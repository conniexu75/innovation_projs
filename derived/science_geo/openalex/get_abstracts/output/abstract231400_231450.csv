https://openalex.org/W2143647842,We have found that two-photon fluorescence imaging of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) provides the sensitivity and spatial three-dimensional resolution to resolve metabolic signatures in processes of astrocytes and neurons deep in highly scattering brain tissue slices. This functional imaging reveals spatiotemporal partitioning of glycolytic and oxidative metabolism between astrocytes and neurons during focal neural activity that establishes a unifying hypothesis for neurometabolic coupling in which early oxidative metabolism in neurons is eventually sustained by late activation of the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. Our model integrates existing views of brain energy metabolism and is in accord with known macroscopic physiological changes in vivo.

By combining functional brain imaging and region-specific neuronal inactivation in mice, we identified prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex as critical for storage and retrieval of remote spatial memories. Imaging of activity-dependent genes also revealed an involvement of parietal and retrosplenial cortices during consolidation of remote memory. Long-term memory storage within some of these neocortical regions was accompanied by structural changes including synaptogenesis and laminar reorganization, concomitant with a functional disengagement of the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortices. Thus, consolidation of spatial memory requires a time-dependent hippocampal-cortical dialogue, ultimately enabling widespread cortical networks to mediate effortful recall and use of cortically stored remote memories independently."

Since striatal dopamine and acetylcholine affect plasticity of cortico-striatal transmission and are both crucial to learning, they may serve as teachers in the basal ganglia circuits. We recorded from both neuronal populations in monkeys performing a probabilistic instrumental conditioning task. Both neuronal types respond robustly to reward-related events. Although different events yielded responses with different latencies, the responses of the two populations coincided, indicating integration at the target level. Yet, while the dopamine neurons' response reflects mismatch between expectation and outcome in the positive domain, the TANs are invariant to reward predictability. Finally, TAN pairs are synchronized, compared to a minority of dopamine neuron pairs. We conclude that the striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic systems carry distinct messages by different means, which can be integrated differently to shape the basal ganglia responses to reward-related events."
https://openalex.org/W1999899839,"One cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is mutation in ubiquitously expressed copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), but the mechanism of toxicity to motor neurons is unknown. Multiple disease-causing mutants, but not wild-type SOD1, are now demonstrated to be recruited to mitochondria, but only in affected tissues. This is independent of the copper chaperone for SOD1 and dismutase activity. Highly preferential association with spinal cord mitochondria is seen in human ALS for a mutant SOD1 that accumulates only to trace cytoplasmic levels. Despite variable proportions that are successfully imported, nearly constant amounts of SOD1 mutants and covalently damaged adducts of them accumulate as apparent import intermediates and/or are tightly aggregated or crosslinked onto integral membrane components on the cytoplasmic face of those mitochondria. These findings implicate damage from action of spinal cord-specific factors that recruit mutant SOD1 to spinal mitochondria as the basis for their selective toxicity in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2015266340,"Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutations in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene cause motor neuron death in about 3% of ALS cases. While the wild-type (wt) protein is anti-apoptotic, mutant SOD1 promotes apoptosis. We now demonstrate that both wt and mutant SOD1 bind the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, providing evidence of a direct link between SOD1 and an apoptotic pathway. This interaction is evident in vitro and in vivo in mouse and human spinal cord. We also demonstrate that in mice and humans, Bcl-2 binds to high molecular weight SDS-resistant mutant SOD1 containing aggregates that are present in mitochondria from spinal cord but not liver. These findings provide new insights into the anti-apoptotic function of SOD1 and suggest that entrapment of Bcl-2 by large SOD1 aggregates may deplete motor neurons of this anti-apoptotic protein."
https://openalex.org/W1992900501,"Nerve injury triggers numerous changes in the injured neurons and surrounding nonneuronal cells that ultimately result in successful target reinnervation or cell death. c-Jun is a component of the heterodimeric AP-1 transcription factor, and c-Jun is highly expressed in response to neuronal trauma. Here we have investigated the role of c-jun during axonal regeneration using mice lacking c-jun in the central nervous system. After transection of the facial nerve, the absence of c-Jun caused severe defects in several aspects of the axonal response, including perineuronal sprouting, lymphocyte recruitment, and microglial activation. c-Jun-deficient motorneurons were atrophic, resistant to axotomy-induced cell death, and showed reduced target muscle reinnervation. Expression of CD44, galanin, and alpha7beta1 integrin, molecules known to be involved in regeneration, was greatly impaired, suggesting a mechanism for c-Jun-mediated axonal growth. Taken together, our results identify c-Jun as an important regulator of axonal regeneration in the injured central nervous system."

Here we demonstrate that epithelial cells can develop from BMDCs without cell-cell fusion. We use the Cre/lox system together with β-galactosidase and enhanced green fluorescent protein expression in transgenic mice to identify epithelial cells in the lung, liver, and skin that develop from BMDCs without cell fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2108815207,"Pacemaker neurons have been described in most neural networks. However, whether such neurons are essential for generating an activity pattern in a given preparation remains mostly unknown. Here, we show that in the mammalian respiratory network two types of pacemaker neurons exist. Differential blockade of these neurons indicates that their relative contribution to respiratory rhythm generation changes during the transition from normoxia to hypoxia. During hypoxia, blockade of neurons with sodium-dependent bursting properties abolishes respiratory rhythm generation, while in normoxia respiratory rhythm generation only ceases upon pharmacological blockade of neurons with heterogeneous bursting properties. We propose that respiratory rhythm generation in normoxia depends on a heterogeneous population of pacemaker neurons, while during hypoxia the respiratory rhythm is driven by only one type of pacemaker."
https://openalex.org/W2027014741,"Many central nervous system (CNS) diseases display sexual dimorphism. Exposure to circulating sex steroids is felt to be a chief contributor to this phenomenon; however, CNS diseases of childhood and the elderly also demonstrate gender predominance and/or a sexually dimorphic response to therapies. Here we show that XY and XX neurons cultured separately are differentially susceptible to various cytotoxic agents and treatments. XY neurons were more sensitive to nitrosative stress and excitotoxicity versus XX neurons. In contrast, XX neurons were more sensitive to etoposide- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis versus XY neurons. The responses to specific therapies were also sexually dimorphic. Moreover, gender proclivity in programmed cell death pathway was observed. After cytotoxic challenge, programmed cell death proceeded predominately via an apoptosis-inducing factor-dependent pathway in XY neurons versus a cytochrome c-dependent pathway in XX neurons. This gender-dependent susceptibility is related to the incapacity of XY neurons to maintain intracellular levels of reduced glutathione. In vivo studies further demonstrated an incapacity for male, but not female, 17-day-old rats to maintain reduced glutathione levels within cerebral cortex acutely after an 8-min asphyxial cardiac arrest. This gender difference in sensitivity to cytotoxic agents may be generalized to nonneuronal cells, as splenocytes from male and female 16–18-day-old rats show similar gender-dependent responses to nitrosative stress and staurosporine-induced apoptosis. These data support gender stratification in the evaluation of mechanisms and treatment of CNS disease, particularly those where glutathione may play a role in detoxification, such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and conditions producing cerebral ischemia, and may apply to non-CNS diseases as well.

Sexual dimorphism exists in the normal developing mammalian brain, particularly in sex steroid-concentrating regions such as the hypothalamus (1MacLusky N.J. Naftolin F. Science. 1981; 211: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence of innate gender differences at the cellular level, dependent upon the brain region, neuronal subtype, and developmental stage. For instance, phenotypic differences in XY and XX brain cells appear to be independent of gonadal phenotype (2Carruth L.L. Reisert I. Arnold A.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and cultured dopaminergic neurons from female rat fetuses are morphologically distinct and have increased capacity for dopamine uptake versus neurons from males (3Reisert I. Engele J. Pilgrim C. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell death in certain brain regions can be different in both magnitude and duration between male and female rats, supporting the notion that divergent pathways of cell death occur between genders (4Nunez J.L. Lauschke D.M. Juraska J.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Innate sexual dimorphism independent of circulating sex steroids would have significant clinical implications in central nervous system (CNS) 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; ED, embryologic day; INH2BP, 5-iodo-6-amino-1,2-benzopyrone; z-VAD, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; RT, reverse transcription; AIF, apoptosis-inducing AIF factor; ELISA, immunoabsorbant assay; SH, sulfhydryl; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; DIV, days in vitro; PND, post-natal day; PI, propidium iodide. diseases with regard to both mechanisms and treatments. Many CNS diseases also display sexual dimorphism, specifically a predilection for one gender (5Sacco R.L. Neurology. 2001; 5: S31-S34Crossref Google Scholar, 6Van Den Eeden S.K. Tanner C.M.

Exposure to circulating sex steroids is felt to be a chief contributor to this phenomenon; however, sexual dimorphism is also exhibited in many CNS diseases afflicting children and the elderly. Studies in children show that girls have more favorable neurologic outcome after traumatic brain injury (9Donders J. Hoffman N.M. Neuropsychology. 2002; 16: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and respond more favorably to treatment for medulloblastoma (10Weil M.D. Lamborn K. Edwards M.S. Wara W.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 1474-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) compared with boys but that girls demonstrate worse outcome after stroke (11Hurvitz E.A. Beale L. Ried S. Nelson V.S. Pediatr. Rehabil. 1999; 3: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Elderly men have a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease and do not respond as well to surgical intervention compared with elderly females (6Van Den Eeden S.K. Tanner C.M. Bernstein A.L. Fross R.D.

Scand. 2003; 108: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Elderly men with Alzheimer's disease have an earlier onset and increased mortality compared with elderly females (12Ueki A. Shinjo H. Shimode H. Nakajima T. Morita Y. Int. J. Geriatr. Psychiatry. 2001; 16: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Gambassi G. Lapane K.L. Landi F. Sgadari A. Mor V. Bernabie R. Neurology. 1999; 53: 508-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a study examining patients after cardiac arrest where the mean age was 67 years, male gender, but not age, was associated with poor outcome (14Vukmir R.B. J. Women's Health. 2003; 12: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether innate gender differences independent of circulating sex steroids could contribute to gender-related differences in CNS disease prevalence and outcome, we developed a model system where male and female embryologic day (ED) 17 rats were segregated, and XY and XX neurons were cultured separately. The response to various cytotoxic agents and treatments and proclivity in programmed cell death pathway was then evaluated in this model system. Reagents and Materials—Neurobasal medium, RPMI 1640, and B27 supplement were from Invitrogen. Peroxynitrite (ONOO–) was from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI. The poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor 5-iodo-6-amino-1,2-benzopyrone (INH2BP) was a kind gift from Dr. Csaba Szabó, Inotek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Beverly, MA. The pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD) was from Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA. The reverse transcription (RT)-PCR primers for rat SRY3 and actin were synthesized and purchased from Invitrogen. The antibody against apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The anti-caspase-3 antibody that recognizes both the intact zymogen and the cleaved p17 fragment was from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA. The anti-cytochrome c oxidase and anti-histone III antibodies were from BD Pharmingen. The cytochrome c enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) was from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. ThioGlo-1 reagent for measurement of reduced glutathione (GSH) and protein sulfhydryls (SHs) were from Convalent Associates, Inc., Woburn, MA. The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), l-glutamate, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), kainate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA), staurosporine, etoposide, 17β-estradiol, MK801, catalase, superoxide dismutase, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and remaining reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Gender-segregated Neuronal Cultures, Cytotoxicity, and Pharmacological Studies—Male and female Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (ED 16–17) were separated by visual inspection, and neurons were harvested and cultured separately using standard methods (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A. Szabo C. Clark R.S.B. J. Biol.

Male and female fetuses can be distinguished by visualization of the dorsal penile vessels and sex cords (Fig. 1a) (3Reisert I. Engele J. Pilgrim C. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dissociated cell suspensions from cerebral cortices were placed in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) or in plastic dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (1.3 × 107 cells/well). Cortical neuron-enriched cultures were achieved by using neurobasal medium with serum- and estrogen-free B27 supplement (17Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Neuron survival was optimized by replacing glutamine with GlutaMaxl. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2.Onthe second and sixth days in vitro (DIV) the culture media was replaced with fresh media. At 10 DIV, cultures consisted primarily of neurons with minimal glial cells detectable (>95% microtubule associated protein-2-immunoreactive cells, <5% glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactive cells analyzed in 8–10 fields/well, collected from 6 independent experiments). The majority of experiments were performed on the 10th DIV, with the exception of the excitotoxicity studies, which were performed on days 8–14. Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared in similar fashion, with the exceptions that dissociated cell suspensions were prepared from hippocampi and glia were removed by treating cultures on DIV 2 with 5 μm cytosine arabinoside for 72 h. Nitrosative/Oxidative Stress—Neuron-enriched cultures were exposed to varying concentrations of ONOO– or H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, whereupon fresh media was replaced. For excitotoxicity, neuron-enriched cultures were exposed to varying concentrations of l-glutamate with 5 μm glycine for 30 min, NMDA for 20 h or Kainate or AMPA for 30 min in culture media. Glycine was not added in the NMDA, AMPA, or kainate experiments. For apoptosis, neuron-enriched cultures were exposed to varying concentrations of staurosporine or etoposide in culture media for 4 h. For pharmacological studies cultures were pretreated with either 17β-estradiol (10–60 nm for 24 h on DIV 7, 10, and 14), the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor INH2BP (100 μm), the NMDA antagonist MK801 (1–5 μm), the antioxidant catalase (5000 units), or the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD (100 μm) dissolved in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (300 units) or NAC (5 mm) dissolved in distilled H2O. High concentration stock solutions were diluted in culture media. Although poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors are notoriously nonspecific, INH2BP at the concentration used here significantly inhibited poly-ADP-ribosylation in neurons (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A. Szabo C. Clark R.S.B. J. Biol.

Gender-segregated, Isolated Splenocytes—Spleens were isolated from male and female post-natal day (PND) 16–18 Sprague-Dawley rats. Splenocytes were obtained by squeezing the organ in culture medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin). After centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, erythrocytes were removed using red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma). Splenocytes were again centrifuged, and the pellet was washed twice with culture medium. Isolated gender-segregated splenocytes were resuspended in culture medium and cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24-48 h at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 96-well plates. For cytotoxicity assays varying concentrations of ONOO– or staurosporine were added to culture media, and the MTT assay was performed at 24 and 48 h. RT-PCR for SRY3—RT-PCR was performed using genomic DNA harvested from neurons in culture or brain tissue from male and female rats using standard methods (19Zhang X. Graham S.H. Kochanek P.M. Marion D.W. Nathaniel P.D. Watkins S.C. Clark R.S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1367-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer. One μg of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed with 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 42 °C primed with 0.5 μg of random hexamer. RT products were then digested with RNase H at 37 °C for 30 min. cDNA samples (1 μl) were subjected to PCR amplification using primers specific for rat SRY gene (forward, 5′-GCTCAACAGAATCCCAGCAT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTGTTGAGGCAACTTCACG-3′) or primers for rat actin with a Robocycler Gradient 96 PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using a Plantinum Taq PCRx kit (Invitrogen). Reagents were assembled in a final volume of 50 μl as follows: 1 μl of first-strand cDNA, 1 μm each primer, 1× PCR amplification buffer, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1× PCR digoxigenin-labeling mix (Roche Applied Science), and RNase free water to volume. Samples were initially denatured at 94 °C for 3 min, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase were then added. Thermocycling parameters were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C and 1 min of extension at 72 °C repeated for 30 cycles with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were then separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto nylon membranes overnight in 20× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). After air drying and UV cross-linking, the membrane was blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 3% blocking reagent in 1× maleic acid buffer (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin at a concentration of 1:10,000 in 1% blocking reagent. A CDP-Star chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied before exposing the membrane to x-ray film. Assessment of Cell Viability—Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase release, and/or flow cytometry. Duplicate 100-μl supernatant samples from 96-well plates were used for the MTT assay (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A. Szabo C. Clark R.S.B.

Values are expressed as the percentage of control (untreated) neurons and represent 5–8 separate experiments. In some paradigms, lactate dehydrogenase release was measured in duplicate 20-μl supernatant samples. Flow cytometry labeling of propidium iodide (PI) uptake and annexin V binding was also used to evaluate cell viability after ONOO-, glutamate/glycine, and staurosporine cytotoxicity (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A. Szabo C. Clark R.S.B. J. Biol.

Neurons were harvested using trypsin-EDTA, washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of annexin V binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 1 × 105 cells were stained with 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 5 μg/ml PI in binding buffer at 4 °C. After 20 min, 400 μl of binding buffer was added to each tube, and samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Unstained cells were used to determine background fluorescence, and thresholds for normal (unlabeled) cells were determined. The percentage of cells in each quadrant was calculated. For statistical comparison, the percentage of normal cells defined as PI and annexin V for each cytotoxicity paradigm were analyzed. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Cellular proteins were separated into mitochondrial, nuclear, and cytosolic fractions (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M.

Neurons at 0, 2, and 24 h after cytotoxic treatment were lysed in buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 17,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. These supernatants were used for assessment of cytosolic proteins. The pellets containing mitochondria were lysed in buffer and sonicated. The initial pellet was re-suspended in lysis buffer then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C with the supernatant used for assessment of nuclear proteins. Protein concentration was determined using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Protein samples (50 μg) were then boiled in loading buffer for 5 min followed by chilling on ice, then electrophoretically separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking overnight in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated in 1:100 dilutions of antibodies against AIF or caspase-3 at room temperature for 1 h, washed, then incubated in appropriate secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film. The relative optical density of detected peptides was semi-quantified using an Eastman Kodak Co. imaging system. To determine the purity of individual cellular compartments, immunoblotting for cytochrome c oxidase and histone III was performed pre hoc. Cytochrome c Enzyme-linked ELISA—Cellular proteins were separated into mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H. Carcillo J.A.

Cytochrome c concentrations were determined by ELISA within 96-well plates using triplicate samples as per manufacturer's instruction. DNA Analysis—Chromosomal DNA samples were prepared in agarose plugs using a CHEF Mammalian Genomic DNA Plug Kit (Bio-Rad). Samples were homogenized in cell suspension buffer, mixed with preheated (50 °C) 2% low melting point agarose, and transferred into agarose plug molds. After solidification at room temperature the plugs were incubated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 50 °C without agitation. Deproteinized DNA-containing agarose plugs were washed in wash buffer, added to wells, and sealed with low melting point agarose. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was performed as described (16Zhang X. Chen J. Graham S.H. Du L. Kochanek P.M. Draviam R. Guo F. Nathaniel P.D. Szabo C. Watkins S.C. Clark R.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) using a CHE DR II pulsed field gel electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). Fragments were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel at 14 °C for 20 h. Field strength was set at 6 V/cm, and initial switching time was set at 60 s for 15 h followed by final switching time 90 s for 9 h. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. DNA laddering was performed using standard methods. Fluorescence Assay of GSH and Protein-SH—The concentrations of GSH and protein-SH were determined using ThioGlo-1, a maleimide reagent that produces a highly fluorescent product upon its reaction with sulfhydryl groups (20Bayir H. Kagan V.E. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V. Ruppel R.A. Adelson P.D. Graham S.H. Janesko K. Clark R.S. Kochanek P.M. Pediatr. Res. 2002; 51: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), modified for use in culture and brain tissue. A standard curve was established using 0.04–4 μm GSH in 50 mm Na2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm Thio-Glo-1. GSH content was estimated by an immediate fluorescence response observed upon the addition of ThioGlo-1 to each sample. Levels of total protein-SH were determined as an additional fluorescence response after adding of 4 mm SDS to the same sample. A Cytofluor 2350 fluorescence plate reader (Millipore Corp., Marlborough, MA) was used to detect fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 388 and 500 nm, respectively. Asphyxial Cardiopulmonary Arrest in Post-natal Day 17 Rats—Cortical brain tissue samples were obtained from PND 17 rats after 8-min of asphyxial cardiac arrest. This model produces hypoxic-ischemic injury at a time when circulating levels of reproductive hormones are similar between genders (21Fink E.L. Alexander H. Marco C.D. Dixon C.E. Kochanek P.M. Jenkins L.W. Lai Y. Donovan H.A. Clark R.S. Pediatr. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 5: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At 6 or 24 h after asphyxia or in sham controls, rats were perfused with ice-cold saline, and cerebral cortices were dissected and frozen. Gender was verified at necropsy. The concentrations of GSH and protein-SH were determined as above. For analysis, 6- and 24-h samples were combined for each gender. Data Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons between genders, treatment groups, and time points were made using two-factor analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc tests unless otherwise specified. If data failed tests of normality and/or equal variance, data were ranked before analysis. For cell viability studies, 3–9 wells/condition and a minimum of 3 independent experiments were performed. For Western blot, ELISA and DNA gels 3–6 wells/condition and a minimum of 2 independent experiments were performed. DNA gels were qualitatively analyzed. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Gender Proclivity in Response to Cytotoxicity—There were no obvious gross morphologic differences between XY and XX neurons. Accurate gender separation was verified using RT-PCR for the Y-chromosome gene SRY3 (Fig. 1b). The sensitivity of XY and XX neurons to multiple cytotoxic insults is shown in Fig. 1c. The conversion of MTT to formazan as the indicator of cell viability was used because the assay could be performed in a high-throughput fashion. Cytotoxicity models of nitrosative/oxidative stress using exogenous ONOO– or H2O2, excitotoxicity (supraphysiologic glutamate and glycine), cell-signal mediated apoptosis (staurosporine), and apoptosis mediated via topoisomerase II inhibition (etoposide) were tested. Remarkably, for most cytotoxicity paradigms, XY and XX neurons were differentially susceptible. XY neurons were more sensitive to nitrosative stress and excitotoxicity, whereas XX neurons were more sensitive to etoposide and staurosporine. Responses to H2O2 were similar between genders. Because ONOO– and other oxidants affect mitochondrial function thereby influencing the results of the MTT assay, other measures of cell viability were performed. Gender-dependent responses to nitrosative stress, excitotoxicity, and staurosporine were confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis using PI and Annexin V binding as markers (Fig. 1d and e), as well via measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release (data not shown). Hippocampal neurons at ED 17 are also non-sex steroid producing (1MacLusky N.J. Naftolin F. Science. 1981; 211: 1294-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Similar gender-dependent sensitivity to ONOO–, glutamate/glycine, and staurosporine was seen in hippocampal neurons compared with cortical neurons (Fig. 1g). However, both XY and XX hippocampal neurons were more sensitive to similar concentrations of glutamate/glycine and staurosporine than their cortical neuron counterparts. To determine whether results in neurons could be generalized to non-neuronal cells, the sensitivity of splenocytes to nitrosative stress and staurosporine-induced apoptosis was also examined. Remarkably, similar gender-dependent sensitivity to ONOO– and staurosporine was seen in splenocytes as was seen in neurons (Fig. 1 h; representing n = 10 wells/condition and 2 independent experiments). However, splenocytes of both genders appeared more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of ONOO– and staurosporine versus cortical neurons. In addition, gender differences were not detected in splenocytes after staurosporine treatment until 48 h after exposure (versus 2 h in neurons). Gender Proclivity in Programmed Cell Death Pathway— Pathways of programmed cell death were examined by measuring mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and AIF. We and others have previously reported that nitrosative/oxidative stress induces programmed cell death in mixed-gender neurons via an AIF-mediated, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-dependent and caspase-independent pathway (15Du L.

After ONOO–, nuclear translocation of AIF was more prominent in XY neurons in contrast to cytochrome c release, which was more prominent in XX neurons (Fig. 2, a–c). Similar to our previous studies, a concomitant reduction in mitochondrial AIF was not detected using this dose of ONOO– (15Du L. Zhang X. Han Y.Y. Burke N.A. Kochanek P.M. Watkins S.C. Graham S.H.

With higher concentrations of ONOO-, a reduction in mitochondrial AIF is seen (16Zhang X. Chen J. Graham S.H. Du L. Kochanek P.M. Draviam R. Guo F. Nathaniel P.D. Szabo C. Watkins S.C. Clark R.S. J.

The predilection for XY neurons to undergo an AIF-mediated programmed cell death pathway was confirmed by the detection of 50-kbp DNA fragments. Large scale DNA fragments are the biochemical hallmark of AIF-mediated cell death (23Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P.

https://openalex.org/W2052223075,"Epileptogenesis is the process whereby a normal brain becomes epileptic. We hypothesized that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates its receptor, TrkB, in the hippocampus during epileptogenesis and that BDNF-mediated activation of TrkB is required for epileptogenesis. We tested these hypotheses in Synapsin-Cre conditional BDNF−/− and TrkB−/− mice using the kindling model. Despite marked reductions of BDNF expression, only a modest impairment of epileptogenesis and increased hippocampal TrkB activation were detected in BDNF−/− mice. In contrast, reductions of electrophysiological measures and no behavioral evidence of epileptogenesis were detected in TrkB−/− mice. Importantly, TrkB−/− mice exhibited behavioral endpoints of epileptogenesis, tonic-clonic seizures. Whereas TrkB can be activated, and epileptogenesis develops in BDNF−/− mice, the plasticity of epileptogenesis is eliminated in TrkB−/− mice. Its requirement for epileptogenesis in kindling implicates TrkB and downstream signaling pathways as attractive molecular targets for drugs for preventing epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W1974316629,"CA1 pyramidal neurons degenerate after transient global ischemia, whereas neurons in other regions of the hippocampus remain intact. A step in this selective injury is Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) entry through Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor channels; reducing Ca(2+) permeability of AMPA receptors via expression of Ca(2+)-impermeable GluR2(R) channels or activation of CRE transcription in the hippocampus of adult rats in vivo using shutoff-deficient pSFV-based vectors rescues vulnerable CA1 pyramidal neurons from forebrain ischemic injury. Conversely, the induction of Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) influx through AMPA receptors by expressing functional Ca(2+)-permeable GluR2(Q) channels causes the postischemic degeneration of hippocampal granule neurons that otherwise are insensitive to ischemic insult. Thus, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 gates entry of Ca(2+) and/or Zn(2+) that leads to cell death following transient forebrain ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2035688930,"Arp2/3 is an actin binding complex that is enriched in the peripheral lamellipodia of fibroblasts, where it forms a network of short, branched actin filaments, generating the protrusive force that extends lamellipodia and drives fibroblast motility. Although it has been assumed that Arp2/3 would play a similar role in growth cones, our studies indicate that Arp2/3 is enriched in the central, not the peripheral, region of growth cones and that the growth cone periphery contains few branched actin filaments. Arp2/3 inhibition in fibroblasts severely disrupts actin organization and membrane protrusion. In contrast, Arp2/3 inhibition in growth cones minimally affects actin organization and does not inhibit lamellipodia protrusion or de novo filopodia formation. Surprisingly, Arp2/3 inhibition significantly enhances axon elongation and causes defects in growth cone guidance. These results indicate that Arp2/3 is a negative regulator of growth cone translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1990847799,"During development, precerebellar neurons migrate dorsoventrally from the rhombic lip to the floor plate. Some of these neurons cross the midline while others stop. We have identified a role for the slit receptor Rig-1/Robo3 in directing this process. During their tangential migration, neurons of all major hindbrain precerebellar nuclei express high levels of Rig-1 mRNA. Rig-1 expression is rapidly downregulated as their leading process crosses the floor plate. Interestingly, most precerebellar nuclei do not develop normally in Rig-1-deficient mice, as they fail to cross the midline. In addition, inferior olivary neurons, which normally send axons into the contralateral cerebellum, project ipsilaterally in Rig-1 mutant mice. Similarly, neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus and basilar pons are unable to migrate across the floor plate and instead remain ipsilateral. These results demonstrate that Rig-1 controls the ability of both precerebellar neuron cell bodies and their axons to cross the midline."

Aldosterone-induced SGK1 is thought to enhance ENaC surface expression by phosphorylating Nedd4-2 and thereby preventing ENaC retrieval and degradation. In outside-out membrane patches of Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing ENaC, amiloride-sensitive ENaC currents were enhanced by phosphatase inhibitors and were dependent on cytosolic Mg2+. This indicates that a kinase is involved in channel regulation. Indeed, recombinant constitutively active SGK1, included in the pipette solution, caused a sustained 2- to 3-fold increase of ENaC currents. Deletion of the C terminus of αENaC largely reduced the stimulatory effect of SGK1, whereas stimulation by SGK1 did not require the presence of the C termini of the β- or γ-subunits. Replacing the serine residue Ser621 of the SGK1 consensus motif in the C terminus of the α-subunit by an alanine specifically abolished the stimulatory effect of SGK. Our findings indicate that SGK1 can stimulate ENaC activity independently of an inhibition of Nedd4-2-mediated channel retrieval.

Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Indeed, two human genetic diseases provide direct evidence that molecular dysfunction of ENaC has severe effects on arterial blood pressure. Loss-of-function mutations of ENaC cause urinary sodium loss, hyperkalemia, and low blood pressure in patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (2Chang S.S. Gründer S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A.

In contrast, gain-of-function mutations of ENaC are found in patients with so-called Liddle's syndrome (pseudohyperaldosteronism) and result in increased renal sodium re-absorption, hypokalemia, and severe arterial hypertension (3Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Nelson Williams C. Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). ENaC is composed of three subunits called α, β, and γ (4Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). The C termini of the ENaC subunits each contain a proline-rich PPXY (PY) motif, which is believed to be important for interaction with the ubiquitin-protein ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, promoting the ubiquitination, endocytosis, and proteasomal degradation of the channel (5Kamynina E.

The functional importance of the PY motif was recognized in Liddle's syndrome where mutations and/or deletions of the PY motif in β or γ ENaC reduce the endocytic retrieval of ENaC from the membrane (9Abriel H.

This results in an increase in the number of ENaC channels in the membrane, which in turn is thought to cause hyperabsorption of Na+ and hypertension in patients with Liddle's syndrome (11Firsov D.

The effects of aldosterone include transcriptional, translational, and post-translational modifications of ENaC and involve a complex system of aldosterone-induced and/or aldosterone-repressed regulatory proteins (13.Verrey, F., Hummler, E., Schild, L., and Rossier, B. C. (2000) in The Kidney, Physiology & Pathophysiology (Seldin, D. W., Giebisch, G., eds) Third Ed., Chap. 53, pp. 1441–1471Google Scholar). Despite impressive progress in this field of research the molecular mechanisms that mediate the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on ENaC activity remain incompletely understood (14Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F559-F576Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, there is a growing body of evidence that the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase isoform 1 (SGK1) is an important contributing factor in the signal transduction cascade of aldosterone action on epithelial sodium transport (15Pearce D. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In primary cultures of rabbit renal collecting duct cells (16Naray Fejes Toth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16973-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and in rat distal nephron, aldosterone was shown to stimulate the expression of SGK1 mRNA (17Bhargava A. Fullerton M.J. Myles K. Purdy T.M. Funder J.W. Pearce D. Cole T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This effect correlates well with the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on sodium transport and appears to be mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor (18Shigaev A. Asher C. Latter H. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F613-F619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that in the renal collecting duct SGK1 is not expressed in intercalated cells but in principal cells consistent with a specific co-expression of SGK1 and ENaC (19Loffing J.

SGK1 mRNA and protein levels are also increased by aldosterone in distal colon (17Bhargava A. Fullerton M.J. Myles K. Purdy T.M. Funder J.W. Pearce D. Cole T.J.

These findings suggest that SGK1 is a mediator of aldosterone action in classic mineralocorticoid target tissues. SGK1 was the first aldosterone-induced gene shown to upregulate ENaC-mediated sodium transport. This was initially demonstrated by co-expression experiments in Xenopus laevis oocyte (16Naray Fejes Toth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E.S. Aldrich G. Fejes Toth G. J. Biol.

SGK1 is thought to be an important molecular target that integrates multiple endocrine inputs regulating epithelial sodium transport (24Faletti C.J. Perrotti N. Taylor S.I. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent development of SGK1 null mice has confirmed that the presence of SGK1 is important for the maintenance of sodium balance, since these animals develop pseudohypoaldosteronism when kept on a low sodium diet (26Wulff P. Vallon V. Huang D.Y. Volkl H. Yu F. Richter K. Jansen M. Schlunz M. Klingel K. Loffing J. Kauselmann G. Bosl M.R. Lang F. Kuhl D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of SGK1 occurs in the absence of an increase in ENaC expression levels and appears to be due, at least in part, to increasing the surface expression of ENaC. Recent evidence suggests that the increase in surface expression of ENaC is mediated by PY motif-dependent binding of SGK1 to Nedd4-2 and its subsequent phosphorylation. This has been reported to result in an inhibition of Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination, endocytic retrieval, and proteasomal degradation of ENaC, thereby increasing the number of functional ENaC channels in the plasma membrane (27Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Münster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.-D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

However, there is disagreement as to whether the stimulatory effect of SGK1 on ENaC surface expression is primarily mediated by a decrease in removal from or an increase in translocation to the plasma membrane (23Alvarez de la Rosa D.

Finally, in addition to its stimulatory effect on ENaC surface expression, SGK1 may also increase ENaC open probability (30Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). ENaC phosphorylation by kinases and dephosphorylation by phosphatases (31Becchetti A. Malik B. Yue G. Duchatelle P.

Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Aldosterone, insulin, and protein kinases A and C have been shown to increase in vivo phosphorylation of the C termini of the β- and γ-subunits of ENaC (32Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C termini of ENaC subunits expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were found to be phosphorylated by cytosolic fractions derived from rat colon (33Chigaev A. Lu G.

This phosphorylation is thought to involve at least three different types of kinases, including the extracellular-regulated kinase (34Shi H. Asher C. Chigaev A. Yung Y. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H.

In the present report we used outside-out membrane patch recordings to functionally confirm the involvement of kinases and phosphatases in the regulation of ENaC heterologously expressed in X. laevis oocytes. More specifically, we demonstrated a stimulatory effect of recombinant and constitutively active SGK1 on ENaC currents and identified the importance of an SGK consensus motif in the α-subunit for mediating this effect. These results suggest that SGK1 can directly stimulate ENaC activity independently of its effects on Nedd4-2-mediated channel retrieval.

Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and the mutant subunit βS518C (37Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were in pSD5 and were a gift of Drs. Bernard C. Rossier and Laurent Schild (Lausanne, Switzerland). Linearized plasmids were used as templates for cRNA synthesis using either T7 (wt αβγ-ENaC and truncated γ-ENaC) or SP6 (truncated αβ-ENaC) RNA polymerases (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX). To replace the serine Ser621 in the SGK consensus motif 616RSRYWS621 of rat αENaC by an alanine (αS621A-ENaC) or by aspartate (αS621D-ENaC), site-directed mutagenesis extension overlap PCR was performed using T7 and SP6 as flanking primers. To generate αS621A-ENaC, a mutagenic forward primer with the sequence 5′-CGG AGC CGG TAC TGG GCC CCA GGA CGA GGG GCC-3′ and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-GGC CCC TCG TCC TGG GGC CCA GTA CCG GCT CCG-3′ were used to introduce a triplet mutation from TCT at nucleotides 1861–1863 to GCC. To generate αS621D-ENaC a mutagenic forward primer with the sequence 5′-CGG AGC CGG TAC TGG GAC CCA GGA CGA GGG GCC-3′ and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′-GGC CCC TCG TCC TGG GTC CCA GTA CCG GCT CCG-3′ were used to introduce a triplet mutation from TCT at nucleotides 1861–1863 to GAC. Mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Isolation of Oocytes, Injection of cRNA, and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Experiments—Isolation and injection of X. laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed essentially as described previously (38Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Tucker S.J. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21346-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Defolliculated stage V–VI oocytes were injected with cRNA using 0.2 or 0.5 ng of cRNA per ENaC subunit. To prevent Na+ overloading (39Konstas A.A. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A.B. Degger B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29406-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) injected oocytes were kept in “low sodium” modified Barth's saline (in mm: 1 NaCl, 40 KCl, 60 N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl, supplemented with 10 units/ml sodium penicillin, and 10μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). Outside-out Macropatch Recordings—After a brief (1–2 min) exposure to hypertonic NMDG-Cl bath solution (in mm: 95 NMDG-Cl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 200 sucrose, 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris) oocytes were stripped of the vitellin membrane using sharpened forceps and transferred to a bath chamber on a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope (Leitz Microsystems UK Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). A computercontrolled EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) was used as described previously (38Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Tucker S.J. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21346-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to perform conventional outside-out membrane patch recordings (40Hamill P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). It was usually possible to obtain a second patch from the same oocyte for matched control experiments. Alternatively, a patch from another oocyte of the same batch served as control. For each experimental series oocytes from at least three different batches were used. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (catalog no. 1155150, inner diameter 0.87 mm, outer diameter 1.5 mm, Hilgenberg, Masfeld, Germany) using a DMZ-Universal puller (Zeitz Instrumente, Munich, Germany) and had a tip diameter of about 5–7 μm after fire polishing to obtain macropatches. Unless stated otherwise pipettes were filled with potassium gluconate pipette solution (in mm: 90 potassium gluconate, 5 NaCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 2 EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris). A Na2+-free NMDG-Cl bath solution (in mm: 95 NMDG-Cl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris) was the standard bath solution at the beginning of each experiment. In NaCl bath solution, NMDG-Cl was replaced by 95 mm NaCl. Downward current deflections correspond to cell membrane inward currents, i.e. movement of positive charge from the extracellular side to the cytoplasmic side. Outside-out patches were routinely held at a holding pipette potential of –70 mV, which was close to the reversal potential of Cl– (ECl = –77.2 mV) and K+ (EK = –79.4 mV) under our experimental conditions. I-V plots were obtained from voltage step protocols, and ΔIAmi values were obtained by subtracting the currents in the presence of amiloride (2 μm) from the corresponding currents prior to addition of amiloride. Single Channel Recordings in Outside-out Patches—Single channel recordings were performed essentially as described previously (38Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Tucker S.J. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21346-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41Letz B. Ackermann A. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Korbmacher C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Bath and pipette solutions were identical to those used for recordings in outside-out macropatches. The pipette had a tip diameter of about 1 μm after fire polishing. Single channel current data were initially filtered at 250 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz. Data were analyzed using the program “Patch for Windows” written by Dr. Bernd Letz (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Using channel traces re-filtered at 15 Hz, channel activity was estimated from binned amplitude histograms as the product NPo, where N is the number of channels and Po is single channel open probability. The program for calculating NPo from integration of the areas under the peaks of amplitude histograms uses the following equation (42Korbmacher C. Volk T. Segal A.S. Boulpaep E.L. Frömter E. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar): NPo = ∑(nj · ΔIj)/(i · ∑nj), where i refers to the mean single-channel current and where j refers to the jth current amplitude bin, and j ranges from 1 to the total number of bins; nj is the number of events within bin j; ΔIj = Ij – Ic, where Ij is the current of bin j, and Ic is the current at which all channels are closed. Ic was determined in the presence of 2 μm amiloride. Single channel Po was estimated by dividing NPo by the maximal apparent number of channel levels in the current trace analyzed. Solutions and Chemicals—Recombinant constitutively active SGK1(Δ1–60, S422D) was purchased from Biomol GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) as 2-μg vials in 50 μl of stock solution containing as main components 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mm NaCl, and 270 mm sucrose. SGK1 pipette solution was freshly prepared on the day of the experiment by adding 2 μl of the SGK1 stock solution to 1 ml of the potassium-gluconate pipette solution giving a final SGK1 concentration of 80 ng/ml. To preserve SGK1 activity, the pipette solution was supplemented with dithiothreitol (1 mm). For control experiments the pipette solution also contained dithiothreitol (1 mm) and a vehicle control, including the main components of the SGK1 stock solution as indicated above. In addition control experiments were performed using heat-inactivated SGK1 stock solution, which had been incubated at 68 °C for 45 min. Okadaic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany) and was dissolved in Me2SO as a stock solution with a concentration of 0.1 mm. Recombinant protein phosphatase inhibitor type 2 (PPI2) was obtained from Merck Biosciences GmbH (Schwalbach, Germany) as a stock solution containing 1 mg/ml PPI2. Okadaic acid and PPI2 were added to the pipette solution to give final concentrations of 100 nm and 1 μg/ml, respectively. Appropriate amounts of Me2SO or of a buffer corresponding to the main components of the PPI2 stock solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol) were added as vehicle controls to the pipette solution in control experiments. The sulfhydryl reagent MTSET ((2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Amiloride hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany). ENaC Currents Can Be Recorded in Outside-out Macropatches from X. laevis Oocytes Heterologously Expressing ENaC—In oocytes injected with ENaC cRNA, channel expression was routinely confirmed by using two-electrode voltage clamp measurements, which revealed amiloride (2 μm)-sensitive currents (ΔIAmi) averaging 10.3 ± 1.1 μA at a holding potential of –60 mV (n = 43 in 14 batches of oocytes). From these oocytes it was possible to obtain stable outside-out macropatches in about 50% of attempts. Fig. 1A shows a typical current recording starting about 5 min after patch excision. In the absence of extracellular Na+ in NMDG-Cl bath solution, only a minor inward current component was initially observed. Changing to NaCl bath solution resulted in an immediate increase of the inward current consistent with the occurrence of a current component carried by Na+ influx. After an initial transient peak this Na+ current component relaxed to a slightly lower quasi-steady-state current. The current peak with subsequent relaxation is a well known phenomenon and is most likely due to so-called Na+ self-inhibition by extracellular Na+ thought to reduce the open probability of ENaC through interaction with an extracellular Na+ binding site (43Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in the current trace in Fig. 1A, application of amiloride, in a concentration of 2 μm known to specifically inhibit ENaC, instantaneously inhibited the Na+ inward current component and the effect was readily reversible upon washout of amiloride. In similar experiments as the one shown in Fig. 1A, ΔIAmi averaged 364 ± 88 pA (n = 22 in 9 batches of oocytes) at a holding potential of –80 mV. Amiloride-sensitive currents could be recorded in all successful outside-out patches from ENaC-expressing oocytes. Moreover, in about 60% of cases it was possible to obtain a second patch with amiloride-sensitive currents from the same oocyte to serve as a direct control experiment. We never detected amiloride (2 μm)-sensitive currents in outside-out patches of non-injected control oocytes (n = 12). Fig. 1B shows I/V plots obtained from voltage step protocols performed in the absence and presence of amiloride during the experiment shown in Fig. 1A. A subtracted I/V plot representing the average ΔIAmi values of similar experiments is shown in Fig. 1C. A Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) fit of these data reveals that ΔIAmi is highly Na+ selective as expected for a current mediated by ENaC. ENaC Activity Is Stimulated by Phosphatase Inhibitors and Is Dependent on the Presence of Cytosolic Magnesium—As shown in Fig. 2, we were able to obtain continuous current recordings from outside-out macropatches that were stable for at least 20–30 min. This enabled us to continuously monitor ENaC activity in these patches by repeatedly measuring ΔIAmi. As illustrated in the representative current trace shown in Fig. 2A, ΔIAmi remained largely unchanged throughout the experiment. Maintenance of channel activity may require a balance between channel phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by kinases and phosphatases, respectively, which may be associated with ENaC outside-out macropatches. We therefore tested the effect of phosphatase inhibitors that were included in the pipette solution. ENaC currents increased over time when okadaic acid (100 nm), a known inhibitor of a range of phosphatases, was included in the pipette solution. Similarly, inclusion of PIP2 (1 μg/ml), a more specific inhibitor of phosphatase 1, had a stimulatory effect on ENaC currents as shown in the representative current recording in Fig. 2B. On average, both okadaic acid and PIP2 stimulated ENaC currents by 2- to 3-fold with a similar time course (Fig. 2D). These findings indicate that continuous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions occur in the outside-out macropatches and that the phosphatase inhibitors shift the equilibrium toward phosphorylation resulting in enhanced channel activity. To confirm the kinase dependence of ENaC channel activity we performed additional experiments in which Mg2+ was omitted from the pipette solution, which in addition contained the divalent cation-chelating substance EDTA (10 mm). As shown in the representative current trace in Fig. 2C, ENaC currents decreased to a very low level within 10–15 min under these conditions. Data from similar experiments are summarized in Fig. 2D and indicate that ENaC activity is dependent on the presence of cytosolic Mg2+. This is likely to be due to an Mg2+-dependent kinase that appears to be necessary for maintaining ENaC channel activity. Recombinant SGK1 Stimulates ENaC Currents in Outside-out Patches—To test whether SGK1 can directly affect ENaC activity in outside-out patches, constitutively active recombinant SGK1 (80 ng/ml) was included in the pipette solution. As shown in Fig. 3B, this resulted in a substantial increase of ΔIAmi over time reaching a steady-state level that was on average about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of the initial ΔIAmi (Fig. 3C). In contrast, including heat-inactivated recombinant SGK1 (n = 8, Fig. 3A) or a vehicle control for the SGK1 buffer (n = 22, Fig. 3C) did not stimulate ENaC currents. Data are summarized in Fig. 3C and indicate that recombinant SGK1 applied from the cytosolic side leads to a sustained stimulation of ENaC currents. The average I/V plots shown in Fig. 3D were derived from the set of experiments shown in Fig. 3C with SGK1 in the pipette solution. The I/V plots were constructed using ΔIAmi values that were measu"

We identified more than 250 proteins associated with Nonidet P-40 soluble AS, and demonstrated that at least 51 of these proteins displayed significant differences in their relative abundance in AS complexes under conditions where rotenone was cytotoxic and induced formation of cytoplasmic inclusions immunoreactive to anti-AS. Overexpressing one of these proteins, heat shock protein (hsp) 70, not only protected cells from rotenone-mediated cytotoxicity but also decreased soluble AS aggregation. Furthermore, the protection afforded by hsp70 transfection appeared to be related to suppression of rotenone-induced oxidative stress as well as mitochondrial and proteasomal dysfunction.

Pathologically, it has been found to be a major constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs) in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) as well as other neurodegenerative diseases (1Lowe J.S. Leigh N. Graham D.I. Lantos P.L. 7 Ed. Greenfield's Neuropathology. II. Arnold, London2002: 325-430Google Scholar). Three types of AS missense mutations (A30P (2Kruger R. Kuhn W. Muller T.

Neurol. 2004; 55: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar)) that co-segregate with clinical manifestations of PD in autosomal-dominantly inherited familial PD have been found. The fact that each mutation appears to make the protein prone to aggregation strongly implicates AS aggregation in neuronal degeneration. Although there are no known AS mutations in sporadic PD, AS aggregation is also believed to be pivotal in pathogenesis in these patients (5Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For sporadic PD, it is currently hypothesized that dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (6McNaught K.S. Belizaire R. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Isacson O. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 326: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and interrelated increased oxidative stress (7Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar) lead to inappropriate folding and aggregation of AS, eventually resulting in cell death. Although the mechanism whereby mutations or oxidatively damaged AS lead to AS aggregation is not completely understood; one of the prevailing hypotheses is that mutated or damaged AS first forms soluble oligomers, followed by insoluble fibrils such as those found in LBs. These protein aggregates are refractory to UPS-mediated proteolysis, thus ultimately leading to cell death (8Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that soluble AS oligomers are more toxic than insoluble fibrils (9Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Dev K.K. Hofele K. Barbieri S. Buchman V.L. van der Putten H. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 14-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in cell culture models. Consistent with this hypothesis, both A53T and A30P mutations induce more rapid formation of AS oligomers (reviewed in Ref. 11Lansbury Jr., P.T. Brice A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although the A30P mutation demonstrates a slower rate of fibrillization than wild-type AS. Indeed, these findings were the basis for the proposed toxic role of small AS oligomers and led to the development of the working model proposed by Lansbury and coworkers (9Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Volles M.J. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), in which molecular crowding, i.e. focally increased AS concentration in the cytosol, accelerates the formation of AS protofibrils. These protofibrils become toxic as they bind to and permeate lipid vesicles or membranes and then form insoluble fibrils. The processes leading to molecular crowding of AS and subsequent aggregation, though largely unknown, can be influenced by macromolecules like inert polymers (13Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3855-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Proteins interacting with AS may also modulate the extent of molecular crowding of AS, thereby influencing its ability to form aggregates. For example, a mutation in parkin, an E3 ligase interacting with AS, leads to neuronal death in the absence of LB formation (14Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Over the last 10 years, numerous investigators have utilized a variety of approaches to identify the proteins interacting with AS; about 30 proteins have been found that either interact with AS directly in vitro or are associated with LBs in human PD (1Lowe J.S. Leigh N. Graham D.I. Lantos P.L. 7 Ed. Greenfield's Neuropathology. II. Arnold, London2002: 325-430Google Scholar, 10Dev K.K. Hofele K. Barbieri S. Buchman V.L. van der Putten H.

J Neurochem. 2004; 88: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To comprehensively study the proteins associated with AS, particularly in the context of soluble AS aggregate formation, we have employed quantitative proteomics in conjunction with isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) (16Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Goodlett D.R. Peskind E. Quinn J.F. Zhou Z. Wang Q. Pan C. Yi E.C. Eng J. Aebersold R. Montine T.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Using this technique we quantified changes in the protein complex associated with AS in a dopaminergic cell line, MES cells, exposed to rotenone, a pesticide that not only produces parkinsonism in animal models but also induces formation of LB-like inclusions in the remaining dopaminergic neurons (18Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). We specifically focused on soluble AS aggregates, because they appear to play a key role in AS aggregation-induced toxicity. Finally, we studied the biological function of one AS-associated protein whose level in the protein complex was significantly lowered by exposure to rotenone. Chemicals and Antibodies—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Antibodies used included: AS (13623, a gift from Drs. Pedro Piccardo and Bernardino Ghetti at Indiana University and widely used in neurodegenerative research (18Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat.

Cell Cultures and Viability Assays—Detailed methods for culturing MES cells, a gift from Drs. Weidong Le and Stanley Appel at Baylor University, have been previously described by us (20Zhang J. Kravtsov V. Amarnath V. Picklo M.J. Graham D.G. Montine T.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two viability assays were used: live-dead and MTT. Both were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR and Roche Applied Science, respectively). In selected experiments, remaining viable cells were directly counted after trypan blue staining as indicated. Finally, cell viability of cells transfected with hsp70 was assessed by flow cytometry as described below. Immunocytochemistry—AS-associated protein aggregation in cells exposed to rotenone was determined using polyclonal anti-AS (13623; 1:300). In brief, cells were cultured on chambered glass slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and treated with 20 nm rotenone or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 3 days. After treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by incubation with formic acid. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with cross-adsorbed goat anti-rabbit antibody to reveal AS after DAB reaction and counterstained with H&E. Western Blot—Cells were extracted with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C; 40 μg of protein from each supernatant was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, blocked, and probed overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-AS (13623 at 1:10,000; or 5038, 1:5,000). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added at 1:40,000, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence. AS aggregation was quantified by measuring optical densities of the high molecular bands (two bands in Fig. 1C indicated by open and closed arrows), whereas total AS was calculated by adding the optical densities of all anti-AS positive bands. In-gel Digestion and LC-MS Characterization of Protein Complexes—Duplicate gels were run with one gel blotted and probed with anti-AS while the other gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Stained gel sections corresponding to AS-immunoreactive bands in Western blot analysis were cut and digested as described previously (21Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Desiderio D.M. Nibbering N.M.M. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry Wiley-Interscience Series on Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, New York2002: 152-160Google Scholar). Next, extracted peptides were desalted by reversed-phase ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and injected onto an LC-MS/MS LCQDECA workstation (see below). Each sample was injected twice, and 12 possible AS peptides generated from trypsin digestion were monitored using SIM. Isolation of AS-associated Protein Complex—An NHS AS affinity column was prepared following manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Nonidet P-40 soluble fractions were prepared from 2.0 × 108 cells by gentle Dounce homogenization in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g to remove organelles. Supernatant was loaded onto the affinity column (0.2 ml/min) and washed with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Bound AS and its associated proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl and 0.5 m NaCl at pH 2.7 and desalted with a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined by standard BCA assay, and the presence of AS was confirmed by Western blot analysis as described above. These protein complexes were used for ICAT analysis described below. To determine the extent of possible contamination in the Nonidet P-40 AS protein complex by proteins from other organelles, relative abundance of several organelle protein markers was determined in Nonidet P-40 soluble lysates using Western blot analysis as described above. Markers analyzed included cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (mitochondria, 1:10,000), calnexin (ER, 1:10,000), and glucose-regulated protein (Grp94, lysosome, 1:6000). ICAT Analysis of Protein Complexes with LC Followed by MS—ICAT labeling was performed as described initially by Gygi et al. (16Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar) and to the manufacturer's specifications (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Recently, we have also used this technique to quantitatively analyze the proteome of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (17Zhang J. Goodlett D.R. Peskind E. Quinn J.F. Zhou Z. Wang Q. Pan C. Yi E.C. Eng J. Aebersold R. Montine T.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AS protein complexes isolated as described above from either rotenone- or vehicle-treated cells (100 μg of protein each) were reduced, and cysteinyl groups biotinylated with a 5-fold molar excess of either heavy (13C) (rotenone) or light (12C) (Me2SO) cleavable ICAT reagents. Next, the two labeled samples were mixed, digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37 °C, and the digested peptide solution was passed consecutively over an ionic exchange column and a monomeric avidin column (Applied Biosystem). The biotinylated peptides were eluted with 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in 30% acetonitrile, and biotin was cleaved from the labeled peptides with concentrated trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the purified labeled peptides were separated and analyzed with a μLC system linked directly to two alternating reversed-phase C18 columns (10 cm × 180 μm), followed by analysis with MS/MS (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Settings for the LC-MS/MS were as follows: 12 fractions were eluted from SCX using a binary gradient of 2-90% solvent D (1.0 m ammonium chloride and 0.1% formic acid in 5% acetonitrile) versus solvent C (0.1% formic acid in 5% acetonitrile). Each fraction was injected automatically onto a reverse phase column with peptides resolved using a 200-min binary gradient of 5-80% solvent B (acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) versus solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water). A flow rate of 160 μl/min with a spit ratio of 2 μl was used. The intensities of eluting peptide pairs (heavy versus light) were measured in the scanning mass spectrometer. To determine the amino acid sequence, the MS operated in a data-dependent MS/MS mode, where the precursor ion was selected “on the fly” from the previous scan. An m/z ratio for an ion that had been selected for fragmentation was placed on a list and dynamically excluded for 3 min from further fragmentation. Proteins from the mixture were later identified automatically using the computer program Sequest, which searched MS/MS spectra against the International Proteins Index database (22Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd., J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar, 23Aebersold R. Goodlett D.R. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 24Goodlett D.R. Yi E.C. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 138-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Potential peptides and proteins were further analyzed by newly developed computer software to select proteins with high probability of being correct (< 5% error rate) (25Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Relative protein abundance in experimental groups compared with controls was calculated using a newly developed computer algorithm, the Automated Statistical Analysis of Protein abundance (ASAP) ratio. Immunoprecipitation of hsp70—Reverse hsp70 immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (26Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. These included: 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.4); centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min; primary monoclonal mouse anti-hsp70 antibody incubation at 4 °C for 2 h; and immunoblotting with AS antibody (5038, 1:5,000). Transfection of hsp70 and Selection by Flow Cytometry—Vector pZEM-hsp70-tag was a gift from Dr. Kerstin Bellmann (Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de l'Université Laval, Montreal, QC). Transfection was performed as described by others (27Tofaris G.K. Layfield R. Spillantini M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and to the manufacturer's specification (LipofectAMINE Plus™, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Clones with high hsp70 expression levels were selected by flow cytometry using anti-hsp70, and replated to form stable cell lines. Notably, while hsp70 levels in the selected clones, as assessed by Western blot, were significantly increased (300% over vector-transfected cells), only about 30% of cells demonstrated apparent increase in hsp70 levels as determined by flow cytometry (also see Fig. 5C1). Flow Cytometric Characterization of hsp70 Cells—FITC-TUNEL/hsp70 dual labeling was used to correlate cell death (apoptosis) and hsp70 expression level in hsp70-transfected cells. Briefly, at 3 days post-rotenone or vehicle treatment, cells ± hsp70 transfection were collected, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h before treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL labeling as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). After washing twice with 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS, pH 7.4, cells were incubated with mouse anti-hsp70 at room temperature for 30 min, then donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Simultaneous measurement of TUNEL intensity and hsp70 expression level was carried out using a FACSort® flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Measurement of Mitochondrial Complex I Activity—Mitochondria were isolated and assayed for complex I activity using previously described methods (28Zhang J. Fitsanakis V. Gu G. Jing D. Ao M. Amarnath V. Montine T. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1-11Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) activity was measured by monitoring loss of absorbance at 340 nm (ϵ: 6.81 mm-1·cm-1), i.e. oxidation of n-decylubiquinone (130 μm) at 30 °C. Proteasomal Activity Assay—20 S chymotrypsin-like and postglutamyl peptidase proteasomal activities were determined as previously described by measuring the fluorescence of 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) liberated from peptide-AMC linked substrates (6McNaught K.S. Belizaire R. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Isacson O. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 326: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The results, expressed as fluorescence units (FU)/min/mg protein, were normalized to inhibition of total proteasomal function by 10 μm lactacystin. Protein Carbonyl Assay—Protein oxidation was measured by quantifying total protein carbonyl contents using DNPH. The spectrum difference between DNPH-treated and control samples was determined, and results were expressed as nanomoles of DNPH incorporated/mg of protein based on the absorption at 375 nm (ϵ: 21.0 mm-1·cm-1). Protein concentration was determined by standard BCA assay. Statistical Methods—Grouped data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Changes between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls test using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (San Diego, CA). Repeated measures were performed at least three times in all experiments. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Characterization of Rotenone-produced Neurotoxicity—Rotenone produced time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity in cells, with ∼40% remaining viable (as determined by live-dead assay) following a 3-day treatment with 20 nm rotenone (Fig. 1A). Treatment with vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) produced minimal toxicity. Viability assessed by MTT assay as well as direct enumeration of viable cells after trypan blue staining gave similar results (data not shown). Remarkably, rotenone-treated cells also demonstrated formation of cytoplasmic LB-like inclusions (Fig. 1B) that were immunoreactive with anti-AS (inset in Fig. 1B). In addition, there was an apparent shift toward higher molecular weight Nonidet P-40 soluble AS immunoreactive bands (Fig. 1C). Semiquantitative analysis of the two highest molecular weight bands demonstrated that rotenone exposure produced a 10-fold increase in AS aggregation. Although overall levels of AS did not change significantly in rotenone-treated cells as compared with vehicle-treated cells, the increase in AS aggregation appeared to be accompanied by a decrease in AS monomer (band near 17.8 kDa) and a few AS complexes or aggregates (within right brace in Fig. 1C) that were present in vehicle-treated cells. The nature of these complexes or aggregates is not known; however, the presence of AS was confirmed by Western blot analysis with another antibody targeted at a different amino acid sequence (13623). As further confirmation, duplicate gels were run and one gel blotted and probed with anti-AS while the other gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Gel sections corresponding to those in Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C) were excised, digested with trypsin, separated by microcapillary liquid chromatography (μLC), and analyzed with MS. 12 possible trypsin-generated AS peptides, which cover ∼90% of AS sequence, were analyzed using selective ion monitoring (SIM) techniques. All analyzed bands contained from 8 to 12 selected ions (data not shown). Fig. 1D shows the sequence (in blue) for AS with peptides identified from in-gel digestion of the band area indicated by the closed arrow in Fig. 1C; in this particular study, 10 of 12 selected ions were captured. Exposure to Rotenone Significantly Modified the Compositions of the Protein Complex Associated with AS—To quantitatively compare the profiles of the Nonidet P-40 soluble AS protein complexes in rotenone-treated versus vehicle-treated cells, AS-associated proteins were purified by affinity chromatography, labeled with ICAT, and separated by μLC followed by identification with MS/MS. This method identified 251 proteins (see Supplementary Materials I), many more than all the proteins previously reported in the literature combined (Table I). The MS scan and MS/MS fragmentation of a typical protein by LC-MS/MS are demonstrated in Fig. 2. We were able to identify not only the majority of proteins reported to be associated with AS or co-localized to LBs in PD patients, but also several relevant to neurodegeneration or PD pathogenesis but not yet identified with either AS or LBs, e.g. hsp90. Notably, a significant number of proteins listed in Supplementary Materials I were novel without known functions. Fig. 3 shows a pie chart summarizing the functions of the AS-associated proteins. Major classes of proteins included those related to signal transduction, UPS, regulation of oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function, all of which have been implicated in PD pathogenesis.Table IComparison of proteins associated with AS or LBsProteinAssociated with AS, LB, or bothIDaID, identification. by usNo Cys114-3-3AS (26)+2AβAS (41) and both (42)−3Bcl2-antagonist of cell death (BAD)AS (26)−x4Calmodulin (CaM)AS (43)−x5Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseLB (44)+6Clusterin/apolipo-protein JLB (45)+7Copper, zinc-SODLB (46)+8Cytochrome oxidaseAS (47)−9Cyclin-dependent kinase 5LB (48)−10Plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT)AS (49)−11Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs)AS (50)+12Non-selenium glutathione peroxidaseLB (51)−13Heme oxygenaseLB (52)−14Hsp70AS (53) and LB (54)+15Lysosome associate proteinsLB (29)+16Microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1A, B)AS (55)+17Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)LB (56)−18Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MARKs)AS (50) and LB (57)+19NeurofilamentsLB (58)+20p62Both (59)+21ParkinAS (60) and LB (61)−22Protein kinase C isoformsAS (26)+23Phospholipase D2AS (62)−24Proteasome subunitsLB (63)+25Rab5AAS (64)−26SeptinLB (65)−27SynphilinAS (66) and LB (67)−28TAT-binding protein 1AS (68)−29TauAS (69)+30Torsin ALB (70)−31Tyrosine hydroxylaseAS (71)+32TubulinAS (72) and LB (73)+33UbiquitinAS (53) and LB (74)−x34UCH-L1AS (75) and LB (76)+Total34173a ID, identification.

Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar), and only proteins with at least two different peptide hits were considered. For instance, proteasomal subunit 4 and parkin, two proteins known to be important to PD, were not included in Table I or Supplementary Materials I, because they were identified by a single peptide only, even though they had good probability scores and altered abundance (see below) in cells treated with rotenone versus vehicle. Finally, although most protein identifications were unequivocal, some could not be distinguished based on the peptides present in the samples. These are listed as one group with several subentries in Table II and Supplementary Materials I.Table IIRelative changes in AS-associated proteins(I) Decreased in rotenone vs. Me2SO > 100%160 kDa hsp, mitochondrial precursoraProteins identified in more than two independent experiments.

We found evidence for the existence of an antisense mRNA (sONE) that is derived from a transcription unit (NOS3AS) on the opposite DNA strand from which the human eNOS (NOS3) mRNA is transcribed at human chromosome 7q36. The genes are oriented in a tail-to-tail configuration, and the mRNAs encoding sONE and eNOS are complementary for 662 nucleotides. The mRNA for sONE could be detected in a variety of cell types, both in vivo and in vitro, but not vascular endothelial cells. In contrast, expression of eNOS is highly restricted to vascular endothelium. Most surprisingly, interrogation of transcriptional events across NOS3/NOS3AS genomic regions, using single- and double-stranded probes for nuclear run-off analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation-based assessments of RNA polymerase II distribution, indicated that NOS3 and NOS3AS gene transcription did not correlate with steady-state mRNA levels. We found strong evidence supporting a role for NOS3AS in the post-transcriptional regulation of NOS3 expression. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of sONE expression in vascular smooth muscle cells increased eNOS expression. Overexpression of sONE in endothelial cells blunted eNOS expression. Finally, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A is known to regulate the expression of eNOS via a post-transcriptional mechanism. We found that trichostatin A treatment of vascular endothelial cells increased expression of sONE mRNA levels prior to the observed decrease in eNOS mRNA expression. Taken together, these results indicate that an antisense mRNA (sONE) participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of eNOS and provide a newer model for endothelial cell-specific gene expression.

Regulation of eNOS gene expression is complex and takes place at multiple levels. Recent work has emphasized the importance of post-translational modification of the eNOS holoenzyme (5Shaul P.W.

However, the mechanisms that are involved in this process are poorly understood. Our understanding of mechanisms of post-transcriptional control of gene expression has matured in recent years. It has recently been appreciated that changes in mRNA half-life and translational regulation can be mediated not only by RNA-binding proteins but also by sense-antisense RNA interactions (24Lehner B. Williams G. Campbell R.D. Sanderson C.M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 63-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning of a human antisense mRNA (sONE) that is derived from a transcription unit (NOS3AS) on the opposite DNA strand from which the eNOS (NOS3) mRNA is transcribed. A related genomic organization is also described for the mouse ortholog, Nos3as. Collectively, the results presented here indicate that an antisense mRNA (sONE) participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of eNOS. cDNA and Genomic Characterization—An oligo(dT)-primed λgt11 human testis cDNA library (Clontech) was screened under conditions of high stringency by using a full-length human eNOS cDNA (25Marsden P.A.

Nature. 2003; 424: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To characterize Nos3as cDNA and genomic sequences, I.M.A.G.E. and new cDNAs were sequenced (see www.chr7.org1). Murine genomic clones for Nos3as were isolated from the RPCI-22 bacterial artificial chromosome library created in the pBACe3.6 vector using female murine 129S6/SvEvTac strain diploid genomic DNA. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE were performed by using total cellular RNA (1 μg) derived from various normal human and murine tissues and cell types (human placenta, brain, testis, and vascular endothelial cells and murine ED 11.5 days post-coitum embryos and placenta; Clontech), as described (10Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A complete description of the oligonucleotide primers used for human and murine RT-PCR and RACE analyses is available from the authors upon request. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and maintained as described (29Stewart R.J. Kashour T.S. Marsden P.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1221-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAoVSMC) were purchased from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) and cultured according to the supplier's suggestion. Studies were performed in early passage HUVEC (passage 3-5) and HAoVSMC (passage 4-8) derived from multiple donors. HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), HeLa (cervical epithelium adenocarcinoma), and JEG-3 (placental choriocarcinoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES and 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers of HUVEC were treated with trichostatin A (TsA, 500 nm, Sigma) for the indicated times. RT-PCR Southern Blot Analyses and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—First strand cDNA was synthesized with total cellular RNA (5 μg) derived from varied normal human tissues (Clontech) using random or strand-specific primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers used to prepare strand-specific cDNA were located within 100 nt of the PCR amplicon. The sequence of the eNOS + first-strand primer was 5′-CCT GGA GGA ATA ATG CTG AAT C-3′ and corresponds to the genomic DNA coding strand of eNOS. This primer pair would bind to the complementary antisense strand. The sequence of the eNOS-first-strand primer was 5′-AAT GGT AAC GTG CAG GAC ATC-3′ and corresponds to the antisense genomic DNA strand with respect to eNOS. PCR amplification used a single primer pair located in overlapping exonic regions of the NOS3/NOS3AS transcription units to amplify both eNOS and sONE in the same reaction, specifically eNOS exons 25 and 26 and/or sONE exons 11 and 10 (5′-CCT CTG GAC AGA TGT GAG AAG GCA-3′ and 5′-CAT GTT TGT CTG CGG CGA TGT TA-3′). Products were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and downward transferred to HyBond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Southern blots were hybridized with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides positioned internally to flanking PCR primers. The eNOS-specific hybridization primer spanned the exon 25/26 junction (5′-TGC TGC GGG ATC AGC AAC GCT ACC A-3′), and the sONE-specific hybridization primer spanned the exon 10/11 junction (5′-GAA AAG CTC TGG CAC GCC GAT GAC G-3′). All quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses were performed by using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system containing the cDNA equivalent of 100 ng of RNA. We again prepared first-strand cDNA using three approaches. RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers or strand-specific primers corresponding to either the coding or antisense strand. The eNOS and sONE real time primer pairs were located in nonoverlapping genomic regions of the two transcription units. Strand-specific cDNA primers corresponding to the genomic DNA coding strand or antisense strand for eNOS were eNOSex11+ (5′-GGA GTG CCG CCA AGG GCA CC-3′) and eNOSex12-(5′-TCG GAG CCA TAC AGG ATT GT-3′), respectively. Strand-specific cDNA primers corresponding to the genomic DNA coding strand or antisense strand for sONE were sONEex7+ (5′-GCA CCT CCG CAG CCA GCT CC-3′) and sONEex8-(5′-GCT GCC GAT GCT CCC AAC TT-3′), respectively. For human tissues, reactions were performed in triplicate on cDNA synthesized from 3 to 6 independent lots of RNA. To quantitate copy number, we used serial 10-fold dilutions of plasmids corresponding to target RNAs to generate standard curves. Normalization of results used the geometric means of GAPDH, cyclophilin, and 18 S RNAs. For quantitation of eNOS, we used primers corresponding to NOS3 exons 11/12, 5′-GGC ATC ACC AGG AAG AAG ACC-3′, 5′-TCA CTC GCT TCG CCA TCA C-3′, and probe 5′-FAM™ CCA ACG CCG TGA AGA TCT CCG C TAMRA™-3′ (90-bp amplicon). Quantitation of sONE mRNA levels was performed by using primers spanning NOS3AS exons 7/8 5′-CGC CTG ATG AGG AGA AGC C-3′, 5′-TCT GTG GTC ACC TGA AAC CCT-3′, and 5′-VIC™ TGC CTC TAG CCC CAG ACA ACA GTG G TAMRA™-3′ (123-bp amplicon) (VIC™, Applied Biosystems). Human GAPDH mRNA levels were assessed by using primers corresponding to exons 2 to 4: 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′, 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′, and the probe 5′-VIC™ CAA GCT TCC CGT TCT CAG CC TAMRA™-3′ (226-bp amplicon). Human cyclophilin mRNA levels were assessed using primers corresponding to exons 1 and 2: 5′-GAC GGC GAG CCC TTG G-3′, 5′-TCT GCT TTT GGG ACC TTG T-3′, and the probe 5′-FAM™ CGC GTC TCC TTT GAG CTG TTT GCA BHQ™-3′ (64-bp amplicon). Human 18 S rRNA levels were assessed using the primers 5′-AGG AAT TGA CGG AAG GGC AC-3′ and 5′-GA CAT CTA AGG GCA TCA CA-3′ with Sybr Green chemistry. Primers 5′-GAT GAG CTA CCC CCT CAG GT-3′ and 5′-ACA GCC TGA CCT GCT CAT CT-3′ were used for FLJ22169. For murine tissue RT-PCR, we used primers 5′-GCC ACC TGA TCC TAA CTT GC-3′ and 5′-AGA AAA GCT CTG GGT GCG TA-3′ corresponding to exon 23 and exon 26 for Nos3, primers 5′-CCC TTG CAC TGA CTG AGG AT-3′ and 5′-TGC TGC TTG TTT CGT ACA GG-3′ in exons 8 and 9 for Nos3as, and primers 5′-AGA GGA GGG CTC AGA GGA TG-3′ and 5′-GCT GCT CAG CTA TTC CAG GT-3′ for Flj22169. Northern Blot Analysis and in Situ cRNA Hybridization—Multiple tissue Northern blots containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane (Clontech) were hybridized with human cDNA probes corresponding to exons 8-16 of NOS3 or 4-9 of NOS3AS. These probes are located in nonoverlapping genomic regions. Murine cDNA probes corresponded to either exon 1 and 2 or exon 9 of Nos3as. Probes were [α-32P]dCTP-labeled using Ready-to-Go cDNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/μg. Hybridization and high stringency wash conditions followed the manufacturer's suggestions. Northern blots were analyzed using a PhosphorImager with Image-Quant software (version 1.3, Amersham Biosciences). In situ cRNA hybridization studies were performed as described (18Flowers M.A. Wang Y. Stewart R.J. Patel B. Marsden P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1988-H1997PubMed Google Scholar). To detect murine Nos3-derived mRNAs, we used a probe representing 992 nt of exons 23-26 of murine eNOS. To detect murine Nos3as-derived mRNAs, we used a 481-nt probe that corresponded to exons 2-4 of murine sONE. Briefly, we studied embryonic tissue from ED 9.5, ED 12.5, and ED 15.5, extraembryonic uteroplacental tissue from ED 11.5, ED 12.5, ED 16.5, and ED17.5, and adult heart, aorta, kidney, and testes. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (5 μm) were mounted on gelatinized slides, deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and postfixed. The sections were digested with proteinase K, treated with triethanolamine/acetic anhydride, washed, and dehydrated. cRNA transcripts were uniformly labeled with 35S-UTP (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and hydrolyzed with alkali to a mean size of <100 nt. Sections were hybridized overnight at 52 °C (50% deionized formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPO4, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, 50 μg/ml total yeast RNA, 50-7500 cpm/μl 35S-labeled cRNA probe). High stringency washes followed at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10 mm dithiothreitol prior to treatment with 20 μg/ml RNase at 37 °C for 30 min. Following washes in 2× SSC and 0.1× SSC for 10 min at 37 °C, slides were dehydrated and coated with Kodak NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and exposed for 4-6 weeks in light-tight boxes with desiccant at 4 °C. Photographic development was carried out in Kodak D-19. Slides were counter-stained lightly with toluidine blue and analyzed using both lightfield and darkfield optics of a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Sense control cRNA probes (see above) from nonoverlapping regions of the Nos3/Nos3as genomic region assessed background levels of hybridization signal. Nuclear Run-off Transcription—Assessment of nuclear transcription across NOS3 and NOS3AS genomic regions was performed as described (29Stewart R.J. Kashour T.S. Marsden P.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1221-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Run-off RNA products were resuspended at equivalent 32P-labeled counts/min in hybridization buffer (2-5 × 105 cpm/ml). Hybridization to 1 μg of linearized and denatured probes slot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters was performed at 42 °C for 72 h in the presence of 16% deionized formamide. Signal intensities were quantitated by using a PhosphorImager. Probes ranged in size from 0.8 to 1.6 kb and represented sONE exons 1-6 (800 bp), sONE exons 4-9 (732 bp), eNOS exon 2-9 (1314 bp), eNOS exons 8-16 (1100 bp), and eNOS exons 17-26 (1600 bp, overlaps with sONE exons 10-12). For single-stranded run-offs, sequences were cloned in both orientations into pBluescript I (SK-), and VSCM13 helper phage was used according to the manufacturer's suggestions to generate positive and negative single-stranded DNA probes. Unique cDNA probes corresponded to sONE exons 1-6 (800 bp) and eNOS exons 8-16 (1100 bp). Negative and positive strand overlap regions were represented by a 1783-bp genomic clone containing exons 10-12 for sONE and exons 24-26 of eNOS. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed essentially as recommended by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., using the ChIP assay kit. Approximately 3 × 106 cells were cross-linked in situ with formaldehyde per ChIP assay. Sonication achieved chromatin fragments ranging in size from 200 to 400 bp. 1% of total chromatin was removed prior to immunoprecipitation to serve as an input sample. Chromatin was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A at 4 °C with rotation for 30 min, followed by the addition of 5 μg of anti-RNA polymerase II NH2-terminal antibody (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), as described (30Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 16 h with rotation. Controls representing no antibody and control rabbit IgG (SC-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were performed in parallel. After washing, formaldehyde cross-links were reversed; samples were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and DNA was suspended in 25 μl of water. Real time PCR was performed as detailed above using primer pairs spanning the NOS3/NOS3AS locus (Table I). Fold enrichment was calculated by subtracting the copy number of each amplicon in the no antibody control or nonspecific control IgG immunoprecipitated fractions from the copy number present in the specific antibody-bound fraction, and dividing this by the number of copies in a dilution of the input chromatin.Table IPrimer pairs used for ChIP analysesPrimerSequenceLocationSizebpeNOS exon 2 ChIP-f5′-TTC CCT CGT GTG AAG AAC TGG-3′eNOS exon 252eNOS exon 2 ChIp-r5′-TGA GGG TGT CAT AGG TGA TGC TC-3′eNOS in 13ex14 ChIP-f5′-AGC TGC CCT GAT GGA GAT GTC C-3′eNOS intron 13-eNOS exon 1482eNOS in 13ex14 ChIP-r5′-CCC AAA CTC TCA CCC AAC TCA CTT G-3′eNOS exon 23 ChIP-f5′-TCT CAA TGT CAT GCA GCC GCT C-3′eNOS exon 23/sONE exon 1285eNOS exon 23 ChIP-r5′-AGC TTG CCC TGC ATT CTG GTG-3′sONE intron 11 ChIP-f5′-GGT GCG TAT GCG GCT TGT CA-3′sONE intron 11/eNOS intron 24131sONE intron 11 ChIP-r5′-GGT TCC TGC TAA GGT CTC CGA GTC-3′sONE exon 6 ChIP-f5′-CCC AGC TCC CAG AAC TTG CTT C-3′sONE exon 6128sONE exon 6 ChIP-r5′-CCA CCT CAG TCT CCA TGT TGT TCA C-3′sONE exon 3 ChIP-f5′-CTC ACC CCG CTG TTT CTG CTT-3′sONE exon 359sONE exon 3 ChIP-r5′-AAG TCG ATA ATC TCC AGG GCA CG-3′ Open table in a new tab siRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—siRNA duplexes targeted to sONE mRNA sequences were designed as described (31Martinez J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; : 333Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (Table II). sONE targeted duplexes were transfected along with scrambled control siRNA (Scramble II siRNA duplex, Dharmacon) into HAoVSMC using Trans-Messenger (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, 16 h before transfection, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated prior to transfection with 2 μg of siRNA duplexes per sample. Total cellular RNA was extracted after 72 h, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to quantitative PCR as detailed above. To monitor and optimize for transfection and silencing efficiency, cells were transfected in parallel with siRNA duplexes targeted to the nuclear membrane protein Lamin A/C (Table II). Western blots used an anti-lamin A/C antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and revealed >95% reduced levels of lamin A/C protein. Relative expression levels were calculated by normalizing target amplicons to co-amplified GAPDH. Data were then compared with similarly normalized expression levels in scrambled control transfected cells (set to 1) by one sample t test.Table IIRNA oligonucleotides used for siRNA knockdownNameTarget sequenceLocationsONE 1745′-CTC CTG CTG CAG ACA GCC C-3′sONE exon 2sONE 10445′-TCC TGG TCA AGT GAC GGC T-3′sONE exon 8sONE 10995′-CCC AGA AGG CCC GGA ATC T-3′sONE exon 8Lamin A/C5′-CTG GAC TTC CAG AAG AAC A-3′Scramble5′-GCG CGC TTT GTA GGA TTC G-3′ Open table in a new tab Overexpression of sONE—Expression plasmids encoding 1555 nt derived from 3′-regions of the sONE cDNA that overlap with 662 nt of eNOS sequence (sONE exons 10-12) were constructed using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Transcription was directed by a 302-bp SV40 promoter/enhancer encoded in the pMACS KK II plasmid (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). HUVEC were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips. After 18-24 h cells were transiently transfected using Effectene (Qiagen). Cells were co-transfected with the pDsRed2 N1 plasmid (Clontech) which encoded the Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein for in situ detection of transfected cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min followed by permeabilization in cold 100% methanol for 15 min. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:25 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-human eNOS COOH-terminal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Coverslips were subsequently washed and incubated in a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were visualized on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with argon (514 nm) and Green He-Ne (543 nm) lasers.

https://openalex.org/W1972138860,"The ability of Staphylococcus aureus to adhere to components of the extracellular matrix is an important mechanism for colonization of host tissues during infection. We have previously shown that S. aureus binds elastin, a major component of the extracellular matrix. The integral membrane protein, elastin-binding protein (EbpS), binds soluble elastin peptides and tropoelastin via its surface-exposed N-terminal domain. In this study, we demonstrate that some strains of S. aureus adhere strongly to immobilized human elastin and that this interaction is independent of EbpS but instead is mediated by the fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPA and FnBPB. Our results show that EbpS mutant cells adhere to elastin-coated plates, whereas the cells negative for FnBPA and FnBPB do not adhere to the plates. Furthermore, only wild-type cells from the exponential phase of growth adhered when FnBPs were expressed maximally. We show that adherence to elastin promoted by FnBPA was not affected by soluble fibronectin, suggesting that the elastin binding domain is distinct from the fibronectin binding regions. Recombinant FnBPA37–544 (rFnBPA37–544) protein corresponding to the A region of FnBPA and anti-FnBPA37–544 antibodies inhibited FnBPA-mediated bacterial adherence to immobilized elastin. Finally, recombinant A domain proteins, rFnBPA37–544 and rFnBPB37–540, bound immobilized elastin dose-dependently and saturably. This interaction was inhibited by soluble elastin peptides, suggesting a specific receptor-ligand interaction.

Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen that can express several proteins on its cell surface that promote bacterial adherence to proteins of the mammalian extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; rFnBP, recombinant FnBP; MSSA, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus; MSCRAMM, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; ClfA, clumping factor A; ClfB, clumping factor B; FnBPA, fibronectin-binding protein A; FnBPB, fibronection-binding protein B; EbpS, elastin-binding protein of S. aureus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Collectively, these proteins are called microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs). The binding to the ECM allows bacteria to adhere to and colonize the host tissue. Surface proteins that interact with collagen (1Switalski L.M. Patti J.M. Butcher W. Gristina A.G. Speziale P.

Elastin is a hydrophobic protein that provides resilience and elasticity to tissues such as lung, aorta, and skin. Tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin, is produced by smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts (10Rosenbloom J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 10: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Sandberg L.B. Soskel N.T. Leslie J.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The protein consists of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains with the hydrophilic domains often consisting of lysine residues that are involved in cross-linking (12Indik Z. Yeh H.

A thermodynamically controlled process called coacervation is thought to orientate the tropoelastin monomers into an ordered fibrillar structure via interactions between the hydrophobic domains of neighboring molecules (13Cox B.A. Starcher B.C.

Lysine residues in the hydrophilic cross-linking domains of secreted tropoelastin then are rapidly cross-linked both intermolecularly and intramolecularly by the enzyme lysyl oxidase to form mature elastin (14Kagan H.M.

S. aureus infects elastin-rich tissues such as lung and heart valves, causing pneumonia and native-valve endocarditis, respectively (15Sheagren J.N. N. Engl. J.

The membrane-associated elastin-binding protein (EbpS) was shown to promote binding of soluble elastin peptides and tropoelastin to S. aureus cells (17Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R.P.

It was suggested that EbpS might be the adhesin responsible for the bacterial colonization of elastin-rich tissue (17Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R.P. J. Biol.

If EbpS is to function as an elastin adhesin, it must be able to promote bacterial adherence to immobilized elastin. In this study, we show that the ability of S. aureus to adhere to immobilized elastin is not dependent on EbpS but rather on the fibronectin-binding proteins FnBPA and FnBPB (Fig. 1), cell wall-associated proteins that promote bacterial adherence to immobilized fibronectin in vitro (19Greene C.

The PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 48–50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1–4 min using Pfu polymerase (Promega). The PCR products were cloned into the N-terminal six-histidine tag expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by Ni2+ chelate chromatography followed by Q-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (34O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D.

Chicken anti-human fibronectin antibodies were supplied by Gallus Immunotech (Fergus, Ontario, Canada) after immunization with the purified N-terminal 29-kDa fragment containing the type I modules to which FnBPs bind. Western Immunoblotting and Western Ligand Affinity Blotting— Samples were boiled for 5 min in an equal volume of 2× sample buffer before electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) was performed through a 4.5% stacking and 10% polyacrylamide-separating gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science) by Western blotting. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human fibrinogen-horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Dako 1:4000) and goat polyclonal anti-human fibronectin antibodies (Dako 1:2000) were used in an attempt to detect contaminants in 30 μg of elastin peptides fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used to detect any bound antibodies using the LumiGLO chemiluminescence substrate (New England Biolabs). Bacterial Adhesion to Immobilized Elastin Peptides—Microtiter plate wells (Povair) were coated with 50-μl volumes of various concentrations (0.001–1 μg) of κ-elastin from bovine ligament, human aortic elastin, or human lung elastin (Elastin Products Company) that had been dissolved in coating buffer (0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.4). The elastin peptides were air-dried under UV light (366 nm) at room temperature for 18 h. Wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS. S. aureus cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.5 (early exponential phase) or 12 (stationary phase) in 20 ml of trypticase soy broth (Difco) in a 250-ml flask with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended to an A600 nm of 1 (1 × 108 colony forming units/ml). Bacterial cell adherence was measured using a fluorescent nucleic acid stain SYTO-13 (Molecular Probes). SYTO-13 was supplied in 5 mm dimethyl sulfoxide. It was diluted 1:10 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Bacterial cells were incubated with SYTO-13 (2.5 μm) at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Elastin-coated wells were washed three times with PBS. 100 μl of stained cells then were added and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 90 min. Wells were washed three times with PBS, and adherent bacteria were measured using a LS-50B spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 509 nm. Effect of Soluble Fibronectin on the Adherence of S. aureus to Immobilized Fibronectin and Elastin—A culture of S. aureus P1 fnbA fnbB (pFNBA4) was grown to early exponential phase, and cells were collected as described above. Cells were preincubated with 100 μg/ml human fibronectin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at ambient temperature before being stained with SYTO-13 and tested for adherence to microtiter plates (Povair) coated with human aortic elastin (10 μg/ml) as described above or to control wells coated with human fibronectin (5 μg/ml, Calbiochem). Inhibition of Bacterial Adherence to Immobilized Elastin with Antibodies—S. aureus P1 fnbA fnbB (pFNBA4) cells were grown to early exponential phase, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Cells were then diluted with an equal volume of dilutions of anti-rFnBPA37–544 or anti-rEbpS1–267 (18Downer R. Roche F. Park P.W. Mecham R.P. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 243-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) antibodies (100–0.8 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells then were stained with SYTO-13, 100 μl was added to the microtiter wells coated with human aortic elastin, and fluorescence was measured as described above. Inhibition of Bacterial Adherence to Immobilized Elastin with Recombinant Proteins—Human aortic elastin peptides (10 μg/ml) were coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate as described previously. Wells were washed three times with PBS, and various concentrations (0.2–60 μm) of rFnBPA37–544, rFnBPA745–878, rFnBPB37–540, or recombinant protein A (Sigma) were added in 50-μl volumes and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells of S. aureus P1 fnbA fnbB (pFNBA4+) grown to early exponential phase and stained with SYTO-13 were added, and bacterial adherence was measured as described above. Direct Binding of Recombinant Proteins to Immobilized Elastin and Fibrinogen—Human aortic elastin (20 μg/ml) and human fibrinogen (10 μg/ml) were coated onto the wells of microtiter plates for 18 h under UV light and for 18 h at 4 °C, respectively. Plates were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2hat37 °C. Following three washes with PBS, different concentrations of purified rFnBPA37–544 and rFnBPB37–540 protein in PBS were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The A domain of ClfA (rClfA40–559) was used as a control for fibrinogen binding. Wells were washed with PBS, and bound protein was detected by incubation with a 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal anti-rFnBPA37–544, anti-rFnBPB37–540, or anti-rClfA40–559 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako, 1:2000) were added and bound horseradish peroxidase was detected as described above. Inhibition of Recombinant Protein Binding to Immobilized Elastin with Soluble Elastin Peptides—The wells of a microtiter plate were coated with human-aortic elastin peptides (50 μg/ml) and blocked with bovine serum albumin as described previously. Recombinant rFnBPA37–544 and rFnBPB37–540 were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing soluble human aortic elastin peptides (0–250 μg/ml) before being added to elastin-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, bound rFnBPs were detected as described above. Adherence of S. aureus to Immobilized Elastin Peptides—It was reported previously that soluble 125I-labeled α-elastin peptides from bovine ligament and 125I-labeled human recombinant tropoelastin, the monomeric precursor of elastin, bound specifically to S. aureus cells (41Park P.W.

Binding experiments with an ebpS mutant of S. aureus strain, Newman, indicated that EbpS is the dominant factor for binding soluble elastin but also suggested that the bacteria express a second elastin binding moiety (18Downer R. Roche F. Park P.W. Mecham R.P. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 243-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ELISA-based assays have been used to study the adherence of S. aureus cells to immobilized mammalian ECM proteins such as fibronectin, collagen, and fibrinogen (42Hartford O. McDevitt D. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2497-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of S. aureus strains to adhere to immobilized elastin peptides, κ-elastin from bovine ligament was coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate. Cultures of laboratory strains, Newman, P1, 8325-4, Cowan, COL, and RN4220, and clinical strains, MSSA476 and methicillin-resistant S. aureus 252, were grown to early exponential phase and stationary phase, and the ability of cells to adhere to immobilized elastin peptides was measured. The cells of strains P1, Cowan, and MSSA476 from exponential phase cultures adhered strongly to immobilized elastin peptides, but cells from stationary phase cultures did not adhere (Fig. 2). Thus, adherence to immobilized elastin is a feature of cells from the exponential phase of growth. MSCRAMMs, such as FnBPs (19Greene C. McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P.E. Lew D.P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and ClfB (3Ní Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), are known to be expressed exclusively on cells from the exponential phase. Adherence to Immobilized Elastin Is Mediated by the Fibronectin-binding Proteins and Not by EbpS—Strain P1 was used for further investigation of S. aureus adherence to elastin, because this strain is amenable to genetic manipulation and exhibits strong adherence to immobilized elastin peptides. To investigate whether EbpS was responsible for this interaction, S. aureus P1 wild type and an isogenic ebpS mutant were tested for adherence to immobilized κ-elastin from bovine ligament. Both strains adhered in a dose-dependent manner, but there was no significant difference in elastin binding activity of the two (Fig. 3A), indicating that EbpS is not an MSCRAMM for elastin. It then was shown that a mutant of P1 fnbA fnbB defective in the expression of the fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPA and FnBPB, did not adhere to immobilized κ-elastin (Fig. 3B). P1 adhered in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no binding was observed with strain P1 fnbA fnbB. This defect was partially complemented by pFNBA4 (expressing FnBPA) and fully complemented by pFNBB4 (expressing FnBPB). Partial complementation by pFNBPA4 could be attributed to lower expression of the 8325-4 fnbA gene in the heterologous P1 host. These data strongly suggest that FnBPA and FnBPB are the surface proteins responsible for bacterial adherence to immobilized elastin peptides. A further analysis of FnBP-mediated adherence to immobilized elastins was performed with P1 fnbA fnbB (pFNBA4). S. aureus Adheres to Human Aortic Elastin and Human Lung Elastin in an FnBP-dependent Manner—S. aureus adheres to immobilized elastin peptides purified from bovine neck ligament in a FnBP-dependent manner (Fig. 3). If the interaction between the fibronectin-binding proteins and elastin is an important factor in human diseases of elastin-rich tissue, such as endocarditis and pneumonia, bacteria should be able to adhere to immobilized human elastin. Human and bovine tropoelastin share a 70.3% identity at the primary amino acid sequence level and are structurally and anti-genetically similar (43Debelle L. Wei S.M. Jacob M.P. Hornebeck W. Alix A.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 2: 321-329Google Scholar). Elastins from bovine ligament, human aorta, and human lung were coated onto the wells of microtiter plates. Cells of strain P1 from an exponential phase culture bound in a dose-dependent manner to all three forms of immobilized elastin (Fig. 4). Strain P1 fnbA fnbB did not adhere (data not shown), and the defect was complemented by plasmids pFNBA4 and pFNBB4 (data not shown). Thus, the adherence to both immobilized human aorta and lung elastin was FnBP-dependent. Strain MSSA adhered to immobilized elastins in a similar fashion to strain P1 (data not shown). To determine whether human aortic elastin dried under UV light onto the wells of a microtiter plate behaves similarly as the native protein, the ability of anti-human aortic elastin antibodies to bind was measured by ELISA. The antibodies bound in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown), indicating that many epitopes from native elastin are present in the immobilized peptides. Because the FnBPs can adhere to both fibronectin (44Patti J.M. House-Pompeo K. Boles J.O. Garza N. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol.

No immunoreactive proteins were detected in the preparations"
https://openalex.org/W2009459756,"Organelle inheritance is an essential feature of all eukaryotic cells. As with other organelles, the Golgi complex partitions between daughter cells through the fission of its membranes into numerous tubulovesicular fragments. We found that the protein CtBP3/BARS (BARS) was responsible for driving the fission of Golgi membranes during mitosis in vivo. Moreover, by in vitro analysis, we identified two stages of this Golgi fragmentation process: disassembly of the Golgi stacks into a tubular network, and BARS-dependent fission of these tubules. Finally, this BARS-induced fission of Golgi membranes controlled the G 2 -to-prophase transition of the cell cycle, and hence cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2142472250,"The motion areas of posterior parietal cortex extract information on visual motion for perception as well as for the guidance of movement. It is usually assumed that neurons in posterior parietal cortex represent visual motion relative to the retina. Current models describing action guided by moving objects work successfully based on this assumption. However, here we show that the pursuit-related responses of a distinct group of neurons in area MST of monkeys are at odds with this view. Rather than signaling object image motion on the retina, they represent object motion in world-centered coordinates. This representation may simplify the coordination of object-directed action and ego motion-invariant visual perception."
https://openalex.org/W2016349392,"Thioredoxin-binding protein-2 (TBP-2)/vitamin D(3) up-regulated protein 1 is an endogenous molecule interacting with thioredoxin (TRX), negatively regulating TRX function, and being implicated in the suppression of tumor development and metastasis. We found that TBP-2 ectopically expressed in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was localized predominantly in the nucleus exhibiting growth suppressive activity. The nuclear accumulation of endogenous TBP-2 protein was also demonstrated when the cells were treated with an anti-cancer drug, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. To investigate the mechanism underlying the nuclear localization, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and identified importin alpha(1) (Rch1) as a protein interacting with TBP-2. The physical interaction between TBP-2 and Rch1 was confirmed with a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. The interaction of TBP-2 was specific to Rch1 among other importin alpha subfamilies (Qip1 and NPI-1), and amino acids 1-227 of TBP-2 were sufficient for both the interaction with Rch1 and the nuclear localization, although there is no typical nuclear localization signal in this sequence. The expression of short interfering RNA of Rch1 suppressed suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid-induced nuclear accumulation of TBP-2. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that an interaction with importin system is required for TBP-2 nuclear translocation and growth control tightly associated with TRX-dependent redox regulation of transcription factors."

(1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27573–27579). Using the sequences of the pigeon enzymes as queries in BLAST searches, we obtained genetic evidence that both enzymes are expressed in a wide range of animal species (Johnson, J. D., Mehus, J. G., Tews, K., Milavetz, B. I., and Lambeth, D. O. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 27580–27586). Here we extend those observations by presenting data from Western and Northern blots and enzymatic assays showing that both proteins are widely expressed in mammals with the relative amounts varying from tissue to tissue. We suggest that both succinyl-CoA synthetases catalyze the reverse reaction in the citric acid cycle in which the ADP-forming enzyme augments ATP production, whereas the GDP-forming enzyme supports GTP-dependent anabolic processes. Widely accepted shuttle mechanisms are invoked to explain how transport of P-enolpyruvate across mitochondrial membranes can transfer high energy phosphate between the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix.

Gibson D.M. Ayengar P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 14: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), almost 20 years after formulation of the citric acid cycle by Krebs and Johnson (4Krebs H.A. Johnson W.A. Enzymologia. 1937; 4: 148-156Google Scholar). We definitively showed by enzyme purification and characterization that GDP-forming and ADP-forming enzymes occur in pigeon liver and breast muscle, respectively (1Johnson J.D. Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27573-27579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The two enzymes were found to contain the same α subunit but different β subunits that share 54% sequence identity (1Johnson J.D. Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27573-27579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1975; 250: 8524-8529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that the β subunit of the heterodimer determines nucleotide specificity.Using each β sequence in pigeon as a query in BLAST searches, we found that aligning expressed sequence tags in mouse and human fell into groups of closely and distantly related sequences. The group that aligned closely with the G-β subunit aligned more distantly with A-β and vice versa. This strongly indicated that the two β subunits arose by gene duplication and also provided evidence that both types of β subunits are expressed in mammals. Early determination of the coding regions of the A-β and G-β mRNAs in mouse and human has permitted the appropriate assignment of nucleotide specificity to hundreds of expressed sequence tag and mRNA sequences that have been deposited in GenBank™ and other public databases.We also reported data obtained by semiquantitative RT-PCR that confirmed expression of both types of β subunits in several mouse and human tissues (2Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of messages varied with tissue type, from being mostly G-β in liver to being mostly A-β in brain and testis (2Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We also reported that the apparent enzyme activity of A-SCS was unaccountably low in tissue homogenates according to the methods of assay used (2Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here results obtained by using Western blotting and a different enzyme assay show that A-SCS is prominently expressed at the protein level in a wide range of mammalian tissues.Knowledge that both ATP- and GDP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetases occur in mammalian tissues has prompted us to further consider the role of the GDP-forming enzyme. The long held assumption that GTP produced by the citric acid cycle is transphosphorylated with ADP in the nucleoside diphosphate kinase reaction is no longer attractive since we now know that A-SCS can synthesize ATP directly. Under “Discussion,” we propose that currently accepted shuttles between mitochondrial matrix and cytosol would allow the phosphorylation potential of P-enolpyruvate to be transferred from mitochondrial matrix to cytosol and vice versa.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMTN Multiple Tissue Northern Blot—An MTN multiple tissue Northern blot membrane kit from Clontech that contained eight different adult mouse tissues was probed for messages for succinyl-CoA synthetase subunits. 32P-labeled probes of about 400 bases were prepared by using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit from Ambion. Primers used for preparing the probes are listed in Table I. The transcripts were cloned into the pBluescript II KS (+/–) vector from Stratagene. A NorthernMax kit from Ambion was used to hybridize probes to the membrane. Hybridization was carried out for at least 2 h at 70 °C for the A-β and G-β probes and 68 °C for the α probe. Membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature with agitation and then twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 °C. The blots were wrapped in plastic and exposed to film. Observed bands were quantified by densitometry.Table IPrimers used to prepare probes for Northern blotsPrimeraF and R refer to the forward and reverse primers for the subunits indicated to the left.

Open table in a new tab Western Blots—Antipeptide antibodies to SCS subunits were prepared by immunizing chicken (α subunit, Gallus Immunotech, Ontario, Canada) or rabbit (both β subunits, Bioworld, Dublin, OH) using the following sequences: KEAHVDVKFQLPI, A-β C-terminal; DAAKKAVASVAKK, G-β C-terminal, and GSYTASRKHIYID, N-terminal of expected processed protein for α (6Majumdar R. Bridger W.A Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These peptide sequences are conserved in human, rat, and mouse. The antibodies generated were affinity-purified from serum by the vendor.Mitochondria were isolated from tissues of rat and mouse by using standard procedures for homogenization and centrifugation. Pelleted mitochondria were stored frozen at –20 °C until analyzed by enzymatic assay or SDS-PAGE. Human tissues analyzed by Western blotting were obtained from Clontech as Protein Medley samples prepared by using SDS to solubilize proteins in whole tissue homogenates. For Western blots, 10 μg of mitochondrial protein (rat and mouse) or 20 μg of Protein Medley (human) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 11% polyacrylamide gels. Following transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the membranes were probed using a 1:2000 dilution of primary antibody and then developed using a 1:70,000 dilution of secondary antibodies. The SCS β proteins were detected by using goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase that were purchased from Bio-Rad. Rabbit anti-chicken antibody from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories was used to detect the α subunit. Bands were visualized using the SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate from Pierce and analyzed by a Lumi-Imager from Roche Applied Science that used Lumi-Analyst 3.0 software.Assays of A-SCS and G-SCS activities were performed at 30 °C using a modification of the procedure of Alarcon et al. (7Alarcon C. Wicksteed B. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2496-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Frozen mitochondrial pellets were extracted in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.4% CHAPS. The complete assay mixture in a volume of 1 ml contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm succinyl-CoA, 2 mm ADP (for A-SCS) or 1 mm GDP (for G-SCS), and 0.2 mm DTNB). The reactions were initiated by adding succinyl-CoA and DTNB) in quick succession. Rates were corrected by subtracting the rate observed when ADP or GDP was deleted. The formation of thionitrobenzoate was followed at 412 nm. Controls demonstrated that the observed succinyl-CoA synthetase activities were dependent on magnesium, succinyl-CoA, and nucleoside diphosphate.RESULTSFollowing evidence obtained by RT-PCR and analysis of expressed sequence tags in databases that the gene for A-SCS is widely expressed in animal tissues (2Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we have further studied the relative levels of A-SCS and G-SCS in selected tissues by using enzymatic assays and Western and Northern blots. The levels of mRNA for the α and two β SCS subunits in eight mouse tissues were determined by Northern blots as shown in Fig. 1. Two transcripts of ∼2.5 and 1.7 kb were noted for A-β with the relative densitometric units shown in Fig. 1 being based on the smaller transcript only. The 1.7-kb transcript accounted for nearly the entire α message in testis and liver. The amount of the 2.5-kb transcript exceeded that of the smaller one in kidney and was also prominent in heart. Expression of the 1.7-kb transcript was strongest in testis and heart followed by kidney and liver.BLAST of the available expressed sequence tags against accession number AF058955 for A-β in mouse suggested that the two different length transcripts for A-β arose from alternative polyadenylation signals. Examination of the sequence in accession number AF058955 (which lacks the 5′-untranslated region) shows alternative polyadenylation signals TATAAA beginning at 1459 and 1475. This was confirmed by Northern blots that compared results obtained by using a probe recognizing the middle of both transcripts with one that was distal to the 3′end of the shorter transcripts. The latter probe detected the 2.5-kb transcript only (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Northern blots of mouse heart and testis using two different probes. The experiment was designed to show that the different size transcripts seen in Fig. 1 are due to different length 3′-untranslated regions arising from alternative polyadenylation sites. A shows the result using a probe placed within the coding region. The probe used in B recognized a region 3′ to the suspected early polyadenylation signals (Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A single transcript of ∼2.5 kb was found for G-β. The level of message was highest in kidney followed by liver and heart. It was detected at a very low level in testis, where the message for A-β was the highest of the eight tissues examined.The same α subunit is found in both A-SCS and G-SCS enzymes (1Johnson J.D. Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27573-27579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Northern blots revealed a single transcript of 1.5 kb with the strongest expression of α observed in heart followed by kidney, liver, and testis.Western blots were used to study the relative amounts of the subunits of A-SCS and G-SCS in mouse, rat, and human tissues. Antipeptide antibodies were used that recognize the C-terminal sequences of the β subunits and the N-terminal sequence of the processed α subunit in human, rat, and mouse. Fig. 3 shows the Western blots for each subunit in these three animal species. The results indicate that the A-β subunit is expressed most highly in testis, brain, heart, and kidney. The G-β subunit is highly expressed in liver, kidney, and heart but barely detected in brain and testis.Fig. 3Western blots of SCS subunits in rat, mouse, and human. Mitochondria were isolated from tissues of rat and mouse, and 10 μg of mitochondrial protein were applied in each lane. For human, each lane contained 15 μg of SDS-solubilized protein derived from a whole tissue homogenate (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we experienced difficulties in reliably measuring the enzymatic activity of A-SCS using either a high pressure liquid chromatography-based method (8Lambeth D.O. Muhonen W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or the spectrophotometric method of Cha and Parks (9Cha S. Parks Jr., R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the origin of the difficulties is not understood, we were able to get consistent data by using a different assay as described below. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation in isotonic medium and stored as frozen pellets following decantation of the supernatant after the final wash. The pellets were extracted by resuspension in hypotonic phosphate buffer containing 0.4% CHAPS. After centrifugation, the extract was immediately assayed by using a modification of the procedure of Alaracon et al. (7Alarcon C. Wicksteed B. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2496-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in which DTNB) is used to follow the formation of CoA from succinyl-CoA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Due to the high absorbance of thionitrobenzoate at 412 nm, the assay is highly sensitive. The results obtained are shown in Table II. The relative amounts of A-SCS and G-SCS vary, from mostly G-SCS in liver to mostly A-SCS in brain and testis. Kidney mitochondria show high activities of both enzymes with the activity of G-SCS exceeding that of A-SCS. The activities are nearly equal in rat heart mitochondria. The results obtained are consistent with the relative intensities of the bands seen in Western blots.Table IISpecific activities of A-SCS and G-SCS in extracts of rat mitochondriaTissueA-SCSG-SCSHeart0.2290.123Testis0.0950.014Brain0.0370.001Kidney0.1240.227Liver0.0530.139 Open table in a new tab Western blots and enzymatic assays of subcellular and submitochondrial fractions showed that A-SCS and G-SCS are both localized in the matrix fraction of mitochondria (data not shown). The possibility that A-SCS might be tetrameric was investigated by chromatography of a kidney extract on Superose 12. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting, which showed that A-SCS and G-SCS eluted together with an apparent molecular weight consistent with heterodimers.DISCUSSIONIn earlier work, we established by RT-PCR that messages encoding the β chains of A-SCS and G-SCS are well represented in a variety of tissues in mouse and human (2Johnson J.D. Mehus J.G. Tews K. Milavetz B.I. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27580-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here we present data for the enzymatic activities of A-SCS and G-SCS in several tissues of rat. These data together with the results of RT-PCR and Western blots obtained for rat, mouse, and human demonstrate that the relative protein amounts of A-SCS and G-SCS varies with tissue source. The G-β subunit is much more highly expressed in anabolic tissues such as liver and kidney, whereas A-β predominates in testis and brain. Both enzymes are located in the matrix of mitochondria, where they could participate in the citric acid cycle. We previously found that G-SCS is by far the predominant enzyme detected by enzyme assay in pigeon liver, whereas A-SCS predominates in pigeon breast muscle (1Johnson J.D. Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27573-27579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Since the discovery of G-SCS 50 years ago, most textbooks and reviews have shown that GTP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle undergoes a transphosphorylation with ADP catalyzed by NDP kinase. This presumption is now unattractive because A-SCS is available to form ATP directly. The significance of GTP production by substrate-level phosphorylation has been considered previously (10Ottaway J.H. McClellan J.A. Saunderson C.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Lambeth D.O. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and the following discussion is intended to provide a frame-work for further work.A review of sequenced genomes reveals that genes for two β subunits of SCS are found in some species of eubacteria (for example, Nitrosomonas europaea and Geobacter metallireducens) and archaebacteria (Archaeoglobus fulgidus). In each species, the two β sequences align with 50–60% identity, which is similar to that found for vertebrates. Thus the origin of the two β genes in metazoan species may have originated from the endosymbiont that gave rise to mitochondria.Limited data on the nucleotide specificity of succinyl-CoA synthetase in bacterial species suggest that most bacterial enzymes will use both adenine and 6-oxopurine nucleotides with adenine usually, but not always, being the best (12Weitzman P.D.J. Jaskowska-Hodges H. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Kelly C.J. Sungman C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fungal species sequenced thus far have only one gene for the β subunit, and the enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is specific for ATP (14Przybyla-Zawislak B. Dennis R.A. Zakharkin S.O. McCammon M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of highly specific succinyl-CoA synthetases in metazoan species may be related to the development of specialized tissues and the need for the functional separation of the adenine and guanine nucleotide pools. In yeast, both succinyl-CoA synthetase and P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase are specific for ATP (14Przybyla-Zawislak B. Dennis R.A. Zakharkin S.O. McCammon M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given that both cytosolic and mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate carboxykinases in animals are GTP-forming, it is attractive to speculate that a functional linkage between P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase and G-SCS is mediated through GTP.Following the discovery of the catabolic role of the citric acid cycle in oxidative tissues, the involvement of cycle enzymes in various anabolic and amphibolic processes has become increasingly appreciated (15Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Although ATP supplies the free energy for many biological processes, anabolic reactions are generally supported by GTP, UTP, or CTP (16Atkinson D.E. Cellular Energy Metabolism and Its Regulation. Academic Press, New York1977: 32-35Google Scholar). G-SCS could directly support anabolic functions of the citric acid cycle within mitochondria by providing GTP for the GTP-requiring steps of protein synthesis as well as the synthesis of P-enolpyruvate by mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase.There is no known mechanism for the export of GTP by mitochondria. However, intramitochondrial GTP could support the synthesis of P-enolpyruvate by mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. Such P-enolpyruvate could then be transported to cytosol by the tricarboxylate or adenine nucleotide transporters (17Kleineke J. Sauer H. Soling H.D. FEBS Lett. 1973; 29: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In cytosol, as illustrated in Fig. 4, P-enolpyruvate could be used for glucogenesis, for the phosphorylation of GDP by cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, or to synthesize ATP by going through the pyruvate kinase reaction. The latter reaction would increase the adenylate charge and could be a part of “pyruvate cycling,” the rate of which can exceed by severalfold the rate of flux through the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of glucose (18Jones J.G. Solomon M.A. Cole S.M. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E848-E856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather than being an energy-wasting, futile cycle, such cycling of P-enolpyruvate and pyruvate may be a mechanism for transferring phosphorylation potential from mitochondria to cytosol (19Drahota Z. Rauchova H. Mikova M. Bass A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 157: 347-349Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Scheme showing possible P-enolpyruvate-pyruvate and P-enolpyruvate-malate cycles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GTP synthesized from P-enolpyruvate by the reversal of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in cytosol could directly support cytosolic protein synthesis and various GTP-binding regulatory proteins. Transport of P-enolpyruvate to the cytosol might occur primarily when the cell is sufficiently energetic to carry out anabolic reactions. The functional role of cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase has been thought to be glucogenesis, and the high level of the cytosolic enzyme found in the major gluconeogenic tissues, liver and kidney, is consistent with that role. However, there has long been doubt about whether the primary role of mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is to support gluconeogenesis (20Modaressi S. Brechtel K. Christ B. Jungermann K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The more sensitive techniques of molecular biology have shown that G-SCS and both forms of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase are expressed at lower levels than those found in kidney and liver in a wide array of immune, nervous, muscle, and secretory tissues. 2See bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards-bin/carddisp?_symbol=SUCLA2 and bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards-bin/carddisp?_symbol=SUCLG2. Consistent with the reversibility of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction in isolated mitochondria (22Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10464-10473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an anaplerotic function for the mitochondrial enzyme has been suggested. Thus the potential involvement of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinases in roles other than glucose synthesis, including ones in which the reversal of the enzyme is required, should receive attention.The importance of A-SCS presumably lies with the catabolic functions of the citric acid cycle in which the oxidation of acetyl groups provides reducing equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation. The prevalence of A-SCS in the mitochondria of highly catabolic tissues is consistent with this role. The synthesis of an ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation would augment ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation by about 10%. In the switch from the bloodstream to the procyclic form of Trypanosome brucei, the procyclic form becomes heavily dependent on oxidative metabolism for energy. The switch is accompanied by the development of mitochondria, and the amount of A-SCS strongly increases along with other citric acid cycle enzymes (23Jenkins T.M. Eisenthal R. Weitzman P.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the finding in a yeast two-hybrid screen that A-SCS is an interacting protein with aminolevulinate synthase suggests that A-SCS can also support anabolic reactions (21Furuyama K. Sassa S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).In summary, the presence of A-SCS in animals is now well established. Ironically, its known presence should refocus interest in the metabolic and regulatory roles of G-SCS. Discovery of how these two synthetases function in the same mitochondria would lead to a better understanding of how the cell balances and regulates anabolism and catabolism. We expect that the mechanisms underlying regulation involve proteinprotein interactions with the two SCS enzymes being associated with different metabolic enzymes.

Thus, Ca2+ ions, and to a lesser extent Mg2+ ions, have been viewed as the principal physiological regulators of PTH secretion. Herein we show that in physiological concentrations, l-amino acids acutely and reversibly activated the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor in normal human parathyroid cells and inhibited parathyroid hormone secretion. Individual l-amino acids, especially of the aromatic and aliphatic classes, as well as plasma-like amino acid mixtures, stereoselectively mobilized Ca2+ ions in normal human parathyroid cells in the presence but not the absence of the CaR agonists, extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o), or spermine. The order of potency was l-Trp = l-Phe > l-His > l-Ala > l-Glu > l-Arg = l-Leu. CaR-active amino acids also acutely and reversibly suppressed PTH secretion at physiological ionized Ca2+ concentrations. At a Ca2+o of 1.1 mm and an amino acid concentration of 1 mm, CaR-active amino acids (l-Phe = l-Trp > l-His = l-Ala), but not CaR-inactive amino acids (l-Leu and l-Arg), stereoselectively suppressed PTH secretion by up to 40%, similar to the effect of raising Ca2+o to 1.2 mm. A physiologically relevant increase in the -fold concentration of the plasma-like amino acid mixture (from 1× to 2×) also reversibly suppressed PTH secretion in the Ca2+o concentration range 1.05–1.25 mm. In conclusion, l-amino acids acutely and reversibly activate endogenous CaRs and suppress PTH secretion at physiological concentrations. The results indicate that l-amino acids are physiological regulators of PTH secretion and thus whole body calcium metabolism.

A major insight into the mechanism by which Ca2+o interacts with parathyroid cells was gained with the cloning of the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) (1Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D.

This receptor, which belongs to subgroup C of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, mediates the Ca2+o-stimulated activation of intracellular signaling pathways in parathyroid cells leading to the activation of various enzymes including phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C and attendant intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (for reviews, see Refs. 2Brown E.M.

Targeted deletion of the CaR in the CaR null mouse eliminates feedback control of PTH secretion and results in a severe form of neonatal hyperparathyroidism (4Ho C. Conner D.A. Pollak M.R. Ladd D.J. Kifor O. Warren H.B. Brown E.M. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). A similar condition in humans, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, has been shown to arise in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes with inactivating mutations of the CaR (5Pollak M.R. Chou Y.W. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Cole D.E.C. Brandi M.L. Papadopoulos S.E. Menko F.H. Hendy G.N. Brown E.M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar).Molecular analysis of the CaR indicates that it is composed of several functional domains that are conserved across related members of subgroup C. The N-terminal Venus Fly Trap domains of many of these receptors recognize amino acids (especially glutamate) or the amino acid analog, γ-aminobutyric acid. More recent work indicates that several cloned members of the family are also broad-spectrum amino acid sensors. In mammals, these include the CaR, which is allosterically activated by aromatic, aliphatic, and polar amino acids as well as plasma-like amino acid mixtures (6Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and a heterodimeric amino acid taste receptor, which has broad selectivity for aliphatic, polar, and charged amino acids but not aromatic amino acids (7Nelson G. Chandrashekar J. Hoon M.A. Feng L. Zhao G. Ryba N.J.P. Zuker C.S. Nature. 2002; 416: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). In human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells that stably express the human CaR, l-amino acids markedly enhanced the sensitivity of the receptor to Ca2+ and other cationic agonists including spermine and Gd3+ (6Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar).Because the CaR mediates the acute control of PTH secretion, the finding that it is allosterically activated by l-amino acids raises the possibility that PTH secretion is acutely regulated not only by adjustments in extracellular Ca2+o but also by physiological changes in amino acid concentration. We have tested and confirmed this hypothesis in the current study on normal human parathyroid cells. The data indicate that l-amino acids and plasma-like mixtures of l-amino acids allosterically activate endogenous parathyroid CaRs contributing to the control of intracellular signaling pathways and PTH secretion. In the presence of physiological concentrations of extracellular Ca2+, l-amino acids (also at physiological concentrations) stereoselectively activated Ca2+ mobilization and inhibited PTH secretion. The data support the view that fluctuations in serum amino acid levels acting via the CaR acutely regulate PTH secretion and thus whole body calcium metabolism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOrigin of Tissue and Preparation of Human Parathyroid Cells— Samples of normal human parathyroid transplants were obtained at neck surgery at the Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Leonards, New South Wales, Australia and the Mater Private Hospital, North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia under guidelines established by the relevant institutional ethics committees. The parathyroid tissue, typically taking the form of a single 1–1.5-mm diameter “chip”, was transported to the laboratory in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing CaCl2 1.25 mm. It was either used immediately or stored overnight at 4 °C in MEM (number 11380-037, Invitrogen). The tissue was then transferred into 10 ml of MEM that contained 1 mg/ml collagenase (type I, Worthington, Scimar, Victoria) and 0.2 mg/ml DNase I (type IV, Sigma). The composition of the MEM formulation was as follows: NaCl 137 mm, KCl 5.4 mm, NaHCO3 4.2 mm, CaCl2 1.2 mm; MgSO4 0.81 mm; Na2HPO4 0.34 mm, KH2PO4 0.44 mm, d-glucose 1 g/liter, Phenol Red 10 mg/liter, MEM amino acids, and vitamins. Collagenase was stored at –80 °C and brought out for weighing on ice or dry ice. The suspension was briefly oxygenated and then incubated at 37 °C. After 20 min, the enzyme solution was decanted and the parathyroid tissue was transferred into 5 ml of MEM that contained 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (protease-free, Sigma A-3059). The tissue was then triturated by repeated passage (10–15 times) through the tip of a disposable 5-ml syringe (no needle attached). The cloudy suspension containing clumps of parathyroid cells was passed through a 200-μm pore-size nylon filter and then sedimented (Sorvall H-1000B rotor, 100 × g, 2 min). The cell pellet was gently resuspended and washed twice in 5 ml of bovine serum albumin-containing MEM (Invitrogen, 11575-032). It was finally resuspended in bovine serum albumin-containing MEM. The remaining pieces of undigested parathyroid tissue were returned to medium containing collagenase and DNase I and incubated for a further 20 min at 37 °C. The enzyme solution was then decanted, and the parathyroid tissue subjected to trituration and centrifugal isolation as above. In general, the second cell harvest was used for analyses of cell function because of greater cell yields; however, the first and second cell harvests were also frequently combined.Amino Acid Solutions—Stock amino acid-containing solutions were routinely made up in physiological saline at 100 or 200 mm with the exception of tryptophan (50 mm because of poor solubility). The amino acid composition of the 1× basal amino acid solution that emulated fasting human amino acids (all l-isomers in physiological saline solution, pH 7.4) was as follows (in μm): 50 Phe, 50 Trp, 80 His, 60 Tyr, 300 Ala, 200 Thr, 30 Cys, 50 Asn, 600 Gln, 125 Ser, 30 Glu, 250 Gly, 180 Pro, 250 Val, 30 Met, 10 Asp, 200 Lys, 100 Arg, 75 Ile, and 150 Leu. Stocks of this basal amino acid solution (40-fold concentrated in amino acids) were made up in physiological saline solution and stored at –20 °C. They were thawed and diluted in amino acid-free physiological saline as required. The control physiological saline used in all microfluorimetry experiments had the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 0.2 or 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH), 0.1% d-glucose, pH 7.4.Microfluorimetry for Determining Cytoplasmic Ca2+Concentration— Parathyroid cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (1 μm, 20 min, 37 °C) in physiological saline solution containing bovine serum albumin 1 mg/ml. The cells were then sedimented (Sorvall H-1000B rotor, 100 × g, 2 min) and resuspended in albumin-free physiological saline solution. Fura-2/AM-loaded cells were transferred into a superfusion chamber and placed in the light path of a Nikon Diaphot microscope as described previously (8Bradbury R.A. McCall M.N. Brown M.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Excitation was performed at alternating wavelengths (340 and 380 nm). The fluorescent light (F, peak 510 nm) was detected by a photomultiplier, and its digitized recording was achieved using Acknowledge software for Macintosh. The control superfusion solution had the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 0.2 or 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH), 0.1% d-glucose, pH 7.4. Data for cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations were expressed either as uncorrected excitation ratios (F340/F380) or converted to ionized Ca2+ concentration using a calibration procedure (8Bradbury R.A. McCall M.N. Brown M.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Determination of PTH Secretion—Perifusion of normal human parathyroid cells was undertaken in low molecular mass (4–5 kDa) cut-off gel filtration media so that intact PTH (∼9 kDa) would appear in the void volume. Gel filtration media were pre-equilibrated with physiological saline that contained 1× basal amino acid mixture and 1 mg/ml bovine albumin (protease-free, Sigma A-3905). 20,000–50,000 cells were loaded onto the surface of a 1-ml bed volume of Bio-Gel P-4 (nominal exclusion limit 4 kDa) and then gently covered with a 1-ml bed volume of Sephadex G-25 (medium, nominal exclusion limit 5 kDa) in a small perifusion column. After tubing connections were established downstream to a peristaltic pump and upstream to a reservoir, the column was suspended in a water bath (37 °C) and perifused at 1.5 ml/min with 37 °C equilibrated control physiological saline, 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH, pH 7.4), 0.1% d-glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine albumin, 1× basal amino acid mixture. Prior to starting all experiments, the columns were perifused for a 20-min control period. Routinely, 2-min (i.e. 3-ml) samples were collected into tubes immersed in an ice bath, and the tubes were transferred to dry ice upon completion of each collection period. As required, solutions were changed to permit variations in extracellular calcium or amino acid concentration. All samples were stored at –80 °C until the analysis of intact human PTH using an Immulite 2000 autoanalyzer (Diagnostic Products Corporation, CA).Statistical Analysis and Curve Fitting—The Ca2+ mobilization data were expressed as concentration-response curves and fitted to the following form of the Hill equation, R = b + (a – b)* Cn/(en + Cn), where R = fractional response, a = maximum fractional response, b = basal fractional response, C = extracellular Ca2+ concentration (in mm), e = EC50 (the concentration of Ca2+ that induced a half-maximal response), and n = Hill coefficient.The PTH secretion data were fitted to the following equation, S = a – (a – b)*Cn/(in + Cn) where S = secretory response, a = maximum response, b = basal response, C = extracellular Ca2+ concentration (in mm), i = IC50 (the Ca2+o concentration that yielded half-maximal inhibition of secretion), and n = Hill coefficient. The first of three or more data points, corresponding to a short equilibration period, was routinely ignored when calculating the mean secretion rate for any given treatment.Estimates of the curve-fitting parameters and their standard errors were obtained using MacCurveFit 1.5 for Macintosh. Differences between the parameter values obtained from concentration-response curves were tested for statistical significance using the F-test as described in Ref. 9Meddings J.B. Scott R.B. Fick G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G982-G989PubMed Google Scholar. Differences in PTH secretion rates were tested for statistical significance using the paired or unpaired t tests. Other data are routinely expressed as means ± S.E. (number of experiments).RESULTSEffects of Individual Amino Acids on Cytoplasmic Free Ca2+Concentration and Sensitivity to Ca2+o—Exposure of fura-2/AM-loaded normal human parathyroid cells to active amino acids including l-Phe (0.1–10 mm) at an extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) below 0.2 mm had no effect on cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i (not shown). However, at [Ca2+]o ≥ 0.2 mm, l-Phe (0.1–10 mm) acutely elevated [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A), and similar effects were observed with l-Trp (Fig. 1B), l-His, and l-Ala (not shown) but not l-Ile, l-Leu (Fig. 1B), or l-Arg (not shown). CaR-active amino acids exhibited similar effects in the presence of the polycationic CaR agonist, spermine (not shown). The effects of amino acids on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization were stereoselective i.e.l-amino acids were much more effective than d-amino acids (Fig. 1). In addition, the effects of l-amino acids were concentration-dependent (Table I, Fig. 2). At a Ca2+o concentration of 2.0 mm, the apparent EC50s for l-Trp, l-Phe, l-His, and l-Ala were 0.04 ± 0.01 mm, 0.06 ± 0.01 mm, 0.1 ± 0.01 mm, and 0.41 ± 0.02 mm, respectively, and the order of potency was l-Trp = l-Phe > l-His > l-Ala > l-Glu > l-Leu = l-Arg (Table I). Individual l-amino acids were also effective at lower extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (1.5 and 1.0 mm); however, the EC50 values increased progressively, and the amino acid-induced maximum responses fell progressively as the Ca2+ concentration fell (Fig. 2, C and D, Table I). An appreciation of the physiological significance of these effects can be gained by dividing the fasting plasma concentration of an amino acid by its EC50 value (conc/EC50). At 2.0 mm Ca2+o, four of the seven amino acids tested, l-Trp, l-Phe, l-His, and l-Ala all exhibited conc/EC50 ratios close to 1.0. At 1.5 and 1.0 mm Ca2+o, the apparent effectiveness of these individual amino acids fell progressively (Table I). Between 1.0 and 1.5 mm Ca2+o, encompassing the normal physiological range, the data indicate that physiologically significant modulation of the CaR could only arise if multiple CaR-active amino acids acted together in concert.Table IEC50data for effects of various l-amino acids in fura-2/AM-loaded normal human parathyroid cellsAmino acidCa2+ = 1.0 mmCa2+ = 1.5 mmCa2+ = 2.0 mml-Trp0.30 ± 0.08 (0.17)0.13 ± 0.02 (0.38)0.04 ± 0.01 (1.25)l-Phe0.69 ± 0.17 (0.07)0.12 ± 0.02 (0.42)0.06 ± 0.01 (0.83)l-His1.2 ± 0.6 (0.07)0.28 ± 0.02 (0.29)0.10 ± 0.01 (0.80)l-Ala5.4 ± 0.1 (0.06)0.81 ± 0.1 (0.37)0.41 ± 0.02 (0.73)l-Glu2.7 ± 0.2 (0.01)1.8 ± 0.1 (0.02)0.71 ± 0.04 (0.04)l-LeuNRaNR, no response up to an amino acid concentration of 10 mm.NR1.4 ± 0.2 (0.11)l-ArgNRNR2.7 ± 0.3 (0.04)a NR, no response up to an amino acid concentration of 10 mm.

In the absence of amino acids, the apparent EC50 for Ca2+ was 2.6 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4); in the presence of 3 mm l-Phe, the concentration response was markedly left-shifted, and the apparent EC50 for Ca2+ was 1.5 ± 0.2 mm (Fig. 3, n = 4). F-test analysis confirmed that the difference was statistically significant (F [1,28] = 30.5, p < 0.001). In addition, l-Phe induced an increase in the maximum response as determined by curve-fitting the cumulative fluorescence ratio data. In the absence of l-Phe, the maximum response was 1.08 ± 0.05, in the presence of 3 mm l-Phe, the maximum response was 1.33 ± 0.08 (F [1,28] = 18.7, p < 0.01). However, l-Phe had no effect on the basal fluorescence ratio at an extracellular Ca2+ of 0.2 mm (F [1,28] = 1.95, p > 0.1). Similar findings were obtained using another CaR-active amino acid, l-Ala, and l-Phe also left-shifted the concentration response curve for spermine (not shown).Fig. 3Effect of l-Phe on extracellular Ca2+ sensitivity in normal human parathyroid cells.

Plasma-like amino acid mixtures activated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in a -fold concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A) and markedly left-shifted the Ca2+o sensitivity of the fura-2/AM-loaded normal human parathyroid cells (Fig. 4, B and C). In the absence of amino acids, the EC50 for Ca2+ was 2.6 ± 0.2 mm (n = 8). In the presence of a fasting plasma-like l-amino acid mixture (total amino acid concentration, 2.8 mm), the EC50 for Ca2+ was 1.6 ± 0.1 mm (n = 4, F [1,28] = 78, p < 0.001). As the -fold concentration was increased from 0.5 to 2×, encompassing the range normally described between protein restriction and high dietary protein intake in humans, respectively, a small apparent decrease in the EC50 for Ca2+o and an increase in the maximum response were observed. Under these conditions, the EC50 for Ca2+o dropped from 1.7 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4) to 1.6 ± 0.1 mm (n = 4), and the maximum response, in the form of a cumulative fluorescence ratio measured from baseline, increased from 0.62 ± 0.04 (n = 4) to 0.69 ± 0.04 (n = 4, Table II). To further evaluate whether receptor response is sensitive to physiologically relevant variations in amino acid concentration, the data were replotted as a function of -fold concentration (Fig. 4D). A threshold for the amino acid-dependent responses was observed at a Ca2+o of ∼0.5 mm. At both 1.0 and 1.5 mm Ca2+o, i.e. either side of the normal range (1.1–1.3 mm), the receptor response increased as the -fold concentration rose above 0.5× (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Impact of various -fold concentrations of a plasma-like amino acid mixture on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and extracellular Ca2+ sensitivity.

Under these conditions, the apparent IC50 for the effect of extracellular Ca2+ on the secretion of intact PTH was 1.12 ± 0.02 mm (n = 7). In addition, an increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 0.9 to 1.4 mm induced a maximal suppression of intact PTH secretion of 84 ± 7% (n = 7). The addition of l-Phe (3 mm) or l-Trp (3 mm) acutely and reversibly suppressed PTH secretion rates at Ca2+ concentrations between 0.8 and 1.5 mm (Fig. 5A, l-Phe) and 0.9 and 1.4 mm (Fig. 5B, l-Trp). In the presence of 3 mm l-Phe, the IC50 value for extracellular Ca2+ concentration fell from 1.13 ± 0.02 to 1.03 ± 0.04 mm. A similar left-shift in the concentration-response curve was observed for l-Trp (Fig. 5, B and C, n = 3). Upon return to the control physiological saline solution containing the 1× amino acid mixture, the IC50 values returned to control levels (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, 3 mm l-Phe or l-Trp induced small drops in intact PTH secretion rates at high Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 5C). For example, the PTH secretion rate (in fg min–1 cell–1, n = 4) at the high Ca2+ concentration plateau fell from 0.40 ± 0.08 to 0.30 ± 0.12 in the presence of 3 mm l-Phe and recovered to 0.51 ± 0.08 upon return to the control solution (F [1,32] = 7.2, p = 0.01). However, the CaR-active amino acids appeared to have no effect on the low Ca2+o concentration plateau. Prior to l-Phe, for example, the low Ca2+ concentration plateau secretory rate (in fg min–1 cell–1, n = 4) was 1.95 ± 0.08, in the presence of 3 mm l-Phe, it was 1.68 ± 0.22, and upon return to the control solution, it was 1.65 ± 0.08. Statistical testing of the data in the l-Phe series using the paired t test confirmed that the observed differences were significant at all Ca2+o concentrations between 0.9 and 1.5 mm (for 0.9 mm, p = 0.002; for 1.0 mm, p = 0.0001; for 1.1 mm, p = 0.0005; for 1.2 mm, p = 0.002; for 1.3 mm, p = 0.005; for 1.4 mm, p = 0.0001; and for 1.5 mm, p = 0.03). Similar results were obtained upon statistical analysis of the data in the l-Trp series.Fig. 5Impact of elevated levels of l-Phe and l-Trp on PTH secretion from perifused parathyroid cells. Normal human parathyroid cells were perifused with physiological saline solution containing the 1× l-amino acid mixture and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. The data in A and B are representative experiments showing acute responses to various concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ in the absence or presence of 3 mm l-Phe or 3 mm l-Trp, respectively. The data in C were derived from four l-Phe experiments and three l-Trp experiments. The experimental series in A and B were undertaken separately and exhibited an ∼2-fold difference in the maximum secretion rate when corrected for cell number. Accordingly, the PTH secretion data in C were normalized to the percent of maximum. The symbols are as follows, open circles, pre- and post-controls in cells exposed to l-Phe; open triangles, pre- and post-controls in cells exposed to l-Trp; closed circles, l-Phe; and closed triangles, l-Trp. The control physiological saline solution contained the 1× amino acid mixture as well as bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effects of various individual amino acids were evaluated in cells exposed to a physiologically significant drop in extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 1.2 to 1.1 mm in the presence of the 1x amino acid mixture (Fig. 6, A and B, Table III). Reducing Ca2+o concentration in this manner resulted in a prompt 2-fold increase in intact PTH secretion. Exposure of cells to various amino acids (all 1.0 mm) under these conditions resulted in a rapid and reversible suppression of PTH secretion in the cases of the CaR-active amino acids l-Phe, l-Trp, l-His, and l-Ala. These effects were stereoselective. Furthermore, the CaR-inactive amino acids l-Arg and l-Leu had no effect (Fig. 6, A and B, Table III).Fig. 6Impact of various amino acids and impact of an increase in the -fold concentration of the plasma-like amino acid mixture on PTH secretion.

In AD, there is a selective decrease in the numbers of radioligand binding sites corresponding to the most abundant nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype, which contains human α4 and β2 subunits (hα4β2-nAChR). However, the relationships between these phenomena are uncertain, and effects of Aβ on hα4β2-nAChR function have not been investigated in detail. We first confirmed expression of hα4 and hβ2 subunits as messenger RNA in transfected, human SHEP1 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Immunoprecipitation Western analyses confirmed α4 and β2 subunit protein expression and co-assembly. Whole cell current recording demonstrated heterologous expression in SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells of functional hα4β2-nAChRs with characteristic responses to nicotinic agonists or antagonists. Nicotine-induced whole cell currents were suppressed by Aβ1-42 in a dose-dependent manner. Functional inhibition was selective for Aβ1-42 compared with the functionally inactive, control peptide Aβ40-1.Aβ1-42-mediated inhibition of hα4β2-nAChR function was non-competitive, voltage-independent, and use-independent. Pre-loading of cells with guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate failed to prevent Aβ1-42-induced inhibition, suggesting that down-regulation of hα4β2-nAChR function by Aβ1-42 is not mediated by nAChR internalization. Sensitivity to Aβ1-42 antagonism at 1 nm was evident for hα4β2-nAChRs, but not for heterologously expressed human α7-nAChRs, although both nAChR subtypes were functionally inhibited by 100 nm Aβ1-42, with the magnitude of functional block being higher for 100 nm Aβ1-42 acting on hα7-nAChRs. These findings suggest that hα4β2-nAChRs are sensitive and perhaps pathophysiologically relevant targets for Aβ neurotoxicity in AD.

Pathophysiological hallmarks of AD include extracellular deposits of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in senile plaques, formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, and cholinergic neuron death (1Prince D.L. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 479-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of AD pathogenesis are only partially understood, it is now widely accepted that the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ1-42 plays a key role in the disease (2Selkoe D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 924: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Evidence has indicated an interaction between Aβ and the cholinergic system (3Auld D.S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 43-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For example, very low concentrations (pico to nanomolar) of Aβ can directly induce cholinergic hypofunction (4Kar S. Seto D. Gaudreau P. Quirion R. J.

Recent evidence suggests possible roles for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as central targets for Aβ-induced neurotoxicity manifest as cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive impairment. First, in the brain of AD patients, there is a marked decrease in the numbers of nAChR radioligand binding sites (12Paterson D. Noreberg A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 75-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), particularly those that have the highest affinity for nicotine and appear to be the most abundant nAChR subtype in the brain of vertebrates (13Warpman U. Nordberg A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2419-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Martin-Ruiz C.M. Court J.A. Molnar E. Lee M. Gotti C. Mamalaki A. Tsouloufis T. Tzartos S. Ballard C.

Immunoassays show that these nAChRs contain α4 and β2 subunits (17Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 18Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Second, nAChR α4 and β2 subunit immunoreactivity is localized in AD brain to Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (19Sparks D.L. Beach T. Lukas R.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Third, interactions have been reported of Aβ1-42 with radioligand binding sites on another abundant nAChR subtype found in the vertebrate brain containing α7 subunits (α7-nAChR; picomolar affinity) and on presumed α4β2-nAChR subtypes (nanomolar affinity) (20Wang H.Y.

Shank R.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Direct inhibition to some extent of α7-nAChR function by Aβ has been demonstrated in whole cell current and excised membrane patch single channel recordings from interneurons in rat hippocampal slices (22Pettit D.L. Shao Z. Yakel J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar), in whole cell studies using rat hippocampal cultured neurons (23Liu Q-S. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and in whole cell recordings from Xenopus oocytes containing heterologously expressed rat or human α7-nAChRs (24Tozaki H. Matsumoto A. Kanno T. Nagai K. Yamamoto S. Nishizaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 42-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Grassi F. Palma E. Tonini R. Amici M. Ballivet V. Eusebi F. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although one report describes that picomolar concentrations of Aβ directly activated whole cell current responses of Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing rat α7-nAChRs (26Dineley K.T. Bell K. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25056-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fourth, it is well known that nAChRs participate in cognitive functions, including learning and memory (16Rezvani A.H. Levin E.D. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 258-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), which are compromised in animals lacking α4 or β2 subunits (27Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Lena C.

Thus, nAChR agonists, antagonists, and modulators have received attention as potentially novel agents for therapeutic use in AD (29Newhouse P.A. Potter A. Kelton M. Corwin J. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 268-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Maelicke A. Samochocki M. Fehrenbacher A. Ludwig J. Albuquerque E.X. Zerlin M. Biol.

However, surprisingly little attention has been given to the possible functional effects of Aβ on the function of human (h) α4β2-nAChRs. To fill this gap in knowledge, we employed patch clamp techniques to elucidate the acute effects of Aβ1-42, control peptide, or related peptides on the function of hα4β2-nAChRs heterologously expressed in the SH-EP1 cell line. Heterologously Expressed hα4β2-nAChRs in SH-EP1 Cells—Human α4 and β2 subunits (kindly provided by Dr. Ortrud Steinlein, Institute for Human Genetics, Rheinische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Bonn, Germany) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1-zeocin and pcDNA3.1-hygromycin vectors, respectively, and transfected using established techniques (32Puchacz E. Buisson B. Bertrand D. Lukas R.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Peng J.-H. Lucero L. Fryer J. Herl J. Leonard S.S. Lukas R.J.

Neurosci. 1993; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) to create the SH-EP1-hα4β2 cell line. For this and all other methods, manipulations were conducted at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C) unless otherwise noted. Briefly, 3 million SH-EP1 cells in 0.5 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 87 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaHPO4, 6 mm dextrose, pH 7.05, in an electroporation cuvette were mixed with 100 μg of α4 and β2 subunit cDNA constructs. Samples were subjected to electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar model 1652076) at 960 microfarads and 200 volts. After electroporation, cells were suspended to 5 ml in complete medium (36Bencherif M. Lukas R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 852-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and 1-ml aliquots were added to 12-ml aliquots of medium in each of five 100-mm dishes before returning the cells to an incubator at 37 °C. 48 h later, positive selection of incubated cells was initiated by supplementing the medium with 0.25 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) and 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). Colonies of surviving cells were picked by ring cloning and expanded before being screened for radioligand binding and functional evidence for α4β2-nAChR expression, which led to selection of the clone designated as the SH-EP1-hα4β2 cell line. Cells were maintained as low passage in medium with 0.25 mg/ml zeocin and 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin to ensure stable expression of phenotype and passaged once weekly by splitting just-confluent cultures 1/10 to maintain cells in proliferative growth. Studies also were done using another cell line transfected with the human α4 subunit cDNA and a chimeric β2 subunit cDNA encoding nAChR β2 subunit sequences, except for cytoplasmic loop amino acids sequence Lys336-Ser448, which was replaced by amino acids Arg347-Ala448 from the murine serotonin receptor 5-TH3A subunit sequence via a process described in detail elsewhere (37Kuo Y.-P. Wu J. Zhao L. Xu L. Lukas R.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 2002; 28: 537.13Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the cells growing at ∼80% confluency in a 100-mm culture dish using 2 ml of TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen). Prior to RT-PCR, RNA preparations were treated with amplification-grade RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) to remove residual genomic DNA contamination. Typically, 1 μg of RNA was incubated with 1 unit of DNase I in a 10 μl-reaction at room temperature for 15 min, and the DNase I was subsequently inactivated by addition of 1 μl of 25 mm EDTA and incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. RT was carried out using 0.8 μg of DNA-free total RNA and oligo(dT)12-18 primer in a 20-μl reaction using the Superscript II™ Preamplification system (Invitrogen). At the end of the RT reaction, reverse transcriptase was deactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 10 min, and RNAs were removed by adding 1 unit of RNase H followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. A typical PCR was performed using 2 μl of cDNA preparation, 1 μl of 10 μm each of 5′ and 3′ gene-specific primers, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of RedTaq™ (Sigma) in a 50-μl reaction. The primers used in the amplification stage were designed and synthesized based on published gene sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers: α4, L35901; β2, X53179; GAPDH, M32599). The primer sequences and their predicted product sizes are: nAChR, α4 subunit sense 5′-gaatgtcacctccatccgcatc-3′, α4 antisense 5′-ccggca(a/g)ttgtc(c/t)ttgaccac-3′ (product size 790 bp); nAChR, β2 subunit sense 5′-cggctcccttccaaacaca-3′, β2 antisense 5′-gcaatgatggcgtggctgctgca-3′ (product size 754 bp); GAPDH, sense 5′-cgtattgggcgcctggtcaccag-3′, GAPDH antisense 5′-gtccttgcccacagccttggcagc-3′ (product size 624 bp). Amplification reactions were carried out in a RoboCycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 35 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 90 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, followed by an additional 4-min extension at 72 °C. One-tenth of each RT-PCR product was then resolved on a 1% agarose gel before ethidium staining was used to visualize bands under ultraviolet illumination. In Situ Hybridization for Cell-specific Localization of α4 or β2 Subunit Message—Riboprobes corresponding to nucleotide sequences coding for large segments of the α4 or β2 subunit large cytoplasmic domains were prepared from in vitro transcription and used for in situ hybridization. For riboprobe preparation, 354- (for the α4 subunit) or 211-bp (for the β2 subunit) partial cDNA fragments were amplified from human nAChR α4 and β2 subunit cDNA constructs using the following two sets of PCR primers: α4 sense 5′-gcacccgccctcaccgtccttc-3′ and α4 antisense 5′-tcagccgagtgggtgttgcgagag-3′; β2 sense 5′-catcattgcgcccgtcagcg-3′ and β2 antisense 5′-gccacagccacacggctccc-3′. These α4 and β2 subunit cytoplasmic domain templates were then gel purified and non-directionally ligated to a T7 phage promoter adapter (Lig'n Scribe, Ambion, Austin, TX). Subsequent PCRs using sense or antisense gene-specific primers in conjunction with Lig'n Scribe adapter primers were then performed to selectively amplify ligation products of in vitro transcription templates in antisense or sense orientation. Sense or antisense partial α4/β2 RNAs were separately transcribed from the PCR-derived template in the presence of biotinylated UTPs using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription system (Ambion), and the quality and quantity of the riboprobes were evaluated using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric reading, respectively. For cell sample preparation, confluent SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium, seeded on Lab Tek II CC2 chambered slides at a target density of ∼50,000 cells/chamber, and allowed to grow at 37 °C to achieve proper morphology and optimal confluence (∼90%). After ∼2 days, cells were then briefly rinsed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed again in 1× PBS for 5 min, and acetylated, delipidated with chloroform, and serially dehydrated with ethanol (50, 75, 85, and 95%) at 23 ± 1 °C. Samples were then incubated in pre-hybridization solution containing final concentrations of 250 μg/ml tRNA, 25% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 0.05 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 4× SSCP, 4 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 50 °C before being incubated in hybridization solution containing antisense or sense probes (final concentration ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 ng/μl) for 20 h at 50 °C. After hybridization, samples were rinsed in 2× SSC twice for 5 min each, 1× SSC for 10 min, 0.5× SSC for 10 min at 23 ± 1 °C, 0.1× SSC for 20 min at 60 °C, and briefly rinsed in double distilled water at 23 ± 1 °C. Samples were then dehydrated again in a graded ethanol series and vacuum dried under desiccant. Dry samples were then rehydrated by rinsing in 1× PBS for 5 min before submersion in a 1:2000 dilution (in 1× PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) of avidin-Alexa fluorophore complexes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min. To terminate the reaction, samples were rinsed 3 times in 1× PBS for 15 min each, again at 23 ± 1 °C. Slides were then coverslipped and stored at 4 °C in the dark until being subjected to fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70, Melville, NY) and image analysis using ImagePro Plus version 4.1 (Silver Spring, MD). Immunoprecipitation-Western Analysis for Confirmation of α4 and β2 Subunit Assembly—Preparation of non-ionic detergent-solubilized membranes for immunoprecipitation began with medium removal from 100-mm dishes containing plated cells, rinsing of dishes 3 times with NP buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4), mechanical harvesting of cells using a rubber policeman, and centrifugation of healthy, confluent cells from the suspension for 5 min at 1,000 × g. The cell pellets were then resuspended and homogenized in ice-cold NP buffer (200 μl/confluent plate) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (1 Mini tablet per 10 ml; Roche Diagnostics), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was then discarded and the pellet resuspended in TNP buffer (NP buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100; 200 μl per ml of starting suspension; supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture) by incubating at room temperature for 30 min. The preparation was then centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction containing the solubilized membrane protein was then collected, and separate samples were reacted overnight at 4 °C with either H133 (rabbit anti-nAChR α4 subunit) or H92 (rabbit anti-nAChR β2 subunit) antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 5 μg/1 mg of solubilized total membrane protein) in the presence of protein G-agarose beads (50 μl; Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitants were collected by centrifugation, and the beads containing immune complexes were washed 3 times in TNP buffer before being resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (20 μl per sample; ICN Biomedicals), heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged briefly to remove the stripped agarose beads. The now-resolubilized protein samples were then collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE separation on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western analysis. Membranes were then blocked by PBS buffer containing 5% skim milk powder and incubated with primary monoclonal antibody 299 (rat anti-nAChR α4; 1:1000; Sigma) and pAb s-1724 (rabbit anti-nAChR β2; 1:50; a gift from Dr. J. Patrick, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) for 1 h. After three 5-min washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rat IgG (sc-2006) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2313) antibodies (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the reaction medium to allow conjugation with subunit-primary antibody targets. The horseradish peroxidase:second antibody-labeled bands were then visualized by using enhanced substrate Opti-4CN (Bio-Rad). Earlier control studies had demonstrated that there was no cross-reactivity on the nitrocellullose membranes between monoclonal antibody 299 and β2 subunits, between pAb s-1724 and α4 subunits, between secondary antibodies and nAChR subunits, or between goat anti-rat IgG antibody and any residual rabbit antibodies in immunoprecipitates (although cross-reactivity between donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit antibodies carried over from immunoprecipitations was sometimes observed), ensuring that nAChR α4 and β2 subunits could be identified on the same Western blot when probed with both subunit-specific antibodies and both species-specific anti-IgG. Patch Clamp Whole Cell Current Recordings—Conventional whole cell current recording, coupled with techniques for fast application and removal of drugs (U-tube), was applied in this study as previously described (38Wu J. Harata N. Akaike N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Wu J. Chan P. Schroeder K.M. Ellsworth K. Partridge L.D. J.

Ther. 2003; 305: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on poly-lysine-coated 35-mm culture dishes were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus iX7, Lake Success, NY) and continuously superfused with standard external solution (2 ml/min). Glass microelectrodes (3-5 MΩ resistance between pipette and extracellular solutions) were used to form tight seals (>2 GΩ) on the cell surface until suction was applied to convert to conventional whole cell recording. Cells were then voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV, and ion currents in response to application of ligands were measured (Axon Instruments 200B amplifier, Foster City, CA), typically using data filtered at 2 kHz, acquired at 5 kHz, displayed and digitized on-line (Axon Instruments Digidata 1200 series A/D board), and stored on hard media for subsequent off-line analysis. Both pipette and whole cell current capacitance were minimized, and the series resistance was routinely compensated to 80%. Before series resistance compensation, whole cell access resistance less than 20 mΩ was accepted. Data acquisition and analyses were done using Pclamp8.0 (Axon Instruments), and results were plotted using Origin 5.0 (Microcal, North Hampton, MA). nAChR acute desensitization (the decline in inward current amplitude over the course of agonist application) was analyzed for decay half-time (τ; τ = 0.693/k for decay rate constant k), peak current (Ip), and steady-state current (Is), using fits to the mono- (or double-) exponential expression I = [(Ip - Is) e-kt] + Is (or I = [(Ip - Ii) e-k1t] + [(Ii - Is) e-k2t] + Is, where Ii is the intermediate level of current and k1 and k2 are rate constants from the two separate decay processes). Curve fitting usually was done using data between 90 and 10% of the difference between peak and steady-state currents. The experimental data are presented as mean ± S.E., and comparisons of different conditions were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t tests. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C). Dose-response profiles were fit to the Hill equation and analyzed using Origin 5.0. Solutions and Drug Application—The standard external solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. For conventional whole cell recordings, “Tris+ electrodes” were used to prevent receptor functional run-down (37Kuo Y.-P. Wu J. Zhao L. Xu L. Lukas R.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 2002; 28: 537.13Google Scholar, 40Zhao L. Kuo Y.P. George A.A. Peng J.H. Purandare M.S. Schroeder K.M. Lukas R.J. Wu J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and were filled with solution containing 110 mm Tris phosphate dibasic, 28 mm Tris base, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 4 mm Na-ATP, pH 7.3 (41Huguenard J.G. Prince D.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 12: 3804-3817Crossref Google Scholar). To initiate whole cell current responses, nicotinic agonists were delivered into the bath medium near the cell being recorded via a computer-controlled U-tube system so that solution exchange occurred within 20 ms (based on 10-90% peak current rise times). Intervals between drug applications (3 min) were adjusted specifically to ensure stability of nAChR responsiveness (without functional rundown). Drugs used in the present study were (-) nicotine, dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE), Aβ40-1 (Sigma), and Aβ1-42 (rPeptide, Athens, GA). Aβ peptides were reconstituted per vendor specifications in distilled water to a concentration of 100 μm, stored at -20 °C, and used within 10 days of reconstitution. Thawed peptide solutions and working dilutions in standard extracellular solution were used within 4 h before being discarded. Heterologously Expressed hα4β2-nAChRs in SH-EP1 Cells—RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of nAChR α4 and β2 subunit messages in SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells (Fig. 1A; α4β2). By contrast, whereas there was successful amplification of GAPDH message (positive control, lane c), no significant α4- or β2-specific product was observed in the host cell line (wild-type SH-EP1 cells). Results of in situ hybridization studies consistently found an absence of staining for nAChR α4 or β2 subunit messages reacting with sense or antisense riboprobes in untransfected SH-EP1 host cells (data not shown) or reacting with sense riboprobes in SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells (Fig. 1B, a and b). However, for reactions employing antisense riboprobes, nearly all SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells displayed strong perinuclear and cytoplasmic hybridization signals for both α4 and β2 subunits (Fig. 1, B, a′ and b′), respectively. Furthermore, apparent levels of α4 or β2 subunit transcripts did not seem to fluctuate as a function of cell confluence or between grouped or solitary cells (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation-Western analyses using solubilized membrane samples from transfected SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells clearly indicated that α4 and β2 subunits are expressed as protein and assembled together (Fig. 1C). Finally, screening using whole cell current recordings confirmed that functional responses to 1 μm nicotine are evident in transfected SH-EP1-hα4β2 cells, but not in untransfected, wild-type SHEP1 cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that transfected cells express functional hα4β2-nAChRs. Basic Functional Properties of Transfected hα4β2-nAChRs—Whole cell current responses of heterologously expressed hα4β2-nAChRs show nicotine and acetylcholine (ACh) dose dependence (Fig. 2A) that translates into a sigmoid dose-response relationship characterized by a functional EC50 value for nicotine of 3.2 μm (Hill coefficient of 0.81) and for ACh of 9.2 μm (Hill coefficient of 0.6; Fig. 2B)."

TRPV1 is activated by noxious heat, acid, and alkaloid irritants as well as several endogenous ligands and is sensitized by inflammatory factors, thereby serving important functions in detecting noxious stimuli in the sensory system and pathological states in different parts of the body. Whereas numerous studies have been carried out using the rat and human TRPV1 cDNA, the mouse TRPV1 cDNA has not been characterized. Here, we report molecular cloning of two TRPV1 cDNA variants from dorsal root ganglia of C57BL/6 mice. The deduced proteins are designated TRPV1α and TRPV1β and contain 839 and 829 amino acids, respectively. TRPV1β arises from an alternative intron recognition signal within exon 7 of the trpv1 gene. We found a predominant expression of TRPV1α in many tissues and significant expression of TRPV1β in dorsal root ganglia, skin, stomach, and tongue. When expressed in HEK 293 cells or Xenopus oocytes, TRPV1α formed a Ca2+-permeable channel activated by ligands known to stimulate TRPV1. TRPV1β was not functional by itself but its co-expression inhibited the function of TRPV1α. Furthermore, although both isoforms were synthesized at a similar rate, less TRPV1β than TRPV1α protein was found in cells and on the cell surface, indicating that the β isoform is highly unstable. Our data suggest that TRPV1β is a naturally occurring dominant-negative regulator of the responses of sensory neurons to noxious stimuli.

The temperature-sensing TRP channels consist of at least 6 members with temperature thresholds ranging from as low as <17 °C for extreme cold to >53 °C for extreme heat (reviewed in Refs. 6Jordt S.E.

Among them, TRPV1 has received a great deal of attention because it was the first cloned channel that responded to pain-producing heat (>43 °C) and acid stimuli and it is the receptor for capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of hot chili pepper (5Caterina M.J.

These functional features and the predominant expression of TRPV1 mRNA in the small diameter neurons of the rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) provide support for TRPV1 as a key player in nociception of primary afferent neurons. Subsequent studies showed that TRPV1 is activated by the endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligand anandamide, N-arachidonyldopamines, and several lipoxygenase products, such as 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (10Smart D.

Indeed, TRPV1 is expressed in non-sensory tissues (15Sanchez J.F. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Detailed studies have established that such signaling steps involved in inflammatory responses as phosphorylation by protein kinase A (16Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S.

Therefore, TRPV1 is a poly-modal detector of both noxious pain stimuli of the mammalian somatosensory system and a mediator of inflammatory pain. Knockout of the trpv1 gene in mice showed severe deficiency of sensory neurons to vanilloid compounds, protons, or heat (>43 °C) and impaired thermal hypersensitivity in response to inflammation (18Caterina M.J.

Nature. 2000; 405: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). However, these studies were done without a characterization of the mouse trpv1 gene. Expression data for TRPV1 in mouse is also lacking. Because mice are commonly used for genetic manipulations, we decided to clone the mouse TRPV1 cDNA and characterize its protein function in heterologous systems. Here we show that at least two splice variants of TRPV1 cDNAs are present in several tissues. One of them, TRPV1α, is equivalent to the widely studied rat and human TRPV1. The other one, TRPV1β, encodes a dominant-negative subunit of the TRPV1 channel. Molecular Cloning of Murine TRPV1α and TRPV1β—DRG from four C57BL/6 mice were dissected, pooled, and placed in 1.2 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) after the animals were sacrificed by cervical dis-articulation followed by decapitation. The DRG were homogenized in the TRIzol solution in a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer and the homogenate was passed through a 20-guage and then a 25-guage syringe needle several times. Total DRG RNA was extracted following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was prepared from 15 μg of the total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences). PCR primers for murine TRPV1 cDNA were designed according to the genomic sequences of the murine trpv1 gene (Celera scaffold: GA_x5J8B7W5FBR:1500001.2000000 and GenBank™ accession number AL663116), which were obtained by BlastN search using the sequence of rat TRPV1 cDNA. Two fragments of murine cDNA were amplified from the first strand DRG cDNA using primer pairs S1, 5′-ATGGAGAAATGGGCTAGCTTAG-3′ and A1, 5′-CTAGGCGATCACCTCCAGCAC-3′ for fragment F1 and S2, 5′-CTGTCCAGGAAGTTCACTGAATG-3′, and A2, 5′-GTGTCCCTCATTTCTCCCCT-3′ for fragment F2 by PCR in 50-μl reactions containing 1× Pfu buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.75, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), 0.2 mm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 0.2 μm each of the sense and antisense primers, 0.25 unit Pfu polymerase, and 1 μl of the first strand cDNA. The reactions were carried out by heating to 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95, 56, and 72 °C each for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were subcloned to pAGA3 vector (GenBank™ accession number AY452085), which was modified from pAGA2 (20Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the polycloning site with the sequence 5′-CCATGGATATCGATGGATCCCGGGTCGACGGTACCTCTAGATAACTAG-3′. The sequences of all PCR clones were determined by the Rightmire DNA Sequencing Facility of the Ohio State University. The full-length murine TRPV1α and TRPV1β were assembled in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pAGA3 vector by joining the EcoRI site contained in the F1 and F2 fragments using standard subcloning techniques. Distribution of TRPV1α and TRPV1β in Mouse Tissues—Total RNA and first strand cDNA were prepared from mouse tissues as described above. The presence of TRPV1α and TRPV1β messengers was determined by PCR using primers: S3, 5′-CTGTCCAGGAAGTTCACTGAATG-3′ and A3, 5′-CTAGTAGAAGATGCGCTTGAC-3′. The quality and amount of cDNA prepared from each tissue were verified by amplification of glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using primers: GS, 5′-TCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ and GA, 5′-CACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGC-3′. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 58 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and 45 s at 95 °C. A 10-min extension at 72 °C was added at the end of the last cycle. Aliquots of the PCR products were subjected to agarose gel (2%) electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Southern blotting was used to distinguish the products of TRPV1α and -β. Full-length cDNA for TRPV1α and -β was cut with BsrGI and included in the agarose gels as positive controls for hybridization conditions of the α- and β-specific probes. DNA from the agarose gel was transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and Southern hybridization was performed in a Hybaid hybridization oven using end-labeled oligonucleotide probes: Pα, 5′-GTGATCGCCTACAGTAGCAG-3′ for TRPV1α, and Pβ, 5′-AGTGCTGGAGAACCGCCACG-3′ for TRPV1β, at55 °C for 2 h. The membranes were washed three times for 15 min each in 0.1% SDS and 2× SSC solution at 55 °C, sealed in plastic bags, and exposed to x-ray film. Expression Constructs and Transfection in HEK 293 Cells—Both full-length TRPV1α and TRPV1β were inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 and the ClaI and XbaI sites of pAGA3. For bicistronic expression with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), the inserts plus a part of the cytomegalovirus promoter were excised from the pcDNA3 vector and subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) at the NdeI and EcoRI sites. For expression of TRPV1α-TRPV1α (αα) or TRPV1β-TRPV1α (βα) concatemers, the stop codon of the TRPV1 cDNA was eliminated by replacing the XhoI/EcoRI fragment coding for its C-terminal end with a PCR fragment that incorporated a sequence 5′-TGTCAACAGCAACAATTG-3′ immediately after the codon for the last amino acid, Lys. The resulting full-length TRPV1α and TRPV1β were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) at the NheI and XhoI sites. The stop codon-removed full-length TRPV1α and TRPV1β were excised from the EGFP fusion constructs using ClaI and SalI and subcloned into a pAGA3 construct that contains the coding sequence for hemagglutinin epitope HA-pAGA3. The resulting plasmids were then cut open with SalI and XbaI and ligated with the unmodified TRPV1α excised from TRPV1α/pcDNA3 using ClaI and XbaI. Both SalI and ClaI sites were filled in by treatment with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to digestion by XbaI. The resulting constructs encode αα and βα concatemers with a short sequence, MYPYDVPDYAMDID, fused to the N-terminal ends and the sequence, CQQQQFCSRAQASNSAVDD, added between the two TRPV1 coding sequences. For the αααα and ααβα concatemers, a non-stopping αα concatemer was first made in HA-pAGA3 using the same strategy as described above with the second TRPV1α generated from TRPV1α-EGFP. This concatemer was then joined with the αα and βα concatemers described above using again the same strategy involving the ligation between the filled SalI and ClaI ends at one side and XbaI at the other side. All concatemers were shuttled back to the pcDNA3 vector using ClaI/XbaI sites. Similar methods were used to make the αββα and αβαβ concatemers. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For biochemical and electrophysiological experiments, cells were seeded in either 60- or 35-mm culture dishes and transfected with the desired DNA constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For intracellular Ca2+ measurements, cells were transfected with the desired DNA constructs in the wells of 96-well plates without pre-seeding using LipofectAMINE 2000. To prevent cell loss from subsequent washing, the wells were treated with 20 μg/ml polyornithine (Mr > 30,000, Sigma) for >15 min and rinsed once with Hank's balanced salt solution without Mg2+ and Ca2+. For each well, the plasmid DNA (25 ng) and LipofectAMINE 2000 (0.4 μl) were mixed in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and added to the well before the addition of 100,000 cells resuspended in 100 μl of the medium without antibiotics. The cells were incubated for 24–28 h without medium change. The transfection efficiency was about 70% as determined using the pEGFP-N1 vector. Intracellular Ca2+Measurements and Whole Cell Recordings of HEK 293 Cells—Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells in 96-well plates were loaded with Fluo4/AM, and intracellular Ca2+ was monitored using a fluid handling integrated fluorescence plate reader, Flex Station (Molecular Devices) as described previously (21Hu H-.Z.

The extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. All experiments were performed at 32 °C.

Denuded, healthy looking oocytes of more than 1 mm in diameter were selected and injected in a volume of 46 nl/cell with a total of 5–20 ng of cRNA for TRPV1α, TRPV1β, αα, or βα concatemers, or TRPV3 either individually or in different combinations. The injected oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 2–5 days in sterile Barth's saline (in mm, 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, 7.5 Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin and 20 μg/ml streptomycin). The solution was changed daily. For electrophysiological recordings of TRPV1 and TRPV3 activities, oocytes were placed in a 50-μl chamber, which was perfused with a bath solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.40. The cell was impaled with two intracellular glass electrodes filled with 3 m KCl (for voltage monitor) and 3 m potassium acetate (for current injection) connected to a CA-1a amplifier (Dagan Co., Minneapolis, MN). The oocytes were clamped at either –80 or –40 mV and currents were continuously recorded using a chart recorder (Astro Med, Inc., West Warwick, RI). The pH 5.0 and 5.5 solutions were made of (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 MES, whereas capsaicin, capsazepine, and ruthenium red were dissolved in the bath solution at the final concentrations and applied to the cells by perfusion. CaCl2 was omitted in some experiments to minimize the Ca2+-dependent channel inactivation and the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– conductance. Immunodetection of TRPV1 in HEK 293 Cells and in Xenopus Oocytes—TRPV1α- and TRPV1β-transfected (0.5 μg of DNA) HEK 293 cells seeded in polyornithine-treated 60-mm dishes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-balanced saline (mm: 136 NaCl, 1.4 KCl, 10 Na2HPO4, 1.7 KH2PO4, pH 8.0) 1 day after transfection and then incubated in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS- LC-biotin (Pierce) on ice for 30 min. For Xenopus oocytes, the biotinylation was performed on 50 oocytes at 19 °C 4 days after cRNA injection. The labeling was then terminated by the addition of 50 mm glycine and cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine on ice. The washed cells were harvested immediately in 0.5 ml (or 1.5 ml for oocytes) of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF). All procedures for streptavidin precipitation were carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots of crude lysates (0.4 ml for HEK cells and 0.5 ml for oocytes) were incubated with agarose beads for 30 min and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube containing streptavidin-agarose beads. After incubation for 120 min, the beads were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min, washed three times with the RIPA buffer, and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (1× = 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8). For Western blotting of biotinylated proteins, one-half of the streptavidin-agarose-precipitated proteins were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and the proteins were detected using anti-TRPV1 (Oncogene) or anti-EGFP antibodies (BD Biosciences). For total proteins, small aliquots (usually 10 μl or otherwise indicated) of crude lysates were subjected to Western blotting. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as previously described (22Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) except that anti-TRPV1 antibody was used. Molecular Cloning of Two Splice Variants of TRPV1—Based on the known cDNA sequences for rat and human TRPV1 and the mouse genomic sequence, we isolated the cDNA for murine TRPV1 by RT-PCR using total RNA prepared from the DRG of C57BL/6 mice. The open reading frame of the murine TRPV1 was predicted to contain 2517 base pairs, coding for a polypep-tide of 839 amino acids. Several clones isolated by the RT-PCR matched exactly the predicted sequence, designated here as TRPV1α (GenBank™ accession number AY452083). However, a subset of clones lacked a 30-nucleotide region at position 1195–1224, coding for a putative TRPV1 variant of 829 amino acids, designated here as TRPV1β (GenBank™ accession number AY452084). A further analysis indicated that the β variant arose from an alternative use of an intron recognition site (gt-) within exon 7 of the trpv1 gene (Fig. 1A). In TRPV1α, this site is part of the “gtg” codon for Val399 and the coding sequence continues to Pro408 before the start of intron 7. In TRPV1β, intron 7 starts 30 nucleotides earlier than the α variant, resulting in the deletion of 10 amino acids corresponding to Val399–Pro408 of the α isoform from the encoded polypeptide. The deleted region is located near the end of the cytoplasmic N terminus, about 25 residues before the start of the transmembrane region (Fig. 1B). To determine the expression patterns of the α and β isoforms of TRPV1, we isolated total RNA from 11 mouse tissues and performed RT-PCR. Primers were chosen to amplify a region encompassing the missing nucleotides in TRPV1β so that the products for the α and β isoform were 216 and 186 base pairs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1C, all tissues tested expressed TRPV1α to varying degrees with DRG and liver being the most and the least abundant, respectively. The product for TRPV1β was barely detectable from DRG by ethidium bromide staining. To better distinguish the PCR products of the α and β isoforms, we performed Southern blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes that specifically recognize either isoform. The specificity of the probes was confirmed by including the plasmid containing either TRPV1α or TRPV1β, cut with BsrGI, on the same blot. Fig. 1D shows that the α probe hybridized mainly with TRPV1α (upper), whereas the β probe hybridized only with TRPV1β (lower). Whereas the Southern result for TRPV1α is consistent with that shown by ethidium bromide staining, the result for TRPV1β revealed its expression in brain, DRG, skin, stomach, and tongue, but not other tissues. Interestingly, although the relative levels of TRPV1β were low as compared with that of TRPV1α, the ratios between the two splice variants were different in these tissues. Even though the highest levels of α and β variants were both found in DRG, stomach and tongue appeared to express a higher proportion of the β variant than other tissues. Skin also appeared to express a relatively high proportion of TRPV1β because much less TRPV1α messenger was detected in skin than in skeletal muscle and spinal cord, but only skin showed a detectable level of TRPV1β. Functional Measurements of the Mouse TRPV1 Variants— We expressed TRPV1α and TRPV1β individually in HEK 293 cells and measured fluorescence changes in response to capsaicin in Fluo4-loaded cells at 32 °C using a fluorescence micro-plate reader. In cells expressing TRPV1α, capsaicin induced a dose-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, as indicated by the increase in Fluo4 fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B). The EC50 for capsaicin is 0.26 ± 0.06 μm (mean ± S.E. of three experiments, performed in triplicate samples for each concentration), a value similar to the rat and human TRPV1 expressed in mammalian cells (23Shin J.S.

The capsaicin-induced response was dose dependently blocked by ruthenium red (Fig. 2C), a known blocker of the TRPV channels (25Dray A. Forbes C.A. Burgess G.M. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 110: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Garcia-Martinez C. Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Merino J.M. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32552-32558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The remaining Ca2+ transient seen in the presence of 10 μm ruthenium red probably represents TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ release resulting from the presence of the expressed channels on intracellular membranes (27Turner H. Fleig A. Stokes A. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which still responded to the membrane-permeable agonist but were not affected by the membrane-impermeable inhibitor. Similarly, addition of resiniferatoxin, anandamide, and N-arachidonyldopamine, as well as lowering the extracellular pH to 5.6, induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in TRPV1α-transfected cells (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that the mouse TRPV1α formed a Ca2+-permeable channel like its rat and human counterparts. In contrast, no change was induced by the drug treatments in cells that expressed either TRPV1β or the vector DNA (Fig. 2, B and E). Reducing the extracellular pH to 5.6 caused a similar transient rise in intracellular Ca2+ in both TRPV1β- and vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2E). This transient intracellular Ca2+ increase was also consistently seen in untransfected HEK 293 cells (not shown) and thus represents the endogenous response to extracellular acidification. We have shown recently that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) activates rat TRPV1 and mouse TRPV1α (21Hu H-.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L-.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (June 11, 10.1074/jbc.M404164200)Google Scholar). However, 2APB had no effect on cells that expressed TRPV1β (Fig. 2E). In whole cell patch clamp recordings, application of 5 μm capsaicin to TRPV1α-transfected cells elicited an outwardly rectifying current, which reached its peak values within 5 s of the drug application and then rapidly declined (Fig. 2D). The current-voltage relationship of the capsaicin-induced activity, as revealed by the voltage ramp (Fig. 2D, inset), is typical of those for heterologously expressed rat and human TRPV1 channels (5Caterina M.J.

In contrast, 5 μm capsaicin did not elicit any current in TRPV1β-transfected cells even after more than 40 s of continued drug presence. The functionality of TRPV1α and TRPV1β was further confirmed in Xenopus oocytes after injection of the cRNA for each isoform. Capsaicin-induced current was only seen in oocytes injected with the cRNA of TRPV1α but not that of TRPV1β (Fig. 3A). The EC50 for capsaicin was 1.52 ± 0.09 μm (n = 5) for the TRPV1α-injected oocytes. The larger EC50 value observed in the oocytes as compared with that in mammalian cells had also been noted for heterologously expressed rat and human TRPV1 (24McIntyre P. McLatchie L.M. Chambers A.

Mutations in Mre11 and nibrin result in the radiosensitivity disorders ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), respectively. Cells from ATLD and NBS patients are deficient in activation of the Atm protein kinase and phosphorylation of downstream Atm targets following irradiation. However, the roles of individual MRN complex proteins in Atm function are not clear, because the mutations in NBS and ATLD cells result in global effects on the MRN complex. Previously we showed that the C-terminal 100 amino acids of nibrin were necessary and sufficient to translocate the MRN complex to the nucleus. Here we have taken advantage of this feature of nibrin to create isogenic cell lines lacking either nibrin or Mre11-Rad50 in the nucleus. We found that nuclear expression of Mre11-Rad50, but not nibrin, stimulated Atm activation at early times after low doses of radiation. At later times or higher doses of irradiation, Atm activation was independent of Mre11-Rad50 or nibrin. The requirement of MRN complex proteins for downstream Atm phosphorylation events following irradiation was more complex. Phosphorylation of nibrin and Chk2 by Atm required Mre11-Rad50 expression in the nucleus at early times after irradiation, reflecting the stimulation of Atm activation by Mre11-Rad50. By contrast, autophosphorylation of Chk2 and phosphorylation of Smc1 at Ser-957 was dependent on the MRN complex 60 min after irradiation, even though Atm was activated at that time point. These results indicate an independent role for Mre11-Rad50 in the activation of Atm and suggest nibrin and/or Mre11-Rad50 also act as adaptors for some downstream Atm phosphorylation events.

The coordination of these processes ensures the integrity of the genome and prevents mutations and chromosomal aberrations that can lead to malignant transformation. Central to the DSB response in mammalian cells is the Atm protein kinase that transduces the damage response signal to downstream effectors. Atm exists as an inactive dimer in the nucleus but undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser-1981 in response to DSBs and dissociates into active monomers (1Bakkenist J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Among the many downstream Atm targets is the Mre11-Rad50-nibrin (MRN) complex.

The interconnection between Atm and the MRN complex in the DSB response is underscored by the existence of radiosensitivity disorders caused by mutations in the genes encoding these proteins.

These observations led to the hypothesis that the MRN complex functions downstream of Atm as a mediator of Atm-induced signals. Recently, Uziel et al. (26Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y.

The contribution of individual MRN complex proteins to Atm activation and function is not clear from these studies, however, because the mutations in NBS and ATLD cells have global effects on all members of the MRN complex. The truncating mutations in the NBS1 gene that are an invariant feature of NBS eliminate the production of full-length nibrin, but they also result in mislocalization of Mre11-Rad50 to the cytoplasm in NBS cells (27Carney J.P.

We have used a retroviral expression system to assess the differential functions of nibrin and Mre11-Rad50 in the DSB response. Previously, we showed (11Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that the C-terminal 100 amino acids of nibrin are necessary to bring the MRN complex to the nucleus. In the current study, a deletion mutant of nibrin that lacked the C-terminal Mre11 binding domain or an N-terminal nibrin deletion mutant that contained only the Mre11 binding domain were expressed in NBS fibroblasts to create cells lacking Mre11-Rad50 or nibrin, respectively, in the nucleus. The activation of Atm following exposure of the mutant cells to ionizing radiation was assessed, as well as the phosphorylation of downstream Atm targets including nibrin and the S-phase checkpoint proteins Smc1 and Chk2. We show that activation of Atm is stimulated by Mre11-Rad50 at early times after low doses of ionizing radiation. The requirement of nibrin or Mre11-Rad50 for downstream Atm phosphorylation events was more complex, suggesting that nibrin and/or Mre11-Rad50 may also act as adaptors for some Atm targets. Cell Lines—NBS-ILB1 is an SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line established from an NBS patient homozygous for the common founder mutation 657del5 (28Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J.I. Friedl A.A. Klein B. Verhaugh G.W.C.T. Jaspers N.G.J. Midro A.T. Eckardt-Schupp F. Lohman P.H.M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NBS-ILB1 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). NBS-ILB1 cells stably expressing nibrin transgenes were maintained in the above medium with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). An SV40-transformed A-T fibroblast cell line, AT3BI, and an SV40-transformed normal fibroblast cell line, GM637, were used as controls and were grown in DMEM with 15% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Phoenix A retroviral packaging cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Retroviral Gene Expression—NBS-ILB1 cells stably expressing the pLXIN retroviral vector (Clontech) or the pLXIN retroviral vector containing a wild type NBS1 cDNA, Nb652 cDNA, or an NbFR5 cDNA have been described previously (11Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Yeo T.C. Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Concannon P. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Nb652 mutant lacks the Mre11 binding domain due to an insertion mutation in the NBS1 cDNA, 1958insA, which causes a frameshift at Lys-652 and premature termination of the protein after four amino acids (29Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Yeo T.C. Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Concannon P. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 1958insA mutation occurs as a result of passage of the NBS1 cDNA in bacteria and is not found in NBS patients (29Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Yeo T.C. Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Concannon P. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The NbFR5 cDNA fragment was generated by PCR and encompasses amino acids 401-754 of nibrin (11Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As a control for these studies, an NBS1 cDNA containing mutations of the Atm phosphorylation sites, S278A and S343A, was constructed. Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed on an NBS1 cDNA containing the single mutation 1028C→G, S343A (3Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K.K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), to introduce the second mutation 832T→G, S278A. NBS1 cDNAs containing the S278A/S343A double mutation were identified by sequencing. A BamHI-NcoI fragment encompassing the nibrin coding region, but ending 5′ of the poly-adenylation site, was cloned into the HpaI site of pLXIN, upstream of the internal ribosome entry site-neomycin resistance cassette. To generate NBS-ILB1 cells expressing the nibrin S278A/S343A mutant, the pLXIN S278A/S343A plasmid was transfected into Phoenix A packaging cells as described (29Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Yeo T.C. Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Concannon P. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Retroviral supernatants were harvested after 48 h and used to infect NBS-ILB1 fibroblasts. Stable cell lines were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared from cells ± irradiation. Fibroblast cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed, and exposed to 0, 3, or 10 Gy of ionizing radiation. Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and were sonicated. Protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad), and lysates were immunoprecipitated or used directly for gel electrophoresis. For immunoprecipitation, 250-800 μg of protein was mixed with primary antibody for 1 h and then immunoprecipitated overnight by addition of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or protein G Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway). For direct gel electrophoresis, 20 μg of protein was loaded per lane. Denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed using NuPage Tris acetate 7% gels or 3-8% gradient gels (Invitrogen). Protein samples were prepared by addition of NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and denatured as described (30Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21944-21951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon P nylon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) in 25 mm Bicine, 25 mm bis-Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 20% methanol, with NuPage anti-oxidant (Invitrogen). Immunoblots were blocked in 10% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, with 0.1% Tween (TBST). Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk/TBST or 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST for phosphospecific antibodies. For these studies, nibrin was detected by using rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for nibrin (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) or an anti-nibrin monoclonal antibody (Gene-Tex, San Antonio, TX). Nibrin phosphorylation was detected with a monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated Ser-343 residue (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY). Mre11 or Rad50 proteins were detected with specific rabbit polyclonal antisera (Novus). Atm protein was detected by using a rabbit polyclonal antisera (Novus) or a monoclonal antibody specific for the phosphorylated Ser-1981 residue (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA). Primary antibodies to Smc1 included a goat polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for the phosphorylated Ser-957 residue, kindly provided by Michael Kastan. Chk2 protein was detected by using a Chk2 monoclonal antibody, kindly provided by Domenico Delia, and rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for the phosphorylated Thr-68 residue (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Primary antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies including goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pharmingen), goat anti-mouse IgG (Pharmingen), and donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Secondary antibodies were diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk/TBST. Antibody staining was detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry of autoradiograms was performed using Image-Quant software, version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Fibroblast cell lines were grown on glass coverslips (Viromed, Minneapolis, MN) overnight and were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min the following day. Coverslips were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal calf serum. Nibrin and Mre11 localization was detected by costaining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to nibrin (Novus) and a monoclonal antibody to human Mre11, kindly provided by Tony Demaggio, ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA. The primary antibodies were detected with an Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate and an Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by using a Nikon fluorescence microscope and Bio-Rad confocal imaging system at 488 and 568 nm (Bio-Rad). Individual fields were z-planed, and the stacked images at 488 and 568 were merged. Localization of Nibrin or Mre11-Rad50 Can be Regulated by Mutagenesis of Nibrin—We have previously shown that the C-terminal 100 amino acids of nibrin bind to the N terminus of Mre11 and that this interaction is both necessary and sufficient to translocate the Mre11-Rad50 proteins to the nucleus of the cell (11Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mre11-Rad50 remain cytoplasmic in the absence of full-length nibrin, such as in NBS cells, or as a result of expression of a nibrin mutant lacking the C terminus (11Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H.J.

In the current study, we took advantage of this finding to construct nibrin deletion mutants that, when expressed in NBS cells, created cells specifically lacking Mre11-Rad50 or full-length nibrin in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Nb652 construct lacks the Mre11 binding domain of nibrin, whereas the NbFR5 construct retains the Mre11 binding domain but lacks the N terminus of nibrin from amino acids 1-400, including the conserved FHA and BRCT domains and the Atm phosphorylation sites at Ser-278 and Ser-343 (3Gatei M.

These mutant NBS1 cDNAs were cloned in the pLXIN retroviral vector and introduced into the NBS fibroblast cell line, NBS-ILB1, by retroviral infection. NBS-ILB1 cells fail to make full-length nibrin protein (28Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J.I. Friedl A.A. Klein B. Verhaugh G.W.C.T. Jaspers N.G.J. Midro A.T. Eckardt-Schupp F. Lohman P.H.M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Fig. 3). As controls, NBS-ILB1 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding wild type NBS1, a nibrin phosphorylation mutant, S278A/S343A, in which Ser-278 and Ser-343 were mutated to alanine, or with the empty pLXIN vector.Fig. 3Phosphorylation of nibrin following irradiation in NBS cells expressing nibrin mutants. NBS-ILB1 cells stably transduced with the pLXIN vector alone, wild type nibrin (NBS1), or the nibrin mutants Nb652, NbFR5, and S278A/S343A were unirradiated or exposed to 3 Gy of ionizing radiation, and total cellular lysates were prepared after 15 (A) or 60 min (B). Controls included GM637 normal fibroblasts (control), AT3BI A-T fibroblasts (A-T), and parental NBSILB1 cells. Nibrin was immunoprecipitated (IP) from 250 μg of protein/cell line using a polyclonal anti-nibrin antibody, and immunoprecipitates were separated on 3-8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were Western-blotted (WB) and probed with a monoclonal antibody specific for the phospho-Ser-343 (P-S343) residue of nibrin. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal anti-nibrin antibody. Quantitation of Ser-343 phosphorylation in individual cell lines relative to total nibrin protein was performed by densitometry and is shown below each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1B shows the expression of the nibrin transgenes and their interaction with Mre11-Rad50 as determined by immunoprecipitation with nibrin antisera. All of the constructs were expressed at levels comparable with endogenous nibrin in the control fibroblasts. Expression of wild type NBS1 or the S278A/S343A phosphorylation mutant in NBS-ILB1 cells resulted in production of full-length nibrin protein that coimmunoprecipitated Mre11 and Rad50. NBS-ILB1 cells transduced with the Nb652 mutant expressed a smaller nibrin species that failed to coimmunoprecipitate Mre11 or Rad50, consistent with the deletion of the C-terminal Mre11 binding domain in this mutant. In contrast to Nb652, the NbFR5 mutant coimmunoprecipitated Mre11 and Rad50 at levels indistinguishable from wild type. Analysis of nibrin and Mre11 localization by immunofluorescence in NBS-ILB1 cells expressing the nibrin transgenes supported these findings (Fig. 1C). Parental NBS-ILB1 cells infected with the vector alone displayed background levels of nibrin staining, and Mre11 was observed only in the cytoplasm. Expression of wild type nibrin or the S278A/S343A nibrin mutant in NBS-ILB1 cells restored nuclear localization of full-length nibrin and Mre11, apparent from the yellow colocalization of nibrin (Fig. 1C, red) and Mre11 (Fig. 1C, green). In cells expressing Nb652, nibrin staining was nuclear, whereas Mre11 remained cytoplasmic because of the deletion of the Mre11 binding domain. NBS cells expressing NbFR5 displayed nuclear staining for both the C-terminal nibrin fragment and Mre11. Thus, the subcellular localization of nibrin or Mre11-Rad50 is regulated by expression of nibrin mutants in NBS cells. Mre11-Rad50 Stimulate Atm Activation Early after Irradiation—Atm activation, as measured by autophosphorylation at Ser-1981, is reduced in response to neocarzinostatin treatment in both ATLD and NBS cells (26Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). To assess whether nibrin, Mre11-Rad50, or the intact MRN complex are required for full Atm activation, we exposed cells expressing Nb652, NbFR5, or controls to 3 Gy of ionizing radiation and assessed Atm Ser-1981 phosphorylation after 15 and 60 min. As shown in Fig. 2A, Atm phosphorylation was dramatically increased in control fibroblasts 15 min after irradiation compared with parental NBS-ILB1 cells or NBS cells with vector alone. Restoration of nuclear localization of the MRN complex by expression of wild type NBS1 or the S278A/S343A nibrin mutant in NBS-ILB1 cells resulted in an increase in Atm autophosphorylation in response to irradiation. Atm activation was also increased in NBS-ILB1 cells expressing the NbFR5 deletion mutant, indicating that nuclear expression of Mre11-Rad50 stimulated Atm phosphorylation in the absence of full-length nibrin. Conversely, nuclear expression of Nb652 in NBS-ILB1 cells in the absence of Mre11-Rad50 failed to stimulate Atm phosphorylation. At later time points (Fig. 2B, 60 min) or higher doses of irradiation (10 Gy, data not shown), Atm phosphorylation was independent of nibrin or Mre11-Rad50. Thus, the stimulatory effect of Mre11-Rad50 on Atm activation is apparent at early times after low doses of ionizing radiation. Nibrin Phosphorylation by Atm Requires Mre11-Rad50—To assess a differential role for Mre11-Rad50 or nibrin in downstream Atm phosphorylation events, we first examined phosphorylation of nibrin itself.

https://openalex.org/W2086023112,"We have previously identified a novel family of secreted, cell-surface proteins expressed in human vascular endothelium. To date, two family members have been described, sharing a characteristic domain structure including an amino-terminal signal peptide followed by multiple copies of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a spacer region, and one CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus. Thus, this family was termed SCUBE for signal peptide-CUB-EGF-like domain containing proteins. Here we described the identification and characterization of one additional member of the SCUBE family named SCUBE3 in humans, sharing an overall 60% protein identity and a similar domain structure with other family members. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and Northern blot analyses revealed that this gene is highly expressed in primary osteoblasts and the long bones (humerus and femur), followed by a low level of expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in heart. When overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, the recombinant hSCUBE3 protein is a secreted glycoprotein that can form oligomers tethered to the cell surface. Interestingly, the secreted hSCUBE3 protein can be further proteolytically processed by a serum-associated protease to release the EGF-like repeats from the CUB domain. The SCUBE3 gene is mapped to human chromosome 6p21.3, a region that has been linked with the locus for a rare form of metabolic bone disease, Paget's disease of bone 1. Together, this novel secreted, cell-surface osteoblast protein may act locally and/or distantly through a proteolytic mechanism, and may play an important role in bone cell biology.

In the present study, we identified and characterized the third member of the SCUBE gene family, named SCUBE3. Its unique expression in bones and osteoblasts suggests that SCUBE3 may play a critical role in bone cell biology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human primary cultured cells, osteoblasts, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and coronary smooth muscle cells, were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, MD). TaqMan Universal PCR master mixture was from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).Long Bone RNA Extraction and Analysis—The long bones (humeri and femurs) from one 2-month-old male C57Bl6 mouse were dissected free of surrounding tissue, cut into small pieces in 2 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and homogenized with a Polytron probe (Brinkmann Instruments) for 30 s. Total RNAs were prepared using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was prepared on 5 μg of total RNA. One-tenth of the first-strand cDNA reaction was used as template for each real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis as described below.Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) Analysis—hSCUBE3 mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR on a panel of cDNAs from a variety of human primary cells or normal tissues. Probes were designed by PrimerExpress software (PE Applied Biosystems) based on the sequence of the hSCUBE3 gene. The hSCUBE3 gene-specific probe was labeled using FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) and the β2-microglobulin reference probe was labeled with a different fluorescent dye (VIC) at the 5′ end. TAMRA (6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine) is linked at the 3′ end as quenchers. The differential labeling of the target gene and internal reference gene thus enabled measurement in the same well. Normalization was performed using β2-microglobulin mRNA levels as controls in the same reaction. TaqMan experiments were carried out in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan reagents. The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: hold for 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by two-step PCR for 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 1 min. Primers used for human (h) SCUBE3 analysis were as follows: forward, 5′-CAAAGTCCAGTGCTCCCCAG and reverse, 5′-GACGGAAGTCGGGCTGATAG; TaqMan probe, 5′-FAM-ACACCAGCATCCACCGCTGTATTCG-TAMRA. Primers used for mouse (m) SCUBE3 analysis were as follows: forward, 5′-CCAGAAGAAGGAATGAACTGCA and reverse, 5′-GCAATGCCCCCCTTGG; TaqMan probe, 5′-FAM-TGCCCACATTTGCCGGGAGACTTAMRA primers used for β2-microglobulin analysis were as follows: forward, 5′-GTCTCGCTCCGTGGCCTTA and reverse, 5′-TGAATCTTTGGAGTACGCTGGATA; TaqMan probe, 5′-VIC-TGCTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCTGGC-TAMRA. Primers used for GAPDH analysis were as follows: forward, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGG and reverse, 5′-AGAGTTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTG; TaqMan probe, 5′-FAM-TTTGGTCGTATTGGGCGCCTGG-TAMRA.Full-length Cloning and Expression Plasmids—On the basis of gene prediction and a public sequence information (GenBank™ accession number AF452494), the entire open reading frame of hSCUBE3 was amplified by PCR via a mixture of Advantage 2 (Clontech) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from cDNAs derived from human primary osteoblasts. The resulting cDNA was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and confirmed by sequencing. The following epitope-tagged expression constructs of hSCUBE3 were prepared by cloning of the PCR fragment encoding the mature hSCUBE3 (amino acids 23–993) into the mammalian expression vectors. The FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was added at the amino terminus followed by the mature hSCUBE3 (amino acids 22–993) into the pFLAG-CMV-1 expression vector (Sigma). The pSecTag2 vector (Invitrogen) was used to add a Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) at the carboxyl terminus of hSCUBE3. The GenBank™ accession numbers for hSCUBE3 and mSCUBE3 are AY639608 and AY639609, respectively.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs (10 μg) from human osteoblasts, HUVEC, and human small intestine were separated on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to nylon members, and hybridized overnight with a radiolabeled 525-bp hSCUBE3 cDNA probe (amino acids 356–531). In addition, one human tissue Northern blot (containing 1 μg of poly(A)-enriched mRNA from a variety of human tissues) was purchased from Clontech and hybridized with a radiolabeled hSCUBE3 cDNA probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization overnight, the blots were washed once at room temperature (25 °C) and twice at 65 °C with 0.1 × SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS (each wash for 1 h). Autoradiography was performed at –80 °C for 1 day. The blot was then stripped and hybridized with a β-actin probe as a positive control.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates overnight before transfection. The transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) or by the calcium-phosphate-mediated method. We consistently observed greater than 90% of transfection efficiency in HEK-293T cells, accessed by the transfection of green fluorescent protein vector (Clontech) as reporter and examined by flow cytometry. The total amount of DNA was kept constant in all transfections by supplementing empty vector DNA. HUVEC were cultured as previously described (3DiChiara M.R. Kiely J.M. Gimbrone M.A. Lee M.E. Perrella M.A. Topper J.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Cells lysates were incubated with 1 μg of the indicated antibody and 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-agarose (Pierce) for 2 h with gentle rocking. After three washes with lysis buffer, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20 and were blotted with the indicated antibodies. After two washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. After washing the membranes, the reactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Flow Cytometry Analysis—Transfected cells were collected and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% FBS in a volume of 0.25 ml. A total of 1 μg of purified anti-FLAG M2 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were added sequentially; each were incubated for 45 min on ice. FACS analyses were performed with a FACScan (Clontech).RESULTSIdentification and Expression Profile of Human SCUBE3— We have previously identified a family of cell-surface proteins expressed in human endothelial cells (2Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To date, two gene members have been described sharing a characteristic domain structure including an amino-terminal signal peptide, followed by multiple copies of EGF-like repeats, a spacer region, and one CUB domain at the carboxyl terminus (2Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, this family was termed SCUBE.To further understand the biology of this gene family, we investigated whether or not additional SCUBE family member(s) exist in the public sequence data bases. After searching a public genome data base, one predicted gene (GenBank™ accession XM_094924), homologous to SCUBE1 and SCUBE2, was identified on human chromosome 6p21. Subsequently, two independent cDNAs representing this predicted gene were described in the GenBank™ data base under accession numbers AF452494 and BC052263, respectively. In this report, this gene is referred to as SCUBE3 to be consistent with the literature and the order of its discovery, related to prior family members, SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 (2Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol.

Dev. 2001; 102: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).We then examined the expression profile of human SCUBE3 (hSCUBE3) by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) analysis. Interestingly, when a panel of cDNAs derived from a variety of human primary cells and tissues was assessed for hSCUBE3 expression by TaqMan analysis, we found that hSCUBE3 mRNA is highly enriched in primary cultured osteoblasts, followed by primary HUVEC and coronary smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1A, top). On the other hand, hSCUBE3 transcript levels were found to be absent or quite low in a variety of normal human tissues (Fig. 1A, bottom). Because osteoblasts are the prominent cells in bone tissues, we then determined whether or not SCUBE3 mRNA is also highly expressed in skeletons. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to measure the SCUBE3 mRNA levels in the long bones (i.e. humerus and femur) and a number of non-osseous tissues from an adult mouse. As shown in Fig. 1B, we found that expression of SCUBE3 is indeed highly enriched in native bone tissue, but low in all other non-bone tissues.Full-length Cloning and Sequence Analysis of hSCUBE3— To obtain the full-length cDNA of this gene, one pair of oligonucleotides based on the public sequences was used to amplify the entire open reading frame by PCR from cDNAs derived from human primary osteoblasts because hSCUBE3 is highly expressed in this cell type. This cDNA was confirmed by sequencing and shown to be identical to the sequence of GenBank™ accession number AF452494 that contains an open reading frame of 2979 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 993 amino acids (see Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1). Hydrophobicity (6Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17007) Google Scholar) and protein family (7Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) analyses predict one 22-residue amino-terminal signal peptide, followed by nine copies of EGF-like repeats, a spacer region, and one CUB domain (Fig. 2). Notably, there are five potential sites for N-glycosylation located within the spacer region, between the multiple EGF-like repeats and the CUB domain (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S1). This domain organization is similar to that of two prior family members, SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 (2Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N.

Mature SCUBE3 protein is predicted (after cleavage of the signal peptide) to contain 971 residues with calculated molecular mass of 107 kDa.Fig. 2Domain structure of human SCUBE3. The region marked with the solid box indicates the putative signal peptide. The graphic shows the domain organization of human SCUBE3 protein. An apparent “spacer region” is located between the 9th EGF-like repeat and the CUB domain. Two deletion constructs are also depicted. SP, signal peptide; FL, full-length; D1 (amino acids 1–993), deletion mutant 1 (amino acids 1–803); D2, deletion mutant 2 (amino acids 1–529); E, EGF-like repeats; CUB, CUB domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SCUBE3 shares an overall 66 and 60% homology with that of SCUBE1 and SCUBE2, respectively (see Supplemental Materials, Figs. S2 and S3). The CUB domain and the very carboxyl-terminal sequences are the most conserved regions sharing 82–90% identity in this family (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S3), followed by the amino-terminal nine copies of EGF-like repeats sharing 66–77% homology (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S2). The spacer regions are the most divergent and are only about 46–50% homologous among the family members (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S3).Northern Blot Analysis for the Expression of the hSCUBE3 Transcript—To further validate the expression of SCUBE3, Northern blots containing total RNAs (10 μg) from human primary cells or poly(A)-enriched mRNA (1 μg) from a variety of human adult tissues was hybridized with a hSCUBE3 cDNA radiolabeled probe, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression level of hSCUBE3 was highest in human primary osteoblasts with a predominant transcript at the size of ∼8.0 kb, followed by a low expression level in HUVEC with an mRNA species of about 4.0 kb. On the other hand, the tissue Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of hSCUBE3 is only barely detectable in heart, but not in all other tissues examined (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Northern blot analysis for the expression of human SCUBE3 transcripts.A, enriched expression of SCUBE3 in human osteoblasts. Ten micrograms of total RNAs isolated from human primary osteoblasts, HUVEC, and small intestine were hybridized with the SCUBE3 cDNA radiolabeled probe. The SCUBE3 probe identified one mRNA species of approximately 8.0 kb in human osteoblasts (arrowhead) and a weak transcript size of 4.0 kb in HUVEC (arrow). The lower panel shows the quantity of 28 S RNAs as loading controls. B, Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA from a variety of human tissues for SCUBE3. One microgram of poly(A)-enriched mRNA from various human adult tissues was hybridized with the SCUBE3 radiolabeled probe. An mRNA species of ∼4.0 kb was identified in heart (arrow), but not in all other tissues examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Secretion, N-Glycosylation, and Cell-surface Expression of Recombinant hSCUBE3 Protein in HEK-293T Cells—Because hSCUBE3 possesses a putative signal peptide indicative for a secreted protein and because multiple EGF-like repeats are found in a number of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) (8Prigent S.A. Lemoine N.R. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 1-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 9Davis C.G. New Biol. 1990; 2: 410-419PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the hSCUBE3 protein is a secretory and/or ECM protein. To this end, the recombinant hSCUBE3 protein was expressed by means of a transient expression system in HEK-293T cells. The FLAG epitope was added immediately after the signal peptide cleavage site (i.e. at the amino terminus of the processed, mature protein) for the detection of the recombinant protein (Flag.hSCUBE3). Two days after transfection and under serum-free conditions, the culture supernatants were collected, and cells were detached from dishes by EDTA treatment, and residual ECM proteins were extracted with Laemmli buffer. Samples from these three fractions were subjected to Western blot analyses using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, like hSCUBE1, the hSCUBE3 protein was detected in the serum-free conditioned culture medium (Medium) and in cell lysates (Cell), but was not detected in the ECM fraction (Matrix) or in fractions derived from the control vector-transfected cells. These data demonstrate that the hSCUBE3 protein is a secreted and cell-associated protein.Fig. 4Secretion, glycosylation, and cell-surface expression of SCUBE3 in HEK-293T cells.A, SCUBE3 is a secreted and cell-associated protein. HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector or expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged human SCUBE3 (Flag.hSCUBE3) or SCUBE1 (Flag.hSCUBE1) as positive control (2Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Forty-eight post-transfection, the serum-free conditioned medium was collected, and cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA. The extracellular matrix on the culture dish was extracted with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples from the serum-free conditioned culture medium (Medium), cell lysates (Cell), and the extracellular matrix (Matrix) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Recombinant SCUBE proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. B, N-glycosylation of human SCUBE3. HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector or expression plasmid encoding the Flag.hSCUBE3 protein. Transfected cells were cultured in the absence (–) or presence (+) of tunicamycin for 24 h. Cell lysates from each culture were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. C, cell-surface expression of human SCUBE3 protein. HEK-293T cells were transfected with empty vector or expression vector encoding Flag.hSCUBE3 or Flag.hSCUBE1 proteins, respectively. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, transfected cells were detached and stained with anti-FLAG antibody and subjected to flow cytometry analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The molecular mass of the recombinant SCUBE3 protein expressed in HEK-293T cells is approximately 130 kDa, slightly larger than the predicted size of mature hSCUBE3 (Fig. S1). Because hSCUBE3 has five putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. S1), it is likely that the recombinant hSCUBE3 is subject to a post-translational modification by glycosylation. Thus, we examined whether tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, affected the molecular mass of the expressed protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, tunicamycin treatment of cells results in a reduction of molecular size to that of the predicted, precursor form of hSCUBE3 at about 110 kDa. These results clearly demonstrate that the majority of hSCUBE3 is N-glycosylated when expressed in HEK-293T cells.Because the majority of expressed hSCUBE3 protein appears cell-associated (Fig. 4A) and because hSCUBE1 is a membrane-anchored protein (2Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we next determined whether or not hSCUBE3 is capable of targeting to the cell surface by means of flow cytometric analysis. Expression plasmid encoding the Flag.hSCUBE3 was transfected into HEK-293T cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were collected and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, then analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4C, expression of the Flag.hSCUBE3 protein resulted in a shift of a population of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, suggesting that hSCUBE3, like hSCUBE1, is targeted to the cell surface.Homo- and Hetero-oligomerization of hSCUBE3—We have previously shown that SCUBE1 and SCUBE2 are capable of forming a homomeric or heteromeric complex when overexpressed in HEK-293 cells. To ascertain whether or not this newly identified family member, SCUBE3, can form the oligomeric complexes, the differentially epitope-tagged SCUBE3 and SCUBE1 expression plasmids were singly or co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. Two days after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated followed by Western blot analysis to determine the protein associations. When SCUBE3.Myc is coexpressed with either Flag.SCUBE1 or Flag.SCUBE3, immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody results in the coimmunoprecipitation of either protein, respectively (Fig. 5). Likewise, the reciprocal immunoprecipitation of anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody confirmed the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes between SCUBE3 and SCUBE1, at least in HEK-293T cells.Fig. 5Homo- and hetero-oligomerization of human SCUBE3 in transfected HEK-293T cells. HEK-293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged SCUBE3 (hSCUBE3.Myc) singly or co-transfected with the Flag.hSCUBE1 or Flag.hSCUBE3 as indicated. The total amount of DNA was kept constant in all transfections by supplementing the empty vector DNA. Two days later, detergent lysates of each transfection were subjected to immunoprecipitate (IP) by FLAG or Myc antibodies, followed by immunoblotting (WB) using FLAG and Myc antibodies, respectively, to determine the associated proteins. Cell lysates were also immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or Myc antibodies to examine the protein expression levels (bottom two panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Proteolytic Processing of the Secreted SCUBE3 Protein—Because two novel CUB domain-containing platelet-derived growth factor family members, platelet-derived growth factor-C and -D (10Bergsten E.

https://openalex.org/W2142604892,"Many types of synapses throughout the nervous system are transiently depressed during high-frequency stimulation. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for this depression, including depletion of release-ready vesicles. However, numerous studies have raised doubts about the importance of depletion in depression of central synapses and have implicated alternative mechanisms, such as decreased release probability. We use variance-mean analysis to determine the mechanism of depression at the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse. We find that postsynaptic receptor saturation makes it difficult to distinguish between a decrease in available vesicles and a reduction in release probability. When AMPA receptor saturation is relieved with a low-affinity antagonist, variance-mean analysis reveals that depression arises from a decrease in the number of release-ready vesicles. Vesicle depletion is prominent, despite numerous docked vesicles at each release site, due to multivesicular release. We conclude that vesicle depletion can contribute significantly to depression of central synapses."

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are considered as the component of mycobacterial adherence to epithelial cells. Here we show that extracellularly occurring mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDP1) promotes mycobacterial infection to A549 human lung epithelial cells through hyaluronic acid (HA). Both surface plasmon resonance analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that MDP1 bound to HA, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate. Utilizing synthetic peptides, we next defined heparin-binding site of 20 amino acids from 31 to 50 of MDP1, which is responsible for the specific DNA-binding site of MDP1. MDP1 bound to A549 cells, and exogenous DNA and HA interfered with the interaction.

Attachment of microbial pathogens to host cells is a critical event to develop mucosal infection (1Kagnoff M.F. Eckmann L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistently infects 32% of the world human population and is responsible for around 1.7 million deaths attributable to a single infectious pathogen each year (2Bloom B.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1434-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis is transmitted by airborne particles and is deposited in a terminal alveolus, where the bacteria are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages or invade into nonprofessional phagocytic cells such as epithelial pneumocytes (3Small P.M. Fujiwara P.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Bermudez L.E. Goodman J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1400-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonprofessional phagocytic cells are presumed to be hiding places of M. tuberculosis in persistent infection, because M. tuberculosis DNA can be frequently detected in type II alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts of the lung derived from tuberculin skin test-positive healthy individuals (5Hernandez-Pando R.

However, the precise mechanism of the interaction between lung epithelial pneumocytes and mycobacteria remains unknown. Better understanding of the interaction is important for developing therapeutic/prophylactic strategies against tuberculosis. Carbohydrates, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; aa, amino acid; BCG, bacillus Calmette-Guérin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; fluos, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; HA, hyaluronic acid; HBHA, heparin-binding hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LBP, laminin-binding protein; MDP1, mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1; P31-50, synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence of MDP1 at the 31-50 position; RU, resonance units; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; CFU, colony-forming units. are thought to be receptors in the process of mycobacterial infection to nonprofessional phagocytic cells (6Menozzi F.D. Rouse J.H. Alavi M. Laude-Sharp M. Muller J. Bischoff R. Brennan M.J. Locht C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). GAGs contain hyaluronic acid (HA), heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates (7Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Bacterial pathogens possess adhesion molecule, called adhesin to interact with host tissues. Heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) binds to GAGs and is identified as a mycobacterial adhesin in the mycobacterium-epithelial cell interaction (6Menozzi F.D. Rouse J.H. Alavi M. Laude-Sharp M. Muller J. Bischoff R. Brennan M.J. Locht C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). When bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or M. tuberculosis lacking HBHA was instilled into mice through the intranasal route, delay of extrapulmonary dissemination was observed (8Pethe K. Alonso S. Biet F. Delogu G. Brennan M.J. Locht C. Menozzi F.D. Nature. 2001; 412: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus interaction with epithelia is thought to be crucial for dissemination and to dominate the disease outcome. Besides HBHA, M. tuberculosis has another possible adhesin, designated mycobacterial cell entry protein 1 (Mcep1), of which DNA fragmentation confers on Escherichia coli an ability to invade into nonphagocytic HeLa cells (9Arruda S. Bomfim G. Knights R. Huima-Byron T. Riley L.W. Science. 1993; 261: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), although its precise role as an adhesin remains unclear (10Shimono N. Morici L. Casali N. Cantrell S. Sidders B. Ehrt S. Riley L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15918-15923Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is likely that mycobacteria utilize multiple adhesins to promote attachment to nonprofessional phagocytes. A number of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins are found in association with bacterial chromosomes and are called histone-like proteins. Mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDP1) has a wide range of binding activities to genomic DNA through guanine and cytosine and is an abundant structural protein, which constitutes ∼7% of cellular proteins in BCG and M. tuberculosis H37Rv (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MDP1 possesses a DNA-binding site at the position of amino acids (aa) 31-50, the sequence of which does not exist in any other nucleic acid-binding protein (12Furugen M. Matsumoto S. Matsuo T. Matsumoto M. Yamada T. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 30: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MDP1 has partial homology with HU, histone-like protein of E. coli, in the NH2-terminal region and with eukaryotic histone H1 in the COOH-terminal region. These facts indicate that MDP1 is mycobacteria-specific histone-like protein (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol.

Importantly, MDP1 inhibits macromolecular biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein in vitro and recombinant E. coli expressing MDP1 grows much slower when compared to the parental strain (13Matsumoto S. Furugen M. Yukitake H. Yamada T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 297-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of MDP1 is up-regulated at the stationary or dormant phases of mycobacterial culture (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Lee B.H. Murugasu-Oei B. Dick T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MDP1 and its homologues, which have been designated as histone-like protein (14Lee B.H. Murugasu-Oei B. Dick T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and laminin-binding protein (LBP) (15Shimoji Y. Ng V. Matsumura K. Fischetti V.A. Rambukkana A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9857-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), are distributed in all mycobacterial species so far examined (12Furugen M. Matsumoto S. Matsuo T. Matsumoto M. Yamada T. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 30: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These imply that MDP1 plays an important role in both slow growth and dormant/latent infection with mycobacteria. Another interesting feature of this molecule is localization. MDP1 exits not only in the cytoplasmic space associated with the 50 S ribosomal subunit and presumably nucleoid but also on the bacterial surface (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Shimoji Y. Ng V. Matsumura K. Fischetti V.A. Rambukkana A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9857-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein is localized in the cytoplasm, and its primitive roles are to compact the genome and control gene expression. However, some nuclear proteins are expressed on the cell surface and play alternative roles. For example, eukaryotic histone H1 on the cell membrane is identified as a receptor for thyroglobulin that is the precursor of thyroid hormones (16Brix K. Summa W. Lottspeich F. Herzog V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). High mobility group 1 protein is a eukaryotic nuclear protein associated with chromatin but also secreted in the extracellular milieu (17Muller S. Scaffidi P. Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Ronfani L. Agresti A. Beltrame M. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4337-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Outside the cell, high mobility group 1 binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end products and then stimulates the cell damage signal. This signal eventually triggers inflammation for clearance of necrotic cells (18Yang T. Witham T.F. Villa L. Erff M. Attanucci J. Watkins S. Kondziolka D. Okada H. Pollack I.F. Chambers W.H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2583-2591PubMed Google Scholar, 19Andersson U. Wang H. Palmblad K. Aveberger A.C. Bloom O. Erlandsson-Harris H. Janson A. Kokkola R. Zhang M. Yang H. Tracey K.J. J. Exp.

Mycobacterium leprae produces LBP, which is a homologue of MDP1, although it lacks DNA-binding activity (15Shimoji Y. Ng V. Matsumura K. Fischetti V.A. Rambukkana A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9857-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Instead of DNA-binding activity, LBP interacts with laminin-2 and is considered to be involved in M. leprae invasion into Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (15Shimoji Y. Ng V. Matsumura K. Fischetti V.A. Rambukkana A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9857-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to clarify the role of surface-exposed MDP1 in the interaction between mycobacteria and lung epithelial cells, because DNA-binding proteins tend to bind GAGs that are thought to be receptors in the process of mycobacterial infection to nonprofessional phagocytes (6Menozzi F.D. Rouse J.H. Alavi M. Laude-Sharp M. Muller J. Bischoff R. Brennan M.J. Locht C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that extracellular MDP1 acts as an adhesin by binding to GAGs and mediates mycobacterial adherence to A549 human lung epithelial cells by interaction with hyaluronic acid (HA). Treatment of BCG-infected mice with HA resulted in the reduction of mycobacterial growth in vivo. Taken together, HA may play a key role in adherence of mycobacteria to lung epithelial cells. Culture Medium and Reagents—RPMI 1640 media, l-glutamine, and 0.05% trypsin EDTA solution, heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa, HA from human umbilical cord, and heparan sulfate from bovine kidney were purchased from Sigma. Chondroitin sulfate A and C were purchased from Calbiochem. Hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolytics, heparinase 1 from Flavobacterium heparinum, and chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-MDP1 sera were obtained from female rabbit (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) after multiple injections of MDP1 emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Polyclonal anti-MDP1 antibodies were obtained by 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation of antisera. The salt was then removed by dialysis in PBS. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions of BCG—To obtain subcellular fractions from BCG, all the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Ten grams of BCG was disrupted in cold PBS with a Bioruptor UCD-200T sonicator (Toso, Tokyo, Japan), and the suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken bacteria. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was rinsed with cold PBS and again centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. This cell wall-containing pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of cold PBS, and then Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) was added to be 60%. Next the mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 1 h to separate cell walls from unbroken cells. The cell wall band was collected and washed twice with PBS and was used as the cell wall fraction. A membrane-ribosome fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant of the cell wall-containing pellet at 105,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet and the supernatant were used as membrane-ribosome and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Culture supernatants of BCG were obtained filtration of culture media of BCG through the membrane filter (pore size of 0.22 μm) and concentrated by 80% of ammonium sulfate precipitation. The salt was then removed by dialysis in PBS. Twenty micrograms of each fraction was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and reacted with polyclonal anti-MDP1 antisera. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—BCG and Mycobacterium smegmatis were grown in Middlebrook 7H9-ADC media at 37 °C until A1.5, and then the bacteria were collected by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4 °C and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Specimens were dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Epon-Araldite resin. The thin section was mounted on the nickel grids, treated in 3% H2O2 for 10 min, and washed in water. For blocking the nonspecific binding of antibody to the plastic, the section was preincubated with 3% BSA in PBS for 60 min at room temperature and washed by PBS, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-MDP1 antisera diluted in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-B-T, 1:800) for 2 h at room temperature. The section was then rinsed for 30 min and incubated with protein A conjugated with gold of 10 nm in diameter (EY Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA) diluted in PBS-B-T (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the section was rinsed with PBS and distilled water and then briefly stained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds' lead citrate. The section was analyzed using an H7100 electron microscope (Hitachi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operated at 75 kV. Proteins Purification—Native MDP1 and antigen 85B were purified from BCG strain Tokyo as described previously (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Naito M. Ohara N. Matsumoto S. Yamada T. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recombinant MDP1 and HBHA were obtained as follows. Based on the nucleotide sequences of mdp1 and hbha, the oligonucleotide primers, i.e. the forward (5′-CCCCATATGAACAAAGCAGAGCTCATTGAC-3′ and 5′-CATATGGCTGAAAACTCGAACAT-3′) and the reverse (5′-CCCAAGCTTTTTGCGACCCCGCCGAGCGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCTGGGTGACCTTCTTG-3′) primers, were synthesized, respectively. The PCR was carried out by targeting 10 ng of chromosomal DNA derived from BCG in an automated thermal sequencer (Iwaki Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan). The samples were first denatured by heating at 94 °C for 5 min and then incubated for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 2 min, 56 °C for 80 s, and 72 °C for 5 min and then finally incubated for 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragment, including mdp1 and hbha, were digested by NdeI and HindIII, and inserted into the same sites of pET22b+ (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). These plasmids were designated pET22b-MDP1 and pET22b-HBHA, respectively. The DNA sequences of the cloned genes were confirmed by using an ABI 373 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The pET22b-MDP1 and pET22b-HBHA were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys (Invitrogen), and these recombinant bacteria were harbored in LB media containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 22 °C. When an optical density at 600 nm of the culture reached 0.3-0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and then the mixture was incubated for additional 7 h. The cells were sonicated as described above, and the supernatant was collected after centrifuging 8,000 × g for 30 min. After removing the clamp from the supernatant by filtration through a 0.22-μm membrane filter, it was applied to a 1-ml Hi-Trap chelating column previously charged with 100 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl. After unbound proteins were washed out, the protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The fractions containing MDP1 were collected and dialyzed against PBS. The purity of proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) as a single band. Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—An MDP1-rich, acid-soluble protein fraction was obtained from BCG as described before (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 200 μg of acid-soluble protein was fractionated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), of which bed volume was 1 ml, at room temperature with a linear gradient of NaCl in PBS. Gradients were made in a gradient apparatus filled with 10 ml each of 0.15 and 2 m NaCl solution. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was maintained, and 1 ml of each fraction was collected. The fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were stained with CBB. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—The interaction between MDP1 and GAGs was monitored by measuring SPR using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All binding reactions were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, including 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20. Proteins and peptide were immobilized to the dextran matrix on the CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) using an amine coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore). Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data using BIAevaluation software version 3.0. Determination of the Heparin-binding site by ELISA—20-mer of synthetic sequential peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of MDP1 (12Furugen M. Matsumoto S. Matsuo T. Matsumoto M. Yamada T. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 30: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were immobilized on the 96-well ELISA plate (Sumitomo, Osaka, Japan) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. After blocking the wells by 5% BSA in PBS, biotinylated heparin (Sigma) was added at 1 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing unbound heparin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing free streptavidin, binding was detected by color development with o-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), and ELISA units (optical density) were measured at 492 nm. Inhibition of interaction between MDP1 and heparin by the synthetic peptide was examined by the following procedure. MDP1 was immobilized on the 96-well ELISA plate at a concentration of 4 μg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, at 4 °C overnight. Biotinylated heparin and peptide were premixed in PBS-T for 10 min at 37 °C and added into each MDP1-immobilized well. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, unbound heparin was washed out and the level of binding was determined by horseradish peroxidase conjugated with streptavidin as described above. Detection of MDP1 Binding to GAGs by ELISA and Inhibition Assay by Exogenous DNA—Genomic DNA of BCG and HA were immobilized on the 96-well ELISA plate at 10 μg/ml and heparin and chondroitin sulfate C were done at 100 μg/ml overnight incubation at 37 °C. MDP1 at 1 μg/ml in PBS-T was added into wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed, and then anti-MDP1 antisera diluted by PBS-T to 1 to 1000 were added. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, wells were washed and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was added. After washing the wells, MDP1 binding was detected by color development with o-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride as described above. Protein Labeling—MDP1 was labeled with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (fluos, Roche Diagnositics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). One milligram of MDP1 was mixed with 0.237 mg of fluos in 1 ml of PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The molar ratio of fluos to MDP1 is 10 to 1. Then, nonreacted fluos was separated by gel filtration on the Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Similarly, bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) and HBHA were labeled with fluos (molar ratio, 10 to 1). Concentrations of labeled proteins were determined by Bradford's method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Protein Binding Assay to A549 Type II Human Lung Epithelial Cells—A549 cells were suspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 25 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 5.5 × 10-5m 2-mercaptoethanol (complete culture medium), and 1 ml of cell suspensions was dispensed into individual wells of a 24-well plate (BD Biosciences). Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 for 24 h. The nonadherent cells were poured off, and the residual nonadherent cells were removed by washing with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium twice and refilled with 200 μl of complete culture medium. fluos-labeled MDP1, BSA, or HBHA was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm, and the mixture was incubated for 0-5 h. In experiments of enzymatic treatment, epithelial cells were treated with heparinase 1, hyaluronidase, or chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) before incubation with proteins. One unit of each enzyme was added into each well and incubated for 2 h in PBS at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Then enzymes were removed by washing with PBS twice and incubated with fluos-labeled proteins. After the incubation, wells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C to remove non-adherent proteins. Then cells were detached by using cell scrapers and collected in a tube and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. After removing supernatant, cells were fixed by adding 1 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde-PBS. Fixed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using Cellquest™ software (BD Biosciences). Construction of Mycobacteria Expressing Green Fluorescent Protein—A BamHI-EcoRI 0.7-kbp fragment from the vector pEGFP (BD Biosciences) containing the gene encoding GFP was introduced into the E. coli-mycobacteria shuttle vector pMV261 (23Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs W. R., Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) to generate the plasmid pMV261GFP. This plasmid was introduced into BCG by electroporation, and kanamycin-resistant BCG colonies were selected after 3 weeks of culture on Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing oleic acid, dextrose, albumin, and catalase enrichment (Difco, 7H11-OADC agar) in the presence of 20 μg/ml kanamycin. The expression of GFP was confirmed by confocal laser microscopy LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experimental Infection in Vitro—Mycobacterial suspension was prepared by the conventional method (24Molloy A. Laochumroonvorapong P. Kaplan G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) after harvesting bacteria in 7H9 media (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin, dextrose, and catalase enrichment (Difco) and 0.05% Tween 80 at 37 °C until 0.6 of optical density at 650 nm. Bacterial suspensions were added to A549 epithelial cells at multiplicities of infection ranging from 1 to 10 bacteria/epithelial cell. After either 6- or 24-h incubation, unbound bacteria were washed with RPMI 1640 medium three times, and adherent epithelial cells were collected by scraping with rubber policeman. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the cell suspension were cultivated on 7H11-OADC agar. Colonies were counted after 3 weeks incubation at 37 °C. Cells infected with BCG expressing GFP were assessed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) as described in the fluos-labeled protein binding assay. Experimental Infection in Vivo—Female C57BL/6 mice, 7 weeks of age (Japan Clea, Suita, Osaka, Japan), were challenged intratracheally with 1 × 106 CFUs of BCG in the presence or absence of 50 μg of HA. At 2 weeks of infection, lungs of mice were removed aseptically and homogenized individually with a set of motor and pestle. The homogenate was plated on 7H11-OADC agars after 10-fold serial dilution. Mycobacterial colonies were counted 3 weeks after the culture. Statistical Analyses—Data were analyzed by Power Macintosh G4 using StatView 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Data that appeared statistically significant were compared by an analysis of variance for comparing the means of multiple groups and considered significant if p values were less than 0.05. Cellular Localization of MDP1—We examined cellular localization of MDP1 by both biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Subcellular fractions obtained from BCG were examined by Western blot analysis by anti-MDP1 antisera (Fig. 1A). The result showed anti-MDP1 antibody reacted with the bands in the cell wall and the membrane-ribosome fractions. In contrast, antibody failed to react with cytoplasmic fraction and culture filtrates. Next immunogold electron microscopic examination was carried out. Protein A-coupled with gold particles did not react with the section (Fig. 1B). In contrast, anti-MDP1 antibody reacted with both inside and outside mycobacteria (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that MDP1 localizes on/in the cell wall as well as intracellular ribosome and membrane fractions. This agrees with previous findings (11Matsumoto S. Yukitake H. Furugen M. Matsuo T. Mineta T. Yamada T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Shimoji Y. Ng V. Matsumura K. Fischetti V.A. Rambukkana A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9857-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Amino Acids Sequence Homology between MDP1 and HBHA—Sequence alignments among BCG-MDP1, M. tuberculosis-MDP1, and M. tuberculosis-HBHA were carried out by a malign program through the DNA data base of Japan (Fig. 2). BCG-MDP1 revealed a lack of nine amino acids from M. tuberculosis-MDP1, and the identity of amino acid sequences was 95%. The total sequence homology between MDP1 and HBHA was low (BCG-MDP1 and HBHA, 35%; M. tuberculosis-MDP1 and HBHA, 34%), although both proteins possessed the conserved region in the C-terminal (Fig. 2). HBHA possessed a heparin-binding site in the C-terminal region, and four PAKK repetitive sequences are key residues for binding to GAGs (25Delogu G. Brennan M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7464-7649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pethe K. Aumercier M. Fort E. Gatot C. Locht C. M"
https://openalex.org/W2112456436,"The rhodopsin regulatory protein, visual arrestin, undergoes light-dependent trafficking in mammalian and Drosophila photoreceptor cells, though the mechanisms underlying these movements are poorly understood. In Drosophila, the movement of the visual arrestin, Arr2, functions in long-term adaptation and is dependent on interaction with phosphoinositides (PIs). However, the basis for the requirement for PIs for light-dependent shuttling was unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the dynamic trafficking of Arr2 into the phototransducing compartment, the rhabdomere, required the eye-enriched myosin III, NINAC. We showed that defects in ninaC resulted in a long-term adaptation phenotype similar to that which occurred in arr2 mutants. The interaction between Arr2 and NINAC was PI dependent and NINAC bound directly to PIs. These data demonstrate that the light-dependent translocation of Arr2 into the rhabdomeres requires PI-mediated interactions between Arr2 and the NINAC myosin III."
https://openalex.org/W1996536318,"Several members of the FXYD protein family are tissue-specific regulators of Na,K-ATPase that produce distinct effects on its apparent K(+) and Na(+) affinity. Little is known about the interaction sites between the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit and FXYD proteins that mediate the efficient association and/or the functional effects of FXYD proteins. In this study, we have analyzed the role of the transmembrane segment TM9 of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit in the structural and functional interaction with FXYD2, FXYD4, and FXYD7. Mutational analysis combined with expression in Xenopus oocytes reveals that Phe(956), Glu(960), Leu(964), and Phe(967) in TM9 of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit represent one face interacting with the three FXYD proteins. Leu(964) and Phe(967) contribute to the efficient association of FXYD proteins with the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit, whereas Phe(956) and Glu(960) are essential for the transmission of the functional effect of FXYD proteins on the apparent K(+) affinity of Na,K-ATPase. The relative contribution of Phe(956) and Glu(960) to the K(+) effect differs for different FXYD proteins, probably reflecting the intrinsic differences of FXYD proteins on the apparent K(+) affinity of Na,K-ATPase. In contrast to the effect on the apparent K(+) affinity, Phe(956) and Glu(960) are not involved in the effect of FXYD2 and FXYD4 on the apparent Na(+) affinity of Na,K-ATPase. The mutational analysis is in good agreement with a docking model of the Na,K-ATPase/FXYD7 complex, which also predicts the importance of Phe(956), Glu(960), Leu(964), and Phe(967) in subunit interaction. In conclusion, by using mutational analysis and modeling, we show that TM9 of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit exposes one face of the helix that interacts with FXYD proteins and contributes to the stable interaction with FXYD proteins, as well as mediating the effect of FXYD proteins on the apparent K(+) affinity of Na,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2090443124,"During axon guidance, the ventral guidance of the Caenorhabditis elegans anterior ventral microtubule axon is controlled by two cues, the UNC-6/netrin attractant recognized by the UNC-40/DCC receptor and the SLT-1/slit repellent recognized by the SAX-3/robo receptor. We show here that loss-of-function mutations in clr-1 enhance netrin-dependent attraction, suppressing ventral guidance defects in slt-1 mutants. clr-1 encodes a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) that functions in AVM to inhibit signaling through the DCC family receptor UNC-40 and its effector, UNC-34/enabled. The known effects of other RPTPs in axon guidance could result from modulation of guidance receptors like UNC-40/DCC."
https://openalex.org/W1984985808,"Airway submucosal gland serous cells express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and secrete antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant molecules. In cystic fibrosis, diminished gland secretion may impair innate airway host defenses. We used Calu-3 cells as a serous cell model to study the types of proteins released, the pathways that release them, and the possible involvement of CFTR activity in protein release. Many proteins were secreted constitutively into the apical fluid and showed increased release to agonists. We identified some of them by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and reverse transcriptase PCR, including lysozyme, siderocalin (the protein NGAL), which inhibits bacterial growth by binding iron-containing siderophores, HSC-71, which is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties, and the serine protease inhibitors α-1-antitrypsin and α-1-antichymotrypsin, which may function as antimicrobials as well as play a potential role in diminishing the activation of epithelial Na+ channels by serine proteases. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify lysozyme secretion by Calu-3 cells in response to various agonists and inhibitors. Forskolin increased the lysozyme secretion rate (Jlyz) from 32 to 77 ng/hr/cm2 (n = 36, p < 0.005). Thapsigargin increased Jlyz from 40 to 63 ng/h/cm2 (n = 16, p < 0.005), and forskolin plus thapsigargin further increased the forskolin-stimulated Jlyz by 48% (n = 9, p < 0.05). 1-Ethyl-benzimidazolinone and carbachol were less effective. Glibenclamide inhibited basal and stimulated Jlyz, but clotrimazole was without effect. CFTRinh172 caused a small (15%) but significant inhibition of forskolin-stimulated Jlyz without affecting basal Jlyz. Thus, Calu-3 cells secrete diverse proteins that in aggregate would be expected to suppress microbial growth, protect the airways from damage, and limit the activation of epithelial Na+ channels via serine proteases. Airway submucosal gland serous cells express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and secrete antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant molecules. In cystic fibrosis, diminished gland secretion may impair innate airway host defenses. We used Calu-3 cells as a serous cell model to study the types of proteins released, the pathways that release them, and the possible involvement of CFTR activity in protein release.

We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify lysozyme secretion by Calu-3 cells in response to various agonists and inhibitors. Forskolin increased the lysozyme secretion rate (Jlyz) from 32 to 77 ng/hr/cm2 (n = 36, p < 0.005). Thapsigargin increased Jlyz from 40 to 63 ng/h/cm2 (n = 16, p < 0.005), and forskolin plus thapsigargin further increased the forskolin-stimulated Jlyz by 48% (n = 9, p < 0.05). 1-Ethyl-benzimidazolinone and carbachol were less effective. Glibenclamide inhibited basal and stimulated Jlyz, but clotrimazole was without effect. CFTRinh172 caused a small (15%) but significant inhibition of forskolin-stimulated Jlyz without affecting basal Jlyz. Thus, Calu-3 cells secrete diverse proteins that in aggregate would be expected to suppress microbial growth, protect the airways from damage, and limit the activation of epithelial Na+ channels via serine proteases. The main function of the airways is to conduct air to and from the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli for gas exchange. Airborne particles, including pathogens, are adsorbed by the mucus layer lining the airways, where they are inactivated by the innate mucosal defense system and removed via mucociliary and cough clearance.

That leads to a process of inflammation that eventually occludes and destroys the airways. Most of the mucus lining the upper airways is produced by submucosal glands, and gland secretion is defective in CF (1Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50710-50715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Glands are complex structures that comprise a ciliated duct connected to a non-ciliated collecting duct into which multiple tubules empty. Each tubule is lined by mucous cells in its proximal part and serous cells at the distal ends. Serous cells are reported to secrete a rich mixture of proteins that have antimicrobial, antiprotease, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions, although there is to date relatively little direct evidence of such secretion. Within submucosal glands, serous cells are the main site for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression. Studies of submucosal gland secretion performed in animals, healthy human subjects, and humans with cystic fibrosis have led to a model in which cholinergic stimulation, which elevates [Ca2+]i, leads to secretion from both mucous and serous cells, whereas stimulation with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which elevates [cAMP]i, stimulates only serous cells. In cystic fibrosis, secretion to VIP or forskolin is completely lost (1Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50710-50715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas the response to cholinergic stimulation is altered, which leads to thicker mucus (2Jayaraman S.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Joo et al. interpreted their results with a model of gland secretion in which the lack of functional CFTR causes the electrolyte-driven fluid secretion from serous cells to be deleted, leaving protein secretion intact (1Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50710-50715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, because no mucus is observed leaving CF gland ducts after stimulation with VIP, these results imply that the proteins are trapped within the glands. An alternative view is that CFTR mediates the secretion of mucins and serous proteins and that its loss will cause CF mucus to have a diminished complement of defense molecules (4McPherson M.A. Pereira M.M. Russell D. McNeilly C.M. Morris R.M. Stratford F.L. Dormer R.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 443: S121-S126Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The inaccessibility of serous cells makes them difficult to study directly. Therefore, the Calu-3 cell line, a serous cell model, has been used as a surrogate to study fluid and protein secretion (5Moon S. Singh M. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1208-L1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Calu-3 cells are capable of releasing proteins such as glycoproteins/mucins and lysozyme in response to cAMP agonists (4McPherson M.A. Pereira M.M. Russell D.

In this study, we harvested uncontaminated mucus secreted by porcine glands and collected apical fluid from Calu-3 cells, analyzing bands via silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. We then identified five proteins not previously known to be secreted by either glands or Calu-3 cells and reviewed evidence that they inhibit serine proteases and have antimicrobial functions. Because airway surface ENaCs are known to be activated by serine proteases, the secretion of serine protease inhibitors by gland serous cells could play a role in diminishing Na+-driven fluid absorption via ENaCs. We also demonstrate that proteins are released in response to elevations of either [Ca2+]i or [cAMP]i, with the latter pathway being more effective in Calu-3 cells. Our attempts to implicate CFTR in protein release were not conclusive; the most effective and specific CFTR inhibitor we used, CFTRinh172 (3Thiagarajah J.R. Song Y. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), produced only a slight (but significant) decrease in forskolin-stimulated lysozyme release. Tissues and Mucus Collection—Porcine tracheas were harvested <1 h postmortem from adult Yorkshire pigs that had been killed after acute experiments unrelated to the present studies. Tissue was maintained until use in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate composition was 115 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4), and osmolarity was adjusted to ∼290 mosm. To minimize endogenously generated prostaglandins, 1 μm indomethacin was present in the bath throughout the experiment. The experimental setup for the agonist-stimulated mucus secretion was as described previously (9Trout L. Corboz M.R. Ballard S.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L639-L645PubMed Google Scholar, 10Joo N.S.

Physiol. 2001; 281: L458-L468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted mucus bubbles were collected by aspiration and stored at -20 °C until use. Calu-3 Cell Culture and Apical Fluid Collection—Calu-3 cells were grown in a T25 tissue culture flask containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged once a week with 1:8 dilutions and plated at 5 × 105 cells/cm2 onto Costar Snapwell filters (12-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size, ∼1 cm2 growing area) that had been coated with human placental collagen (Sigma). Cells on filters were grown at an air/liquid interface after 2-3 days of an initial submerged culture and used within 2-4 weeks when they reached confluence. A day before apical fluid collection, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (minimal medium), and the apical surface was washed multiple times with minimal medium. Transepithelial resistance and transepithelial potential difference of the cell monolayers were measured with Millicell chopstick electrodes (Millipore). Confluent cells were incubated in the presence of apical 200-μl minimal medium and basolateral medium with or without a vehicle or an agonist in a highly humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 2 h. To investigate the potential involvement of CFTR in the process of protein secretion by Calu-3 cells, Calu-3 monolayers were apically pretreated with a vehicle or a known inhibitor of ion transport/fluid secretion for 20 min and then followed by 2 h of incubation with the basolateral medium containing a vehicle or an agonist with or without an inhibitor. Secreted apical fluid was collected after incubation, and another 200 μl of minimal medium was added apically to complete the fluid collection. The collected fluid was briefly centrifuged at 3000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415 centrifuge) to remove any cellular debris. The supernatant was stored at minus 20 °C until use. SDS Gel, Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-flight Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Secreted proteins from gland mucus or Calu-3 apical fluid were separated and visualized on silver-stained 10-20% gradient Tris-Tricine SDS polyacrylamide gels (Ready Gel; Bio-Rad). Selected bands were excised from the SDS gels and digested by trypsin. Peptide mixtures were analyzed using LC-MS. The acquired mass spectra from trypsin-digested products were compared with the known trypsin digest protein sequence data base using Mascot software (Matrix Science). An ELISA for human lysozyme was initially carried out with a kit from Biomedical Technologies Inc. We then developed an in-house ELISA for human lysozyme. Briefly, rabbit anti-lysozyme antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was coated onto 96-well ELISA plates at 5 μg/ml using 50 mm carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Sigma). Coating was done by overnight incubation at 4 °C in the presence of 1% nonfat dried milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Tween. After the removal of the blocking solution and the washing of the ELISA plate 3-5 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBS-Tween), Calu-3 apical fluid samples diluted 1:3 in PBS and human neutrophil lysozyme standards (Sigma) were incubated in the plate for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was washed 3-5 times with PBS-Tween and then incubated with diluted (1:1500 in blocking buffer) secondary antibody (Calbiochem sheep anti-human lysozyme) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3-5 washes with PBS-Tween, the plate was incubated with a diluted (1:5000 blocking buffer) detection antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. rabbit anti-sheep IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate) for 1 h. The plate was washed 3-5 times with PBS-Tween and incubated with the substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 20 min in the dark. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded using an automated ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Reagents—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise and maintained as aliquots of stock concentrations. A stock solution for carbachol was made in deionized water, and forskolin, thapsigargin, 1-ethyl-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO), CFTRinh172, and clotrimazole were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). CFTRinh172 was kindly provided by Drs. Alan Verkman (University of California, San Francisco) and Jack Stutts (University of North Carolina). Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless indicated otherwise. Student's t test for paired data was used to compare the means of different treatment groups. The difference between the two means was considered to be significant when p < 0.05. Identification of Secreted Proteins—Uncontaminated submucosal gland mucus from porcine tracheas was evaluated with the silver staining of Tris-Tricine SDS gradient gels (Fig. 1). Under the conditions used, at least 40 bands, from ∼5 to 200 kDa, could be resolved. No differences were found between forskolin- or carbachol-induced mucus in either the number or intensities of the bands, indicating that these two methods of stimulation have equivalent effects on the protein secretion by submucosal glands (Fig. 1a). The same methods were used to evaluate apical secretions collected from unstimulated (basal) and forskolin-stimulated Calu-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1b, no silver-stained bands were found from the lane of apical washings from Calu-3 cells taken right before the 2 h incubation (WO lane). The absence of proteins in the preincubation wash fluid proves that washing did not release a burst of secretion or dislodge detectable levels of cells. Forskolin stimulation increased the quantity of protein secreted, but there was no evidence for additional bands or an alteration in the relative band intensities for stimulated versus basally secreted proteins, suggesting that no proteins were secreted either purely constitutively or purely in response to stimulation. Our cells typically have some basal level of a short circuit current (Isc) and fluid secretion, and the question of whether this represents a low grade of stimulation by unknown factors has not been resolved. Although carbachol was a potent stimulus for gland protein secretion (Fig. 1a), it was less effective in stimulating protein secretion from Calu-3 cells (gel data not shown; see ELISA results). A comparison of forskolin-stimulated gland and Calu-3 secretions indicated that our collection methods (see “Materials and Methods”) yield less total protein from Calu-3 cells versus glands. Nevertheless, although not immediately apparent in Fig. 1, many bands of comparable molecular weight and comparable relative intensities were observed in the silver-stained SDS gels from glands and Calu-3 cells, and some of these were selected for further analysis using LC-MS. Six proteins secreted by Calu-3 cells were identified using LC-MS, namely lysozyme, α-1-antichymotrypsin, α-1-antitrypsin, siderocalin (represented here by two proteins, the neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin precursor lipocalin-2 and its processed form, NGAL), and the heat shock cognate protein HSC71. Because the 198-amino acid NGAL precursor lipocalin-2 (∼ 22.8 kDa) and the 178-amino acid NGAL (∼20.7 kDa) are not clearly distinguished in terms of function, we discuss them together as siderocalin (12Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). A representative LC-MS analysis for α-1 antitrypsin is shown in Fig. 1c. Analysis for two bands was inconclusive. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of Calu-3 lysates was used to confirm the presence of transcripts for these five proteins (counting NGAL and lipocalin-2 as one protein) using primers designed on reported sequences of each protein. We detected clear evidence for the expression of all of them in Calu-3 lysates (data not shown). The complementary results from reverse transcriptase PCR and LC-MS provide evidence that these proteins were correctly identified and are indeed secreted into the apical media by Calu-3 cells. We consider it significant that antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory. or anti-proteolytic actions have been reported for each of these proteins (see below) Lysozyme was the first natural antimicrobial to be discovered and is abundant and well studied. It is secreted by human submucosal glands and Calu-3 cells (7Dubin R.F. Robinson S.K. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L750-L755Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and was used in this study as an archetype to quantify the effects of agonists and inhibitors on protein secretion (see next section). α-1-Antichymotrypsin and α-1-antitrypsin are members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family and are major protein components of the lung epithelial lining fluid, where they may also function as innate defense molecules against bacteria and viruses (13Sallenave J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 111-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cellular origin within the lung of these inhibitors of serine proteases has not been demonstrated. Our results suggest that gland serous cells are one source. The presence of α-1-antitrypsin and α-1-antichymotrypsin is of particular interest, because the activity of the ENaC is activated, at least in part, by serine proteases (14Adachi M. Kitamura K. Miyoshi T. Narikiyo T. Iwashita K. Shiraishi N. Nonoguchi H. Tomita K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well documented that serine protease inhibitors protect the respiratory tract from proteolytic damage (15Parfrey H. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Loss of functional CFTR in airways increases Na+-driven fluid absorption by surface epithelial cells because of the increased activity of ENaC. Extracellular serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin can increase ENaC activity, whereas a serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin, decreases ENaC activity (16Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that a balance between serine proteases, (such as trypsin, channel-activating serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G) and serine protease inhibitors (such as α-1-antichymotrypsin and α-1-antitrypsin) may be important for maintaining optimal properties of airway mucus. This hypothesis provides an additional mechanism to link CFTR and ENaC; in CF, the diminished surface availability of gland-derived serine protease inhibitors might further enhance fluid absorption and further dehydrate airway mucus. HSC 71 is also called lipopolysaccharide-associated protein 1 or heat shock 70 kDa protein 10. In general, heat shock proteins are regarded as intracellular chaperones that aid the folding and assembly of oligomeric proteins and as intracellular proteases that mediate ubiquitin-dependent degradation of certain proteins via proteosomes. However, heat shock proteins, including HSC 71, can be released into the extracellular milieu under physiological conditions within small membrane-bound vesicles termed exosomes (17Trams E.G. Lauter C.J. Salem Jr., N. Heine U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 645: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) by a number of cell types, including epithelial cells (18van Niel G. Raposo G. Candalh C. Boussac M. Hershberg R. Cerf-Bensussan N. Heyman M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins are found in the peripheral circulation of healthy people, where they are thought to function as anti-inflammatory molecules because of their immune responses to pathogenic microbes (19Pockley A.G. Lancet. 2003; 362: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that they may serve the same function in airway surface liquid. The occurrence of HSC71 in exosomes raises the possibility that its release may be entirely constitutive. However, the band identified as HSC71 was clearly darker in stimulated preparations, and we found no evidence of any bands that were unaffected by stimulation (data not shown). Siderocalin (NGAL), originally identified as a protein stored in neutrophil granules, is a member of the lipocalin superfamily, so named because of the ability of its members to bind the lipophilic components of ligands. However, whereas NGAL binds lipids with only millimolar affinity, it was recently shown (in a remarkable study that included crystallographic evidence for binding) that NGAL binds bacterial catecholate-type ferric siderophores with subnanomolar affinity (12Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). As pointed out by Goetz et al. (12Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), the binding of siderophores will complement iron sequestering by lactoferrin to starve bacteria of iron and is potentially much more efficient because it targets iron already bound for bacterial use. They showed directly that NGAL is bacteriostatic and argue that the recognition machinery of NGAL should allow a large range of catecholate-type siderophores to be bound. Because siderophores and not lipids are the natural ligands of NGAL, the authors propose that NGAL be renamed siderocalin (12Goetz D.H. Holmes M.A. Borregaard N. Bluhm M.E. Raymond K.N. Strong R.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1033-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Quantification of Protein Secretion Using Lysozyme as a Marker Protein—As shown above, lysozyme is one of many proteins secreted into the apical fluid by unstimulated Calu-3 cells. Because relative band densities were maintained across different stimulation conditions, we used lysozyme as a representative protein for the quantification of apically secreted proteins. The lysozyme secretion rate in ng/hr/cm2 was measured by ELISA in the presence or absence of an agonist or an antagonist. The confluent Calu-3 monolayers used in the ELISA experiments had a mean transepithelial resistance of 600 ± 16 Ω·cm2 and a mean transepithelial potential difference of 9.2 ± 0.2 mV (n = 205, apical negative). Basal and agonist treatments were done for 2-h periods in a highly humidified CO2 incubator. Unstimulated Calu-3 cells secreted lysozyme basally at an average rate of 31.7 ± 2.3 ng/h/cm2 (range 8-91 ng/h/cm2, n = 51). Forskolin Stimulated Lysozyme Secretion—Forskolin (10 μm), which directly activates adenylate cyclase to increase [cAMP]i, significantly increased the lysozyme secretion rate from 31.7 ± 3.0 to 77.3 ± 9.1 ng/h/cm2 (160.5 ± 28.8%, n = 36, p < 0.005; Fig. 2a). The percentage increase in lysozyme secretion is much larger than the percentage increases in Isc (20Cowley E.A. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or fluid secretion (21Irokawa T. Krouse M.E. Joo N.S. Wu J.V. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287 (in press)Google Scholar) induced by forskolin in Calu-3 cells. The rates for both unstimulated and forskolin-stimulated lysozyme secretion were relatively constant during the 2-h measurement periods (Fig. 2b). The constant rate of forskolin-stimulated lysozyme secretion is consistent with the rates of forskolin-stimulated gland mucus secretion, which are also constant over time (1Joo N.S. Irokawa T. Wu J.V. Robbins R.C. Whyte R.I. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50710-50715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28167-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We did not find any evidence that mechanical stimulation during the apical fluid collection process caused increased lysozyme secretion. To determine whether a relationship existed between basal and forskolin-stimulated lysozyme secretion, the magnitudes of basal and forskolin-stimulated lysozyme secretion rates for the same monolayer were plotted. As shown Fig. 2c, the rates are positively correlated (r2 = 0.4). This result eliminates the possibility that larger increases were observed in cells with low basal rates of secretion. Carbachol- and Thapsigargin-stimulated Lysozyme Secretion—The cholinergic agonist carbachol is a potent secretagogue for mucus secretion from airway submucosal glands (Fig. 1a). Cholinergic agents cause a fast and transient burst of mucus secretion followed by sustained secretion at a rate that is much slower than that for the initial transient burst but is still usually 2-3 times greater than the rate of sustained secretion to forskolin or VIP (10Joo N.S. Saenz Y. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28167-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, in Calu-3 cells lysozyme secretion was only modestly stimulated by carbachol (100 μm), increasing from 24.1 ± 4.1 to 31.6 ± 5.7 ng/h/cm2 (40.3 ± 24.5%, n = 11, p < 0.05; Fig. 3a). In Isc experiments with Calu-3 cells, the Isc response to carbachol is large but transient, with little or no sustained increase (5Moon S. Singh M. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1208-L1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the rapid adaptation of the Calu-3 Isc response to carbachol is not known, but if the Isc spike represents a spike in [Ca2+]i and if carbachol-stimulated lysozyme secretion is mediated by increases in [Ca2+]i, then any initial large spike in lysozyme secretion would be averaged over the 2-h sample period of our experiments. However, an alternative possibility is that the lysozyme secretion from Calu-3 cells is driven by some aspect of muscarinic stimulation other than an increase in [Ca2+]i. To test more directly the effect of increased [Ca2+]i on lysozyme secretion, we treated cells with thapsigargin, a selective inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase that blocks Ca2+"
https://openalex.org/W2055364518,"5-Oxo-ETE (5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) is a highly potent granulocyte chemoattractant that acts through a selective G-protein coupled receptor. It is formed by oxidation of the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-HETE (5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (5-HEDH). Although leukocytes and platelets display high microsomal 5-HEDH activity, unstimulated intact cells do not convert 5-HETE to appreciable amounts of 5-oxo-ETE. To attempt to resolve this dilemma we explored the possibility that 5-oxo-ETE synthesis could be enhanced by oxidative stress. We found that hydrogen peroxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide strongly stimulate 5-oxo-ETE formation by U937 monocytic cells. This was dependent on the GSH redox cycle, as it was blocked by depletion of GSH or inhibition of glutathione reductase and mimicked by oxidation of GSH to GSSG by diamide. Glucose inhibited the response to H2O2 through its metabolism by the pentose phosphate pathway, as its effect was reversed by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor dehydroepiandrosterone. 5-Oxo-ETE synthesis was also strongly stimulated by hydroperoxides in blood monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets, but not neutrophils. Unlike monocytic cells, lymphocytes and platelets were resistant to the inhibitory effects of glucose. 5-Oxo-ETE synthesis following incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with arachidonic acid and calcium ionophore was also strongly enhanced by t-butyl hydroperoxide. Oxidative stress could act by depleting NADPH, resulting in the formation NADP+, the cofactor for 5-HEDH. This is opposed by the pentose phosphate pathway, which converts NADP+ back to NADPH. Oxidative stress could be an important mechanism for stimulating 5-oxo-ETE production in inflammation, promoting further infiltration of granulocytes into inflammatory sites. 5-Oxo-ETE (5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) is a highly potent granulocyte chemoattractant that acts through a selective G-protein coupled receptor. It is formed by oxidation of the 5-lipoxygenase product 5-HETE (5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (5-HEDH). Although leukocytes and platelets display high microsomal 5-HEDH activity, unstimulated intact cells do not convert 5-HETE to appreciable amounts of 5-oxo-ETE. To attempt to resolve this dilemma we explored the possibility that 5-oxo-ETE synthesis could be enhanced by oxidative stress. We found that hydrogen peroxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide strongly stimulate 5-oxo-ETE formation by U937 monocytic cells. This was dependent on the GSH redox cycle, as it was blocked by depletion of GSH or inhibition of glutathione reductase and mimicked by oxidation of GSH to GSSG by diamide. Glucose inhibited the response to H2O2 through its metabolism by the pentose phosphate pathway, as its effect was reversed by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor dehydroepiandrosterone. 5-Oxo-ETE synthesis was also strongly stimulated by hydroperoxides in blood monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets, but not neutrophils. Unlike monocytic cells, lymphocytes and platelets were resistant to the inhibitory effects of glucose. 5-Oxo-ETE synthesis following incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with arachidonic acid and calcium ionophore was also strongly enhanced by t-butyl hydroperoxide. Oxidative stress could act by depleting NADPH, resulting in the formation NADP+, the cofactor for 5-HEDH. This is opposed by the pentose phosphate pathway, which converts NADP+ back to NADPH. Oxidative stress could be an important mechanism for stimulating 5-oxo-ETE production in inflammation, promoting further infiltration of granulocytes into inflammatory sites. The 5-lipoxygenase pathway is critical in inflammation, because it gives rise to a number of potent inflammatory mediators, including leukotriene (LT) 1The abbreviations used are: LT, leukotriene; BCNU, 1,2-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitrosourea (carmustine); BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 5-HETE, 5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; 13-HODE, 13S-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid; 13-HpODE, 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid; 5-HEDH, 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMS, phenazine methosulfate; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; tBuOOH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 1The abbreviations used are: LT, leukotriene; BCNU, 1,2-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitrosourea (carmustine); BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; 5-HETE, 5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; 13-HODE, 13S-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid; 13-HpODE, 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid; 5-HEDH, 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; 5-oxo-ETE, 5-oxo-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMS, phenazine methosulfate; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; tBuOOH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

This receptor is quite distinct from all other eicosanoid receptors and is highly expressed on eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes, in that order (11Hosoi T. Koguchi Y. Sugikawa E. Chikada A.

The regulation of 5-oxo-ETE biosynthesis is not well understood, and it can be formed both enzymatically (13Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and non-enzymatically via lipid peroxidation (14Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1024-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is formed enzymatically by the oxidation of 5S-hydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase (5-HEDH), a highly selective NADP+-dependent microsomal enzyme that is present in human neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets (13Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Styhler A. Powell W.S. J. Leukoc.

Alternatively, 5-oxo-ETE can be formed directly from 5-hydroperoxy-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HpETE) by murine macrophages, but not human neutrophils, in the presence of a cytosolic protein (17Zarini S. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11190-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this reaction may be akin to that previously reported for the decomposition of hydroperoxy fatty acids in the presence of heme-containing proteins (18Hamberg M. Lipids. 1975; 10: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Unlike 5-HEDH, the pathway in murine macrophages is not stereoselective for the S configuration at C5 (17Zarini S. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11190-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of very high 5-HEDH activity in microsomal fractions from inflammatory cells, unstimulated intact cells form only very small amounts of 5-oxo-ETE when incubated with 5-HETE. This may be because of limited availability of NADP+, which is present at very low levels in the cytosol, as cells maintain this cofactor in its reduced state (NADPH) as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress (19Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, 5-oxo-ETE synthesis is dramatically increased by stimulation of the respiratory burst, which would increase the levels of NADP+ in the cytosol (20Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25373-25380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that other factors that affect the NADP+ levels in cells could also regulate 5-oxo-ETE synthesis. Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide and H2O2, are formed at inflammatory sites and in pathological states associated with leukocyte infiltration (21Bowler R.P. Crapo J.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Nedeljkovic Z.S. Gokce N. Loscalzo J. Postgrad. Med. J. 2003; 79: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). H2O2, which is formed from superoxide by superoxide dismutase, can cause cellular damage and oxidize protein thiol groups, thereby affecting the activities of various intracellular signaling molecules (23Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7276) Google Scholar). It can also affect the cellular redox status, as a major pathway for its inactivation is its GSH-dependent reduction to H2O by glutathione peroxidase (19Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). This results in the formation of GSSG, which is recycled to GSH by glutathione reductase, which concomitantly oxidizes NADPH to NADP+. The latter is in turn reduced back to NADPH by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which uses glucose 6-phosphate as its initial substrate, and is a major defense mechanism against oxidative stress. It seemed possible that the impact of oxidative stress on NADP+ levels could be sufficient to enhance 5-oxo-ETE synthesis. Although our preliminary experiments with neutrophils did not appear to support this hypothesis, further studies using U-937 monocytic cells indicated that in these cells oxidative stress is indeed a very strong stimulus for 5-oxo-ETE formation. This also proved to be true for blood monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets, with neutrophils being the only exception. The effects of oxidative stress and the respiratory burst on 5-oxo-ETE synthesis could potentially be opposed by the PPP, depending on its ability to reduce NADP+ compared with the rate of formation of NADP+ by glutathione reductase or NADPH oxidase. This proved to be the case for U-937 cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, but not for lymphocytes and platelets. Materials—5-HETE was prepared by total organic synthesis (24Zamboni R. Rokach J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 999-1002Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 13S-Hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HpODE) were prepared by oxidation of linoleic acid with soybean lipoxygenase Type 1B (Sigma) (25Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5329-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5S-HpETE was purchased from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phenazine methosulfate (PMS), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH), H2O2, 1,2-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitrosourea (BCNU; carmustine), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and diamide were purchased from Sigma. Auranofin was obtained from ALEXIS Corporation (Lausen, Switzerland). Sodium azide and glucose were purchased from Fisher Scientific. RPMI 1640 and other products for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. U937 Cells—U937 cells, obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum in modified RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (2 mm), sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/liter), glucose (4.5 g/liter), HEPES (25 mm), and sodium pyruvate (1.0 mm). Cells were maintained at a density of 0.1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml. Preparation of Blood Cells—Neutrophils were prepared by treatment of whole blood with Dextran T-500 (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min, followed by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) and hypotonic lysis of any remaining red blood cells in the pellet (13Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19233-19241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neutrophils were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS–, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, and 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Human monocytes were prepared as described in the literature (26Fischer D.G. Hubbard W.J. Koren H.S. Cell. Immunol. 1981; 58: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), present at the interface after centrifugation of leukocytes over Ficoll-Paque as described above, were washed by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold RPMI 1640 (4 °C). The washed cells (2 × 107 cells in 10 ml per dish) were then added to Corning tissue culture dishes (Fisher, Nepean, Ontario, Canada) that had been pretreated with 1.5 ml of autologous plasma for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C the loosely adherent lymphocytes were removed with gentle streams of the culture medium from a 10-ml pipette. The lymphocytes were aspirated and the wash-aspiration procedure was repeated twice more with RPMI at 37 °C and then with PBS– at 4 °C. The monocyte-enriched adherent cells were detached from the plastic by incubation for 30 min with ice-cold 2 mm EDTA in PBS– in the cold room, followed by removal with a rubber policeman. For preparation of platelets, whole blood (20 ml) was collected in medium (2.8 ml) containing citric acid (15.5 mm), sodium citrate (90 mm), NaH2PO4 (16 mm), dextrose (161 mm), and adenine (2 mm) (16Powell W.S. Gravel S. Khanapure S.P. Rokach J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 200 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of medium containing 94 mm citrate and 140 mm dextrose, pH 6.5. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was suspended in PBS– to give a platelet concentration of 3 × 108 cells/ml. Preparation of Microsomal Fractions from U937 Cells—Cells were washed by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 ml of PBS– supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by sonication at a setting of 40 cycles/s (model 4710 ultrasonic homogenizer, Sonics and Materials, Newtown, CT) on ice for 5 × 6 s with 30-s intervals for cooling. The disruptate was successively centrifuged at 4 °C at 1,500 × g for 10 min, 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 150,000 × g for 80 min and the final pellet resuspended in PBS–. Protein was measured with the Bio-Rad DC (detergent compatible) protein assay kit and adjusted to a concentration of 150 μg/ml. Incubation Conditions—Unless otherwise indicated, incubations were performed in PBS– supplemented with calcium (1.8 mm) and magnesium (1 mm) (PBS+) in the absence of glucose. Suspensions (1 ml) of U937 cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils (2 × 106 cells/ml), platelets (108 cells/ml), or U937 cell microsomes (150 μg of protein/ml) were incubated with 5-HETE (1 μm) for 5 min unless otherwise indicated.

The concentration of methanol in each sample was adjusted to 30% by addition of water and either 13-HODE (120 ng) or prostaglandin B2 (130 ng) were added as internal standards. Eicosanoids were analyzed by precolumn extraction/RP-HPLC (27Powell W.S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using a Waters Millenium system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Products were quantitated by comparing the areas of their peaks of UV absorbance at their λmax with that of the internal standard. The extinction coefficients used were: 5-HETE (235 nm; 27,000), 5-oxo-ETE (280 nm, 20,500), 5-oxo-20-HETE (280 nm, 20,5000), LTB4 (270 nm, 39,500), prostaglandin B2 (280 nm, 28,680), and 13-HODE (235 nm, 23,000). The identities of the products measured were confirmed by examination of their complete UV spectra. Data Analysis—The results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. “n” refers to the number of separate experiments performed. In the case of blood cells, a different donor was used for each experiment. Oxidant Stress Enhances the Synthesis of 5-Oxo-ETE—As U937 cells possess high 5-HEDH activity, they were used as a model to investigate the effects of oxidative stress induced by H2O2 on 5-oxo-ETE synthesis. Following incubation of these cells with 5-HETE (1 μm) in the presence or absence of H2O2 (100 μm), the amounts of 5-oxo-ETE were measured by HPLC using 13-HODE as an internal standard. In the absence of H2O2 very little 5-oxo-ETE was detected (Fig. 1A, left side), whereas in its presence, a large amount was formed (Fig. 1A, right side). There was no evidence for the formation of ω-oxidation products of either 5-HETE or 5-oxo-ETE by these cells. The time courses for the effects of H2O2 (100 μm) and tBuOOH (100 μm) on 5-oxo-ETE formation are shown in Fig. 1B. Both hydroperoxides strongly stimulated 5-oxo-ETE synthesis to a similar extent over the first 5 min. However, the amount of 5-oxo-ETE formed in the presence of H2O2 subsequently declined, whereas it continued to increase in the presence of tBuOOH to reach maximal levels between 10 and 15 min. To determine whether the transient effect of H2O2 could be because of its metabolism, incubations were performed in the presence of sodium azide, which inhibits both catalase and myeloperoxidase (28Kalyanaraman B. Janzen E.G. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4003-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two key enzymes involved in H2O2 metabolism. Azide did not significantly alter the response to H2O2 over the first 5 min, but thereafter strongly enhanced its effect on 5-oxo-ETE synthesis (Fig. 1B). Because of the short-lived effect of H2O2, all subsequent incubations with 5-HETE were performed for a period of 5 min. No detectable oxidation of 5-HETE occurred when it was incubated with H2O2 or tBuOOH in the absence of cells (data not shown). The effects of various concentrations of different hydroperoxides on 5-oxo-ETE formation by U937 cells are shown in Fig. 1C. tBuOOH (EC50, 3.5 ± 0.9 μm) is the most potent stimulator of 5-oxo-ETE formation, followed by H2O2 (EC50, 12.1 ± 2.6 μm). Both hydroperoxides elicited an ∼7.5-fold increase in 5-oxo-ETE synthesis when compared with controls. The linoleic acid metabolite 13-HpODE also stimulated 5-oxo-ETE formation, but was somewhat less potent. Because of the limited availability of this substance we were unable to determine the maximal response. In contrast to hydroperoxides, PMA, which is a potent stimulator of 5-oxo-ETE formation by neutrophils (20Powell W.S. Gravelle F. Gravel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25373-25380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no detectable effect on its formation by U937 cells (Fig. 1C). The Glutathione Redox Cycle Mediates the Effect of Oxidant Stress on 5-Oxo-ETE Formation—An important means of cellular inactivation of hydroperoxides is their GSH-dependent reduction by glutathione peroxidase, followed by the reduction of the resulting GSSG back to GSH by glutathione reductase, which is accompanied by the formation of NADP+. To determine whether the stimulatory effect of hydroperoxides on 5-oxo-ETE formation could be mediated by the glutathione redox cycle, we tested the effects of various reagents that affect this cycle. The glutathione reductase inhibitor BCNU (carmustine) (29Schallreuter K.U. Gleason F.K. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) completely blocked the stimulatory effect of H2O2 on 5-oxo-ETE formation (Fig. 2A) and had a similar effect on the response to tBuOOH (data not shown). For comparison, baseline conversion of 5-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE (±S.E.) in the absence of H2O2 or inhibitors is shown by the horizontal lines in Fig. 2A. The effect of BCNU (30 μm) on the concentration-response to H2O2 is shown in Fig. 2B. In contrast to its strong inhibitory effect on H2O2-induced 5-oxo-ETE formation, BCNU had little effect on the response to PMS (Fig. 2B, inset), which acts by a different mechanism by non-enzymatically converting intracellular NADPH to NADP+ (30Davis G.

BCNU also inhibits thioredoxin reductase (29Schallreuter K.U. Gleason F.K. Wood J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which could also potentially explain its inhibitory effect on the response to H2O2. To determine whether thioredoxin redox cycling is involved in this response we investigated the effects of the thioredoxin reductase inhibitor auranofin on H2O2-induced 5-oxo-ETE formation. Auranofin, which is a very potent inhibitor of this enzyme (IC50, 4 nm) (31Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), had no effect on the formation of 5-oxo-ETE in response to H2O2 at concentrations as high as 10 μm (Table II). This inhibitor was also without effect on PMS-induced 5-oxo-ETE formation.Table IIEffects of inhibition of thioredoxin reductase on 5-oxo-ETE formation by U937 cellsTreatment5-Oxo-ETE (pmol/ml)ControlH2O2PMSVehicle23 ± 2142 ± 9137 ± 21Auranofin (1 μm)21 ± 1152 ± 11140 ± 12Auranofin (10 μm)20 ± 3133 ± 6137 ± 10 Open table in a new tab To provide further evidence for the role of GSH in the response to H2O2 we used two approaches to deplete cellular GSH. NEM, which is a very efficient alkylator of SH groups, thus preventing the formation of GSSG, completely suppressed H2O2-induced 5-oxo-ETE synthesis to levels below baseline (Fig. 2A). Like BCNU, NEM did not have a direct effect on 5-HEDH (Table I). The response to H2O2 was also inhibited by about 50% following culture of U937 cells for 24 h in the presence of BSO (Fig. 2C), which depletes cells of GSH by inhibiting γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (32Troyano A. Fernandez C. Sancho P. de Blas E. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47107-47115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, BSO had no effect on the stimulatory effect of PMS on 5-oxo-ETE formation. We also examined the effects of diamide, which acts by non-enzymatically oxidizing intracellular GSH to GSSH (33Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Wertheim B. Correa W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). Diamide (EC50, 15.5 ± 2.5 μm) strongly stimulated the formation of 5-oxo-ETE to an extent similar to that observed with H2O2. The time course for 5-oxo-ETE synthesis in the presence of diamide, shown in the inset to Fig. 2D, is very similar to that observed with tBuOOH (Fig. 1B), except that the response appears to be somewhat more sustained. In contrast, diamide had no effect on the conversion of 5-HETE to 5-oxo-ETE by U937 cell microsomes (Table I). Activation of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway Inhibits 5-Oxo-ETE Formation—The PPP is the major mechanism whereby cells maintain a high ratio of NADPH to NADP+. To determine whether this pathway could affect the formation of 5-oxo-ETE, we investigated the effects of glucose, which is metabolized by the PPP following its phosphorylation to glucose 6-phosphate, and galactose, which is not a substrate for this pathway. Glucose (IC50, 0.42 ± 0.08 mm) strongly inhibited the formation of 5-oxo-ETE in the presence of H2O2, whereas galactose had no effect (Fig. 3A). To further substantiate that the inhibitory effect of glucose is mediated by its metabolism by the PPP, we examined the effect of DHEA, which is an inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the initial enzyme in this pathway (34Tsutsui E.A.

These results indicate a role for Pak2 in the down-regulation of translation initiation in apoptosis by phosphorylation of Mnk1. Within the framework of translational initiation, one of the major points of regulation involves the recruitment of the mRNA to the 43 S pre-initiation complex. Recruitment is mediated by members of the group four initiation factors (eIF4), 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; Mnk1 and -2, mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinases 1 and 2; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Pak2, p21-activated protein kinase; PMA, phorbol ester; HA, hemagglutinin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. the most prominent member of which is the cap-binding complex of eIF4F. eIF4F is a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of the 25-kDa cap-binding protein eIF4E, the 46-kDa bi-directional RNA helicase eIF4A, and the 220-kDa scaffold protein eIF4G. eIF4F (via eIF4E) binds to the m7G-cap of mRNAs along with eIF4B and eIF4H, positioning eIF4A to unwind mRNA secondary structures 5′ to the AUG start codon (reviewed in Refs. 1Hershey J.W.B.

Two unidentified serum-repressed phosphorylation sites in eIF4G were also observed. Tuazon et al. (21Tuazon P.T. Morley S.J. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of eIF4F by protein kinase C or the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F by multifunctional S6 kinase stimulates translation in a reconstituted protein-synthesizing system dependent on eIF4F (22Morley S.J. Dever T.E. Etchison D. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4669-4672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, overall the role of phosphorylation of 4E and 4G is not well understood. Mnk1 and -2 are activated by the MAP kinases Erk1 and -2 and p38 (18Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Activation of Mnk occurs upon phosphorylation at two sites, Thr197 and Thr202. An additional residue, Thr332 in mouse Mnk2 and Thr344 in human Mnk1, has been identified as a phosphorylation site for Erk2 (14Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 15Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingham M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Support for phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1 and -2 in vivo comes from studies utilizing kinase-inactive and constitutively active mutants of Mnk1 (15Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingham M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Kinase-inactive mutants of Mnk1 expressed in 293 cells inhibit the mitogen-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E, while expression of active Mnk1 increases the basal level of eIF4E phosphorylation. Additional support comes from studies using the pharmacological inhibitor PD098059 that specifically inhibits MEK activation and SB203580 a specific inhibitor of p38. Individually, the inhibitors partially block, and together completely inhibit, PMA-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E in 293T cells (20Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L.J. Vries R.G.

The N-terminal 23 amino acids of Mnk1 contain a binding site for eIF4G (15Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingham M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell.

Pak2 is a ubiquitous isoform of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases related to the yeast protein kinase Ste20 (26Roig J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Pak2 activity is stimulated in response to various forms of moderate stress, including ionizing radiation, DNA damaging agents, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and serum starvation following activation and binding of the small G-protein Cdc42(GTP) (reviewed in Ref. 29Roig J. Traugh J.A. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 62: 167-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to UV light, high doses of ionizing radiation, and Fas-ligand, Pak2 is constitutively activated during early apoptosis via cleavage by caspase 3 (30Rudel T. Zenke F.T. Chuang T.H.

Pak2 is involved in the induction of cytostasis as shown by expression of Pak2 in mammalian cells (33Huang Z. Lin J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by injection of active Pak2 into one blastomere of two-cell frog embryos resulting in cleavage arrest at mitotic metaphase (34Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll Jr., E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This induction is due in part to phosphorylation of c-Myc by Pak2, which reduces transcription of growth related genes (35Huang Z. Traugh J.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1582-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Pak2 also inhibits translation when added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate or when transfected into 293T cells. 2J. Ling, S. M. Morley, and J. A. Traugh, manuscript in preparation. Pak2 has been shown to phosphorylate two subunits of eIF3, eIF4B and eIF4G (11Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether Mnk1, which is activated by the stress-activated kinase p38, could be a substrate for Pak2. In these studies, mouse Mnk1 was phosphorylated by caspase 3 cleaved Pak2 but not by Cdc42-activated Pak2. Two phosphorylation sites for Pak2 were identified, Ser27 and Thr22. Phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Pak2 was independent of the phosphorylation and activation by Erk2. Mnk1 phosphorylated eIF4E alone and both the 4E and 4G subunits in eIF4F. Phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Pak2 did not alter phosphorylation of eIF4E but decreased the phosphorylation of eIF4G, which resulted from reduced binding of Mnk1 to eIF4G. Phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Pak2 was observed in 293T cells under apoptotic conditions, where Pak2 was cleaved and activated by caspase 3. Materials—Active Erk2 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals.

Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Quantification used the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. GST-Mnk1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B was released by cleavage with Factor Xa. Soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.04 mg/ml) was added to the supernatant containing Mnk1 to inhibit residual Factor Xa activity, and Mnk1 was stored in aliquots at –80 °C. GST-Pak2 was expressed in TN5B-4 insect cells, purified, and activated by cleavage with caspase 3 for 30 min, followed by autophosphorylation, as described (36Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R.

Alternatively, Pak2 was activated by Cdc42(GTPγS) (33Huang Z. Lin J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Erk2 or Pak2 was carried out in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity: 500–4000 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for the times indicated. Mnk1/GST-Mnk1 (1 μg) was phosphorylated with 0.1 μg of Pak2 or Erk2 in 25 μl, unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer containing 10 mm ATP, EDTA, and EGTA. Following SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and staining with Coomassie Blue, the phosphoproteins were visualized by phosphorimaging or autoradiography. To determine the Km and Vmax values, GST-Mnk1 (0.25–5 μg) was phosphorylated by 0.08 μg of GST-Pak2 for 10 min at 30 °C under kinetically valid conditions. Following SDS-PAGE, the protein was quantified using the EagleEye Photodocumentation station with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Quantification of 32P incorporated into Mnk1 was by scintillation counting of the excised protein. Phosphorylation of GST-Mnk1 by sequential addition of Pak2 and Erk2 was carried out for 90 min for each protein kinase. Following each incubation, the beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer, then washed with 2 ml of 0.5 m LiCl, 1% Triton X-100 to remove the protein kinase and excess ATP (13Waskiewicz A.J.

Phosphorylation of eIF4F and eIF4E by Mnk1—eIF4F was purified from rabbit reticulocytes and the eIF4E mutant lacking the N-terminal 27 amino acids (NΔ27-eIF4E) was prepared as described previously (37Grifo J.A.

Phosphorylation of eIF4F (3 μg) or NΔ27–4E (1 μg) by Mnk1 (1 μg) was carried out in a volume of 25 μlat30 °C for 20 min, under the same conditions described for phosphorylation of Mnk1. Phosphopeptide Mapping and Phosphoaminoacid Analysis—Mnk1 (2 μg) and GST-Mnk1 (20 μg) phosphorylated by Pak2 were subjected to tryptic digestion as described previously (11Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following lyophilization, the samples were resuspended in 20 μl of water, and 1–2 μl was removed for phosphoaminoacid analysis (11Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the protein was analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping on thin-layer cellulose plates (11Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled peptides visualized by autoradiography were scraped from the plates, eluted twice with 100 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and twice with 100 μl 65% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluates were pooled and lyophilized, and the phosphopeptides were used directly for manual and automated sequencing. Phosphopeptide 1 was purified further by reverse phase HPLC using a Waters Delta-Pak2 C18 narrow bore reverse phase column (2.1 × 150 mm) running on a Waters LC625 HPLC system. Samples (500 μl) were loaded onto the column equilibrated in 98% solvent A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 2% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid in water) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and the peptides were eluted with a three-step linear gradient. Elution was monitored at 210 nm, and radioactivity was quantified by Cerenkov counting. Fractions containing radioactivity were concentrated to less than 50 μl in a Speed-Vac. Manual and Automated Sequencing—Radiolabeled phosphopeptides obtained after peptide mapping or HPLC were brought to 65% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20 μl, covalently attached to Sequelon-AA membrane discs, and subjected to manual Edman degradation as described (39Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The membrane and the dried trifluoroacetic acid extracts were monitored for 32P release by Cerenkov counting after each cycle. Duplicate samples were subjected to automated microsequencing on a 492 Procise Sequencer. Binding of Mnk1 to eIF4G Peptides—Peptides of human eIF4G fused to the S-peptide of RNase A, thioredoxin, and His6 tags were expressed and purified from E. coli as described (40Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Merrick W.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The peptides used for these experiments, S-eIF4G-(877–1078), S-4G-(1078–1560), and S-4G-(1317–1560) were incubated with GST-Mnk1 in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm EDTA, in a volume of 20 μl on ice for 1 h. Following incubation, 60 μl of buffer containing 1% nonfat milk and 20 μl of S-protein-agarose were added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with buffer containing milk and twice with buffer, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Mnk1 was detected by ECL following Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Phosphorylation of GST-Mnk in 293T Cells—HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 10-cm plates to ∼20–25% confluence. The cells were transfected with wild type GST-Mnk1 (1 μg), HA-tagged Pak2 (2.5 μg), and constitutively active HA-Cdc42L61 (1 μg) using FuGENE 6 reagent. The control was transfected with GST-Mnk1 kinase-inactive T402A and dominant-negative HA-Cdc42N17. After incubation for 36 h, cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum and radiolabeled for 4 h in the same medium with 1.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate in a total volume of 3.5 ml. To induce moderate stress, cells were stressed with 0.4 m sorbitol for 30 min after 3.5 h of labeling. For induction of apoptosis, 2 mm H2O2 was added at the beginning of the labeling. After 4 h, the cells were collected and stored at –80 °C. Cells from one dish were thawed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 nm okadaic acid), and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 25 min on ice, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. GST-Mnk1 was purified using 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 1 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Pak2—To determine whether Mnk1 was a substrate for Pak2, GST-Mnk1 was examined using Pak2 activated by cleavage with caspase 3 or by binding of Cdc42(GTPγS). GST-Mnk1 was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence and absence of Pak2 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE; GST-Mnk1 was readily phosphorylated by caspase-cleaved Pak2 but was not a substrate for Pak2 activated by Cdc42 (Fig. 1A). The GST fusion protein of Mnk1 migrated at a molecular mass of 72 kDa, while Mnk1 migrated at 49 kDa (Fig. 1B, left panel). Mnk1 and GST-Mnk1 were readily phosphorylated by Pak2 (Fig. 1B, right panel). No phosphorylation was observed in the absence of Pak2. Phosphorylation of Mnk1 was quantified using increasing concentrations of Pak2 activated by caspase 3 (Fig. 1C). Maximal phosphorylation was obtained at an enzyme to substrate molar ratio of 1:6, yielding about 1.5 mol of 32P incorporated per mol of GST-Mnk1 following incubation for 1 h. When the molar ratio was reduced to 1:15, the amount of 32P incorporated was reduced to 1.0 mol/mol. Analysis of the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot (data not shown) yielded a Km value for GST-Mnk1 of 0.60 μm and a Vmax of 14.9 pmol/min/μg of Pak2. Identification of the Sites in Mnk1 Phosphorylated by Pak2— Tryptic phosphopeptides from Mnk1 phosphorylated by Pak2 were separated by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and visualized by autoradiography. Three major phosphopeptides were observed with GST-Mnk1 (Fig. 2A). Mnk1 alone yielded two major phosphopeptides corresponding to peptides 1 and 2 of GST-Mnk1 (Fig. 2B), indicating that phosphopeptide 3 originated from GST or the GST-linker region. Phosphoaminoacid analysis showed peptide 1 contained phosphoserine, peptide 2 contained phosphothreonine (Fig. 2C), and peptide 3 contained both phosphoaminoacids (data not shown). Phosphopeptide 1, purified further by reverse phase HPLC, yielded a major peak containing 87% of the radioactivity, which was collected, concentrated, and subjected to manual Edman degradation and automated amino acid sequencing (Fig. 3A). Microsequence analysis of peptide 1 yielded the sequence ATDXLPG, corresponding to amino acids 24–30 of mouse Mnk. Parallel manual Edman degradation released 32P exclusively at cycle 4. Thus X was the phosphoserine at position 27 (Ser27) in mouse Mnk1. Phosphopeptide 2 could not be purified further by HPLC, as it was not retained on the C-18 column (data not shown). Edman degradation of peptide 2 released 32P exclusively at cycle 3 (Fig. 3B). Given the specificity of trypsin, there was only one possible threonine that could yield release of 32P at cycle number 3, Thr22 in the sequence RKTR, that corresponded to amino acids 20–23 of mouse Mnk1. The assignment of Thr22 as a phosphorylation site for Pak2 was consistent with CNBr cleavage data, which yielded a single phosphopeptide corresponding to the N terminus of Mnk1 starting from amino acid 2 (data not shown). Additional support for the identification came from analysis of human Mnk1, which contained a glycine (Gly34) at the position corresponding to Thr22. With human Mnk1 phosphorylated by Pak2, only phosphopeptide 1 was detected by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (data not shown). Thus mouse Mnk1 was phosphorylated by Pak2 on Thr22 and Ser27. The phosphorylation sites were located in an extremely basic region important for binding to eIF4G (15Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingham M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites for Pak2 were distinct from those phosphorylated by Erk2, Thr197 and Thr202 (13Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingham M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Erk2 and Pak2 and Analysis of Mnk1 Activity—To determine whether phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Pak2 and Erk2 were mutually exclusive, Mnk1 was phosphorylated with Erk2 or Pak2 under conditions where approximately 1 mol of 32P was incorporated per mol of Mnk1. The extent of phosphorylation of Mnk1 by Pak2 and Erk2 was similar at 90 min with about 25% more 32P incorporated into Mnk1 by Pak2, as compared with Erk2 (Fig. 4). Sequential addition of Pak2 following removal of Erk2, or Erk2 following removal of Pak2, showed that phosphorylation was additive and independent of the order of phosphorylation. To analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Mnk1, a recombinant form of eIF4E (NΔ27–4E) was"

To test this hypothesis, we expressed, purified, and characterized the high affinity phorbol-binding subdomain, C1B, of mouse protein kinase Cδ, and studied its interaction with general anesthetic alcohols. When the fluorescent phorbol ester, sapintoxin-D, bound to PKCδ C1B in buffer at a molar ratio of 1:2, its fluorescence emission maximum, λmax, shifted from 437 to 425 nm. The general anesthetic alcohols, butanol and octanol, further shifted λmax of the PKCδ C1B-bound sapintoxin-D in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner to ∼415 nm, suggesting that alcohols interact at a discrete allosteric binding site. To identify this site, PKCδ C1B was photolabeled with three photo-activable diazirine alcohol analogs, 3-azioctanol, 7-azioctanol, and 3-azibutanol. Mass spectrometry showed photoincorporation of all three alcohols in PKCδ C1B at a stoichiometry of 1:1 in the labeled fraction. The photolabeled PKCδ C1B was subjected to tryptic digest, the fragments were separated by online chromatography and sequenced by mass spectrometry. Each azialcohol photoincorporated at Tyr-236. Inspection of the known structure of PKCδ C1B shows that this residue is situated adjacent to the phorbol ester binding pocket, and within ∼10 Å of the bound phorbol ester.

Anesthetics are relatively nonspecific drugs that interact with many transmembrane ion channels and soluble proteins, often causing unwanted side effects. Gaining a detailed understanding of the structural motifs governing anesthetic-protein interactions is a critical step in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying general anesthesia and in developing more selective anesthetic agents. However, little progress can be made until such sites are unequivocally identified. The physiological sites of anesthetic action remain difficult to define, and some potential targets such as the transmembrane domains of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily are so poorly characterized compared with soluble proteins that atomic level principles governing their anesthetic binding cannot yet be defined.

The protein kinase C superfamily plays a central role in signal transduction, regulating divergent cellular functions by phosphorylation of target proteins such as ion channels (14Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 15Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It can be separated into two major categories, the conventional (α, βI βII, and γ) and the novel (δ, ϵ, θ, and η) kinases, each having four domains, termed C1 though C4, that play distinct roles in the function of the kinase. C1 and C2 are the regulatory domains, C3 is the ATP-binding domain, and C4 is the catalytic domain. The two phorbol-binding sites are in the C1 domain, and consist of a tandem repeat of highly conserved cysteine-rich zinc finger subdomains C1A and C1B (residues 159-208 and 231-280, respectively, in the δ isoform). These domains differ in their binding affinities for phorbol ester and sn-diacylglycerol (16Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Homology between different members of the superfamily is high within domains but the novel kinases differ in having their C2 domain N-terminal to their C1 domain (Fig. 1) and in associating with membranes in a calcium-independent manner.Stimulated PKC activity is modulated by anesthetics, and it has been proposed that discrete binding sites for general anesthetics could be present and possibly located near or within the phorbol ester-binding sites (11Slater S.J.

In intact PKCα, volatile anesthetics and long- and short-chain alcohols modulate PKC activation in vitro and alter activator binding affinities. The enhancement of PKCα activity induced by octanol in the TPA/phospholipid system was attributed to a positive allosteric interaction between it and the high affinity phorbol ester-binding site (20Slater S.J.

Protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Bacterial Expression and Purification of the PKCδ C1B Subdomain—The PKCδ C1B subdomain fused with glutathione S-transferase was expressed in BL21 gold E. coli as described earlier (28Quest A.F.

Briefly, cell pellets were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and lysozyme (1 mg/ml), followed by sonication and centrifugation. The clarified supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column. The bound protein was thoroughly washed, released by thrombin cleavage, eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. It was further purified by fast performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad Biologic Work station) using a Superdex™ 75 column (Amersham Biosciences), a mobile phase of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.CD Measurements—Circular dichroism spectra were recorded from 260 to 190 nm at 25 °C on an Aviv 62 DS instrument (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) in a quartz cell of 0.1-cm path length. Data were collected at 0.5-nm intervals and an accumulation time of 20 s. CD spectra were fitted using a CDNN program and the neural network approach of Bohm et al. (29Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Jobin Yvon Spex (model Fluoromax-2, ISA Instruments S.A., Inc.) fluorimeter equipped with temperature and stirring control systems. A 1.5-ml cuvette (Hellma) with a Teflon stopper was used for fluorescence measurements. PKCδ C1B and SAPD were mixed in a buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2) and stirred gently for 20 min with a small Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar at room temperature. SAPD was excited directly at 355 nm and emission spectra were recorded from 375 to 575 nm. Effects of alcohols on the SAPD binding were studied in a 1-ml mixture containing 4 μm protein and 2 μm SAPD. Alcohols were titrated by adding successive 2-μl aliquots of Me2SO containing either 0.5 m octanol or 10 m butanol. Spectra were recorded after 30 min incubation with slow stirring. PKCδ C1B was denatured by heating the solution at 90 °C for 20 min, and its fluorescence was monitored after cooling and transferring to the cuvette.The wavelength maxima of the emission spectra were determined by fitting the symmetrical top of the peaks to a Gaussian function with Igor Pro 4 (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Butanol, octanol, and TPA titration curves were fitted using the following equation (30Dodson B.A. Braswell L.M. Miller K.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar), f(x)=min+(max−min)*{xnH/(xnH+EC50nH)}(Eq. 1) where, min and max are the minimum and maximum values of the effect, EC50 is the equilibrium ligand concentration at half-maximum effect, nH is the Hill coefficient, and x is the concentration of the alcohol or TPA.For fluorescence quenching experiments, phorbol esters (TPA or 4α-TPA, 1 mm in Me2SO) were titrated by additions of successive 1-μl aliquots into 1 ml of PKCδ C1B (1 μm) in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2). The sample was excited at 290 nm and intrinsic fluorescence quenching was monitored by recording fluorescence emission from 300 to 500 nm. The average fluorescence intensity between 348 and 350 nm was normalized to that without additions (F/Fmax) and used in the analysis of binding curves and plots to calculate the Stern-Volmer constant, KSV (31Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Plenumn Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar).Determination of Stoichiometry of Photolabeled PKCδ C1B by Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—The stoichiometry of photoincorporation of 3-azioctanol into PKCδ C1B was determined using microcapillary liquid chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Samples of PKCδ C1B (95 pmol/sample) were photolabeled at 365 nm for 20 min after 10 min preincubation with 1 mm 3-azioctanol, 7-azioctanol, or 3-azibutanol using a model UVL-56 20W Black-Ray handheld lamp (Upland, CA). A 1-μl aliquot of each reaction mixture was diluted 1:20 with 0.1% acetic acid to yield a 1 pmol/μl solution. A 1-μl aliquot of each of these diluted samples was then analyzed by microcapillary liquid chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (LCQ, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). The column (75 × 360 μm) was packed with POROS 10R2 (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) to 15 cm and butt-connected to a fused silica nanospray tip (5 μm). The reaction mixture was eluted from the column with a gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile in 15 min at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 300 to 2000 with a maximum ejection time of 400 ms. Molecular weights for both the modified and unmodified forms of PKCδ C1B were calculated from the resulting charge envelopes. Essentially, the charge state of an ion was determined by subtracting two adjacent ions from each other and the reciprocal of this difference multiplied by the ion of lower mass/charge minus one. The result is the charge state of the ion with the higher m/z of the two adjacent peaks. To calculate the unprotonated molecular weight, the determined charge state is multiplied by the mass/charge of the ion and then the charge state is subtracted from the product.Proteolytic Digestion of Azioctanol-labeled PKCδ C1B—To the photo-labeled PKCδ C1B (95 pmol, 100 μl), 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to a final volume of 300 μl. The sample was then digested overnight at room temperature with trypsin at a ratio of 1:40, protease: protein. The digested samples were stored at -20 °C.Online Reverse-phase Chromatography and Sequencing of Azialcohol-labeled PKCδ C1B by Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Each digested sample was analyzed by automated LC/MS/MS on the ion trap mass spectrometer using online LC. A 0.5-μl aliquot from the 30 μl of digested protein was loaded onto the column, prepared as described above. Peptides were eluted directly into the mass spectrometer with a two-step gradient of 5-65% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid for 25 min, followed by 65-90% acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid for 5 min at a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. MS/MS spectra were acquired under automatic acquisition of the most intense ion from each MS scan.RESULTSProtein Purification and Characterization—SDS-PAGE (18%) analysis of affinity purified and thrombin-cleaved PKCδ C1B showed a single band around 7 kDa (data not shown) similar to that previously reported (23Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A number of criteria suggest that the purified PKCδ C1B protein is correctly folded. First, fast performance liquid chromatography on a gel filtration column confirmed that the PKCδ C1B subdomain migrated as a single symmetrical peak with the expected Stokes radius. Second, analysis of the CD spectrum (Fig. 2) suggests that the secondary structure of PKCδ C1B has about two times more β-sheet content than α-helix content and a high content of random coil (∼50%) (32Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This estimate is consistent with the published crystal structure (23Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Third, phorbol ester binding had the required specificity (see below).Fig. 2Circular dichroism spectrum of expressed, purified PKCδ C1B. The protein concentration was 2.5 × 10-5m in 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Phorbol Ester Binding—In 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, SAPD showed an emission maximum at 437 nm that was unaffected by addition of Me2SO, anesthetics, or the combination of both in the concentrations used in the present studies. Addition of a 10-fold excess of PKCδ C1B to SAPD caused a broad blue-shifted emission spectrum that could be deconvoluted into two components with maxima at 404 and 437 nm representing bound and free SAPD, respectively (Fig. 3). When the spectrum of the same solution was recorded at 90 °C for 20 min, the spectrum narrowed to a single component centered on 437 nm, indicating release of SAPD from PKCδ C1B. Consistent with this interpretation, when PKCδ C1B, preheated at 90 °C for 20 min, was added to SAPD, no wavelength shift was observed.Fig. 3Binding of the fluorescent phorbol ester, SAPD, to PKCδ C1B. Emission spectra of 0.2 μm SAPD: a, in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4), λmax 437 nm; b, in buffer plus 2 μm C1B after incubation for 40 min. Trace b has been deconvoluted into traces c (protein-bound SAPD) and d (aqueous SAPD) with λmax of 404 and 437 nm, respectively. SAPD was excited directly at 355 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PKCδ C1B contains a single tryptophan (Trp-252) whose fluorescence was quenched in a concentration-dependent manner when TPA was added (Fig. 4, inset). Quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of PKCδ C1B depended in a sigmoidal manner on the concentration of the phorbol ester TPA (Fig. 4, trace a). By contrast, the inactive isomer, 4α-TPA (33van Duuren B.L. Banerjee S. Witz G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1976; 15: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), quenched significantly less efficiently and with linear dependence on concentration (Fig. 4, trace b). Assuming that the 4α-TPA data points represent nonspecific quenching, they were subtracted from the TPA quenching data to yield corrected data points that fitted well to the mass action equation (Fig. 4, trace c) with an EC50 of 0.31 ± 0.072 μm (total concentration). Controls showed that addition of TPA (0.1-1.2 μm) to 1 μml-tryptophan in buffer did not cause any quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence, nor did addition of Me2SO in the concentration range used cause significant changes in the fluorescence emission spectra of PKCδ C1B.Fig. 4Effect of the phorbol esters TPA or 4α-TPA on the intrinsic fluorescence of PKCδ C1B.F and Fmax are the average fluorescence intensities at 348-350 nm in the presence and absence of ligand, respectively. Fluorescence quenching is plotted against total phorbol ester concentration for: a, TPA (filled squares), the line is drawn by eye; b, 4α-TPA (filled triangles) and its linear fit; c, calculated specific binding curve for TPA binding to PKCδ C1B obtained by subtraction of data points for b from corresponding data points for a (filled circles), and the nonlinear least squares fit of the corrected data to the logistic equation described under “Experimental Procedures.” A Me2SO solution of TPA or 4α-TPA was titrated in 1-μl aliquots into a solution of PKCδ C1B allowing 10 min for equilibrium after each addition. Inset, emission spectra of PKCδ C1B (top trace). Lower traces were obtained with successive additions of 0.1 μm TPA; concentration range from 0.1 to 1.2 μm TPA. Excitation was at 290 nm and emission was monitored from 310 to 500 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When the TPA fluorescence quenching data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation, 4α-TPA quenching was linear with a slope (Ksv) of 0.54 × 106 M-1. On the other hand, TPA quenching was linear up to 0.5 μm TPA with a much higher Ksv of 2.9 × 106 M-1. At higher concentrations, however, the plot curved upwards suggesting additional quenching mechanisms.Consistent with the TPA study, SAPD also quenched intrinsic PKCδ C1B fluorescence. With increasing concentration of SAPD, intrinsic fluorescence decreased and bound SAPD fluorescence increased in parallel (data not shown).Phorbol Ester-Anesthetic Interactions—As shown above (Fig. 3), the emission spectrum of SAPD in the presence of 10-50- fold excess protein consists of overlapping free and bound contributions with λmax at 437 and 404 nm, respectively. The addition of butanol (100-200 mm) or octanol (1-2 mm) caused no significant change in the composite spectrum under these conditions. However, when the protein to SAPD molar ratio was reduced from 10:1 to 2:1 the composite peak was more symmetrical and exhibited a maximum at 425 nm (Fig. 5). Titration of alcohols caused more SAPD to bind resulting in a blue shift that reached a plateau of ∼415 nm at 80 mm butanol or 1 mm octanol (Fig. 6). These concentration-dependent emission shifts were fitted to logistic curves yielding EC50 values of 34 ± 16 mm for butanol and 410 ± 150 μm for octanol and Hill coefficients that did not differ significantly from one (2 ± 1.6 for butanol and 2 ± 1.4 for octanol). Control experiments in which identical additions of butanol, octanol, or Me2SO were made to SAPD in buffer did not cause any blue shift.Fig. 5Enhancement of SAPD binding to PKCδ C1B by butanol. Emission spectra of SAPD (2 μm): a, in buffer alone; b, in buffer containing 80 mm butanol; c, in the presence of 4 μm PKCδ C1B alone; and d, in the presence of 4 μm PKCδ C1B plus 80 mm butanol. SAPD was added in 2 μlofMe2SO and incubated for 25 min. Butanol was then added from a stock of 10 m in Me2SO and incubated for 15 min. Eex 355 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Allosteric enhancement of SAPD binding to PKCδ C1B by alcohols. The alcohol-induced emission maximum blue shift (λo-λ) of SAPD, where λ and λo represent emission maximum in the presence and absence of alcohols, respectively, is plotted against the alcohol concentrations for octanol (filled square, dashed line) and butanol (filled triangle, solid line). Lines represent nonlinear least square fits to the logistic equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). At the protein (4 μm) and ligand (2 μm) ratio of 2:1, the emission maximum of SAPD, λo,is425 nm. Upon addition of varying amounts of octanol or butanol, the emission maximum shifted toward the blue. Protein and SAPD were incubated for 25 min in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Alcohol was then added in aliquots as described in the legend to Fig. 5 and spectra were recorded after 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test the stability of the diazirine group during the binding assay, the absorbance change of a 2 mm aqueous 3-azioctanol solution at 350 nm was recorded before and after a single emission scan. About 10% of the chromophore was photodecomposed. Because of the photosensitive nature of the diazirine group we did not titrate the azialcohols. However, 2 mm 3-azioctanol caused a substantial, near maximum blue shift to 417 nm under the above conditions.Determination of the Mole Ratio of Alcohol Photoincorporation into PKCδ C1B by LC/MS—The photolabeled samples were diluted (1 pmol/μl) and analyzed using online microcapillary liquid chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. An ion chromatogram for the photoreaction mixture of PKCδ C1B and 1 mm 3-azioctanol can be seen in Fig. 7A. Complete separation of unlabeled and labeled PKCδ C1B was not achieved. However, in LC/MS experiments, peak heterogeneity does not prevent molecular weight determination of the eluted proteins because of their unique charge envelopes. Thus, it was unnecessary to refine chromatographic conditions to achieve resolution of the components. Fig. 7B shows the mass/charge envelope for samples eluting between 10.8 and 13.5 min obtained by summing the spectra obtained every second during this time period. Deconvolution of the mass/charge envelope yielded two major peaks with molecular masses that did not differ significantly from the expected ones of 7,363 Da for PKCδ C1B and 7,491 Da for PKCδ C1B modified by photoincorporation of azioctanol (Fig. 7C). The observed difference between the two major peaks was 128 ± 1 Da, corresponding to photoincorporation of a single 3-azioctanol molecule in PKCδ C1B. No higher molecular weight peak corresponding to the photoincorporation of two azioctanols (7,619 Da) was observed. Nonetheless, it is hard to rule this out because the probability of such labeling is likely to be low (26Addona G.H. Husain S.S. Stehle T. Miller K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25685-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A major unidentified contaminant occurred at 7458 Da, but only in this particular preparation.Fig. 7Mass spectral analysis of photoincorporation of 3-azioctanol into PKCδ C1B.A, a typical ion chromatogram. 95 pmol of C1B was incubated with 1 mm azioctanol for 10 min and then photoir-radiated at 365 nm for 20 min.

They exist in two unrelated forms that are either cofactor (2,3-diphosphoglycerate)-dependent or cofactor-independent. The two enzymes have no similarity in amino acid sequence, tertiary structure, or catalytic mechanism. Certain organisms including vertebrates have only the cofactor-dependent form, whereas other organisms can possess the independent form or both. Caenorhabditis elegans has been predicted to have only independent phosphoglycerate mutase. In this study, we have cloned and produced recombinant, independent phosphoglycerate mutases from C. elegans and the human-parasitic nematode Brugia malayi. They are 70% identical to each other and related to known bacterial, fungal, and protozoan enzymes. The nematode enzymes possess the catalytic serine, and other key amino acids proposed for catalysis and recombinant enzymes showed typical phosphoglycerate mutase activities in both the glycolytic and gluconeogenic directions. The gene is essential in C. elegans, because the reduction of its activity by RNA interference led to embryonic lethality, larval lethality, and abnormal body morphology. Promoter reporter analysis indicated widespread expression in larval and adult C. elegans with the highest levels apparent in the nerve ring, intestine, and body wall muscles. The enzyme was found in a diverse group of nematodes representing the major clades, indicating that it is conserved throughout this phylum. Our results demonstrate that nematodes, unlike vertebrates, utilize independent phosphoglycerate mutase in glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways and that the enzyme is probably essential for all nematodes.

The genome of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used widely as a model to understand molecular pathways common to nematodes and mammals on the basis of conserved evolution. However, nematodes as a group also have features that distinguish them from mammals. It is likely that some of these characteristics are the result of developmental and/or physiological processes potentially involving nematode-specific genes. Indeed, genome analysis has shown that C. elegans possesses many genes that do not have orthologs in mammals (1Lai C.H. Chou C.Y. Ch'ang L.Y. Liu C.S. Lin W. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 2The Caenorhabditis elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). Although a few of these unique genes are known to participate in essential processes such as cuticle biosynthesis and sex determination (3Blaxter M. Science. 1998; 282: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), most of them remain uncharacterized. With a view to gaining an improved understanding of nematode biology, we are focusing on genes absent in mammals that showed a defect when disrupted in high throughput RNA interference (RNAi) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; iPGM, cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase; PGM, phosphoglycerate mutase; dPGM, cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase; aa, amino acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ds, double-stranded; ORF, open reading frame; Ce, C. elegans; Bm, B. malayi; 2-PG and 3-PG, 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate; EST, expressed sequence tag. studies performed in C. elegans (4Fraser A.G.

PGMs catalyze the interconversion of 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate (2-PG and 3-PG) in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. Although these pathways are highly conserved among different organisms, two distinct PGM enzymes are known to exist, iPGM and the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase, dPGM. The sizes, amino acid (aa) sequence composition, three-dimensional structure, and catalytic mechanisms of these two enzymes are vastly dissimilar. iPGM is comprised of ∼500 aa and catalyzes the intramolecular transfer of the phospho group on monophosphoglycerates through a phosphoserine intermediate (8Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23146-23153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, dPGM is composed of ∼250 amino acids and catalyzes the intermolecular transfer of the phospho group between the monophosphoglycerates and the cofactor (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) through a phosphohistidine intermediate (10Rigden D.J. Mello L.V. Setlow P. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Vertebrates are known to possess the dPGM form exclusively, whereas in other organisms, the distribution of the two forms has been considered complex and unpredictable because either dPGM or iPGM or both forms may be present (11Carreras J. Mezquita J. Bosch J. Bartrons R. Pons G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1982; 71: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whereas the two forms of PGM are distinct, the amino acid sequence of each form when present is conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes (13Jedrzejas M.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 73: 263-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The parasitic nematodes of plants, animals, and humans are found worldwide and cause serious economic and health problems. Filarial nematodes, such as Brugia malayi, lead to particularly debilitating infections in humans and other mammals. Current treatments for nematode infections are inadequate. The identification of essential nematode genes that are absent from mammals may lead to the discovery of new drug targets and therapies. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of the function of C. elegans iPGM in vivo and report that iPGM is present in many parasitic nematode species. We provide molecular and biochemical studies on the iPGM enzymes from C. elegans and B. malayi, representing the first analysis of iPGM from metazoans. Identification of iPGM as a Non-mammalian Gene with an RNAi Phenotype in C. elegansm—C. elegans iPGM (Ce-iPGM) was identified using a bioinformatic method relying on gene function data from large scale RNAi screens. Predicted proteins in Wormbase (www.wormbase.org, release version WS110, October, 2003) with a non-wild type entry in the RNAi phenotype field were retrieved and used to query the mouse and human genomes using BLASTP (14Altschul S.F.

Ce-iPGM (corresponding to predicted gene F57B10.3) was identified as a member of a group of genes that do not have orthologs in these mammalian genomes (E-value cut-off score = 10-10). Identification of iPGM Enzymes in Parasitic Nematodes and Other Eukaryotes—Ce-iPGM was used to query NCBI databases for corresponding orthologs in Caenorhabditis briggsae, parasitic nematodes, and other eukaryotes.

The PCR products were purified and used for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase using the HiScribe™ RNAi transcription kit (New England Biolabs). The synthesized dsRNA was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen) and eluted into H2O. The purified dsRNA was injected into the germ line of C. elegans young adult hermaphrodites (wild type N2) (17Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C.

Each injected worm was transferred to a fresh plate every 8 or 16 h over the course of 3 days. The F1 embryos that were laid on each plate were counted immediately after transferring the injected worm. The L1 larvae that emerged from eggs on each plate were counted after 24 h.

Cloning and Overexpression of iPGM Enzymes from C. elegans and B. malayi—Full-length Ce-iPGM was amplified from a C. elegans mixed-stage cDNA pool. Initially, primers were designed according to the C. elegans predicted iPGM open reading frame (ORF) F57B10.3a in Wormbase as follows: forward (5′-ACGTGGATCCATGTTCGTAGCCCTGGGCGCTC-3′, where the BamHI site is underlined) and reverse (5′-ACGTAAGCTTCTAGATCTTCTGAACAATCG-3′, where the HindIII site is underlined). The amplified cDNA was cloned into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs) using the HindIII and BamHI sites, and the insert was sequenced. Subsequently, the cDNA corresponding to the predicted ORF F57B10.3b was PCR-amplified from this construct and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pET21a(+) (Novagen) to express a fusion protein with a His6 tag at the C terminus. The primers were as follows: forward (5′-AGTCGGATCCATGGCGATGGCAAATAAC-3′, where the BamHI site is underlined) and reverse (5′-AGTCAAGCTTGATCTTCTGAACAATG-3′, where the HindIII site is underlined). Based on BLAST analysis, two putative B. malayi iPGM ESTs were identified (GenBank™ accession numbers 5510517 and 1912539) and the corresponding cDNA clones were obtained from the Filarial Genome Project Resource Center ([email protected]). The clones were further sequenced at the 5′ and 3′ ends. Based on these sequences, a complete cDNA (Bm-iPGM) was amplified from an adult female cDNA pool and cloned into the pMAL-c2x vector using the following primers: forward (5′-ATGCGGATCCATGGCCGAAGCAAAGAATCGAGTATGTCTGGTAGTGATTGATGGT-3′, where the BamHI site is underlined) and reverse (5′-ATGCCTGCAGGGCTTCATTAACCAATGGC-3′, where the PstI site is underlined). The Bm-iPGM was subsequently re-amplified and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI of pET21a(+) using the following primers: forward (5′-AGTCGGATCCATGGCCGAAGCAAAGAATCG-3′, where the BamHI site is underlined) and reverse (5′-ATGCCTCGAGGGCTTCATTAACCAATGGC-3′, where the XhoI site is underlined) to express a fusion protein with a C-terminal His tag. Both C. elegans and B. malayi iPGM in pET21a(+) were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain ER2566 (fhuA2 lacZ::T7 gene1 [lon] ompT gal sulA11 [dcm] R (zgb-210::Tn10-TetS) endA1 D(mcrC-mrr)114::IS10 R(mcr-73::miniTn10-TetS)2) (New England BioLabs). Conditions were optimized to maximize expression, solubility, and yield of each recombinant protein. For Ce-iPGM, cultures were grown at 30 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at 15 °C overnight. Bm-iPGM was produced by growing cultures at 37 °C and inducing with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The His-tagged proteins were extracted and purified on nickel columns (Qiagen) using native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. An elution buffer (40 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 60 mm imidazole was found to be optimal in releasing both His-tagged proteins from the nickel resin with a high level of purity. PGM Enzyme Assay—iPGM activity was determined in forward and reverse directions using standard enzyme-coupled assays (12Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the forward reaction (glycolytic), the conversion of 3-PG to 2-PG was measured, whereas in the reverse direction (gluconeogenic), the conversion of 2-PG to 3-PG was assayed. In both cases, PGM activity was determined indirectly by measuring the consumption of NADH, which was monitored at 340 nm. The amount of NADH being oxidized to NAD corresponds to the amount of enzyme product (2-PG in the forward direction or 3-PG in the reverse direction) produced in the PGM reaction. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 5 min with data collected at 10-s intervals using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. In the forward reaction, iPGM was added to a 1-ml assay buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 20 mm KCl, 0.15 mm NADH) containing 1 mm ADP, 10 mm 3-PG (Sigma P8877), and 2.5 units each of enolase (Sigma E6126; EC 4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (Sigma P7768; EC 2.7.1.40), and lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma L2518; EC 1.1.1.27). In the reverse reaction, iPGM was added to a 1-ml assay buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 10 mm 2-PG (Sigma P0257), and 2.5 units each of phosphoglycerate kinase (Sigma P7634; EC 2.7.2.3) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma G0763; EC 1.2.1.12). One unit of PGM activity is defined as the amount of activity that is required for the conversion of 1.0 μm NADH to NAD/min in the above assay conditions. Identification and Cloning of iPGM from C. elegans and B. malayi—Ce-iPGM was identified in this study as a member of a set of C. elegans genes that has no apparent similarity to any mammalian genes and showed a visible phenotype in high throughput RNAi studies (4Fraser A.G.

Ce-iPGM is encoded by a single predicted gene F57B10.3, which potentially can produce two splice forms, F57B10.3a and F57B10.3b, based on existing C. elegans ESTs (Wormbase). They encode ORFs of 539 and 521 aa, respectively, differing only in 18 aa at the N terminus. The cDNA corresponding to the predicted ORF of F57B10.3a was amplified by PCR and sequenced and found to match the predicted intron-exon junctions. Ce-iPGM was used to query the nematode EST databases, and partial cDNA sequences encoding B. malayi iPGM (Bm-iPGM) were identified. A full-length Bm-iPGM cDNA was amplified and cloned from a cDNA pool and subsequently sequenced. The Bm-iPGM was predicted to encode a 515 aa protein. Both C. elegans and B. malayi deduced proteins are typical in size of iPGMs and appear to be canonical iPGM enzymes based on aa sequence comparisons. The sequence alignment (Fig. 1) shows that they possess the catalytic serine and 13 other residues predicted to be involved in catalysis based on the structural studies of the biochemically characterized Bacillus stearothermophilus iPGM (8Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 325: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The nematode enzymes share ∼40-42% amino acid identity and 59-62% similarity to B. stearothermophilus iPGM (22Chander M. Setlow P. Lamani E. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and have a 70% amino acid identity and ∼82% similarity to each other (Fig. 1). They are less related to the experimentally verified iPGM enzymes from the kinetoplastid protozoans Trypanosoma brucei and Leish-mania mexicana (26-28% identical and 47-50% similar) (23Chevalier N. Rigden D.J. Van Roy J. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Guerra D.G. Vertommen D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although the similarity extends over the full length of the proteins. Ce-iPGM Plays an Essential Role in Development—To determine the role of Ce-iPGM in vivo, its endogenous activity was reduced by RNAi (17Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11895) Google Scholar) and the effects on C. elegans development were monitored at various time intervals following injection. Several defects were observed, most notably embryonic lethality (Fig. 2). The degree of embryonic lethality at different time periods after dsRNA injection was carefully monitored. The embryos that were laid 18-26 h after injection of Ce-iPGM dsRNA hatched normally and continued to develop normally (data not shown). The embryos that were laid 26-42 h after injection showed only a low level of embryonic lethality (∼22%). Strikingly, the embryonic lethality increased significantly after 42 h with most embryos laid 42-66 h post-injection, failing to hatch (94-97% embryonic lethality) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, RNAi inactivation of control unc-22 (17Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11895) Google Scholar) and pos-1 (18Tabara H. Hill R. Mello C. Priess J. Kohara Y. Development. 1999; 126: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genes resulted in full penetrant phenotypes in progeny produced by 18-h post-injection (Fig. 2B). The phenotype severity and time course of the effects observed with iPGM RNAi were comparable following the administration of dsRNA at 1 mg/ml (Fig. 2A) and at higher (3 mg/ml) or lower (0.4 mg/ml) concentrations (data not shown). When the embryos that failed to hatch were examined further, it was observed that the development was arrested at different time points during embryogenesis (Fig. 2, C-D). In some of the larvae that escaped embryonic lethality, additional defects were noted including sluggish movement (data not shown), variable abnormal body morphology, developmental arrest, and lethality (Fig. 2, F-J). In a total of 31 larvae that developed from embryos collected at 42-50 h post-injection, larval lethality was 19%. The larval lethality rate increased to 37% in the 19 surviving larvae that resulted from embryos collected at 50-65 h post-injection. To further address the in vivo function of Ce-iPGM, its spatial and developmental expression was examined in transgenic C. elegans carrying an iPGM::GFP transcription reporter construct. GFP expression was observed in most cells with higher levels in the nerve ring, intestine, and muscles of the body wall (Fig. 3). The distribution pattern and expression levels were consistent in larval stages and adult worms. Recombinant Ce-iPGM and Bm-iPGM Have PGM Activity—To verify their PGM activities, Ce-iPGM and Bm-iPGM were overexpressed in E. coli as C-terminal His6-tagged proteins for enzymatic analysis. The ORF corresponding to the C. elegans shorter splice variant that was selected for expression as the 18 aa extension present in the longer form does not match any known iPGM sequence. Ce-iPGM and Bm-iPGM recombinant proteins (∼60 kDa in size) were abundantly expressed and subsequently purified (Fig. 4A). PGM activity was measured using standard enzyme-coupled assays (12Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both Ce-iPGM and Bm-iPGM showed PGM activity in the glycolytic (conversion of 3-PG to 2-PG) (Fig. 4B) and gluconeogenic directions (2-PG to 3-PG) (Fig. 4C) as evidenced by the consumption of NADH by the coupling enzymes. The slope resulting from the change in NADH concentration was used to calculate specific activities. The specific activities in the forward reaction for Ce-iPGM and Bm-iPGM were ∼40 and 93 units/mg, respectively. For the reverse reaction, the activities for Ce-iPGM and Bm-iPGM were 72 and 256 units/mg, respectively. The addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, the cofactor for dPGM (11Carreras J. Mezquita J. Bosch J. Bartrons R. Pons G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1982; 71: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), did not alter these activities. Likewise, the enzyme activities were not affected by the addition of vanadate, a known inhibitor of dPGM (data not shown) (25Carreras J. Bartrons R. Grisolia S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Distribution and Conservation of iPGM and dPGM Enzymes in Nematodes and Other Eukaryotes—To investigate whether iPGM is present in other nematodes, Ce-iPGM was used as a query to search the recently sequenced genome of the closely related free-living nematode C. briggsae (26Stein L.D. Bao Z. Blasiar D. Blumenthal T. et al.PLoS Biology. 2003; 1: 167-192Crossref Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and the ∼300,000 EST sequences available from 30 different parasitic nematode species (27Wylie T. Martin J.C. Dante M. Mitreva M.D. Clifton S.W. Chinwalla A. Waterston R.H. Wilson R.K. McCarter J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D423-D426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C. briggsae genome was found to contain a predicted gene (CBG12654) that encodes a protein with 95% amino acid identity to Ce-iPGM. In addition, 38 nematode ESTs obtained from a highly diverse group of parasitic nematodes were found to match Ce-iPGM. These included 16 non-overlapping ESTs from a total of 12 parasitic species found in humans (B. malayi, Trichinella spiralis, Onchocerca volvulus, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Necator americanus), animals (Trichuris muris, Litomosoides sigmodontis, Haemonchus contortus, and Ostertagia ostertagi), and plants (Globodera rostochiensis, Meloidogyne incognita, and Heterodera glycines). When these matching sequences were sorted among the five major clades of the phylum Nematoda (3Blaxter M. Science. 1998; 282: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), they were found in all four clades that have existing EST sequences (Fig. 5A). In contrast, no dPGM sequences were found in the C. elegans and C. briggsae genomes or the nematode EST data base when human dPGM (GenBank™ gi130353) (28Shanske S. Sakoda S. Hermodson M.A. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14612-14617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the query. The same human dPGM query identified a large number of orthologs in other organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals (data not shown). The relationship of the nematode iPGMs to other eukaryotic IPGMs was examined using multiple sequence alignments. Ce-iPGM was used to query available databases, and orthologs were identified in fungi, protozoa, and plants. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using full-length iPGM sequences from diverse species that represent the major taxa (Fig. 5B) with a distantly related iPGM from an Archaea Pyrococcus furiosus (29van der Oost J. Huynen M.A. Verhees C.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 212: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) included as an outgroup in displaying the tree. The iPGM enzymes from C. elegans and B. malayi clustered together as expected from the high degree of conservation between them (70% aa identity). The C. elegans enzyme was more closely related to putative fungal iPGM enzymes (41-53% identity) than those found in protozoa (26-30% identity) and plants (∼32% identity). It was 42% identical to the B. stearothermophilus enzyme chosen to represent bacteria iPGM has been found mainly in bacteria and plants and predicted to exist in C. elegans (12Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Grana X. Perez de la Ossa P. Broceno C. Stocker M. Garriga J. Puigdomenech P. Climent F. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 112: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide biochemical characterization of C. elegans iPGM and confirmation of its essential role in development. We also cloned and characterized iPGM from the parasitic nematode B. malayi. We discovered that iPGM is probably present in all of the nematodes as indicated by the presence of numerous matching ESTs from a diverse collection of parasitic species. In sharp contrast, dPGM, the form of the enzyme found in vertebrates, was not detected among any of the available nematode sequence databases. We demonstrate that recombinant iPGM enzymes from C. elegans and B. malayi are active in both glycolytic and gluconeogenic directions. The specific activities were similar to those reported for the recombinant iPGM from T. brucei (23Chevalier N. Rigden D.J. Van Roy J. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but they were ∼10-fold lower than the enzyme from the thermophilic bacterium B. stearothermophilus (22Chander M. Setlow P. Lamani E. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similar to other iPGMs, the activity of the nematode enzymes was not affected by the addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, the cofactor for dPGM or vanadate, a known inhibitor of dPGM. The nematode enzymes were clearly active in neutral buffer containing magnesium ions like the enzymes from E. coli (12Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and T. brucei (31Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it would be of interest in the future to evaluate the effect of other ions on activity because cobalt is preferred by the iPGM from T. brucei (31Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Van Schaftingen E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 204: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and L. mexicana (24Guerra D.G. Vertommen D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1798-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas manganese is optimal for iPGM from Bacillus species (22Chander M. Setlow P. Lamani E. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Chander M. Setlow B. Setlow P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 759-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and present in E. coli iPGM (12Fraser H.I. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As expected from its involvement in a fundamental metabolic pathway, we found Ce-iPGM expressed throughout the worm in all of the developmental stages. The enzyme was most abundant in cells that would be expected to have a higher metabolic rate, such as the frequently contracting body wall muscles, nerve ring, and intestinal cells. Disruption of Ce-iPGM by RNAi resulted in variable defects including embryonic and larval lethality. These defects were initially detected in high throughput RNAi screens (4Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) and characterized in more detail in this study. An interesting finding from our detailed analysis was the apparent delay in the onset of the RNAi effect compared with other genes and an increasing potency over time. For other genes, the progeny produced from the microinjected mother start to show potent and consistent phenotypes ∼6 h after injecting dsRNA (17Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11895) Google Scholar). For iPGM, a low level effect was detected only by 26 h and then it reached maximum potency at 42-66 h post-injection. This delay and incomplete penetrance may be the result of a slower depletion of iPGM transcripts or a stable abundant reservoir of the protein or both. Alternatively, it may reflect the involvement of a non-sustainable salvage regulation in response to the depletion of iPGM. The delayed RNAi effect peculiar to this gene may have partly contributed to the different phenotypes observed for iPGM in the various large-scale RNAi screens (4Fraser A.G. Kamath R.S. Zipperlen P. Martinez-Campos M. Sohrmann M. Ahringer J. Nature. 2000; 408: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 33Kamath R.S. Fraser A.G. Dong Y. Poulin G. Durbin R. Gotta M. Kanapin A. Le Bot N.

PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 77-84Crossref Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely that 100% embryonic lethality would be observed when iPGM activity is completely deleted in a strain carrying a genetic null mutation of iPGM. Our studies clearly demonstrate an essential role for iPGM in C. elegans. Similarly, essential roles for iPGM have also been reported in two bacterial species. Deletion of the iPGM gene in a spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, resulted in extremely slow growth and in an inability to produce spores (36Leyva-Vazquez M.A. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3903-3910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the iPGM locus by a transposon insertion in the tomato bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae resulted in a mutant strain that could not grow or infect tomatoes (37Morris V.L. Jackson D.P. Grattan M. Ainsworth T. Cuppels D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration of the essential roles of iPGM in these organisms suggests that it is possible to target this enzyme in certain pathogens. Our discovery that nematodes have only iPGM in their genomes indicates that it represents an excellent drug target against parasitic nematodes because it is absent from their human and other vertebrate hosts.

https://openalex.org/W2054699781,"The gammaherpesvirus human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infects endothelial and B-lymphoid cells and is responsible for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). In the present study, we demonstrate that the activation of the NF-κB pathway during HHV-8 lytic replication is required for the generation of replication-competent virions capable of initiating a de novo infection of endothelial cells. In the HHV-8-positive PEL cell line BCBL-1, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) induction of the lytic cycle activates the NF-κB pathway, and this activation requires the induction of the IKKβ component of the classical IκB kinase (IKK) complex. To further investigate the role of NF-κB activation in HHV-8 lytic replication, the NF-κB super-repressor IκBα-2NΔ4 was introduced into BCBL-1 cells by retroviral transduction. Expression of IκBα-2NΔ4 completely abolished NF-κB activity, as demonstrated by the loss of NF-κB DNA-binding activity and the absence of expression of the endogenous, NF-κB-regulated IκBα gene. NF-κB blockade dramatically impaired the ability of HHV-8 to produce infectious particles capable of initiating an effective de novo infection of endothelial EA.hy926 cells, as demonstrated by the lack of viral protein production in the target cells. Diminished infectivity did not appear to be caused by a reduction in virus titer, as demonstrated by equivalent viral DNA content in the supernatant of TPA-stimulated BCBL-1 and BCBL-1/2N4 cells. Although the viral and/or cellular products affected by NF-κB inactivation remain to be fully characterized, these data demonstrate an unexpected role for NF-κB induction during lytic reactivation in the production of replication-competent HHV-8 virions."

However, whereas sliding is often envisaged as one-dimensional tracking of the DNA major groove, such a mechanism would not allow linear diffusion over long distances in vivo, where short stretches of free DNA are delimited by bound proteins. I propose a two-dimensional sliding mechanism, in which the protein diffuses freely on the cylindrical DNA surface, and I present experiments that can distinguish between one- and higher-dimensional diffusion along the DNA contour length. At 100 mm NaCl, translocation of EcoRI restriction endonuclease between sites on two DNA helices connected by a Holliday junction is as efficient as between sites on the same helix, indicating a three-dimensional mechanism. At 25 mm NaCl, translocation between sites on the same DNA helix is more efficient, indicating a role for sliding at low ionic strength. Obstacles attached to the major groove of one face of the DNA helix did not interfere with sliding, regardless of their orientation relative to the cleavage sites. This result is compatible with two-dimensional but not one-dimensional sliding. As illustrated by Monte-Carlo simulation, two-dimensional sliding may not only allow proteins to move around nucleosomes in vivo but also reduce the redundancy of their search for the target site.

The binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences is a process central to life. Its thermodynamic basis, the network of noncovalent protein-DNA interactions that confer specificity, is well characterized for a large number of cases. However, the kinetics and mechanism of target location by DNA-binding proteins are not understood in detail.The simplest kinetic model for complex formation between a protein (P) and a specific target site (T) on the DNA would be as follows. P+T⇋P·T(Eq. 1) However, some of the measured association rates are 1000-fold higher than the theoretical diffusion-controlled rate for this model (1von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results from many kinetic studies suggest that nonspecific DNA sequences flanking a specific target site facilitate target location (2Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15293-15296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These findings are compatible with the generally accepted two-step binding model involving nonspecific DNA (N). P+N+T⇋P·N+T⇋P·T+N(Eq. 2) The first step is fast because the concentration of nonspecific sites is much higher than that of specific sites. The second step requires a transfer mechanism between sites on the DNA molecule.Two main classes of hypothetical transfer mechanisms can be distinguished (3Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar): 1) Mechanisms based on dissociation and reassociation of the protein. This class comprises microscopic dissociation-reassociation events (“hopping”), where the protein usually reassociates with the site of dissociation or with a site in the immediate vicinity thereof, and macroscopic dissociation-reassociation events involving diffusion through three-dimensional (3D) 1The abbreviations used are: 3D, three-dimensional; 1D, one-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional.1The abbreviations used are: 3D, three-dimensional; 1D, one-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional. space and binding to an uncorrelated site. 2) Mechanisms during which the protein remains DNA-bound. This class comprises “sliding,” which is defined as diffusion of the protein along the contour length of the DNA, and “direct transfer” of the protein between two non-contiguous DNA segments that are transiently both bound by the same protein molecule. Whereas dissociation-reassociation mechanisms can be expected to be available to all DNA-binding proteins, only proteins that meet certain criteria may use the mechanisms of the second category. In particular, “direct transfer” requires the protein to have two DNA-binding sites.It is important to note that sliding does not necessarily amount to one-dimensional (1D) diffusion of a protein along the major groove of the DNA, although early definitions of sliding seem to imply 1D random walks (3Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) and experimentally observed diffusion along the contour length is often interpreted or labeled as 1D diffusion. Instead, a protein may be free to diffuse on the two-dimensional (2D) cylindrical surface of the DNA between sites that are not adjacent in the primary sequence of the DNA. Although other authors have referred to this mechanism as sliding “along one face of the DNA” (4Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 889-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), I prefer the more general term “2D sliding,” especially in light of the experimental results obtained in this study. Theoretical considerations have been used recently to support 1D sliding for BamHI restriction endonuclease (5Sun J. Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3317-3325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No experiments that can distinguish between 1D and 2D sliding have yet been published.Another unsolved question is whether facilitated diffusion as studied in vitro occurs in vivo: 1D sliding over distances of more than 1000 bp is still a commonly accepted mechanism for facilitated diffusion (2Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15293-15296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); it is incompatible, however, with eukaryotic chromatin as a substrate. Physiologically relevant models of target location by DNA-binding proteins will have to account for the bypass of other DNA-bound proteins.Here, I present experiments that address these questions. Using EcoRI endonuclease as a model system, I show that the protein can bypass obstacles during translocation on DNA; this result rules out 1D diffusion for distances as short as 21 bp (7 nm). 2D diffusion is seen only at low ionic strength. Using computer simulation, I analyze the physiological implications of 2D diffusion, which have not been discussed in the previous literature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides corresponding to the two strands of the DNA substrates were chemically synthesized by Charles Hill (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge); all sequences are listed in Table I. Full-length strands were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and by denaturing gel electrophoresis, and the purity was monitored by capillary electrophoresis. Both strands were radioactively labeled at their 5′ ends using [γ-32P]ATP (6Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Equal amounts of two oligonucleotides were mixed in annealing buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), heated at 80 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Folding of substrates containing a Holliday junction structure was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis as described elsewhere (7Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), except that the running buffer contained 40 mm Tris acetate and 0.1 mm MgCl2.Table IOligonucleotides used in this study Open table in a new tab Cleavage Reactions and Analysis—EcoRI restriction endonuclease and the appropriate diluent buffer were purchased from New England Biolabs. The enzyme was diluted to 2.5 nm immediately before use. 5 nm DNA substrate and 50 pm enzyme were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and NaCl as indicated. Samples were taken at specified time points and mixed with an equal volume of deionized formamide containing 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 10 mm EDTA to stop the reaction. These samples were heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and a fraction corresponding to 25 fmol of DNA substrate was subjected to electrophoresis at 50 W on a sequencing-type denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). The radioactivity of the different bands was quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), corrected for differential labeling of the two strands, and the signals corresponding to the different bands were plotted as a function of time and fitted by linear regression.Monte Carlo Simulation—Simulations were implemented in Fortran 90 and followed the rules described in the legend to Fig. 4B and in the text. The source code of the computer programs is available as supplemental online material.Fig. 4Monte-Carlo simulation of protein motion on DNA. A, individual random walks of proteins on DNA lattices. Circles represent coordinates on the cylindrical DNA surface, which is projected onto a rectangle; the upper and lower edge of each rectangle would be continuous on the DNA cylinder. Gray diagonal lines represent the major groove; a protein located at a coordinate in the major groove can sample the DNA sequence at that site. Gray rectangles represent an obstacle to protein diffusion that partially occludes the DNA helix, for example a nucleosome. Circles with a thick black outline represent the starting position of the diffusing protein. All random walks consisted of 50 site-sampling events.

B, random walks of varying lengths were simulated, and the number of different DNA sites sampled by the protein was recorded. Each data point is the average of 10 simulations. Nucleosomal DNA contained obstacles covering 50% of the DNA surface over a stretch of 145 bp, separated by 55 bp of obstacle-free linker DNA. Unlike in the random walks shown in A, the start site of the protein was in the middle between two obstacles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSMonitoring Protein Motion on DNA by Measuring Processivity—DNA substrates containing two cleavage sites for a given restriction endonuclease have been used in a number of studies to investigate mechanisms of protein motion on the DNA molecule. I follow the nomenclature introduced by Terry et al. (8Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Stanford et al. (9Stanford N.P. Szczelkun M.D. Marko J.F. Halford S.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6546-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for the different cleavage events and the resulting fragments (Fig. 1A). Short 5′-end labeled linear DNA molecules containing two EcoRI cleavage sites were incubated in the presence of EcoRI. Upon encounter with an enzyme molecule, different cleavage events will result in the production of different radiolabeled fragments, the relative amounts of which can be quantified after denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Monitoring DNA cleavage events. A, nomenclature of cleavage events and resulting DNA fragments for digest of a linear DNA substrate containing two cleavage sites. B, EcoRI cleavage of substrate NO in reaction buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction at the indicated time points and analyzed on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, a PhosphorImager record of which is shown. Fragment names and sizes in nucleotides are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Each event produces defined amounts of the different fragments. The total amounts of the fragments, A, C, AB, and BC are therefore a function of the total occurrence of the different events that create them, E1, E2, E12, and E21, as expressed by the following set of equations.A=E1+E12+E21(Eq. 3) C=E2+E12+E21(Eq. 4) AB=E2(Eq. 5) BC=E1(Eq. 6) From these equations, it is possible to derive the following expression.A+AB=C+BC(Eq. 7) This cleavage model describes encounters between one protein and an uncleaved DNA substrate. It therefore reflects the initial phase of the reaction. In all experiments described, the enzyme was incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of substrate to minimize encounters between proteins and partially cleaved DNA fragments. The rates of production of the radiolabeled fragments, vA, vC, vAB, and vBC, were measured during the initial linear phase, in which less than 10% of the total DNA was digested.Equation 7 can be formulated in terms of the following initial rates.vA+vAB=vC+vBC(Eq. 8) Processive cleavage of two sites on one DNA molecule rather than stochastic distributive cleavage of sites on different DNA molecules indicates facilitated diffusion of the restriction endonuclease between the two sites. Processivity is therefore a quantitative measure of the efficiency of protein motion along the DNA. Processivity p is defined as the fraction of proteins that, after cutting one site, also cut the second site of their DNA substrate. It can therefore be expressed as follows.p=(E12+E21)/(E1+E2+E12+E21)(Eq. 9) Substitution yields the following.p=(vA+vC−vBC−vAB)/(vA+vC+vAB+vBC)(Eq. 10) It is generally assumed that after the cleavage reaction, the enzyme stays bound to one of the two DNA fragments, whereas the other fragment diffuses away. Therefore, the theoretical upper limit for processivity on linear substrates is 0.5.The Effect of Obstacles on Processivity—Obstacles that physically impair protein diffusion between the two cleavage sites on the DNA substrate can generally be expected to reduce the processivity. Whether a particular obstacle affects the processivity, however, will depend on the mode of protein diffusion. Therefore, investigation of the effect that different obstacles have on processivity can yield information about the mechanism of protein motion along DNA.I designed four DNA substrates, as shown in Fig. 2A. Substrate NO is the control substrate without an obstacle. The spacing of the two EcoRI cleavage sites is 21 bp; the sites are therefore located on the same face of the DNA helix. In substrates OA and OS, an obstacle is created by a 6-bp DNA helix capped at both ends with tetraloops, which is connected to the DNA substrate via a four-way junction. In substrate OS, the obstacle faces the same way as the EcoRI recognition sequence in the major groove; in substrate OA, the obstacle faces away from the cleavage sites. Fig. 2, B and C, shows an atomic model of the tertiary structure of the obstacle. The obstacle should not interfere with nonspecific binding of EcoRI endonuclease to the opposite face of the DNA molecule. Substrates OA and OS were obtained by annealing two oligonucleotides of different lengths. The strands were complementary at their ends, but the longer strand contained an additional interior stretch of 20 nucleotides that was designed to fold into the obstacle described above. The short DNA helix was stabilized by 5 CG pairs, as well as GTAA tetraloops, which are known to be particularly stable (10Antao V.P. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The sequence at the four-way junction included the trinucleotide ACC, which has been shown to stabilize specific pair-wise stacking of the four DNA helices (11Eichman B.F. Vargason J.M. Mooers B.H. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In substrate FJ, the helices around the conserved four-way junction were rewired such that the two EcoRI sites no longer lie on a continuous DNA helix. The spacing of the sites was chosen such that an enzyme bound to either of the cleavage sites would not experience steric hindrance by the rest of the DNA substrate. The relative mobility of the four DNA substrates during native gel electrophoresis supports their predicted structures with respect to helical stacking (Fig. 2D). It cannot be excluded that the short helix forming the obstacle assumes a slightly different structure, possibly an ensemble of structures, or undergoes thermal fluctuations. In any case, it will present an obstacle to 1D sliding of EcoRI that is localized to one face of the DNA helix.Fig. 2Overview of DNA substrates. A, substrate names are given and the constituting oligonucleotides are indicated. Complete sequences are listed in Table I. The tertiary structure is shown schematically. White lines delimit major and minor grooves. Arrows emerging from the major groove represent the dyad axis of EcoRI restriction sites. Secondary structure representations reveal the intended base pairing in the central region of the DNA substrate. A box is drawn around the conserved four-way junction core with known helical stacking of substrates OA, OS, and FJ. The lengths of EcoRI restriction fragments are shown. Where the length differs for the two strands of the DNA substrate, the length of the longer fragment is given in parentheses. B and C, Protein Data Bank coordinates 1DCW, 1F7Y, and BDL084 were used to construct a three-dimensional model of the obstacle (stereo view).

The production of cleavage fragments over time was plotted and vA, vC, vAB, and vBC were determined by linear fitting of the initial phase of the reaction (Fig. 3A). Processivity p was calculated as described above. Fig. 3B shows the values for p under different substrate and ion conditions. For substrate NO, the processivity at 25 mm NaCl is close to the theoretical limit of 0.5. At higher ionic strength, the processivity is reduced. There are no significant differences in processivity between the four substrates at 100 mm NaCl. The obstacles in substrates OA and OS do not have an effect on processivity at 25 mm NaCl, either. However, the processivity for substrate FJ at 25 mm NaCl is significantly lower than for the other substrates.Fig. 3Comparison of cleavage processivity for the different DNA substrates. A, cleavage of substrate FJ in a reaction buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Production of cleavage fragments was quantified from PhosphorImager records of denaturing gels and plotted as a percentage of the total DNA amount. Data from the linear phase of the reaction were fitted by straight lines, the slopes of which were used to calculate processivity. B, overview of all processivities measured. For each substrate and NaCl concentration, the average and standard error of processivities determined from at least 3 separate experiments is shown. At 100 mm NaCl, the processivities of the different substrates are not significantly different (p > 0.05), as determined by analysis of variance. At 25 mm NaCl, the only substrate that displays a processivity significantly different from the others (p < 0.05) is FJ (marked by an asterisk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Comparison of 1D and 2D Diffusion of Proteins on DNA by Monte-Carlo Simulation—As I will discuss in more detail below, the experimental results seem to rule out 1D sliding of EcoRI along the major groove of the DNA as a functionally significant mechanism of facilitated diffusion. The results, however, are compatible with 2D sliding at low ionic strengths. In a 2D sliding mode, the protein would move between sites on the DNA but remain nonspecifically bound to it. However, the protein would not track the major groove as in 1D sliding, but it would freely diffuse across the entire cylindrical surface of the DNA. I used Monte-Carlo simulation to compare how efficiently proteins would scan the DNA for their target site using 1D versus 2D diffusion. In a given amount of time determined by the dissociation rate, the protein can sample a given number of sites. Target location will be more efficient and less redundant when the number of different sites sampled is high.For 1D diffusion on naked DNA, the protein had the same probability of stepping forward or backward along the DNA major groove (Fig. 4A, blue). 2D diffusion was modeled such that each random walk step was either along the major groove or orthogonal to the major groove (Fig. 4A, yellow). Coordinates outside the major groove are likely to be energetically less favorable positions for the protein and represent transition states between the energetically more favorable positions that coincide with major groove sites. The time spent at major groove positions is likely to be much greater than the time spent at all other positions, and dissociation from a major groove site rather than the translocation time between sites will be rate-limiting. The simulation was therefore based on the simplifying assumption that pathways between two major groove sites take the same amount of time irrespective of the length of the pathway.In vivo, DNA is bound to nucleosomes and other proteins that occlude parts of the major groove. In Fig. 4A, green and red show proteins following the same rules for 1D and 2D diffusion, respectively, on a DNA substrate bound to an obstacle. The simulation assumes that the diffusing protein can still access half of the DNA surface in the nucleosome-bound region; the actual accessible surface in physiological protein-bound DNA is likely to be even smaller because of steric hindrance. Fig. 4B shows the number of different major groove sites sampled as a function of all site-sampling events. On naked DNA, 2D diffusion is more efficient than 1D diffusion. On nucleosomal DNA, proteins using 1D diffusion can sample only the linker DNA between two nucleosomes (55 bp in the simulation). 2D diffusion on nucleosomal DNA is however highly efficient; it is even more efficient than 2D diffusion on naked DNA.DISCUSSION1D Sliding versus 2D Sliding—1D sliding along the major groove is an appealing model for target location of DNA-binding proteins. Although most authors favor this model, no experimental evidence specifically supports it (2Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15293-15296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A recently published computational study (5Sun J. Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3317-3325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) predicts 1D sliding for BamHI restriction endonuclease. The most favorable position for BamHI associated with nonspecific DNA is calculated to be at a distance of 34 Å from the DNA axis, facing the major groove. Thus, the protein may be able to slide along the DNA on a water cushion. The authors calculate an energy barrier of 2.6 kcal/mol for the movement of the protein from its position over the major groove to the minor groove and conclude that the protein will therefore follow a helical path along the major groove during diffusion to avoid this energy barrier. In their argument, they neglect, however, that the protein may also face considerable energy barriers when moving between two major groove sites, because it will transiently have to leave the optimal orientation with respect to the backbone phosphates. Furthermore, helical movement of proteins around DNA has been shown to be unfavorable for hydrodynamic reasons (12Schurr J.M. Biophys. Chem. 1979; 9: 413-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For an accurate prediction of the behavior of proteins bound to nonspecific DNA, molecular dynamics simulations taking into account solvent water molecules will be necessary.This study presents for the first time experiments that can distinguish between 1D and 2D sliding. Processivity of EcoRI cleavage was investigated for DNA substrates that contain obstacles between two cleavage sites. The obstacle was located in the major groove on one face of the DNA, so that proteins using 1D sliding would not be able to overcome it. The obstacle, however, should not affect proteins using higher-dimensional modes of diffusion. At both low and moderate ionic strength, facilitated diffusion of EcoRI between the two cleavage sites was as efficient as in the absence of an obstacle. This result indicates that 1D sliding does not play a significant role in protein motion over distances as short as 21 bp.If 2D sliding is involved in facilitated diffusion, it is an interesting question whether the protein prefers pathways along one face of the DNA, or whether a genuine 2D random walk applies. If pathways along one face of the DNA were preferred, processivity on substrate OA could be expected to be higher than on substrate OS. Because processivities on OA and OS are not significantly different under both ionic strength conditions, diffusion along one face of the DNA can be ruled out.2D Sliding versus 3D Diffusion—Transfer of EcoRV between distant DNA sites has been shown to involve 3D diffusion (9Stanford N.P. Szczelkun M.D. Marko J.F. Halford S.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6546-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase has been shown to diffuse along the contour length of the DNA (13Guthold M. Zhu X. Rivetti C. Yang G. Thomson N.H. Kasas S. Hansma H.G. Smith B. Hansma P.K. Bustamante C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2284-2294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); this finding is compatible with sliding rather than 3D diffusion. It is likely that different proteins have evolved idiosyncratic mechanisms of target location. Furthermore, proteins may use a combination of different diffusion modes: 2D sliding over short distances and 3D diffusion over long distances.The data presented here support the occurrence of 2D sliding at low ionic strength. The distance between the two cleavage sites in substrate NO is greater than in substrate FJ, yet the processivity is higher on NO at 25 mm NaCl. The most probable explanation for this observation is that the highly efficient transfer between the two sites on NO relies on 2D sliding. Because the two sites on FJ do not lie on the same double helix, 2D sliding cannot be used for the transfer and the protein has to rely on less efficient 3D diffusion.However, 3D hopping over very short distances along the DNA may also account for the observed effect. Furthermore, the physiological relevance of phenomena observed under low ionic strength conditions is arguable.Obstacles and Efficiency of Target Location—Almost all studies into"

Our previous findings have shown that baicalein, a major flavonoid derived from the medicinal herb Scutellariae radix, induces Cl– secretion across rat colonic mucosa. The current study examines the effect of baicalein on Cl– secretion in human colonic epithelial (T84) cells and its interaction with Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent secretagogues. We have employed a technique that allows concurrent monitoring of short-circuit current (ISC) and [Ca2+]i in polarized epithelium. Basolateral application of baicalein induced a concentration-dependent increase in ISC. The increase in ISC was because of Cl– secretion and was not accompanied by any discernible increase in [Ca2+]i. Baicalein acted synergistically with Ca2+- but not cAMP-dependent secretagogues. In the presence of baicalein, the carbachol and histamine induced increases in ISC that were markedly potentiated while increases in [Ca2+]i were not significantly enhanced. Baicalein treatment uncoupled Cl– secretion from inhibitory effects normally generated by muscarinic activation. Baicalein treatment also resulted in increased cAMP content and activated PKA activity. Nystatin permeabilization studies revealed that baicalein stimulated an apical Cl– current but did not activate any basolateral K+ current. These data suggest that baicalein potentiates Ca2+-mediated Cl– secretion through a signaling pathway involving cAMP and protein kinase A, most likely through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the apical membrane.

Some flavonoids have been shown to possess anti-diarrheal effects and to inhibit intestinal motility or protect animals against castor oil-induced diarrhea (e.g. apigenin from Petroselinum sativum). Other flavonoids have been shown to stimulate colonic epithelial ion transport processes. The best known examples are quercetin (a flavonol) and genistein (an isoflavone). Recent studies have shown that quercetin stimulates Cl– secretion across rat colonic mucosa (11Cermak R. Vujicic Z. Scharrer E. Wolffram S. Biochem.

This secretory activity does not depend on cAMP but depends on Ca2+, possibly via a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent pathway. The cAMP pathway and inhibition of phosphodiesterase appear not to be responsible for the secretory activity of the flavonol (13Cermak R. Vujicic Z. Kuhn G. Wolffram S. Exp.

On the other hand, genistein can activate both wild type and mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CCh, carbachol; DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; PKA, protein kinase A; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; ISC, short-circuit current; Fura-2-AM, Fura-2 acetoxymethylester; Δratio, change in Fura-2 ratio; ΔISC, change in short-circuit current; ICl(ap), apical membrane Cl– currents; IK(bl), basolateral membrane K+ currents. 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CCh, carbachol; DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; PKA, protein kinase A; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; ISC, short-circuit current; Fura-2-AM, Fura-2 acetoxymethylester; Δratio, change in Fura-2 ratio; ΔISC, change in short-circuit current; ICl(ap), apical membrane Cl– currents; IK(bl), basolateral membrane K+ currents. probably through direct binding of the channel (14Roomans G.M. Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 10: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the rat colon, genistein has been found to stimulate Cl– secretion and to inhibit Na+ and Cl– absorption. Moreover, pre-stimulation of the cAMP pathway is a prerequisite for the secretory action of genistein (15Heinke B. Horger S. Diener M. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1999; 165: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 16Diener M. Hug F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 299: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Currently, there are no reports describing any effect of baicalein on colonic secretion in human intestinal cells.Our previous finding provided the first evidence that baicalein induces Cl– secretion across rat colonic mucosa, possibly via a cAMP-dependent pathway (17Ko W.H. Law V.W. Yip W.C. Yue G.G. Lau C.W. Chen Z.Y. Huang Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G508-G518Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the underlying pro-secretory mechanism(s) of baicalein differs from that of quercetin or genistein. Consequently, we examined the effect of baicalein on Cl– secretion in human colonic epithelial (T84) cells and its interaction with Ca2+-dependent secretagogues. In the present study, we employed a technique that allows concurrent monitoring of agonist-induced short-circuit current (ISC) and [Ca2+]i in a polarized epithelium (18Wong C.H. Ko W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9016-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we show that baicalein stimulates Cl– secretion and potentiates Ca2+-mediated Cl– secretion via a cAMP- and PKA-dependent pathway in human intestinal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulture of Cells—Experiments were performed using the human intestinal T84 cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection. T84 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and ISC, cells were seeded onto Transwell-col membranes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 0.4-μm pore diameter (culture area 0.1 cm2) as previously described (18Wong C.H. Ko W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9016-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells reached confluency after 9 to 10 days, with a resistance greater than 300 Ω·cm2.Simultaneous Measurements of [Ca2+]i and ISC—Agonist-induced calcium signals and anion secretion were measured simultaneously in polarized epithelium as described (18Wong C.H. Ko W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9016-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Ko W.H. Law V.W. Wong H.Y. Wilson S.M. J. Membr.

Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on a Transwell-col membrane were loaded with Fura-2 by incubation (45 min, 37 °C) in bicarbonate-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 3 μm Fura-2-AM and 1.6 μm pluronic F127. Membranes bearing Fura-2-loaded epithelia were then mounted in a miniature Ussing chamber (22Larsen E.H. Novak I. Pedersen P.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 424: 109-131Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) attached to the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon TE300). The cells were viewed with a ×40 extra long working distance objective (Nikon CFI Plan Fluor ELWD, 0.6 numerical aperture). The Fura-2 fluorescence ratios were recorded (PTI Ratio-Master fluorescence system, Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) from an optical field containing 30 to 40 cells in the center of the epithelium. The potential difference was clamped to 0 mV, and ISC was simultaneously measured using a voltage-clamp amplifier (VCC 600; Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Both signals were digitized and recorded to computer hard disk. Positive currents, displayed as upward deflections of the traces, were defined as those carried by anions moving from the basolateral to the apical compartments. A transepithelial potential difference of 1 mV was applied periodically, and the resultant change in current was used to calculate the transepithelial resistance using Ohm's law.Short-circuit Measurement in Nystatin-permeabilized T84 Monolayers—Experiments were performed using conventional ISC measurements with T84 cell monolayers grown on Millipore filter membranes (Millipore) with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm as described previously (23Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497: 19-29Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 885-894Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The monolayers were mounted in an Ussing chamber and bathed in normal Krebs-Henseleit solution while the ISC was measured as above. Apical membrane Cl– currents, defined as ICl(ap), were measured in cells permeabilized basolaterally with 360 μg/ml nystatin in the presence of asymmetrical buffers that imposed an apical to basolateral Cl– gradient (25Chan H.C. Cheung W.T. Leung P.Y. Wu L.J. Chew S.B. Ko W.H. Wong P.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C469-C477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basolateral NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate. Nystatin was added to the basolateral membrane 30 min before the addition of drugs. Basolateral membrane K+ currents, defined as IK(bl), were measured in cells permeabilized apically with 360 μg/ml nystatin for 30 min in the presence of asymmetrical buffers that imposed an apical-to-basolateral K+ gradient. The apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar K-gluconate, whereas basolateral NaCl was substituted with equimolar sodium gluconate. In all gluconate-containing solutions, CaCl2 was increased to 11 mm to compensate for the Ca2+ chelating effect of the gluconate anion (24Ko W.H. Chan H.C. Chew S.B. Wong P.Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 885-894Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Measurement of cAMP Accumulation and Protein Kinase A (PKA) Activity—T84 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per ml in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning). On day 10, confluent T84 cells were washed and incubated in Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 °C for 15 min. Drugs were added to the wells and incubated for various time periods. Afterward, each well of cells was washed with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit solution and extracted with 500 μl of lysing buffer (0.1 m HCl and 1% Triton X-100) for 10 min. Lysed cells were mixed with the buffer solution and centrifuged at 300 × g for 4 min at room temperature. The cAMP content of cleared supernatants was assayed using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). In each experiment, the protein content of three wells was measured by using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Sigma). Protein determination allowed detection of cAMP at picomole/mg. For PKA activity, the confluent T84 cells were incubated with vehicle alone or baicalein for 5 and 15 min and assayed using the PepTag® non-radioactive cAMP-dependent protein kinase assay system (Promega). The phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated samples were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel at 100 V for 15 min. The gel was photographed and the fluorescence intensity was quantified by the FluorChem™ 8000 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA).Materials and Solutions—The bicarbonate-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution contained (in mm) NaCl, 117; NaHCO3, 25; KCl, 4.7; MgSO4, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; CaCl2, 2.5; and d-glucose, 11, pH 7.4, when bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Cl–-free solution was prepared by isosmotically replacing NaCl and KCl with sodium gluconate and potassium gluconate, respectively; CaCl2 was replaced with 11 mm calcium gluconate to counteract the chelating effect of gluconate anion. The membrane permeant acetoxymethylester (AM) forms of Fura-2 and pluronic F127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Baicalein, bumetanide, carbachol (CCh), charybdotoxin, forskolin, histamine, and nystatin were obtained from Sigma. Diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) was obtained form Riedel-de Haën (Hannover, Germany); glibenclamide from Sigma; and 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom). All other general laboratory reagents were obtained from Sigma, and cell culture reagents from Invitrogen.Data Analysis—Experimentally induced changes (Δ) in Fura-2 fluorescence ratio and ISC were quantified by measuring each parameter at the peak of a response and subtracting the equivalent values measured immediately prior to stimulation. Pooled data are presented as mean ± S.E., and values of n refer to the number of experiments in each group. Data were analyzed by Student's t test for paired or unpaired variants and analysis of variance where appropriate, with p < 0.05 considered significant.RESULTSBaicalein Stimulates an Increase in ISC but Not in [Ca2+]i— Our previous study demonstrated that baicalein stimulates Cl– secretion in rat colon (17Ko W.H. Law V.W. Yip W.C. Yue G.G. Lau C.W. Chen Z.Y. Huang Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G508-G518Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study, the effects of baicalein on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1A) and ISC (Fig. 1B) were monitored simultaneously in T84 cells. The 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio was used to represent the changes in [Ca2+]i. Basolateral application of 100 μm baicalein elicited an increase in ISC (n = 10, Fig. 1B). Meanwhile, baicalein did not induce any discernible increase in fluorescence ratio (Fig. 1A). Apical application of baicalein (10–300 μm) did not induce any significant concentration-dependent increases in ISC or [Ca2+]i (data not shown). When cells were exposed to 2-min pulses of increasing concentrations (10–300 μm) of baicalein, a concentration-dependent increase in ISC occurred (Fig. 1C), with an EC50 value of 28.2 ± 5.5 μm. In Cl–-free solution, basolateral application of baicalein (100 μm) did not induce any increase in ISC (n = 5). The data confirm that the baicalein-induced increase in ISC in T84 cells is because of Cl– secretion.Baicalein Potentiates Cl–Secretion Stimulated by Ca2+-dependent Agonists—Although baicalein did not stimulate a substantial increase in Cl– secretion as seen in rat colon (17Ko W.H. Law V.W. Yip W.C. Yue G.G. Lau C.W. Chen Z.Y. Huang Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G508-G518Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it may interact with other known secretagogues acting via cAMP or Ca2+. Experiments were performed to determine whether baicalein acted synergistically with Ca2+-dependent agonists, such as the muscarinic receptor agonist CCh. As seen in Fig. 2, CCh (10 μm, basolateral) induced a transient increase in ISC (ΔISC = 6.9 ± 0.5 μA/cm2, n = 21) in the T84 monolayers. CCh produced a rapid increase in ISC that peaked at 1–2 min after drug application and returned to baseline values within 15 min (Fig. 2B). At the same time, CCh stimulated an increase in Fura-2 fluorescence ratio (Δratio = 0.28 ± 0.02, n = 21), with maximum ratio reached within 10–20 s (Fig. 2A). The fluorescence ratio then declined gradually and reached a plateau, but it did not return to baseline until CCh was washed off. The EC50 values for the CCh-induced increase in ISC and Fura-2 fluorescence ratio were 31.1 ± 9.2 and 5.1 ± 3.1 μm, respectively.Fig. 2Effect of baicalein on carbachol-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and ISC. Basolateral additions of CCh (10 μm) induced increases in Fura-2 ratio (A) and ISC (B). For the T84 monolayer responses shown in C and D, cells were initially perfused bilaterally with normal Krebs-Henseleit solution. The monolayers were exposed to baicalein (100 μm) on the basolateral (bl) side as indicated and then stimulated with CCh (10 μm, bl). The subsequent CCh-induced changes in ISC (D) were statistically different from the control responses (p < 0.05, Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether baicalein could potentiate the CCh-induced secretory effect, cells were first exposed to baicalein on the apical or basolateral side. After 2 min, CCh (10 μm, basolateral) was added to the cells in the presence of baicalein. Fig. 2D shows that baicalein (basolateral) markedly enhanced the ISC response to CCh (ΔISC = 14.1 ± 3.4 μA/cm2, n = 23). The peak increase in ISC differs significantly from that of control (ΔISC = 6.9 ± 0.5 μA/cm2, n = 21, p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained when the monolayers were stimulated with CCh in the presence of 100 μm baicalein applied to the apical side (ΔISC = 12.43 ± 3.12 μA/cm2, n = 23, p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the response of [Ca2+]i to CCh in the absence (Fig. 2A) or presence (Fig. 2C) of baicalein was qualitatively the same (CCh alone: Δratio = 0.28 ± 0.02, n = 21; baicalein + CCh: Δratio = 0.29 ± 0.02, n = 23, p > 0.05). Therefore, the secretory response to CCh was significantly potentiated by baicalein added to either side of the epithelia. However, baicalein treatment did not alter the response to [Ca2+]i. In the presence of baicalein (apical or basolateral), the CCh-induced ISC increase was abolished in Cl–-free solution while the CCh-induced [Ca2+]i increase remained unchanged (n = 5, data not shown), further confirming that baicalein potentiated the CCh-stimulated Cl– secretion in T84 cells. The threshold concentration of baicalein for the augmentation of CCh-elicited ISC was repeatedly observed at 10 μm (n = 10, data not shown).To determine whether the ability of baicalein to potentiate Ca2+-dependent secretory responses was specific for CCh, the H2-receptor agonist histamine was used. Addition of histamine (100 μm) to the basolateral bathing solution of T84 cell monolayers increased both [Ca2+]i and ISC (Δratio = 0.26 ± 0.03; ΔISC = 3.9 ± 0.5 μA/cm2; n = 6), as shown in Fig. 3, A and B. Prior additions of apical (Fig. 3, C and D) or basolateral (data not shown) baicalein (100 μm) increased potentiation of ISC responses to 7.6 ± 1.1 μA/cm2 (Fig. 3D, n = 6, p < 0.05) and 8.0 ± 2.0 μA/cm2 (n = 5, p < 0.05), respectively. However, there was no significant difference in [Ca2+]i responses elicited by histamine in the absence (Fig. 3A, Δratio = 0.26 ± 0.03, n = 6) or presence of baicalein in the apical (Fig. 3C, Δratio = 0.28 ± 0.02, n = 7, p > 0.05) or basolateral side (Δratio = 0.30 ± 0.02, n = 7, p > 0.05). Therefore, the potentiation effect of baicalein on histamine-induced ISC was similar to that of CCh.Fig. 3Effect of baicalein on histamine-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and ISC. Basolateral additions of histamine (100 μm) induced increases in Fura-2 ratio (A) and ISC (B). For the T84 monolayer responses shown in C and D, cells were initially perfused bilaterally with normal Krebs-Henseleit solution. The monolayers were exposed to baicalein (100 μm) on the apical (ap) side as indicated and then stimulated with histamine (100 μm, bl). The subsequent histamine-induced changes in ISC (D) were statistically different from the control responses (p < 0.05, Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Baicalein Uncouples the Inhibitory Effects of Carbachol on Subsequent Cl–Secretory Response—A previous study has shown that carbachol exhibits stimulatory and inhibitory effects on Cl– secretion (26Warhurst G. Higgs N.B. Tonge A. Turnberg L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G220-G228PubMed Google Scholar). The long-term effect of this muscarinic agonist on Cl– secretion is inhibitory (27Barrett K.E. Smitham J. Traynor-Kaplan A. Uribe J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C958-C965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol.

Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We tested whether baicalein affected muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of Ca2+-dependent Cl– secretion. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, T84 cell monolayers stimulated with CCh (10 μm, basolateral) exhibited increases in both [Ca2+]i and ISC. However, such a brief exposure to CCh was capable of inhibiting the subsequent ISC response of the cells to a second challenge of CCh (1st peak: ΔISC = 5.9 ± 0.7 μA/cm2; 2nd peak: ΔISC = 2.4 ± 0.9 μA/cm2, n = 4, p < 0.05). In contrast, if baicalein (30 μm, basolateral) was added after withdrawal of CCh activation as shown in Fig. 4D, a markedly potentiated CCh-induced ISC occurred (1st CCh challenge: ΔISC = 5.4 ± 0.6 μA/cm2; 2nd CCh challenge: ΔISC = 15.0 ± 4.4 μA/cm2, n = 7, p < 0.05). Under this condition, the first CCh challenge no longer inhibited the second CCh-induced ISC response, despite the change in fluorescence ratio (Fig. 4C) being significantly decreased (1st CCh challenge: Δratio = 0.30 ± 0.02; 2nd CCh challenge: Δratio = 0.25 ± 0.03, n = 7, p < 0.05). Therefore, baicalein reversed the subsequent refractoriness of the cells to CCh-induced Cl– secretion. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4D, the baicalein-induced ISC response was also significantly potentiated when the monolayers were pre-stimulated with CCh (10 μm, bl). In control experiments, the ISC responses to baicalein (30 μm, basolateral) were only 0.3 ± 0.1 μA/cm2 (n = 9). However, after the monolayers were challenged by CCh, the same concentration of baicalein elicited an increase in ISC (4.6 ± 1.5 μA/cm2, n = 7, p < 0.05).Fig. 4Effect of repeating stimulation of the T84 monolayers with carbachol on [Ca2+]i and ISC changes in the absence or presence of baicalein. Fura-2 ratio (A) and ISC (B) were measured from T84 epithelia receiving two carbachol (CCh) stimulations. Monolayers were first exposed to 10 μm CCh on the basolateral (bl) side. CCh was washed off, and the monolayer was challenged with the same concentration of CCh after 10 min. Fura-2 ratio (C) and ISC (D) were measured in the monolayer using a protocol similar to that described in A and B with 100 μm baicalein added to the basolateral side of the monolayer before the second challenge of CCh. Essentially identical responses were obtained in eight experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction of Baicalein with Forskolin and the Effect on Cl–Secretion—We next examined whether baicalein would interact with a cAMP-dependent secretagogue of Cl– secretion. Therefore, experiments were performed to test the effects of baicalein on Cl– secretion in the presence of the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. Applications of baicalein and forskolin had no discernible effect on [Ca2+]i (data not shown). In the presence of low concentrations of forskolin (0.1 and 1 μm), application of baicalein elicited an increase in ISC (Fig. 5, A and B, n = 4). In contrast, when the monolayers were maximally stimulated by 10 μm forskolin (Fig. 5D), subsequent addition of baicalein (100 μm, apical) inhibited the ISC from 96.9 ± 13.5 to 86.3 ± 12.5 μA/cm2 (n = 4). The inhibitory effect of baicalein on forskolin-induced ISC was similar when baicalein was applied to the basolateral side (n = 4, data not shown). Moreover, washing out of baicalein was associated with overshooting of ISC (Fig. 5, A–D). These data suggest that forskolin and baicalein may share a common intracellular signaling pathway (e.g. cAMP) for stimulating Cl– secretion. Thus, upon maximal stimulation of cAMP-dependent Cl– secretion, baicalein may exert an inhibitory effect.Fig. 5Effect of baicalein on forskolin-induced changes in ISC. T84 monolayers were initially perfused bilaterally with normal Krebs-Henseleit solution and then stimulated by adding forskolin (0.1 (A), 1 (B), 3 (C), or 10 (D) μm) to the apical bathing solution. Apical (ap) or basolateral (bl) baicalein (100 μm) was added at the peak ISC response of forskolin. These records are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Baicalein Stimulates cAMP Accumulation and PKA Activity—Our previous data have shown that baicalein does not induce increased [Ca2+]i but potentiates the ISC response to Ca2+-dependent agonists such as CCh and histamine. Furthermore, baicalein does not further increase the ISC after a maximal forskolin-induced ISC response. Therefore, it is likely that baicalein exerts its effect via a cAMP-dependent pathway in T84 cells. Preliminary study has shown that maximal cAMP stimulation was detected when the cells were exposed to baicalein (100 μm) for 2 min (compared with those measured at 5 and 10 min). As shown in Fig. 6A, the intracellular cAMP content under basal conditions was 2.53 ± 0.26 pmol/mg protein (n = 7). After incubation with baicalein (100 μm), cAMP levels increased significantly to 4.62 ± 0.41 pmol/mg protein (n = 7, p < 0.05). To test whether decreased cAMP degradation contributed to increased cAMP levels, the broad, specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX was added to T84 cells, and the resulting effects on baicalein-responsive cAMP levels were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6B, IBMX (100 μm) alone cause an increase in cAMP levels to 3.57 ± 1.20 pmol/mg protein, which is not significantly different from baicalein (n = 5, p > 0.05). However, after incubation with baicalein (100 μm) in the presence of IBMX (100 μm), there was a significant increase in cAMP levels (6.32 ± 1.01 pmol/mg protein, n = 6, p > 0.05). In the presence of forskolin (1 or 10 μm) and IBMX (100 μm), baicalein (100 μm) coul"

Many proteins, most notably transcriptional regulators, contain multiple cZFs, and typically the cZFs comprise the DNA recognition domain. Indeed the mechanisms by which cZFs recognize specific DNA sequences are now well understood, and it has even been possible to generate artificial cZF proteins with tailored DNA-binding activities (for a review, see Ref. 4Jamieson A.C. Miller J.C. Pabo C.O. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discovery. 2003; 2: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In other cases, cZFs have been shown to mediate RNA recognition, and the structural basis for the binding of Transcription Factor IIIA to the 5S RNA has now been elucidated (5Lu D. Searles M.A. Klug A. Nature. 2003; 426: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Most recently, cZFs have been shown to act as specific protein-protein interaction domains (6McCarty A.S. Kleiger G. Eisenberg D. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), however, the structural details of how cZFs mediate specific protein contacts have not been revealed to date. As part of our efforts to gain a broader understanding of the functions of cZF domains, and as a first step toward deciphering the activities of the myriad cZFs deposited in sequence databases, we have investigated the cZFs of the transcriptional co-regulator Friend of GATA (FOG) (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). FOG is known to physically interact with the erythroid/megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA-1 and either inhibit or potentiate its activity depending on promoter context (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Crispino J.D. Letting D.L. Nakazawa M. Poncz M. Blobel G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5225-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). FOG is the founding member of a family of co-regulators, including FOG-2 and Drosophila U-shaped, which act as important cofactors for GATA transcription factors in various biological contexts (10Fossett N. Tevosian S.G. Gajewski K. Zhang Q. Orkin S.H. Schulz R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7342-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). FOG (see Fig. 1A) is a multitype cZF protein that contains four typical cZFs and five variant cZFs, which exhibit a final cysteine in place of the usual histidine (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Several of these latter variant fingers have been shown to mediate direct contact with GATA-1 (12Fox A.H. Liew C. Holmes M. Kowalski K. Mackay J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but the functions of the four traditional cZFs in FOG have not been elucidated. The possibility that these classic ZFs are involved in nucleic acid binding has been investigated (13Kwan A.H. Czolij R. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but to date no convincing evidence for DNA or RNA recognition has been obtained. To determine whether any of the cZFs of FOG mediate protein-protein interactions, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen against a region of FOG containing three of its classic cZFs, i.e. cZFs 2, 3, and 4. From this screen, we isolated a clone encoding part of the Transforming Acidic Coiled-Coil protein 3 (TACC3) (14McKeveney P.J. Hodges V.M. Mullan R.N. Maxwell P. Simpson D. Thompson A. Winter P.C.

Dev. 2000; 97: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TACC3 is known to associate with microtubule-binding proteins and is implicated in the movement of chromosomes during mitosis; consequently, it has been suggested that it may be part of a general apparatus that coordinates DNA and chromosome dynamics during cellular proliferation (17Raff J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 222-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Lappin T.R. Mullan R.N. Stewart J.P. Morgan N.A. Thompson A. Maxwell A.P. Leuk.

Recently, it has been reported that TACC3 inhibits the activity of FOG in immature erythroid cells by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. A decrease in TACC3 levels during erythroid maturation has been postulated to allow FOG to move into the nucleus to regulate genes required for erythroid differentiation (20Garriga-Canut M. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23597-23605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We define the region of FOG required to mediate the interaction with TACC3 as FOG-ZF3. This domain, when expressed in isolation, showed poor solubility. Nevertheless, we used mutagenic mapping followed by protein engineering to obtain a derivative FOG-ZF3KRA that is soluble but maintains the TACC3-binding properties of FOG-ZF3. We confirm that this domain forms a genuine classic ZF. We further show that, remarkably, it is the α-helix of ZF3 that contacts TACC3. This is the same helix that, in well characterized cZFs, contacts the major groove of DNA. The interacting domain of TACC3 forms a predominantly dimeric coiled-coil, and it is a small negatively charged C-terminal surface of this coiled-coil that interacts with FOG-ZF3. Our results are discussed in the context of the fields of genomic annotation, protein design, gene expression and hematopoiesis. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Clontech two-hybrid system was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A murine erythroleukemia cell cDNA library (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) in the Gal4 activation domain fusion vector, pGAD10. Gal4AD was transfected into the yeast strain HF7c, harboring the bait plasmid pGBT9.mFOG-(241-407). DNA was recovered from yeast colonies that grew on Trp/Leu/His-deficient media and used to transform Escherichia coli strain HB101. Plasmid DNA was purified and the inserts sequenced. Interactions between FOG and TACC3 as well as TACC3 self-association were investigated by co-transforming HF7c with appropriate bait and prey plasmids. The resulting transformants were selected on Leu/Trp-deficient plates and patched onto Leu/Trp/His-deficient plates. In a similar manner, the semi-quantitative assays were performed by co-transforming pGAD10.mTACC3-(535-637) and pGBT9.mFOG-(241-407) or mFOG-(328-360). Transformants originally selected on Leu/Trp-deficient plates were grown overnight, and the density of the resultant cultures was adjusted to an absorbance of 0.3 at 600 nm. Four serial dilutions of 1 in 10 (2 μl each) were then spotted onto Leu/Trp/His-deficient plates. Growth was monitored after incubation at 29 °C for 30 h. Production of Recombinant Proteins and GST-pull-down Assays—Recombinant GST-FOG and GST-TACC3 proteins were produced in the E. coli strain BL-21, purified as described previously (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5057) Google Scholar) and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The TACC3 coding region from pGAD10.TACC3 was transferred into the vector pcDNA3FLAG and used to generate 35S-labeled FLAG-TACC3 using in vitro transcription and translation (Promega). 5 μl of 35S-labeled FLAG-TACC3 was mixed with 5 μl of agarose beads-protein complex equivalent to 5 μg of fusion protein in 300 μl of pull-down buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μm ZnSO4, 0.1 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with pull-down buffer, resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized using a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The FLAG expression construct FLAG-TACC3 was kindly provided by Drs F. Gergely and J. Raff. Human embryonal kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with 0.75 μg of each expression construct using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were prepared in whole cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and separated by SDS-PAGE (Novex). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), filters were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 then probed with rabbit antisera against FOG-1 followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmids and Construction of Mutants—Murine FOG and murine TACC3 were used in all cases. The numbering system used to describe FOG follows that of Tsang et al. (8Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), and TACC3 follows that of the National Institutes of Health Mammalian Gene Collection Program (accession number AAH03252). Regions encoding the amino acid segments described in the text were used in the yeast vectors pGBT9 and pGAD10 (Clontech) and the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). Mutants were constructed using overlap PCR, or standard primer-directed mutagenesis in instances where the mutation was near the end of the fragment and single primers were sufficient to achieve mutagenesis. Overexpression and Purification of FOG-ZF3, FOG-ZF3KRA, and TACC3 Constructs—Both TACC3 and FOG constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins using standard procedures (22Simpson R.J. Cram E.D. Czolij R. Matthews J.M. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28011-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and purified using glutathione affinity chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. FOG-ZF3KRA was produced by single-primer mismatch PCR. The purifications yielded ∼1-5 mg of >95% pure peptide per liter of culture. The identity of the peptides was confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry. Overexpression of 15N-labeled peptides was performed using a bacterial fermenter as previously described (23Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—The sample of TACC3-77 was prepared by dissolving lyophilized reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-purified peptide in 1 mm TCEP to a final concentration of 7.4 μm. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 using 0.1 m NaOH. CD spectra were recorded at 9 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. CD data were collected over the wavelength range 184-260 nm with a resolution of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 1 s using a 1-mm path length cell. Final spectra were the sum of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm/min and were baseline-corrected. Chemical Cross-linking—TC77 and a control protein, HOP (24Chen F. Kook H. Milewski R. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Li J. Nazarian R. Schnepp R. Jen K. Biben C. Runke G. Mackay J.P. Novotny J. Schwartz R.J. Harvey R.P. Mullins M.C. Epstein J.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), were dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm TCEP and 1 mm ZnSO4 to concentrations of ∼120 μm. The pH was checked and, when necessary, adjusted with 0.1 m NaOH. The cross-linking reactions were started with the addition of 0.03% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, and after a set time, stopped with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Equal volumes of each sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—TACC3-77 and FOG-ZF3 were dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm TCEP and 2 mm ZnSO4, and the sample pH was adjusted to 5.5 (using 0.1 m NaOH). The samples were then dialyzed extensively against the same reservoir of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm TCEP and 2 mm ZnSO4. FOG-ZF3 (320 μm) was titrated into TACC3-77 (35 μm) in duplicate experiments. Titrations were carried out on a Microcal VPITC microcalorimeter at 25 °C. For each titration, 15-20 injections were made at 5-min intervals, with each injection consisting of 15 μl of titrant. The reference power was set at 10 μcal s-1, and the cell was stirred continuously at 310 rpm. Data were analyzed using the Origin ITC Analysis software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). A linear fit of the isotherm of the protein injected into buffer alone was subtracted from the experimental isotherms to account for the heats of dilution and mixing. A non-linear least squares fit to a single binding site model was used to obtain values for the binding constant, stoichiometry, and heat of binding. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out on TACC3-103 (dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH ∼ 7) at 4 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with an AnTi-60 rotor. Absorbance (230 and 360 nm) versus radius scans (0.001-cm increments) were collected at 3-h intervals until the samples had reached equilibrium. Data were recorded at three different speeds (16,000, 20,000, and 24,000 rpm) and loading concentrations (9, 18, and 37 μm). Analysis of the data was carried out using the NONLIN software (25Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The density of the solvent and the partial specific volume of the peptide were estimated using Sednterp (26Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. SEDNTERP. University of New Hampshire, 1995Google Scholar). Final parameters were determined by a nonlinear least squares fit to several models, and examination of residuals and χ2 values was used to determine the goodness of fit. NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized FOG peptides were dissolved in a solution containing TCEP and ZnSO4 (1 mm each) to final concentrations of ∼150-300 μm. The pH was adjusted to ∼5.5 using 0.1 m NaOH, and D2O (5% v/v) and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (20 μm) were added. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 2 °C on a Bruker DRX600 NMR spectrometer. For determination of the structure of FOG-ZF3KRA, homonuclear two-dimensional data were collected and analyzed as described (23Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M.

NMR. 1999; 13: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The NOESY spectrum was recorded with a mixing time of 200 ms. 3JHN, Hα coupling constants were obtained from an HNHA as described previously (23Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All NMR data were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker, Karlsruhe) and analyzed with the program XEASY (28Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). An 15N-HSQC titration was carried out by adding aliquots of unlabeled TACC3-77 (330 μm stock) to a solution of 15N-labeled FOGZF3KRA (initial concentration = 110 μm) in the same buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm TCEP and 1 mm ZnSO4) and recording 15N-HSQC spectra after each addition. At some points during the titration, the mixture was concentrated using a centrifugal concentrator with a 1-kDa cut-off membrane. Structure Determination—NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained from the two-dimensional 1H-NOESY spectra and calibrated using the CALIBA module of DYANA (29Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). 3JHN, Hα coupling constants were included in the calculations. Structure calculations were performed initially in DYANA and later in CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar) using the standard ARIA protocol (31Nilges M. J.

Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was incorporated in the ARIA calculations, and calculations were carried out as described previously (34Kwan A.H. Gell D.A. Verger A. Crossley M. Matthews J.M. Mackay J.P. Structure. 2003; 11: 803-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ARIA found consistent assignments for all NOEs, and the 20 conformers with the lowest value of Etot were visualized and analyzed using the programs MOLMOL (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6503) Google Scholar), PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1srk). Molecular Modeling and HADDOCK Docking—A homology model of the C-terminal coiled-coiled domain of TACC3 was constructed in Swiss PDB Viewer and SwissMODEL (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9690) Google Scholar) (www.expasy.org/spdbv/), using the x-ray crystal structure of the coiled-coil from cortexillin (PDB accession code 1d7n (39Burkhard P. Kammerer R.A. Steinmetz M.O. Bourenkov G.P. Aebi U. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) as a template. The HADDOCK protocol (40Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar) was used to dock FOG-ZF3KRA and a single chain of the homology model of TACC3. HADDOCK is a series of scripts that run “on top of” ARIA (31Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 32Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). Residues implicated in mediating the interaction from either NMR or mutagenesis experiments described herein (nine from FOG-ZF3 and six from TACC3) were used as “active residues” to generate ambiguous interaction restraints. Six and five residues from TACC3 and FOG-ZF3, respectively, were defined as “passive” using the criteria described Dominguez et al. (40Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). 200 structures were calculated, and the 10 with the lowest energy were refined in water using the standard ARIA protocol as implemented in HADDOCK. FOG-1 Interacts with the Centrosomal Protein TACC3—Three of the classic cZFs of FOG (cZF2, 3, and 4) are clustered in a domain in the N terminus of the protein. Interestingly, although this region superficially resembles the arrays of DNA-binding cZFs in proteins such as TFIIIA, no DNA-binding function has been observed for this region of FOG (13Kwan A.H. Czolij R. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We chose a region encoding amino acids 241-407 of FOG, encompassing both this cluster and the variant cZF1 (which is known to bind GATA-1), as a bait for use in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1A). We screened a murine erythroleukemia cell cDNA library and recovered six clones that interacted specifically with the bait but neither with negative control (Gal4-DNA binding domain alone) or several irrelevant bait proteins (data not shown). Sequencing revealed that three of the positive clones encoded the known FOG partner protein GATA-1, whereas the three remaining clones encoded a C-terminal portion of TACC3-(349-637). The interaction was further verified using a GST-pull-down assay, where GST-FOG-(241-407) retained in vitro transcribed and translated TACC3-(349-637), but GST alone did not (Fig. 1B). A specific interaction between FOG-1 and TACC3 was confirmed in mammalian cells (Fig. 1C). Expression vectors encoding FOG-1 or TACC-3 carrying a FLAG tag at its N terminus were transfected into embryonal kidney epithelial cells, and TACC-3 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody. FOG-1 was detected in these immunoprecipitates but not in those using an isotype-matched control antibody. Delineating the TACC3 Contact Surface of FOG—We next used the yeast two-hybrid system to test a series of deletions of FOG and investigate whether any particular cZF was required for the interaction. The results indicated that a minimal region containing only ZF3 (328-360) was both necessary and sufficient for the interaction (Fig. 1A). To assess whether adjacent regions of FOG (e.g. ZFs 2 and 4) contribute to TACC3 binding, semi-quantitative yeast two-hybrid assays were performed with constructs containing either ZF1-4 or ZF3 alone. Resistance of the yeast to increasing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole concentrations is a measure of the cellular levels of His3p (the HIS3 gene product) and therefore a reflection of the strength of the bait:prey interaction. A 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole titration showed that ZF1-4 and ZF3 bound TACC3 with similar affinities (data not shown), indicating that adjacent domains do not contribute markedly to the FOG·TACC3 interaction. We then carried out an alanine scan across ZF3, changing each residue to Ala, except for residues such as Ala346 (which was changed to Asp) and the highly conserved Cys, His, and hydrophobic core residues required for structural integrity. The results are shown in Fig. 1D. In summary, several residues in FOG-ZF3, including Thr343, Thr344, Asn347, Arg350, and Val354, were implicated in binding to TACC3. To establish how these residues relate to each other in the fold of FOG-ZF3, we sought to use standard NMR methods to determine the solution conformation of the domain. However, although the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of FOG-ZF3 indicated that it took up a well defined structure (Fig. 2A), it was not sufficiently soluble to allow multidimensional experiments to be recorded. Consideration of the charge properties of the domain, together with the knowledge of the putative contact surface indicated by the alanine scan and knowledge of the main structural residues required for cZF folding, led us to construct a triple point mutant (FOG-ZF3KRA; Fig. 1E) that we expected would be more soluble but would preserve the cZF fold and the TACC3 contact surface. The introduction of two additional basic residues (E330K and L336R) and the removal of one glutamic acid (E349A) shifted the theoretical pI from 8.1 to 10.3. A one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of FOG-ZF3KRA (Fig. 2A) indicated that the mutant was folded and likely to have the same fold as the wild-type domain; additionally, the mutant proved to be substantially more soluble than the wild-type domain. We therefore went on to solve the three-dimensional structure of FOG-ZF3KRA (Fig. 2B). As expected, the domain forms a classic zinc finger fold, comprising an N-terminal β-hairpin, a type-VII β-turn, and a 10-residue C-terminal α-helix, and it overlays with the first cZF from Zif268 with a root mean square deviation of 2.9 Å (backbone Cα, N, and C atoms over the well ordered regions). A titration of TACC3-77 into 15N-FOG-ZF3KRA was then carried out and monitored by recording 15N-HSQCs (Fig. 2C). Signals corresponding to several residues disappeared very early in the titration (Thr343, Ala346, Arg350, His351, Val354, Thr356, and Asp357), and several more reduced in intensity and/or underwent small shifts (∼10 Hz for the HN proton) as the titration proceeded. Thus, the kinetics of the interaction are such that the interaction is in intermediate to fast exchange on the chemical shift timescale.

https://openalex.org/W1987016766,"Membrane-bound BACE1 naturally cleaves its transmembrane substrate amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the two adjacent β- and β′-sites. Cleavage at these two sites generates the heterogeneous N-terminal end of APP C-terminal fragments that are further processed by γ-secretase to release Aβ-(1-40/42) or Aβ-(11-40/42). The significance underlying Aβ-(11-40/42) in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis has remained to be experimentally elucidated, but increased production of Aβ-(1-40/42) has been broadly demonstrated to contribute to amyloid depositions in senile plaques. In this study, we show that the cleavage of APP at the β-site by BACE1 is readily disrupted through limited structural twists, whereas the β′-site is relatively better positioned to gain access to the BACE1 catalytic cavity. Radical insertion or deletion of residues between β- and β′-site also favors cleavage of APP at the β′-site. On the other hand, either lengthening or shortening the loop region of BACE1 has a minor impact on the selective cleavage of APP at these two adjacent sites, but significantly shortening the loop region impairs the ability of BACE1 to process APP at both sites. Thus, processing of APP by BACE1 is clearly dependent on a mutual structural compatibility in addition to the sequence feature. The knowledge gained from this study will potentially offer an opportunity for rational design of small molecule drugs to block the cleavage of APP specifically at the β-site while not disturbing the functions of other cellular aspartyl proteases.

When BACE1 is overexpressed in cells, an alternative processing of APP at the β′-site (between Tyr10-Glu11 within the Aβ region) becomes apparent (5Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Kahn S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Loeloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosinski M.A. Biere A.L. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J.C. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). Cleavage of APP at the β′-site seems more robust in rodent species than in humans because more Aβ-(11-40/42) in rodents has been reported previously (19Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 20Buxbaum J.D. Thinakaran G. Koliatsos V. O'Callahan J. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J.

Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), suggesting that processing of APP at the β′-site occurs naturally. Recent studies have demonstrated that processing of APP at the β′-site by BACE1 is independent of the initial cleavage of APP at the β-site (23Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fact, the preferential cleavage at either site largely relies on the sequence feature (24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the case of wild type human APP (APPWT), in vitro assays with synthetic peptide substrates indicate that the β-site is slightly superior to the β′-site (24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). More Aβ-(1-40/42) is therefore detected by mass spectroscopy than Aβ-(11-40/42) in cells expressing APPWT, and this phenomenon is more evident in cells expressing Swedish mutant APP (APPSW) for its far better cleavable sequence at the β-site than β′-site. When the protein levels of BACE1 are greatly increased, processing of APP at the β′-site is enhanced, probably due to the sequential processing of both APP and CTF99 substrates by an increased amount of BACE1 (22Huse J.T.

Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar).With the knowledge that BACE1 is capable of cleaving APP at two adjacent cleavable sites, we then ask whether the structural flexibility between the APP β- and β′-site would contribute to the selective cleavage of a site without an optimal sequence feature. The knowledge gained from this study may potentially be applicable to the discovery of small molecules that potentially block processing at the β-site. In this report, we found that the distal space of the cleavage sites from the membrane is one important factor for cleavage at the β-site by BACE1. However, the structural compatibility between BACE1 and its APP substrate is more important. Cleavage at the β-site by BACE1 is easily disrupted upon twisting the secondary structure near the β-site. These results have revealed important spatial requirements for BACE1 to process APP at the β-site. Hence, spatial interactions between BACE1 and APP should be an alternative consideration for disrupting production of amyloidogenic peptides.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines—Human HEK-293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 controlled atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and glutamine. HEK-293 cells were used to generate a stable cell line (HM) expressing BACE1 under the selection of hygromycin B (100 μg/ml).Transfection—Transfection was performed using the Lipofect-AMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). A total of 20 μg of DNA were transfected into cells plated in 10-cm dishes using 80 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. DNA and LipofectAMINE solutions were made in a total of 2 ml of Opti-MEMI media and added to each dish containing 8 ml of antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared according to Yan et al. (6Yan R. Bienkowski M.J. Shuck M.E. Miao H. Tory M.C. Pauley A.M. Brashier J.R. Stratman N.C. Mathews W.R. Buhl A.E. Carter D.B. Tomasselli A.G. Parodi L.A. Heinrikson R.L. Gurney M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cellular extracts were loaded onto a 4-12% Nupage gel or 16% Tricine gel (Invitrogen), and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis. The protein was then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane according to standard procedures followed by Western analysis. The primary antibody C8 recognizes the C-terminal 15 amino acids of APP; 6E10 recognizes the sequence 1-16 within the Aβ region; and 22C11 recognizes the N terminus of APP. Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal West PICO reagent (Pierce).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Palo Alto, CA) according to the standard procedure. APPWT was initially mutated to APPSW (K670N/M671L) or APPISYEV (V669I/K670S/M671Y/D672E/A673V). ISY was incorporated into the β′-site (S679I/G680S) to generate APPWT/ISY and APPISY/ISY. Two Pro substitutions (F675P/R676P) were incorporated into APPISY/ISY to generate APPISY/PP/ISY, and amino acids R676 and H677 were deleted in APPWTΔRH, APPISYΔRH, and APPISY/ΔRH/ISY. One and two Ala residues were inserted between R676 and H677 in APPISY/+A/ISY and APPISY/+2A/ISY, respectively. One and two additional Ala residues were inserted between A692 and E693 to generate APPISY/+2A/ISY/21A and APPISY/+2A/ISY/21A2 or APPISY/ISY/21A and APPISY/ISY/21A2, respectively. Four Ala residues were inserted between R676 and H677 in APPWT/+4AWT, APPISY/+4A/WT, and APPISY/+4A/ISY, and an uncleavable sequence (Y681K/E682K) was subsequently added to APPWT/+4A/KK and APPISY/+4A/KK. In subscript designations such as in APPWT/ISY, the WT refers to the wild type sequence at the β-site, and the ISY refers to the P3-P1 residues at the β′-site (see Fig. 1A). Amino acids 447-451 and 444-453 were deleted from BACE1 to generate BACE1Δ L5 and BACE1Δ L10, respectively. A repeat sequence (ESTLMTLDMEDCGYNESTLMTLGHGRLWLQRVNPHALDMEDCGYN) was inserted between N446 and E452 to generate BACE1Δ L5+L45 (see Fig. 5A). All constructs were validated by double strand DNA sequencing.Fig. 5Shifted cleavage to the β′-site in mouse APP variants. A, both APPWT and APPISY/ISY were mutated to mouse counterparts as denoted. B, HM cells were transfected with indicated constructs for 48 h, and lysates were examined by Western blot with antibody C8. Lysates from HEK-293 cells transfected with APPWT were loaded as a control lane for locating CTFα.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSAbolished Cleavage of the APP β-Site by BACE1 upon Local Conformational Change—Our previous studies with a mutant APP construct termed APPISY/ISY containing the optimal ISY-EV sequence at both β- and β′-sites have demonstrated that both β- and β′-sites are cleavable by BACE1 (24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This has also been confirmed with a pulse-chase experiment (data not shown). Two possible scenarios may account for the simultaneous cleavage of two adjacent APP sites by BACE1: 1) the APP structure overlapping the β- and β′-site is sufficiently flexible like a random coil so that BACE1-mediated hydrolysis at either site can be accommodated, and 2) the secondary structure spanning this region is relatively rigid, either in a β-turn or α-helix, but allows both the β- and β′-site to be positioned in proximity to the BACE1 catalytic cleft. Because the structure of APP has not been resolved, we intend to differentiate between these possibilities by a mutagenesis approach to distort conformation near the BACE1 cleavage sites. We first used APPISY/ISY as a template and generated additional APP variants by either insertion or deletion of residues between the β- and β′-site as outlined in Fig. 1A. We reasoned that either addition or deletion of residues between these two sites should cause a shift of the conformation in this region. As shown in Fig. 1B, the patterns of BACE1-cleaved C-terminal fragments were variable in cells expressing different APP constructs. Insertion of either one or two Ala residues did not noticeably affect the cleavage of APP at these two sites, whereas insertion of four Ala residues almost completely shifted the cleavage to the β′-site. Interestingly, when two residues (Arg-His) in the center of this region were deleted, the cleavage at the β′-site was also predominant (Fig. 2B). Thus, to either shorten or extend the length between β- and β′-site would favor BACE1 to cleave APP at the β′-site.Fig. 2Balancing of an optimal BACE1 β-site with a structural twist. A, both APPWT and APPISY were mutated by either insertion of Ala or deletion of Arg-His residues between the β- and β′-site. B, HM cells were transfected with the indicated constructs for 48 h, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blot with antibody C8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Pro residue is known to typically break a α-helical or β-sheeted structure. Theoretically, the substitution (F4P/R5P) in the Aβ region would cause conformational changes in this region. To test further which cleavable subsite will be more sensitive to a structural bending, we generated such a construct named APPISY/PP/ISY (Fig. 1A). Transfection of this construct in HM cells showed that CTFβ′ was again a preferred product that migrated at the expected size on a gel (Fig. 1B). To our surprise, we also observed a fragment that migrated obviously slower than the expected CTFβ (denoted with an arrowhead in Fig. 1, B and C). We referred to this fragment as CTFx because it has an undefined N-terminal end. Sequence inspection of a BACE1 cleavable site suggests that an upstream EIS-EV is a potential processing site for generating this CTFx (24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 25Turner III, R.T. Koelsch G. Hong L. Castenheira P. Ghosh A. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This suggested that a BACE1 inaccessible cleavage site in a normal circumstance could very well be aligned into the BACE1 active cleft upon a structural twist.To further understand these cleavages in subcellular compartments, we treated cells with either brefeldin A (BFA) or monensin. BFA arrests secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by blocking the exit of secretory vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas monensin locks transport of secretory vesicles in the Golgi. As demonstrated previously (23Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), processing of APP at the β-site is presumably favored in cells treated with BFA, whereas monensin treatments favor production of CTFβ′. We found that the patterns of aforementioned APP mutants processed by BACE1 in monensin-treated cells were generally similar to the patterns in the untreated transfected cells (data not shown). However, BFA treatment indeed accumulated more CTFβ than the untreated condition (comparing Fig. 1, B with C) consistent with that seen previously (23Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 84: 1006-1017Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although production of CTFβ was detectable in BFA-treated cells expressing APPISY/PP/ISY, the anomalous fragment CTFx was still more robustly generated. Clearly, the cleavage of the β-site in APPISY/PP/ISY was suppressed whereas a totally new product was produced with a local conformational shift. Thus, conformational changes in the Aβ N-terminal region mainly disrupt the cleavage of APP at the β-site.Given the fact that the template used for the above study contains ISYEV at both β- and β′-sites, it is unclear whether similar insertions or deletions in either APPWT or APPISY would replicate the same selective cleavage. To resolve this, we generated more mutant APP as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Because the β-site in APPISY is much more superior to the wild type β′-site, we routinely observed CTFβ as a predominant cleavage product in APPISY-expressing cells (see lane APPISY in Fig. 2B). Remarkably, a significant shift of the processing to the β′-site still occurred in both APPISY insertion and deletion variants regardless of the fact that the β-site possesses a much more optimal cleavable sequence than the β′-site in APPISY/+4A/WT (Fig. 2B). The same shift was also confirmed to occur in variants with wild type cleavage sites (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, a structurally perturbed superior β-site cannot compete against a well positioned suboptimal β′-site.Taken together, these data suggested that BACE1 cleavage at the β-site is more easily disrupted than the β′-site if there is a structural change in this region. Natural processing of APP at the β′-site is clearly caused by its favorable orientation together with the presence of the cleavable sequence.The Extended or Shortened Linker Region Does Not Disrupt Cleavage at the β-Site—Given the fact that a significant structural twist between the β- and β′-site (as caused in APPISY/PP/ISY) would suppress the cleavage at the β-site by BACE1, it was still unclear whether the similarly suppressed cleavage at the β-site in APP 4A-insertion constructs (APPISY/+4A/ISY, APPWT/+4A/WT, or APPISY/+4A/WT) was primarily caused by the structural or the distal changes of the β-site from the membrane. To differentiate between the changes, we inserted Ala residues between Ala21 and Glu22 in the APPISY/+2A/ISY template because it retains cleavage at both sites by BACE1. As a consequence, the distance of the β-site to the membrane in APPISY/+2A/ISY21A2 would mimic that in APPISY/+4A/ISY (Fig. 3A). Examinations of these new APP variants actually revealed no changes at both the β- and β′-site in HM cells transfected with APPISY/+2A/ISY21A or APPISY/+2A/ISY21A2 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, examination of another construct named APPISY/+2A/ISY21A4 that placed the β-site farther from the membrane by inserting four Ala residues at position 21 also did not indicate a noticeable shift (data not shown).Fig. 3Insertion of residues between the transmembrane domain and BACE1 cleavage sites. A, APPISY/+2A/ISY was used as a template, and additional mutants were generated by the insertion of Ala residue between Ala21 and Glu22. B and C, HM cells were transfected with the indicated constructs for 48 h followed by Western blot analysis with antibody C8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined APP mutants with shortened linker regions spanning the BACE1 cleavage sites and the residues that anchor APP in the membrane. When four residues (Phe19-Phe20-Ala21-Glu22) were deleted in APPISY/ISY, patterns of cleaved products were not changed as shown by cells expressing APPISY/ISY/ΔFFAE (Fig. 3C). Therefore, insertion or deletion of a few residues outside the β- and β′-sites does not disrupt APP processing patterns unlike the mutants shown in Figs. 1 and 2. These results suggest that the distance of the β-site from the membrane is not a determining factor for BACE1 to cleave at the β-site, whereas the proper conformation in this region is more important.The Unfavorable β-Site Is Cleavable by BACE1 if the β′-Site Is Blocked—Having seen the inhibited cleavage at the β-site by BACE1 in APPISY/+4A/WT and similar mutants, it was intriguing to see whether this inhibition is attributable to an absolute inaccessibility of the mutant APP β-site to the BACE1 cleft after a structural twist. Therefore we examined another mutated APP protein named APPWT/+4A/KK with a Y10K/E11K substitution in APPWT/+4A/WT. Prior analysis of cleavable sequences suggests that the β′-site is blocked by such a substitution (data not shown) or a similar mutation (23Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas cleavage at the wild type β-site is retained. Utilizing APPWT/+4A/KK would allow us to determine whether a structurally twisted β-site is actually accessible to the BACE1 active site. Examination of cells expressing APPWT/+4A/KK showed clear cleavage at the β-site, whereas no CTFβ′ was detectable (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the blocked β′-site was not processed by BACE1 even with monensin treatment, a condition known to favor the production of CTFβ′ (Fig. 4B). Thus, if a well positioned β′-site is not cleavable, BACE1 would continue to search for the structurally twisted β-site for processing. Again, these data support the idea that the cleavage of APP by BACE1 possesses elasticity despite the dockings of both BACE1 and APP in the membrane.Fig. 4A non-cleavable β′-site in structurally twisted APP variants. HM cells were transfected with indicated constructs for 48 h either in the absence (A) or presence (B)of 10 μm monensin.

https://openalex.org/W1995170424,"Previous work has shown that protonated taurine and aminosulfonate pH buffers, including HEPES, can directly and reversibly inhibit connexin channels that contain connexin26 (Cx26) (Bevans, C. G., and Harris, A. L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 3711–3719). The structural requirements for this inhibition were explored by studies of the effects of structural analogs of taurine on the activity of Cx26-containing reconstituted hemichannels from native tissue. Several analogs inhibited the channels, with a range of relative affinities and efficacies. Each active compound contains a protonated amine separated from an ionized sulfonate or sulfinate moiety by several methylene groups. The inhibition is eliminated if the sulfonate/sulfinate moiety or the amine is not present. Compounds that contain a protonated amine but lack a sulfonate/sulfinate moiety do not inhibit but do competitively block the effect of the active compounds. Compounds that lack the protonated amine do not significantly inhibit or antagonize inhibition. The results suggest involvement of the protonated amine in binding and of the ionized sulfur-containing moiety in effecting the inhibition. The maximal effect of the inhibitory compounds is enhanced when a carboxyl group is linked to the α-carbon. Inhibition but not binding is stereospecific, with l-isomers being inhibitory and the corresponding d-isomers being inactive but able to antagonize inhibition by the l-isomers. Whereas not all connexins are sensitive to aminosulfonates, the well defined structural requirements described here argue strongly for a highly specific regulatory interaction with some connexins. The finding that cytoplasmic aminosulfonates inhibit connexin channels whereas other cytoplasmic compounds antagonize the inhibition suggests that gap junction channels are regulated by a complex interplay of cytoplasmic ligands.

There are ∼20 isoforms of connexin protein (2Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), each of which forms channels with distinct regulatory and permeability properties (3Stauffer K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6768-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The intercellular signaling mediated by connexin channels is important; every functional deletion of a connexin isoform produces a distinct pathology (2Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The pathologies that arise from altered connexin channel function must arise from abnormal molecular movement through connexin channels, whether in modulation, magnitude, or molecular specificity. Despite the importance of gap junction channels in development, physiology, and disease, little is known about the regulation of connexin channels by cytoplasmic ligands. Identification of endogenous ligands and their modes of action on connexin channels would be of considerable value for understanding intercellular signaling and connexin channel structure function. Connexin channels are homo- or hetero-oligomers of isoforms of connexin protein (4Jiang J.X. Goodenough D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The basic unit is a hexamer, called a “hemichannel” or “connexon.” The hemichannel is the single-membrane form, found in the plasma membrane of many cells and implicated in a variety of cellular processes (9Ebihara L. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 100-103PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gap junction channels are end-to-end dimers of hemichannels. The intercellular location of gap junction channels presents challenges for detailed biophysical investigation; hemichannels are more amenable for study. By and large, the properties of junctional channels are predictable from those of the component hemichannels (3Stauffer K.A. J. Biol.

Whereas many compounds affect junctional channels when applied to cells, in most cases, it is unclear or unlikely that the compounds affect the channels directly. Our previous work showed that the protonated forms of the Good's pH buffers HEPES, MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; Cx, connexin; PS, phosphatidylserine; rho-PE, rhodamine B-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine; l-CSA, l-cysteine sulfinic acid; TSF, transport-specific fractionation; l-CA, l-cysteic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; APSA, 3-amino-1-propane sulfonic acid; l-DPA, l-2,3-diaminopropionic acid; IA, isethionic acid; HPSA, 3-hydroxypropane sulfonic acid; APA, 2-aminoethyl phosphonic acid; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel; GlyR, glycine receptor; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; CT, C-terminal; NT, N-terminal; CL, cytoplasmic loop; ACES, N-[2-acetamido]-2-aminocethanesulfonic acid. and TAPS can directly and reversibly inhibit channels that contain Cx26 (1Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Aside from the effect of pH on the degree of protonation of these compounds, pH changes over the range 6–10 were without effect. This inhibition did not occur for channels composed solely of connexin32 (Cx32). Since the active compounds were all aminosulfonates, the ubiquitous biological aminosulfonate taurine was tested and found to have similar effect at cytoplasmic concentrations. The present study was undertaken with two goals: to determine the structural basis of the inhibition and to determine whether cytoplasmic aminosulfonates other than taurine affect connexin channels. To these ends, a series of structural analogs of taurine were tested for inhibitory effect, and their relative effectiveness was determined, using connexin channels purified from native tissue. Analogs found to be inactive were assessed for antagonism of the inhibition produced by taurine. A set of structural rules for the inhibition and its antagonism were defined. We find that to inhibit the channels, a compound must contain a protonated amine separated from an ionized sulfonate or sulfinate moiety by two or three methylene groups. The data indicate that the protonated amine is required for binding, and the ionized sulfur-containing moiety is required for efficacy. The inhibition is stereospecific, but binding is not. Because the inhibitory compounds include taurine and cysteic acid, and the competitive antagonists include β-alanine, GABA, glycine, and glutamic acid, it is possible that the site of interaction is similar to the binding sites of these compounds on other channels and receptors. Furthermore, the finding that inhibitors and their antagonists co-exist in cells suggests that cellular control of junctional channels involves a complex interplay among the various metabolic pathways that generate these compounds and the membrane transporters that regulate their cytoplasmic concentrations.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Liposomes were formed by gel filtration of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, PS, and rho-PE at a molar ratio of 2:1:0.03 in urea buffer (see below) containing 80 mmN-octyl-d-glucopyranoside and immunoaffinity-purified connexin. The size of the liposomes was monodisperse with mean diameter of ∼900 Å (25Ollivon M. Walter A. Blumenthal R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein/lipid ratio of the liposomes was typically 1:60 (w/w), corresponding to an amount of connexin equivalent to <1 hemichannel/liposome (see “Data Analysis”). The protein/lipid ratios used yielded functional channels in 20–50% (mean 37%) of the liposomes, corresponding to a mean of ∼0.5 functional hemichannels/liposome. What It Is and How It Works—Channel activity was assessed by TSF of the liposomes. TSF has been previously described and characterized (20Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Harris A.L. Walter A. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. Zimmerberg J. Mol.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 357-377Google Scholar). It separates liposomes into distinct populations within a density gradient based on their permeability to urea and sucrose, which permeate open connexin channels. The density gradient is formed from iso-osmolar solutions in which the major component is either urea (459 mm) or sucrose (400 mm). The sucrose solution has a greater density than the urea solution, and the gradient is constructed so that the density of lipid is near the bottom. The other components of the solutions are as follows: 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 3 mm NaN3. Osmolality of urea and sucrose buffers is 500 mosm/kg, and their specific gravities (D204) are 1.0056 and 1.0511, respectively. Unilamellar liposomes are formed in and entrap the (less dense) urea-containing solution and were centrifuged through the TSF gradient at 300,000 × g for 3 h in a swinging bucket rotor at 37 °C. With centrifugation, liposomes without functional channels move into the gradient a short distance, being buoyed by the (lighter) entrapped urea buffer and form a band in the upper part of the gradient. Liposomes with functional channels continuously exchange urea and sucrose through the open connexin pores, equilibrating the aqueous density inside and outside the liposome. As this occurs, the phospholipid membrane becomes the determinant of liposome density, and the liposomes move to a position in the lower part of the gradient. The positions of liposomes are monitored via rho-PE fluorescence (λex 570 nm, λem 590 nm), making it possible to visualize and to recover the liposome bands by aspiration. The distribution of the liposomes between the two bands in the gradient is calculated from the specific intensity of rhodamine fluorescence and the volume of each collected band. A change in the distribution of liposomes between the upper and lower bands, relative to control, reflects a change in the fraction of channels that are permeable to the gradient solutes. A reduction of this fraction can be due to pore block or to a reduction to near zero of channel open probability (Po). Since solution exchange is rapid for these 900-Å liposomes, even a channel that opens only infrequently for brief times will mediate sufficient exchange of solutes to cause liposome movement to the characteristic lower position. TSF is therefore essentially an all-or-none assay for channel function per liposome. A modulatory compound could reduce the proportion of liposomes that shift to the lower position by restricting the diameter of the pores, rather than moving Po close to zero. However, in this case, the restriction would have to render the channels impermeable to urea and to sucrose. Such a change in diameter would effectively eliminate the ability of connexin channels to mediate molecular signaling between cells and therefore is regarded functionally as eliminating channel activity, with regard to molecular signaling. TSF therefore identifies conditions/reagents that dramatically reduce channel function. Absence of an effect of a reagent in this system does not imply absence of effect on the channels. But positive findings, such as those reported in this study, reflect truly significant alterations of channel function. Understanding TSF Dose-response Relations—TSF fractionates liposomes according to whether the channels they contain have Po less than a very low value. Consequently, the concentration of a compound that produces channel closure detectable in TSF is much greater than that needed to see an effect in biochemical studies, corresponding to the concentration needed to induce Po very close to 0. Therefore, TSF does not give classical Michaelis-Menten binding parameters such as Km, and does not allow determination of actual affinities. By the same token, the concentration of a modulator that produces an effect in TSF is a far upper limit for the real half-maximal value. For simple inhibition of a homogeneous channel population, TSF yields a step change in the activity-concentration relation, with the step occurring where Po is very close to 0. The step in the activity-concentration relation occurs at the concentration at which all channels in the population are effectively closed by the inhibitor. A graded TSF activity-concentration relation occurs when there is heterogeneity of ligand-channel interactions. In the present work, this arises from the known structural heterogeneity of Cx26/Cx32 heteromeric channels purified from native tissue heterogeneity with regard to connexin isoform stoichiometry and arrangement (1Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Brink P.R. Valiunas V. Christ G.J. Peracchia C. Gap Junctions: Molecular Basis of Cell Communication in Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2000: 43-60Google Scholar). Multiple modes of interaction that have different effective “affinities” produce a graded slope of effect, which is really a mixture of step changes, each reflecting a different effective affinity. This mechanism is responsible for the graded effects of protonated aminosulfonates on heterogeneous mixtures of Cx26/Cx32 channels. Graded effects can also occur if ligand interactions are themselves heterogeneous (i.e. each channel has multiple binding sites with different affinities) or if the TSF measurement is not at steady state (i.e. the on rate of binding is comparable with the time of the TSF centrifugation). In the present studies, there was no effect of lengthened TSF centrifugation on the fractionation of the liposomes (not shown), so the separations were considered to be at steady state. Correction for More than One Channel per Liposome—Previous work with the TSF system suggested that connexin channels distribute among the liposomes in a manner described by Poisson's distribution (20Rhee S.K. Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This means that for a given ratio of functional channels to lipid (λ) in the liposomes, a Poisson distribution accounts for the fraction of the liposomes that have functional channels. λ was estimated from the maximum activity (percentage of liposomes with active channels) for a given preparation of liposomes. Using the Poisson distribution, this λ was used to calculate the distribution of channels in the liposome population, which was used to compensate for the error introduced by some of the liposomes containing more than one channel (1Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This calculation transforms the fraction of liposomes in the lower TSF band to the fraction of channels that are not inhibited. Normalization of TSF Data—For each preparation of connexin, the percentage of liposomes in the lower TSF band was normalized to the maximum value obtained for that preparation. This enabled comparison of modulatory effects across reconstitutions that produced different amounts of channel activity (fractions of liposomes with functional channels). Where several preparations were used, normalized data sets were combined for each condition for calculation of means and S.E. values. Curve Fitting—The activity-concentration data were fit with a four-parameter logistic function of the form f(x) = a/(1 + exp(b*(x – c))) + d using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. A Hill equation was not used, since TSF does not produce a binding/effect curve but in this case gives a superimposition of behaviors of an unknown number of channel forms with different properties (see above). A smooth function was fit to the data solely to determine the characteristic half-maximal channel activity parameter. This parameter is not a Km but does represent the relative effectiveness of a compound as a function of concentration; changes in it reflect differences in the concentration needed to fully inhibit one-half of the (heterogeneous) channel population and is used as an indicator of relative affinity (IC50-TSF). Heteromeric Cx26/Cx32 channels were obtained from mouse liver as previously described and characterized (6Brink P.R. Valiunas V. Christ G.J. Peracchia C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This heteromeric channel population is functionally heterogeneous with regard to permeability to large molecules (6Brink P.R. Valiunas V. Christ G.J. Peracchia C. Gap Junctions: Molecular Basis of Cell Communication in Health and Disease. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2000: 43-60Google Scholar) and sensitivity to modulatory ligand (1Bevans C.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that it is composed of channels that are heterogeneous in the stoichiometry and/or arrangement of Cx26 and Cx32 isoforms. It does not contain homomeric Cx26 or Cx32 channels (6Brink P.R. Valiunas V. Christ G.J. Peracchia C. Gap Junctions: Molecular Basis of Cell Communication in Health and Disease.

The data shown are averages from at least five purifications to control for differences in range or distribution of stoichiometries and isoform arrangements in the channel population from preparation to preparation. Hemichannels were reconstituted into unilamellar phospholipid liposomes. The activities of the reconstituted channels were explored by TSF, which has been well characterized and used effectively in studies of connexin channel permeability and modulation (1Bevans C.G.

The technique is described under “Experimental Procedures.” In brief, when centrifuged in an appropriate isoosmolar density gradient, solute exchange through open channels causes liposomes to become more dense and move to a position deep in the gradient. Liposomes without open channels remain in the upper part of the gradient. Any significant Po results in sufficient osmolyte exchange to cause the change in density. TSF is therefore an essentially all-or-none assay of per liposome channel activity. TSF is of particular utility in study of connexin channels due to the constraints of studying connexin channels in situ and their apparent refractoriness to functional reconstitution in planar bilayers (3Stauffer K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6768-6772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It also directly assesses their molecular permeability, the key functional property of connexin channels (except in neurons). The effects of test compounds on channel activity were assessed by exposing connexin-containing liposomes to the compounds during a TSF centrifugation. The change in distribution of liposomes between the upper and lower positions, relative to a control gradient without the compound, is a quantitative measure of the aggregate fractional change in activity of the population of the channels. Fig. 1 illustrates the inhibition of Cx26-containing channels by protonated taurine, as established in previous work (1Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the change in channel activity of Cx26-containing channels in 10 mm taurine over a wide range of pH and insensitivity of homomeric Cx32 channels under the same conditions. The decline in activity with decreased pH could be accounted for either by deprotonated taurine acting as a channel agonist or protonated taurine acting as a channel antagonist. To distinguish these possibilities, channel activity was assessed at the taurine pKa of 8.8 in 50 mm taurine. At the higher concentration, channel activity was reduced to that at 10 mm taurine at low pH (i.e. when it is fully protonated) (Fig. 1A, asterisk). This suggests that the protonated form of taurine is the channel inhibitor, since in this experiment, the concentrations of both the protonated and deprotonated species were increased equally. This point is made more rigorously by an experiment in which the concentration of protonated taurine was controlled by changing the concentration of total taurine while keeping pH constant at 6.5. Normalized inhibition of connexin channel activity is plotted as a function of protonated taurine concentration at constant pH in Fig. 1B. If the channel activity was being controlled by pH, there would be no change in activity. Furthermore, these data superimpose with those from Fig. 1A (in which total taurine was constant and pH changed). Therefore, the channel activity is a simple function of protonated taurine conce"

https://openalex.org/W2064507764,"A Ser to Asn mutation at position 54 of the α subunit of Gs (designated N54-αs) was characterized after transient expression of it with various components of the receptor-adenylyl cyclase pathway in COS-1, COS-7, and HEK 293 cells. Previous studies of the N54-αs mutant revealed that it has a conditional dominant negative phenotype that prevents hormone-stimulated increases in cAMP without interfering with the regulation of basal cAMP levels (Cleator, J. H., Mehta, N. D., Kurtz, D. K., Hildebrandt, J. D. (1999) FEBS Lett. 243, 205–208). Experiments reported here were conducted to localize the mechanism of the dominant negative effect of the mutant. Competition studies conducted with activated αs* (Q212L) showed that the N54 mutant did not work down-stream by blocking the interaction of endogenous αs with adenylyl cyclase. The co-expression of wild type or N54-αs along with the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor and adenylyl cyclase isotypes differing with respect to βγ stimulation (AC II or AC III) revealed that the phenotype of the mutant is not dependent upon the presence of adenylyl cyclase isoforms regulated by βγ. These studies ruled out a downstream site of action of the mutant. To investigate an upstream site of action, N54-αs was co-expressed with either the TSH receptor that activates both αs and αq or with the α1B-adrenergic receptor that activates only αq. N54-αs failed to inhibit α1B-adrenergic receptor stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production but did inhibit TSH stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These results show that Gs and Gq compete for activation by the TSH receptor. They also indicate that the N54 protein has a dominant negative phenotype by blocking upstream receptor interactions with normal G proteins. This phenotype is different from that seen in analogous mutants of other G protein α subunits and suggests that either regulation or protein-protein interactions differ among G protein α subunits.

This phenotype is different from that seen in analogous mutants of other G protein α subunits and suggests that either regulation or protein-protein interactions differ among G protein α subunits. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins or G proteins transmit signals from receptors on the surface of the cell to various intracellular effector enzymes. G proteins have traditionally been defined by their α subunits, which consist of four families: αs; αi/o; αq/11; and α15/16. One of the best-characterized α subunits, αs, stimulates adenylyl cyclase in response to receptor-mediated hormone stimulation (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 3Spiegel A.M. Med.

Inactive Gs consists of a GDP-bound α subunit and a βγ dimer. Upon receptor activation, the αs·GTP complex dissociates from the receptor and its βγ dimer and then stimulates adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP levels in the cell. Certain isotypes of adenylyl cyclase (e.g. AC II and AC IV) are also stimulated by βγ in the presence of activated αs (5Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 6Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other isotypes of adenylyl cyclase are inhibited by βγ (e.g. AC I). Deactivation occurs when the α subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP, allowing it to reassociate with βγ. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; PI, phosphatidylinositol; TSH-R, TSH receptor; αs*, activated αs Q212L mutant; VIP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; VIP-R, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GMP-P(NH)P, guanyl-5′-yl imido-diphosphate; AC I and AC II, adenylyl cyclases I and II; AR, adrenergic receptor; IP, inositol phosphate. activate G proteins by catalyzing GTP exchange on the α subunit. Although some GPCRs activate only one G protein isotype (e.g. β-adrenergic receptor activation of αs), others are described as promiscuous and can activate multiple G protein isotypes (e.g. the receptor for TSH). The TSH receptor has been shown to couple to adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (7Van Sande J. Raspe E. Perret J. Lejeune C. Maenhaut C. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1992; 267: 24153-24156Google Scholar), in part because the receptor can couple to both Gs and Gq/11 (10Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Van Sande J. Spicher K. Schultz G. Dumont J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 269: 13733-13735Google Scholar). It has not been determined whether one population of TSH receptors exists that possesses the ability to couple both Gs and Gq/11 or whether multiple populations of receptor exist (e.g. arising from either splice variants, post-translational modifications, or compartmentalization) that could account for the ability of the TSH-R to activate both Gs and Gq/11. The superfamily of GTP-binding proteins, which include the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and the monomeric GTP-binding proteins, share four conserved amino acid sequences that form the core of the GTP regulatory mechanism of these proteins (11Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 12Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

The consensus sequence of the first conserved region of the nucleotide binding site is GX4GK(S/T), the residues of which include Ser17 in Ras and the equivalent Ser54 in Gαs. These residues are involved in binding Mg2+ ion when it is complexed with nucleotide (14Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Ras with an Asn mutation at this site (N17) has an increased preference for GDP over GTP and a dominant negative phenotype (15Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The dominant negative phenotype of N17-Ras can be explained by its ability to sequester its own guanine nucleotide exchange factor (16Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Schweighoffer F. Cai H. Chevallier-Multon M.C. Fath I. Cooper G. Tocque B.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is functionally analogous to a GPCR. An extension of the N17-Ras mutation to other members of the Ras superfamily, such as Ran (18Kornbluth S. Dasso M.J.N. J.

Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), also results in a dominant negative phenotype. Gαs with a Ser to Asn mutation at this site (N54) also has an increased preference for GDP over GTP (23Hildebrandt J.D. Day R. Farnsworth C.L. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4830-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a conditional dominant negative phenotype (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Its phenotype is conditional, because it prevents hormone-stimulated increases in cAMP, even though it itself activates adenylyl cyclase down-stream and increases basal cAMP levels (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The site analogous to Ser54 of αs in αi and αo is Ser47. Cys mutants of this site also have a dominant negative phenotype (25Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Slepak V.Z. Quick M.W. Aragay A.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21889-21894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism in this case appears to be different from that of the N17-Ras mutant. In particular, others have suggested that C47-αo and C47-αi interfere with hormone activation of G proteins by tightly binding βγ dimers (25Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Slepak V.Z. Quick M.W. Aragay A.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21889-21894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants are presumably not active themselves, because G protein subunit dissociation is required for activation (2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar). Further, their dominant negative phenotype is explained by their ability to sequester βγ dimers away from other G protein α subunits and by the fact that intact G protein heterotrimers facilitate greatly receptor interactions. Because Ras mutants and αi/o mutants of this essential Ser residue involved in complexing Mg and nucleotide seem to have different mechanisms of action, we sought to determine the analogous mechanism for the N54-αs mutant. Surprisingly, the N54-αs mutant has a mechanism of action more similar to that of Ras than its more closely related αi/o counterparts. These results suggest differences either in the mechanism of regulation of αs and αi proteins by magnesium and nucleotides or in the protein-protein interactions of these different G proteins. Materials—[3H]adenine, [3H]inositol, donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody, and ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

Transient Transfections and cAMP Determination—COS-1 and HEK 293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C were transfected with LipofectAMINE as previously described (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP was measured by use of the [3H]adenine uptake assay as described previously (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Samples were prepared by washing cells in phosphate-buffered saline followed by addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar).

Proteins were incubated with anti-αs antibody, ASC, produced according to the protocol of Spiegel and co-workers (32McKenzie F.R. Mullaney I. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. Milligan G. Biochem. Soc.

Inositol Phosphate Determination—Inositol phosphate production was measured by use of the [3H]inositol uptake assay (33De vivo M.

Cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/20 mm NaHepes (or Hanks' balanced salt solution where indicated) containing 10 mm LiCl for 10 min prior to hormone treatment. Cells were incubated for 40 min at 35 °C in the presence or absence of the hormone. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.75 ml of ice-cold 10 mm formic acid to the cells. 0.75 ml of each reaction (1 well of a 24-well dish) was diluted in 3 ml of 20 mm ammonium hydroxide (pH of final solution, 8.0–9.0) and applied to regenerated Dowex anion-exchange columns (AG1-X8 resin, Bio-Rad 140-1444) followed by the addition of 1 ml of H20. The combined sample and water wash was collected as the [3H]inositol fraction. The columns then were washed with 4 ml of 40 mm ammonium formate in 0.1 m formic acid. The [3H]inositol phosphates were collected by eluting the columns with 5 ml of 2 m ammonium formate in 0.1 m formic acid. Data are presented as the percent of total [3H]inositol recovered as [3H]inositol phosphates where total [3H]inositol equals [3H]inositol phosphates plus [3H]inositol. Previous characterization of the N54 mutant revealed that it possessed a conditional dominant negative phenotype with respect to the TSH-R and the β-adrenergic receptor (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The nature of this phenotype is shown in Fig. 1A where the rat VIP-R (30Ishihara T. Shigemoto R. Mori K. Takahashi K. Nagata S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) was co-expressed in COS-1 cells with either wild type or N54-αs. The expression of αs resulted in elevated basal cAMP levels with the mutant being slightly more effective than wild type. Co-expression with wild type αs was substantially more effective at increasing VIP-stimulated cAMP levels than co-expression with the N54-αs mutant. When basal cAMP levels were subtracted from those in the presence of VIP (Fig. 1A, right graph), N54-αs was seen to actually decrease VIP-stimulated cAMP levels. These results were similar to what is seen with the TSH receptor and the β-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, whereas the expression of wild type αs increased hormone-stimulated levels, N54-αs decreased both TSH and VIP-stimulated cAMP levels by ∼50%. Based on dose-response curves for the expression of wild type and mutant αs (data not shown and Ref, 24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this appears to be a maximal effect of the mutant. The mutant also decreased stimulation of cAMP levels through the endogenous β-adrenergic receptor but to a lesser degree than for the transfected receptors. The lower inhibition seen in this case probably reflects the relative transfection efficiency, and stimulation through this receptor is probably blunted by ∼50% as well. Fig. 1 and our previous results (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) indicate that N54-αs interferes with receptor stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The N17-Ras homolog of N54-αs interferes with Ras signaling by binding unproductively to its upstream regulator (16Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Schweighoffer F. Cai H. Chevallier-Multon M.C. Fath I. Cooper G. Tocque B.T. Mol. Cell.

Signaling by G proteins is more complex than for the monomeric G proteins, and hence, there are more possible sites of action for N54-αs. In fact, the mutants of the cognate site in αo and αi (S47C) appear to have a dominant negative phenotype because they bind tightly to βγ (25Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Slepak V.Z. Quick M.W. Aragay A.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether N54-αs had a mechanism analogous to its related αi/o proteins or one similar to the more distantly related Ras protein. Co-expression of Wild Type or N54-αs with Activated αs in COS-7 Cells—One possible mechanism of action of a dominant negative effect of N54-αs would be for it to bind to adenylyl cyclase, thus blocking stimulation by wild type αs. Although at first thought this mechanism might seem inconsistent with the fact that N54-αs has inherent basal activity (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), this is not necessarily true. For example, N54-αs could have a lower intrinsic efficacy for activating adenylyl cyclase than does wild type αs. Thus, its binding to adenylyl cyclase could activate the enzyme to a low level but preclude its interaction with an activated wild type αs with greater efficacy and generated by receptor activation of Gs. In fact, our previous data could be consistent with the idea that N54-αs does have less efficacy than does a persistently activated αs protein (24Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 243: 205-208Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test whether this idea is probable, we determined whether N54-αs could effectively compete with an activated αs (Q212L-designated αs*) for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. To establish conditions for this experiment, increasing amounts of αs* cDNA were transfected with a fixed amount of TSH-R cDNA into COS-1 cells and cAMP levels were measured in the absence or presence of TSH (Fig. 2A). As the amount of αs* cDNA increased, the difference between hormone-stimulated and basal cAMP levels decreased. At 450 ng of αs* transfected with the TSH-R, there was little hormone-stimulated activity, suggesting that the adenylyl cyclase in these cells was near maximally stimulated by the activated αs mutant (Fig. 2A). To examine whether the N54 mutant could inhibit activated αs* from stimulating adenylyl cyclase, αs* cDNA (450 ng) was co-transfected alone or with an equal amount of either wild type or N54-αs (Fig. 2B). As seen in Fig. 2B, a representative experiment conducted in COS-1 cells, the expression of αs* increased basal cAMP levels to a greater extent than did wild type or N54-αs. The co-expression of N54-αs with αs* failed to appreciably inhibit αs* from stimulating adenylyl cyclase under basal conditions or under hormone stimulation (Fig. 2B, compare αs* to αs* + N54-αs). A summary of experiments conducted in COS-1 cells is shown in Fig. 2C. Control immunoblots showed that mutant and wild type αs were actually expressed at ∼10 times the level of the activated αs* protein in these experiments (Fig. 2D). Thus, at least at a 10-fold excess, N54-αs does not block the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by αs*. These studies did not support the idea that N54-αs blocks the ability of wild type αs to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Interestingly, it was observed that transfection of αs* in COS-1 cells resulted in an increase in the endogenous long form of αs (Fig. 2D). Although this is a potentially interesting result, we have not yet followed it up. Because it was not clear how this induction affected the results of these experiments, we conducted the same experiment in HEK 293 cells, which do not show an increase in the expression of endogenous long form of αs upon expression of αs* (Fig. 2D). The effect of transfection of αs* alone compared with αs* plus N54-αs on basal and TSH-stimulated cAMP levels in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that N54-αs did not prevent αs* from stimulating adenylyl cyclase in these cells either (Fig. 2C). Co-expression of Wild type or N54-αs with Adenylyl Cyclase II and III in COS-1 Cells—Another possible mechanism for the dominant negative effect of N54-αs might involve its interference with downstream effects of βγ. This could result from N54-αs irreversibly binding to βγ, as has been suggested to explain the phenotype of the analogous mutation in Gαi (25Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mutant interferes with the βγ regulation of downstream effectors, experiments were conducted with co-expressed adenylyl cyclase isotypes (AC II or AC III) that differ with respect to βγ regulation. AC II can be activated directly by βγ dimers in the presence of activated αs, whereas AC III is not regulated directly by βγ (5Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 6Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AC II or AC III were co-expressed with the TSH-R and with αs (wild type or N54 mutant) in COS cells. Co-expression of AC II with the TSH-R increased TSH stimulation of cAMP accumulation 5-fold compared with transfection of the TSH-R alone (Fig. 3), whereas co-expression of AC III with the TSH-R only increased cAMP accumulation 3-fold in response to TSH. It is not clear whether these differences are due to differences in the level of expression of these two adenylyl cyclase isoforms, to differences in their inherent activities, or to differences in their regulation. Nevertheless, the differences in the inherent regulation of these two enzymes allowed us to test whether they differed also in their response to the presence of the αs mutants. When wild type αs was transfected with AC II, TSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation was decreased. This is consistent with the idea that TSH maximally stimulated AC II by a dual mechanism involving both αs and βγ and that expressed αs inhibited this maximal stimulation by binding βγ. In contrast, the expression of wild type αs with AC III increased cAMP accumulation in response to TSH, compatible with the idea that αs is rate-limiting for activation of AC III under these conditions. However, regardless of the response to wild type αs, transfection of the N54-αs mutant with either AC II or AC III decreased cAMP accumulation in response to TSH (Fig. 3, insets). This finding suggests that the effects of N54-αs on receptor regulation of cAMP are independent of the properties of the downstream adenylyl cyclase isoform producing the cAMP. This makes it unlikely that the mutant inhibits TSH stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by simply sequestering βγ and preventing the effects of βγ on downstream effectors. This idea is further supported by the fact that the mutant can inhibit TSH stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in HEK 293 cells, which reportedly lack an adenylyl cyclase that is stimulated by βγ (38Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Effect of Wild type αk or N54-αs on Signaling to Phospholipase-β through the α1B-Adrenergic Receptor in COS-7 Cells—In the case of the Ser47 mutant of αi, the analogous site to Ser54 of αs, it interferes not only with receptor regulation of αi-mediated signaling but also with signaling mediated through other G proteins, even for receptors that do not regulate Gi (25Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This is one argument that the mutant works by sequestering βγ and preventing upstream receptor heterotrimer coupling. The β-adrenergic receptor, the TSH receptor, and the VIP receptor all couple to Gs. Presumably, a dominant negative effect of αs mediated by its binding to receptor would not directly interfere with signaling through receptors that do not couple to Gs. Therefore, we tested whether N54-αs blocked α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1B-AR) signaling to phospholipase Cβ through Gq. The α1B-adrenergic receptor is not known to couple to Gs. COS-7 cells were used for these experiments, because they reportedly lack a phospholipase Cβ isoform that is stimulated by βγ (39Jiang H. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13430-13434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The α1B-AR when expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4A) had an EC50 for phenylephrine of ∼1 μm (Fig. 4B). Increasing the expression of wild type αs slightly decreased the ability of the α1B-AR to increase inositol phosphate levels (Fig. 4C). In contrast, increasing the expression of N54-αs had no effect on the ability of the α1B-AR to stimulate phospholipase C (Fig. 4C). The expression of αs* failed to alter phenylephrine stimulation of PI turnover in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that the effects of wild type αs cannot be accounted for by elevations in cAMP levels. Although these data are complicated by small effects of wild type αs protein on signaling through phospholipase (discussed below), they clearly demonstrate that N54-αs does not block α1B-AR stimulation of phospholipase C through Gq. This result supports the idea that N54-αs does not nonspecifically interfere with receptor regulation of downstream processes by sequestering βγ dimers necessary for receptor G protein coupling. Co-"

TrHbN is one of the two truncated hemoglobins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The kinetic traces were analyzed in terms of three distinct phases. These three phases are ascribed to rebinding: (i) from the distal heme pocket, (ii) from the adjacent apolar tunnel prior to conformational relaxation, and (iii) from the apolar tunnel subsequent to conformational relaxation. The fractional content of each of these phases was shown to be a function of the viscosity and, in the case of the sol-gel-encapsulated samples, sample preparation history. The observed kinetic patterns support a model consisting of the following elements: (i) the viscosity and conformation-sensitive dynamics of the Tyr(B10) side chain facilitate diffusion of the dissociated ligand from the distal heme pocket into the adjacent tunnel; (ii) the distal heme pocket architecture determines ligand access from the tunnel back to the heme iron; (iii) the distal heme pocket architecture is governed by a ligand-dependent hydrogen bonding network that limits the range of accessible side chain positions; and (iv) the apolar tunnel linking the heme site to the solvent biases the competition between water and ligand for occupancy of the vacated polar distal heme pocket greatly toward the nonpolar ligand. Implications of these finding with respect to biological function are discussed."

The mature receptor can mediate the binding and internalization of a number of specific ligands, including modified low-density lipoprotein. We have investigated the effects of inhibiting N-glycan processing on SR-A expression, distribution, and activity in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. We have found that SR-A normally interacts with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum and in its mature form carries complex N-glycans. The imino sugar, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) is an inhibitor of the N-glycan processing enzymes α-glucosidases I and II. Following NB-DNJ treatment SR-A became Endo H-sensitive, consistent with inhibition of N-glycan processing. A dose-dependent increase in cell surface expression of SR-A was observed in response to NB-DNJ treatment. The receptor on inhibitor-treated cells was still functional because the increased surface expression resulted in a proportional enhancement in the endocytosis of the ligand, acetylated low-density lipoprotein. The expression of SR-A on NB-DNJ cultured cells was further enhanced by co-treatment with interferon-γ. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis did not show a significant difference in the amount of SR-A mRNA in NB-DNJ-treated RAW264.7 cells. However, the half-life of SR-A protein was significantly increased. These data indicate the retention of glucosylated N-glycans does not result in gross misfolding and degradation of this receptor or prevent its transport to the cell surface.

Haworth R. Darley L. Gordon S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 212: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SR-A can recognize a number of ligands, including chemically modified molecules (2Krieger M. Acton S. Ashkenas J. Pearson A. Penman M. Resnick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4569-4572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 4Platt N. Gordon S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R193-R203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is the uptake of one of these ligands, modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL), that promotes the conversion of monocyte-derived macrophages (Mϕ) into foam cells that characterize atherosclerosis (5Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). Unlike endocytosis via the LDL receptor, intracellular cholesterol levels do not down-regulate SR-A-mediated uptake of modified LDL, and cholesterol ester accumulation leads to the development of foam cells (3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). This process is considered to be critical for disease progression and the important contribution of SR-A has been delineated through studies of atherogenesis in SR-A-deficient mice (6Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). There are two major isoforms of SR-A, which are derived by alternative splicing (3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 7Emi M. Asaoka H. Matsumoto A. Itakura H. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Kanamori H. Yazaki Y. Takahashi E. Lepert M. J. Biol.

Each contains six predicted structural domains: cytoplasmic, transmembrane, spacer, α-helical coiled coil, collagenous, and an isoform-specific carboxyl terminus. They differ only at the COOH terminus (3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Type II SR-A is identical to the type I receptor, except that the 110-amino acid SRCR domain of SR-AI is replaced by a 6-amino acid COOH terminus. Type II scavenger receptor mediates the endocytosis of modified LDL and binding of other ligands with essentially the same affinity and broad specificity as the type I receptor (8Freeman M. Ekkel Y.

Experimental investigations of the properties of a series of truncated and site-specific mutant receptors have identified structural domains and specific residues that are important for conferring biological activities (10Doi T. Higashino K. Kurihara Y. Wada Y. Miyazaki T. Nakamura H. Uesugi S. Imanishi T. Kawabe Y. Itakura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2126-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Andersson L. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19592-19601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, lysines within the carboxyl terminus of the collagenous domain of bovine SR-A are critical for the binding of modified lipoprotein (12Yamamoto K. Nishimura N. Doi T. Imanishi T. Kodama T. Suzuki K. Tanaka T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and a histidine residue within the α-helical coiled coil is required for pH-dependent ligand dissociation (13Doi T. Kurasawa M. Higashino K. Imanishi T. Mori T. Naito M. Takahashi K. Kawabe Y. Wada Y. Matsumoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these extensive structure-activity studies of the molecule, there have been no reports of the potential significance of secondary modifications on the biochemical and biological properties of SR-A. The predicted protein sequence of human SR-A contain seven N-linked oligosaccharide consensus sequences, three of which lie within the extracellular spacer domain and four within the α-helical coiled coil (14Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) (Table I). A comparison across human, mouse, bovine, and rabbit SR-A sequences reveals that five sites (Asn102, Asn143, Asn184, Asn249, and Asn267) are absolutely conserved (9Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the biology of SR-A, we have characterized the effects of the modulation of N-glycan processing on SR-A expression, distribution, and activity.Table IPredicted sites of N-linked oligosaccharides on mammalian SR-AAsn residueProtein domainMouseBovineHumanRabbitAsn82Spacer-+++Asn102Spacer++++Asn143Spacer++++Asn184Coiled coil++++Asn221Coiled coil-+++Asn249Coiled coil++++Asn267Coiled coil++++ Open table in a new tab N-Linked glycosylation of nascent proteins involves the transfer of a precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from dolichol to the asparagine residue of the Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr glycosylation sequon of the protein. The oligosaccharide is subsequently processed by the sequential action of trimming glycosidases in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, prior to the elaboration of hybrid and complex type oligosaccharide structures in the Golgi apparatus. Trimming is initiated by endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase I, which releases the outer α-1,2-linked glucose residue from the oligosaccharide, followed by removal of the α-1,3-linked second and third glucose residues by α-glucosidase II. Several compounds that inhibit α-glucosidases I and II have been identified, including deoxynojirimycin (15Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and its N-alkylated derivative N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) (15Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the presence of these imino sugars, immature glucosylated N-glycans are retained and therefore hybrid and complex type oligosaccharide synthesis is prevented (16Winchester B. Fleet G.W. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Glucosidase inhibitors have been successfully used as tools to probe the requirement of an interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum-resident lectin calnexin to achieve protein folding, a process that is primarily dependent upon a monoglucosylated N-glycan structure generated by the action of α-glucosidase II. For example, tyrosinase, a key enzyme in melanin biogenesis was catalytically inactive when synthesized in the presence of NB-DNJ, but was transported correctly to the melanosome (17Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Titu H.N. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Its inactivity was because of misfolding that occurred in the absence of the normal interaction with calnexin, resulting in an inability to incorporate copper into its active site (17Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Titu H.N. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It should be noted that recent evidence has revealed that in certain circumstances calnexin can display lectin-independent activities (18Swanton E. High S. Woodman P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2948-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is not possible to predict the precise effects of inhibiting N-glycan processing and must be determined on a case by case basis. We therefore examined the effects of culturing the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, which expresses significant levels of functional SR-A (19Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S. Nature. 1993; 364: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), in the presence of NB-DNJ. We found that SR-A usually carries complex N-linked carbohydrate structures, but addition of the imino sugar resulted in the predicted retention of glucosylated N-glycans that prevented association with calnexin. We observed correct trafficking of receptors to the cell surface, together with significantly enhanced levels of expression that led to increased endocytosis of acetylated (ac) LDL. We observed synergistic effects when cells were co-treated with NB-DNJ and the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The increased expression was not because of regulation of transcription but was the result of increased receptor half-life. These data suggest that the interaction with calnexin may be a pre-requisite for correct folding of this protein that affects the turnover rate of this receptor.

For radiolabeling experiments cells were placed in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium obtained from ICN (Thame, UK). Treatment of RAW 264.7 Cells with Imino Sugar and Co-treatment with IFN-γ—NB-DNJ and IFN-γ were dissolved in double distilled, endotoxin-free water, filter-sterilized (0.2 μm), and added to the cells to the required final concentration. The cells were incubated in the presence of the imino sugar for the duration of the particular experiment. In brief, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of NB-DNJ for 2 weeks, and then co-treated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. Pulse-Chase Analysis—RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of NB-DNJ (2 mm) at 37 °C for 2 weeks and subsequent co-incubation with IFN-γ for the following 48 h. Cells were harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 m (pH 7.2) (PBS), and resuspended in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and IFN-γ for 1 h. The cells were pulsed for 30 min with 300 μCi/ml Tran35S-label. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in “chase” medium consisting of 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 mm unlabeled methionine, 4 mm unlabeled cysteine, and IFN-γ. NB-DNJ (2 mm) was maintained in the pulse and chase medium of treated cultures.

Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to remove debris. Supernatants were stored at –70 °C until used. Immunoprecipitation and Endoglycosidase H Treatment—35S-Labeled or unlabeled cell lysates were precleared with GammaBind™ Plus Sepharose™ for 2 h at room temperature. Antigen was precipitated overnight at 4 °C by incubation with 10 μg/ml anti-mouse SR-A monoclonal antibody (2F8) and GammaBind™ Plus Sepharose™, washed 6 times with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0); 3 times in 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; twice with 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; once with 0.05% (w/v) SDS. The beads were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8) then boiled for 5 min in 5× Laemmli sample buffer with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The supernatant was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Samples for digestion with Endo H were eluted from the solid phase by heating at 100 °C for 5 min with 50 μl of 100 mm sodium citrate phosphate (pH 5.5), containing 0.2% SDS, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. The boiled sample was split into equal aliquots and incubated at 37 °C overnight in the presence or absence of 2 milliunits of Endo H. Digestion was terminated by the addition of SDS reducing sample buffer with heating at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed and impregnated with Amplify™ (Amersham) 15 min before drying and exposure to film at –70 °C. Glycosidase Treatment of SR-A—The material that bound to protein G-Sepharose was treated with PNGase F and Endo H as described by the manufacturer. In brief, the beads were washed and boiled for 5 min in 10 μl of 0.2% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The volumes were adjusted to final detergent concentrations of 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h in the presence of 15 units/ml PNGase F and at 37 °C overnight in the presence of 1 unit/ml Endo H or sialidase 100 milliunits/ml, respectively. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE gel separation and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon™-P transfer membrane, Millipore Corp.). Membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20 prior to the addition of the anti-mouse SR-A antibody. The membrane was washed and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS, containing 0.02 m NaN3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (FACS buffer). Cells (1 × 106) were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated 2F8, washed, and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis on the basis of differential uptake of propidium iodide. Data were collected on 104 viable cells and plotted on a four-decade log10 scale of increasing fluorescence intensity on the x axis. To quantify copy number of surface receptors per cell, fluorescein-labeled quantitative microbead standard (BD Biosciences) were included within assays. To determine total receptor expression, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min on ice), washed three times with PBS, and incubated with 0.5% saponin in PBS (10 min at room temperature) prior to incubation with antibody. Quantitation of DiI-AcLDL Uptake—Cells were incubated in 10 μg/ml DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-1–3, 3, 3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate)-labeled acLDL (DiI-acLDL) (Autogen Bioclear, Calne, UK) for 2 h at 37 °C in complete medium. Cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. Quantitative RT-PCR—All equipment and reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems (Warrington). Primer and probe sequences that recognize both SRA-1 and SRA-2 transcripts were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer express software from the murine macrophage scavenger receptor sequence (9Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer used was tggtccacctggtgctcc, the reverse primer was acctccagggaagccaattt, and the probe was ataagaggtattccaggtgttaaaggtgatcggg. Primer pairs were tested using conventional RT-PCR to confirm a single band of the expected amplicon size (not shown). cDNA was synthesized using 200 ng of total RNA (prepared using RNAeasy kit, Qiagen) in a 10-μl reaction volume using RT Gold reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction using Taqman Universal Master mixture containing 100 nm each primer and 50 nm probe. For each reaction the equivalent of 20 ng of total RNA (1 μl of cDNA) was used. Reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, in duplicate, and quantified against a relative standard curve made from a serially diluted stock RNA containing the target sequence. Cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by a 40-cycle amplification phase of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The amount of total RNA input into each RT reaction was assayed by measuring the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in each cDNA sample using the Rodent GAPDH Taqman kit. Data were calculated as relative SRA mRNA expression, normalized to GAPDH. SR-A Interaction with Calnexin—Lysates were prepared from RAW 264.7 cells cultured in the presence or absence of NB-DNJ (2 mm), then immunoprecipitated with anti-calnexin antibody, eluted, run on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using 2F8 antibody. Surface Biotinylation—RAW264.7 cells (1 × 108/ml) were cultured in the presence or absence of 2 mm NB-DNJ with IFN-γ. The cells were washed twice in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin (PBS, 10% bovine serum albumin) and once in PBS. The cells were resuspended in 4.5 ml of PBS containing 1.5 mg of sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed as before and then returned to culture medium and incubated as indicated. At the indicated times, cells were incubated with 2F8 before lysis (cell-surface protein) or lysed immediately (total protein). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2F8 as above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. Blots were developed with appropriate secondary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated extravidin by ECL. Effects of NB-DNJ on the Electrophoretic Mobility of SR-A— RAW264.7 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of different concentrations of NB-DNJ for 2 weeks prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A significant dose-dependent increase in the mobility of SR-A resulted from culturing the cells in NB-DNJ. Whereas the SR-A obtained from untreated cells migrated with a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa, receptor from the RAW264.7 cells cultured with 2 mm NB-DNJ migrated as a species with an apparent mass of 66 kDa (Fig. 1A). The maximal increase in mobility was achieved at 2 mm NB-DNJ (Fig. 1A, lane 5) and was not enhanced by higher concentrations of drug (data not shown). Glycosylation of SR-A—To define the glycosylation status of SR-A from untreated and NB-DNJ-treated cells, cell lysates were digested with Endo H or PNGase F. The de-glycosylated receptor (PNGase digested) had the predicted molecular mass of 45 kDa (9Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The receptor from untreated cells was fully Endo H resistant showing that the glycans carried by SR-A are all of the complex type (Fig. 1B). Endo H treatment of the lysate prepared from RAW264.7 treated with 2 mm NB-DNJ yielded a heterogeneous population of SR-A molecules that comprised at least 3 species (Fig. 1C). The lowest molecular mass species migrated as a 45-kDa protein, whereas the difference in molecular mass between the three species was ∼2–3 kDa (Fig. 1C), consistent with receptors having zero, one, or two N-glycosylation sites carrying oligosaccharides that could be because of incomplete digestion with Endo H or partial processing via Golgi endomannosidase (20Moore S.E. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity to sialidase digestion (Fig. 2A) indicted that SR-A normally carries complex N-glycans. The receptor from NB-DNJ-treated cells was, as predicted, predominantly resistant to sialidase digestion (Fig. 2B). Pulse-Chase Analysis—The kinetics of SR-A N-glycan processing by untreated and NB-DNJ-treated RAW264.7 cells were investigated by pulse-chase analysis. At the 10-min time point (Fig. 3) SR-A was fully Endo H-sensitive in both untreated and drug-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B). By 4 h, SR-A from untreated cells has been almost fully processed to an Endo H resistant form (Fig. 3A), whereas NB-DNJ-treated SR-A remained almost entirely fully Endo H sensitive, with only a small fraction being Endo H resistant, presumably via flux of a small number of molecules through the Golgi endomannosidase pathway (20Moore S.E. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13104-13112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). SR-A Interacts with Calnexin—SR-A immunoprecipitated from untreated and NB-DNJ-treated cells had molecular masses of 90 and 66 kDa, respectively. When samples were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-calnexin antibody and subsequently probed with anti-SR-A antibody, the scavenger receptor could be detected only from untreated cells (Fig. 4). Effects of NB-DNJ on Cell Surface and Total Expression of SRA—To investigate whether NB-DNJ-treatment influenced SR-A expression, binding sites of the anti-SR-A antibody were quantified by flow cytometry. Both NB-DNJ treatment and IFN-γ treatment increased cell surface staining with 2F8 monoclonal antibody when compared with untreated RAW264.7 cells (in the region of an approximate 2-fold increase) (Fig. 5A). When cells were exposed to the two agents simultaneously, there was a more marked augmentation of binding sites (15.4 ± 3.3 S.E., -fold relative to untreated cells) (Fig. 5A). In comparison, total cellular expression of SR-A was augmented 4.8 ± 1.1 S.E., -fold relative to untreated cells (Fig. 5C). DiI-AcLDL Uptake by NB-DNJ-treated Cells—SR-A is involved in the cellular uptake of acLDL by macrophages (1Platt N. Haworth R. Darley L. Gordon S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 212: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To study the functional properties of glucosylated SR-A, endocytosis of the fluorescently labeled SR-A ligand DiI-acLDL by untreated, NB-DNJ-treated, and NB-DNJ plus IFN-γ-treated RAW264.7 cells was measured by flow cytometry. Cells treated with NB-DNJ alone showed a significant increase in DiI-acLDL uptake compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5C). The increase in endocytic activity of drug plus cytokine-treated cells (13.2 ± 4.2 S.E., -fold increase in comparison to untreated) approximated that of SR-A surface expression (15.4 ± 3.3 S.E. greater in NB-DNJ plus IFN-γ-treated RAW-264.7 cells (Fig. 5A). Quantitative RT-PCR Analyses of NB-DNJ and Untreated Cells—To investigate the mechanism of increased cell surface expression of SR-A, SR-A mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR analyses in untreated and NB-DNJ-treated RAW264.7 cells. There was no significant difference in the relative amount of SR-A mRNA (as determined by Ct values and relative expression compared with that of GAPDH) between the untreated, drug-, and cytokine-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that the mechanism of increased cell surface receptor expression did not arise at the level of receptor transcription. Kinetics of Turnover of Cell Surface and Total Cellular SR-A—To determine whether the increase in expression of SR-A that accompanied exposure to the imino sugar reflected a change in the turnover rate of the receptor, we undertook pulse-chase analysis. These studies revealed that biotinylated SR-A had an approximate half-life of 1.6 (total pool of receptor) and 0.3 h (cell-surface pool of receptor) in control RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6). NB-DNJ treatment increased the half-life of surface-biotinylated SR-A to ∼2.3 (total) and 2 h (cell surface). IFN-γ treatment extended SR-A half-life to a comparable extent (2.4 and 2.0 h for total and cell surface-labeled populations of SR-A, respectively). The receptor half-life was further enhanced by co-treatment with NB-DNJ plus IFN-γ, to 7.9 (total) and 4.2 h (cell-surface). Inhibiting the first steps in N-glycan processing, and therefore preventing the interaction of glycoproteins with calnexin, does not inevitably lead to gross protein misfolding and degradation. Instead, it can cause subtler conformational changes of certain domains of the protein. These domains would have a particular requirement for an interaction with calnexin to achieve correct regional folding. For example, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV, gp120, is heavily N-glycosylated and when expressed in cultured cells in the presence of glucosidase I and II i"
https://openalex.org/W2091583410,"The eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by sequential activation and inactivation of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes. In this work, we screened human cDNAs that can rescue yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae from lethality caused by ectopic expression of human cyclin E and isolated a cDNA encoding ESXR1, a paired-like homeodomain-containing protein with a unique C-terminal proline-rich repeat region. In adult tissues, ESXR1 is primarily expressed in the testis. We demonstrate that ESXR1 prevents degradation of ubiquitinated cyclins in human cells. Accordingly, elevation of ESXR1 level results in accumulation of cyclin A and cyclin B1 and thereby provokes M-phase arrest. In human cells, the 65-kDa full-length ESXR1 protein is capable of proteolytically processing into N-terminal 45-kDa and C-terminal 20-kDa fragments. The C-terminal fragment, containing a proline-rich repeat region, is localized to the cytoplasm and displays the ability to inhibit cyclin degradation. In contrast, the N-terminal fragment, containing a paired-like homeodomain, is localized exclusively in the nucleus, suggesting that it plays a role in transcription. Our results indicate that proteolytic processing of ESXR1 plays a role in concerted regulation of the cell cycle and transcription in human cells."
