https://openalex.org/W2898103936,"The nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) has been widely used to assess the fungal composition in different environments by deep sequencing. To evaluate the ITS in the analysis of fungal diversity, comparisons of the clustering and taxonomy generated by sequencing with different portions of the whole fragment were conducted in this study. For a total of 83,120 full-length ITS sequences obtained from the UNITE database, it was found that, on average, ITS1 varied more than ITS2 within the kingdom Fungi; this variation included length and GC content variations and polymorphisms, with some polymorphisms specific to particular fungal groups. The taxonomic accuracy for ITS was higher than that for ITS1 or ITS2. The commonly used operational taxonomic unit (OTU) for evaluating fungal diversity and richness assigned several species to a single OTU even with clustering at 99.00% sequence similarity. The clustering and taxonomic capacities did not differ between ITS1 and ITS2. However, the OTU commonality between ITS1 and ITS2 was very low. To test this observation further, 219,741 pyrosequencing reads, including 39,840 full-length ITS sequences, were obtained from 10 soil samples and were clustered into OTUs. The pyrosequencing results agreed with the results of the in silico analysis. ITS1 might overestimate the fungal diversity and richness. Analyses using ITS, ITS1 and ITS2 yielded several different taxa, and the taxonomic preferences for ITS and ITS2 were similar. The results demonstrated that ITS2 alone might be a more suitable marker for revealing the operational taxonomic richness and taxonomy specifics of fungal communities when the full-length ITS is not available."
https://openalex.org/W2898320620,"Background Under-5 mortality rate in the sub-Saharan region has remained unabated. Worse still, information on the regional trend and associated determinants are not readily available. Knowledge of the trend and determinants of under-5 mortality are essential for effective design of intervention programmes that will enhance their survival. We aimed to examine the mortality patterns in under-5 children and maternal factors associated with under-5 deaths. Methods Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from five sub-Sahara Africa countries; Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Niger and Zimbabwe were used in this study. The sample size consisted of 68,085 women aged 15–49 years with at least one history of childbirth. The outcome variable was under-five mortality rate. Relevant information on maternal factors were extracted for analysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model maternal factors associated with under-five mortality. Results The current under-5 mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) was; 133 in Republic of Chad, 104 in Democratic Republic of Congo, 95 in Mali, 127 in Niger, and 69 in Zimbabwe. Several maternal and child level factors were found to be significantly associated with under-five mortality. Lack of spousal support (not currently married) resulted to increase in under-five mortality (Chad- Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.11, 95%CI = 0.97–1.25; DR Congo- HR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.11–1.40; Mali- HR = 2.43, 95%CI = 1.63–3.64; Niger- HR = 1.59, 95%CI = 1.24–2.03; Zimbabwe- HR = 1.33, 95%CI = 1.06–1.67). Delivery by caesarean section was significantly associated with under-five mortality (Chad- HR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.00–1.77; DR Congo- HR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.01–1.43; Mali- HR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.08–1.85; Niger- HR = 1.43, 95%CI = 1.06–1.92; Zimbabwe- HR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.03–2.15). Conclusion Despite concerted effort by government and several stakeholders in health to improve childhood survival, the rate of under-5 mortality is still high. Our findings provided evidence on the contribution of maternal age, place of residence, household wealth index, level of education, employment, marital status, religious background, birth type, birth order and interval, sex and size of child, place and mode of delivery, to Under-5 mortality rate in SSA. The position of prominent risk factors for under-five mortality should be addressed through effective design of timely and efficient intervention aimed at reducing childhood mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2898550567,"A multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) was developed and evaluated for the simultaneous detection of Salmonella spp., S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis in various (food) matrices. Early and fast detection of these pathogens facilitates effective intervention and prevents further distribution of contaminated food products on the market. Three primer and probe sets were designed to target the invA gene, the STM4200 gene, and the SEN1392 gene to detect and differentiate Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium, and S. Enteritidis, respectively. The multiplex qPCR targeting these three genes was optimized for efficiency and linearity. By testing 225 Salmonella isolates and 34 non-Salmonella isolates from various sources the inclusivity and exclusivity were determined. The inclusivity of the multiplex qPCR was 100% for all Salmonella isolates, including 72 S. Typhimurium isolates, and 53 S. Enteritidis isolates. The exclusivity for Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium, and S. Enteritidis was 100%, 94.6%, and 100%, respectively. No positive results were reported for non-Salmonella isolates. The limit of detection (LOD) for the qPCR was determined for the matrices poultry, minced meat, egg, herbs/spices, powdered milk, fish, animal feed, boot-socks with chicken feces and chicken down. LOD values for qPCR and the conventional culture methods were similar, except for the matrix boot-socks and down, for which the LOD for the conventional culture methods performed better than the qPCR method. In conclusion, the multiplex qPCR assay developed allows for rapid screening of Salmonella spp., S. Typhimurium, and S. Enteritidis in various (food) matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2898090286,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. Although infection with ZIKV generally leads to mild disease, its recent emergence in the Americas has been associated with an increase in the development of the Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, as well as with neurological complications, in particular congenital microcephaly, in new-borns. To date, little information is available on neuroinflammation induced by ZIKV, notably in microglial cells in the context of their metabolic activity, a series of chemical transformations that are essential for their growth, reproduction, structural maintenance and environmental responses. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the metabolomic profile of ZIKV-infected microglia. Microglial cells were exposed to ZIKV at different time points and were analyzed by a Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach. The results show that ZIKV infection in microglia leads to modulation of the expression of numerous metabolites, including lysophospholipids, particulary Lysophosphatidylcholine, and phospholipids such as Phosphatidylcholine, Phosphatidylserine, Ceramide and Sphingomyelin, and carboxylicic acids as Undecanedioic and Dodecanedioic acid. Some of these metabolites are involved in neuronal differentiation, regulation of apoptosis, virion architecture and viral replication. ZIKV infection was associated with concomitant secretion of inflammatory mediators linked with central nervous system inflammation such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and NO. It also resulted in the upregulation of the expression of the gene encoding CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor known to regulate functional synapse plasticity and signaling between microglial cells. These findings highlight an important role for microglia and their metabolites in the process of neuroinflammation that occurs during ZIKV pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2898324042,"Nonsense mutations, resulting in a premature stop codon in the open reading frame of mRNAs are responsible for thousands of inherited diseases. Readthrough of premature stop codons by small molecule drugs has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to treat disorders resulting from premature termination of translation. The aminoglycoside antibiotics are a class of molecule known to promote readthrough at premature termination codons. Gentamicin consists of a mixture of major and minor aminoglycoside components. Here, we investigated the readthrough activities of the individual components and show that each of the four major gentamicin complex components representing 92–99% of the complex each had similar potency and activity to that of the complex itself. In contrast, a minor component (gentamicin X2) was found to be the most potent and active readthrough component in the gentamicin complex. The known oto- and nephrotoxicity associated with aminoglycosides preclude long-term use as readthrough agents. Thus, we evaluated the components of the gentamicin complex as well as the so-called “designer” aminoglycoside, NB124, for in vitro and in vivo safety. In cells, we observed that gentamicin X2 had a safety/readthrough ratio (cytotoxicity/readthrough potency) superior to that of gentamicin, G418 or NB124. In rodents, we observed that gentamicin X2 showed a safety profile that was superior to G418 overall including reduced nephrotoxicity. These results support further investigation of gentamicin X2 as a therapeutic readthrough agent."
https://openalex.org/W2898331915,"Understanding complex abdominal organ motion is essential for motion management in radiation therapy (RT) of abdominal tumors. This study investigates abdominal motion induced by respiration and peristalsis, during various time durations relevant to RT, using various CT and MRI techniques acquired under free breathing (FB) and breath hold (BH).A series of CT and MRI images acquired with various techniques under free breathing and/or breath hold from 37 randomly-selected pancreatic or liver cancer patients were analyzed to assess the motion in various time frames. These data include FB 4DCT from 15 patients (for motion in time duration of 5 sec), FB 2D cine-MRI from 4 patients (time duration of 1.7 min, 1 second acquisition time per slice), FB cine-MRI acquired using MR-Linac from 6 patients in various fractions (acquisition time is less than 0.6 seconds per slice), FB 4DMRI from 2 patients (time duration of 2 min), respiration-gated T2 with gating at the end expiration (time duration of 3-5 min), and BH T1 with multiphase dynamic contrast in acquisition times of 17 seconds for each of five phases (pre-contrast, arterial, venous, portal venous and delayed post-contrast) from 10 patients. Motions of various organs including gallbladder (GB) and liver were measured based on these MRI data. The GB motion includes both respiration and peristalsis, while liver motion is primarily respiration. By subtracting liver motion (respiration) from GB motion (respiration and peristalsis), the peristaltic motion, along with small residual motion, was obtained.From cine-MRI, the residual motion beyond the respiratory motion was found to be up to 0.6 cm in superior-inferior (SI) and 0.55 cm in anterior-posterior (AP) directions. From 2D cine-MRI acquired by the MR-Linac, different peristaltic motions were found from different fractions for each patient. The peristaltic motion was found to vary between 0.3-1 cm. From BH T1 phase images, the average motions that were primarily due to peristalsis movements were found to be 1.2 cm in SI, 0.7 cm in AP, and 0.9 cm in left-right (LR) directions. The average motions assessed from 4DCT were 1.0 cm in SI and 0.3 cm in AP directions, which were generally smaller than the motions assessed from cine-MRI, i.e., 1.8 cm in SI and 0.6 cm in AP directions, for the same patients. However, average motions from 4DMRI, which are coming from respiratory were measured to be 1.5, 0.5, and 0.4 cm in SI, AP, and LR directions, respectively.The abdominal motion due to peristalsis can be similar in magnitude to respiratory motion as assessed. These motions can be irregular and persistent throughout the imaging and RT delivery procedures, and should be considered together with respiratory motion during RT for abdominal tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2898558634,"In retinal raster imaging modalities, fixational eye movements manifest as image warp, where the relative positions of the beam and retina change during the acquisition of single frames. To remove warp artifacts, strip-based registration methods-in which fast-axis strips from target images are registered to a reference frame-have been applied in adaptive optics (AO) scanning light ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). This approach has enabled object tracking and frame averaging, and methods have been described to automatically select reference frames with minimal motion. However, inconspicuous motion artifacts may persist in reference frames and propagate themselves throughout the processes of registration, tracking, and averaging. Here we test a previously proposed method for removing movement artifacts in reference frames, using biases in stripwise cross-correlation statistics. We applied the method to synthetic retinal images with simulated eye motion artifacts as well as real AO-SLO images of the cone mosaic and volumetric AO-OCT images, both affected by eye motion. In the case of synthetic images, the method was validated by direct comparison with motion-free versions of the images. In the case of real AO images, performance was validated by comparing the correlation of uncorrected images with that of corrected images, by quantifying the effect of motion artifacts on the image power spectra, and by qualitative examination of AO-OCT B-scans and en face projections. In all cases, the proposed method reduced motion artifacts and produced more faithful images of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2898245750,"Civil war, flight, escape and expulsion are extremely stressful and assert a negative impact on refugees’ mental health. However scientific research about resilience and coping of refugees is scarce. Especially in the recent refugee crisis, calls have been made to consider factors contributing to coping and resilience in this vulnerable population. Therefore, the current research sought to investigate individual differences that could serve as antecedents of coping and contextual factors that might moderate these effects. Specifically, it took into account individual’s self-regulatory differences in terms of regulatory focus (i.e., a promotion focus on nurturance needs, ideals and gains vs. a prevention focus on security needs, oughts and losses). It furthermore explored contextual influences by considering Syrian refugees in Turkey (Sample 1, N = 273) and Germany (Sample 2, N = 169). Compared to Syrian refugees in Turkey, those in Germany had a stronger promotion focus. They also reported more problem-focused and less maladaptive coping, as well as less symptoms. Both promotion and prevention focus were positively related to problem-focused coping. Problem-focused coping, in turn, predicted more symptoms in Turkey but not in Germany. Furthermore, a stronger promotion focus was associated with less symptoms and maladaptive coping was associated with more symptoms in both samples. These results contribute to the coping literature in demonstrating that under certain conditions problem-focused coping can be maladaptive and extend the scarce previous work on self-regulation and coping. Most importantly, they highlight a promotion focus as a clear resilience factor and the role of maladaptive coping in increasing vulnerability. As such, they might inform the design of effective interventions among Syrian refugees and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2898474822,"Mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) is an important edible bean in the human diet worldwide. However, its growth, development, and yield may be restricted or limited by insufficient or unbalanced nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization. Despite this, there are few long-term studies of the effects of varying levels of N, P, and K combined fertilizers and the optimal fertilization for improving mung bean yield and quality. This study was conducted to optimize the fertilization strategies for high yield and to improve yield components (pods per plant, seeds per pod, and 100-seed weight) in the Bailv9 mung bean cultivar, 23 treatments were tested in 2013–2015, using a three-factor (N, P, and K fertilizers), five-level quadratic orthogonal rotation combination design. Our studies showed that, the N, P, and K fertilizers significantly influenced the pods per plant and yield, which increased and then decreased with the increasing N, P, and K fertilizers. The 100-seed weight was significantly affected by the N and P fertilization, and it was increased consistently with the increasing N fertilizer, and decreased significantly with the increasing P fertilizer. Whereas, the seeds per pod significantly decreased with the increasing N and K fertilizers, and the P fertilizer had no significant effect on it. The NP interaction had a significant effect on yield and pods per plant at high N levels, while the NK interaction had a significant but opposite effect on yield at low N levels. The optimal fertilization conditions to obtain yield >2,141.69 kg ha-1 were 34.38–42.62 kg ha-1 N, 17.55–21.70 kg ha-1 P2O5, and 53.23–67.29 kg ha-1 K2O. Moreover, the optimal N, P, and K fertilization interval to achieve pods per plant > 23.41 and the optimal N fertilization to achieve a 100-seed weight > 6.58 g intersected with the interval for yield, but the seeds per pod did not. The fertilizer ratio for the maximum yield was N:P2O5:K2O = 1:0.5:1.59. Following three years experimentation, the optimal fertilization measures were validated in 2016–2017, the results indicated that yield increased by 19.6% than that obtained using conventional fertilization. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance for high-yield mung bean cultivation using the optimal fertilization measures."
https://openalex.org/W2898178897,"Objective To understand the value of information on vaccine inventory levels during an influenza pandemic, we propose a simulation study to compare vaccine allocation strategies using: (i) only population information (pro-rata, or population-based, PB), (ii) both population and vaccine inventory information (population and inventory-based, PIB). Methods We adapt an agent-based simulation model to predict the spread of the disease both geographically and temporally. We study PB and PIB when uptake rates vary geographically. The simulation study is done from 2015 to 2017, using population and commuting data from the state of Georgia from the United States census. Findings Compared to PB under reasonable scenarios, PIB reduces the infection attack rate from 23.4% to 22.4%, decreases the amount of leftover inventory from 827 to 152 thousand, and maintains or increases the percentage of vaccinated population. Conclusions Our results indicate the need for greater vaccine inventory visibility in public health supply chains, especially when supply is limited, and uptake rates vary geographically. Such visibility has a potential to decrease the number of infections, help identify locations with low uptake rates and to motivate public awareness efforts."

The most used strategies, such as 'finding strategies to create pleasurable distractions', 'engaging in leisure activities' or 'identifying the cause of the depression', were not always perceived as most helpful. In addition, the perceived most helpful strategies, such as 'completing treatment' and 'leaving the house regularly' were not always the most used ones.Patients use and perceive a wide range of self-management strategies as helpful to recover from their depression. Patients use and perceive strategies about engagement in treatment and physical activities as being most helpful. These finding may contribute to the further development and implementation of self-management programs for the prevention or the rehabilitation of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2898363554,"Introduction Blood is an important requirement in different medical and surgical conditions with half of all donations are from developing countries. Lack of eligibility among blood donors who present for blood transfusion, called blood donor deferral is associated with the unsustainable and inadequate amount of blood collected by blood banks worldwide. However, the prevalence and causes of blood donor deferrals are not well known in Tanzania where less than one-third of actual needs of blood is collected, leading to unmet demand of blood for transfusion, and causing unwanted morbidity and mortality. Materials and methods This was a retrospective analysis of blood donors at northern zone blood transfusion center, Tanzania from January to December. 2016. Donor’s data were transferred to Statistical Package for Social Studies (SPSS) program version 20.0 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize data and comparisons made by type of donor and deferrals using Chi-square test. Results A total of 14377 participants were studied whereby 12775 (88.9%) were voluntary non-remunerated blood donors. The blood donor deferral rate was 12.7% and deferral was significantly more likely in females, with increasing age above 31 years, who came from nearby regions from where the blood bank is located and/or a family replacement donor (P value <0.01). Overall, infections contributed to 62% of all deferrals and low hemoglobin was the leading cause of temporary deferrals while Hepatitis B lead the permanent deferral causes. Conclusions Blood donor deferral is a significant problem in northern Tanzania and accounts for more than one-tenth of all prospective blood donors. Latent and active infections are the leading cause of blood donor deferrals, a picture that mirrors other low income countries especially those located in sub-Saharan Africa. Results of this study calls for appropriate preventive interventions to address prevalent causes of deferrals such as infections with HIV and HBV to tackle low hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2898574693,"Purpose To investigate the effect of reading or writing on a smartphone in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) changes. Design Prospective, comparative case series. Participants Thirty-nine (39) healthy young (age < 40) volunteers. Methods The participants were requested to conduct standardized work (i.e., read a sample text on single mobile device and subsequently type it on the same device) under daylight [300 lux] and low-light [100 lux] conditions independently on consecutive days. On each day, three sets of IOP measurements (total: 7) using a rebound tonometer (iCare PRO; Tiolat, Helsinki, Finland) were performed: (1) pre-work (baseline) [2 measurements], (2) during smartphone work [5, 15, and 25 minutes], and (3) post-work [5 and 15 minutes]. Main outcome measures Changes in IOP at different check-out points. Results Under the daylight condition, the mean baseline IOP was 13.7 ± 1.8 mmHg, and the mean IOP increased after 5 minutes of work (14.1 ± 1.8 mmHg; +2.0 ± 1.9%; P < 0.001). When the smartphone work lasted for 15 minutes, the IOP showed a further significant increase (15.5 ± 1.7 mmHg; +12.9 ± 4.4%; P < 0.001), which persisted over the course of the 25 minutes of smartphone work (15.3 ± 1.8 mmHg; +11.1 ± 3.9%; P < 0.001); then, after stopping work for 5 minutes, the IOP was restored (13.9 ± 1.7 mmHg; +0.9 ± 2.1%; P = 0.220). Under the low-light condition, the mean IOP was significantly increased immediately after 5 minutes of smartphone work (from 13.9 ± 1.9 to 15.6 ± 1.8 mmHg; +12.1 ± 4.8%; P < 0.001); this IOP increase continued: 17.3 ± 1.9 [+24.7 ± 10.3%] at 15 minutes’ work, and 17.0 ± 1.7 mmHg [+23.1 ± 9.5%] at 25 minutes’ work (P < 0.001 at both check-out points). Five minutes after stopping the smartphone work, interestingly, the IOP significantly dropped, to a level even lower than that of the pre-work (12.8 ± 1.9 mmHg; -8.1 ± 3.0%; P < 0.001), and at post-work 15 minutes, the IOP returned to the baseline (13.9 ± 1.8 mmHg; -0.3 ± 2.6%; P = 0.360). Conclusions In healthy young subjects, reading or writing on smartphone significantly increased IOP, and the changes of IOP were faster and greater under the low-light condition. Smartphone users who are concerned about IOP fluctuation are advised to (1) take a break if they read or write on smartphone for more than 5 minutes, and (2) avoid using smartphones wherever possible in dark places."
https://openalex.org/W2952948518,"The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is an agricultural pest of commercial potatoes in parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Plant protection strategies within this geographic range employ a variety of pesticides to combat not only the insect, but also plant pathogens. Previous research has shown that field populations of Leptinotarsa decemlineata have a chronological history of resistance development to a suite of insecticides, including the Group 4A neonicotinoids. The aim of this study is to contextualize the transcriptomic response of Leptinotarsa decemlineata when exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, or the fungicides boscalid or chlorothalonil, in order to determine whether these compounds induce similar detoxification mechanisms. We found that chlorothalonil and imidacloprid induced similar patterns of transcript expression, including the up-regulation of a cytochrome p450 and a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase transcript, which belong to protein families associated with xenobiotic metabolism. Further, transcriptomic responses varied among individuals within the same treatment group, suggesting individual insects' responses vary within a population and may cope with chemical stressors in a variety of manners."
https://openalex.org/W2898179409,"In the last four decades there has been a staggering increase in the geographical range of the arboviral vector Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894). This species is now found in every continent except Antarctica, increasing the distribution of arboviral diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. In Lao PDR dengue epidemics occur regularly, with cases of chikungunya also reported. As treatment methods for arboviral diseases is limited, the control of the vector mosquitoes are essential. There is a paucity of information on the bionomics and resistance status of this mosquito for successful vector control efforts. Here we describe the bionomics and insecticide resistance status of Ae. albopictus in Laos to identify opportunities for control. Adult Ae. albopictus were collected using human-baited double bed net (HDN) traps in forests, villages and rubber plantations and tested for alpha- and flaviviruses with RT-PCR. Surveys were also conducted to identify larval habitats. Seven adult and larval populations originating from Vientiane Capital and Luang Prabang province were tested against DDT, malathion, permethrin, deltamethrin and, temephos following WHO protocols. Aedes albopictus were found throughout the year, but were six-fold greater in the rainy season than the dry season. Adult females were active for 24 hours, with peak of behaviour at 18.00 h. The secondary forest and rubber plantation samples showed evidence of Pan-flaviviruses, while samples from the villages did not. More than half of the emerged Ae. albopictus were collected from mature rubber plantations (53.9%; 1,533/2,845). Most Ae. albopictus mosquitoes emerged from latex collection cups (19.7%; 562/2,845), small water containers (19.7%; 562/2,845) and tyres (17.4%; 495/2,845). Adult mosquitoes were susceptible to pyrethroids, apart from one population in Vientiane city. All populations were resistant to DDT (between 27–90% mortality) and all except one were resistant to malathion (20–86%). Three of the seven larval populations were resistant to temephos (42–87%), with suspected resistance found in three other populations (92–98%).This study demonstrates that rural areas in northern Laos are potential hot spots for arboviral disease transmission. Multiple-insecticide resistance was found. Aedes albopictus control efforts in villages need to expand to include secondary forests and rubber plantations, with larval source management and limited use of insecticides."
https://openalex.org/W2898422174,"Rpb4 is an RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit that binds Pol II transcripts co-transcriptionally, accompanies them to the cytoplasm and modulates mRNA export, translation and decay by interacting with cytoplasmic RNA modulators. The importance of the cytoplasmic roles of Rpb4 was challenged by a study reporting that the phenotype of rpb2Δ rpb4Δ cells can be rescued by an Rpb2-Rpb4 fusion protein, assuming that its Rpb4 moiety cannot dissociate from Pol II and functions in the cytoplasm. Here we demonstrate that although the fusion protein supports normal transcription, it adversely affects mRNA decay, cell proliferation and adaptability-e.g., response to stress. These defects are similar, albeit milder, than the defects that characterize rpb4Δ cells. At least two mechanisms alleviate the deleterious effect of the fusion protein. First, a portion of this fusion protein is cleaved into free Rpb2 and Rpb4. The free Rpb4 is functional, as it binds mRNAs and polysomes, like WT Rpb4. Second, the fusion protein is also capable of binding poly(A)+ mRNAs in the cytoplasm, in an Rpb7-mediated manner, probably complementing the functions of the diminished Rpb4. Collectively, normal coupling between mRNA synthesis and decay requires wild-type configuration of Rpb4, and fusing Rpb4 to Rpb2 compromises this coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2951880398,"Lactulose is a common food ingredient and widely used as a treatment for constipation or hepatic encephalopathy and a substrate for hydrogen breath tests. Lactulose is fermented by the colon microbiota resulting in the production of hydrogen (H2). H2 is a substrate for enteropathogens including Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and increased H2 production upon lactulose ingestion might favor the growth of H2-consuming enteropathogens. We aimed to analyze effects of single-dose lactulose ingestion on the growth of intrinsic Escherichia coli (E. coli), which can be efficiently quantified by plating and which share most metabolic requirements with S. Typhimurium.32 healthy volunteers (18 females, 14 males) were recruited. Participants were randomized for single-dose ingestion of 50 g lactulose or 50 g sucrose (controls). After ingestion, H2 in expiratory air and symptoms were recorded. Stool samples were acquired at days -1, 1 and 14. We analyzed 16S microbiota composition and abundance and characteristics of E. coli isolates.Lactulose ingestion resulted in diarrhea in 14/17 individuals. In 14/17 individuals, H2-levels in expiratory air increased by ≥20 ppm within 3 hours after lactulose challenge. H2-levels correlated with the number of defecations within 6 hours. E. coli was detectable in feces of all subjects (2 x 10(2)-10(9) CFU/g). However, the number of E. coli colony forming units (CFU) on selective media did not differ between any time point before or after challenge with sucrose or lactulose. The microbiota composition also remained stable upon lactulose exposure.Ingestion of a single dose of 50 g lactulose does not significantly alter E. coli density in stool samples of healthy volunteers. 50 g lactulose therefore seems unlikely to sufficiently alter growth conditions in the intestine for a significant predisposition to infection with H2-consuming enteropathogens such as S. Typhimurium (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02397512)."
https://openalex.org/W2898535659,"Nematode parasites rely on successful host infection to perpetuate their species. Infection by individual nematode parasites can be risky, however; any one individual could be killed by the host’s immune response. Here we use a model system to show that environmental cues and parasite past experience can be used by entomopathogenic nematodes to reduce individual risk of infection. Past parasite experience can more than double the infective virulence (number of host invaders) of a given cohort of entomopathogenic nematode parasites. This plasticity in individual parasite risk-taking and associated infection can be used to manage infection of parasitic nematodes: enhancing biological control with entomopathogenic nematodes and developing behavioral and chemical strategies to reduce infection by vertebrate and plant parasitic nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W2898377874,"Tannin extracts have wide biological activity in ruminant nutrition. The possibility of masking their bitter taste and enhancing sustained release in the rumen can be achieved through encapsulation. The objectives of this study were to prepare an encapsulated Acacia tannin extract (ATE) suitable for ruminants using the solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) method, and to evaluate the microparticles in terms of morphology, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release under varying pH. Subsequently, the effect of the microparticles on rumen in vitro gas and methane production would be evaluated. Lipid microparticles were prepared using the double emulsion process with palm oil and lard, dichloromethane, and Tween80/Span80 emulsifiers. The microparticles produced by S/O/W emulsion tended to be smaller (P = 0.06), and had greater encapsulation efficiency compared with those produced by the melt dispersion method. Scanning electron micrographs showed microparticles had stable cylindrical and spherical shapes, with mean size of 34± 10.2 μm. Maximum encapsulation efficiencies of 78.6% and 80.1% were obtained with lard and palm oil as lipid wall materials, respectively, even under high core material loading percentage of 80%. Wall material type did not affect the characteristics of microparticles. In acetate buffer, only about 20% of tannin was released from the lipid-encapsulated microparticles into buffer media after 24 hours. In contrast, about 90% of the tannin had been released into solution before eight hours in the crude extract. Lipid-encapsulated ATE reduced rumen gas and methane production in vitro (P ˂0.05) in both Eragrostis and total mixed ration (TMR) diet substrates, but the magnitude of reduction was lower than that obtained when unencapsulated ATE was the additive (10% vs 20% for total gas and 17% vs 24% for methane). Crude ATE and palm oil encapsulated ATE reduced the concentration of methane in sampled gas (P = 0.054) when fermenting the TMR substrate, but this effect was not observed in the Eragrostis substrate. Ammonia nitrogen concentration was greater in encapsulated ATE compared with the crude ATE (P ˂0.001). These results show that the lipid-encapsulated ATE produced small-sized and more uniform microparticles, with high encapsulation efficiency compared with microparticles prepared by melt dispersion. Encapsulation of ATE enhanced the sustained release of tannin in the rumen, and with the potential to improve gas production and reduce methane production."
https://openalex.org/W2898091248,"Musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are complex phenotypes with genetics being one of many proposed risk factors. Case-control association studies using the candidate gene approach have predominately been used to identify risk loci for these injuries. However, the ability to identify all risk conferring variants using this approach alone is unlikely. Therefore, this study aimed to further define the genetic profile of these injuries using an integrated omics approach involving whole exome sequencing and a customised analyses pipeline. The exomes of ten exemplar asymptomatic controls and ten exemplar cases with Achilles tendinopathy were individually sequenced using a platform that included the coverage of the untranslated regions and miRBase miRNA genes. Approximately 200 000 variants were identified in the sequenced samples. Previous research was used to guide a targeted analysis of the genes encoding the tenascin-C (TNC) glycoprotein and the α1 chain of type XXVII collagen (COL27A1) located on chromosome 9. Selection of variants within these genes were; however, not predetermined but based on a tiered filtering strategy. Four variants in TNC (rs1061494, rs1138545, rs2104772 and rs1061495) and three variants in the upstream COL27A1 gene (rs2567706, rs2241671 and rs2567705) were genotyped in larger Achilles tendinopathy and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture sample groups. The CC genotype of TNC rs1061494 (C/T) was associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy (p = 0.018, OR: 2.5 95% CI: 1.2–5.1). Furthermore, the AA genotype of the TNC rs2104772 (A/T) variant was significantly associated with ACL ruptures in the female subgroup (p = 0.035, OR: 2.3 95% CI: 1.1–5.5). An inferred haplotype in the TNC gene was also associated with the risk of Achilles tendinopathy. These results provide a proof of concept for the use of a customised pipeline for the exploration of a larger genomic dataset. This approach, using previous research to guide a targeted analysis of the data has generated new genetic signatures in the biology of musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2898166580,"The Sab’atayn Basin is one of the most prolific Mesozoic hydrocarbon basins located in central Yemen. It has many oil producing fields including the Habban Field with oil occurrences in fractured basement rocks. A comprehensive seismic analysis of fractured basement reservoirs was performed to identify the structural pattern and mechanism of hydrocarbon entrapment and reservoir characteristics. A 3D post-stack time migration seismic cube and logging data of 20 wells were used and several 2D seismic sections were constructed and interpreted. Depth structure maps were generated for the basement reservoir and overlying formations. The top of the basement reservoir is dissected by a set of NW-SE step-like normal faults (Najd Fault System) and to a lesser extent, by secondary NNE-SSW oriented faults (Hadramauwt System). The Najd Fault System is dominant and dissects the reservoir in the middle of the field into two prospective uplifts. The northern and northeastern areas constitute the deep-seated downthrown side of the reservoir. Hydrocarbon emplacement is through the fault juxtaposition of the fractured basement against the organic shale source rock of the overlying Madbi Formation. Hydrocarbons are hosted in basement horsts formed by fault-controlled blocks and overlain by the regional seal of the Sab’atayn Formation. The basement reservoir rock is mainly composed of granite, quartz-feldspar, weathered silica, and mica minerals. Fractures were identified from the outcrops, cores, image logs, and the petrophysical analysis. Hydrocarbon saturation was observed in the upper and middle parts of the reservoir, more specifically in front of the highly fractured sections. The fracture porosity was less than 5% and the dead oil had an API gravity of 40° with no H2S or CO2. In conclusion, the structural highs of the Habban Field are of interest because most oil producing wells are drilled into them. We recommend extending the drilling and development activities in these uplifts."
https://openalex.org/W2898280909,"The polymorphisms of the prion protein (PRNP) gene, which encodes normal prion proteins (PrP), are known to be involved in the susceptibility of prion diseases. The prion-like protein (Doppel) gene (PRND) is the paralog of the PRNP gene and is closely located downstream of the PRNP gene. In addition, the polymorphisms of PRND correlate with disease susceptibility in several animals. We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of PRND polymorphisms in 246 Korean native black goats and found a total of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with one novel SNP, c.99C>T. We observed linkage disequilibrium (LD) within and between loci. PRND c.28T>C, c.151A>G, and c.385G>C and PRND c.65C>T and c.286G>A were in perfect LD and we have reported for the first time strong LD between PRND and PRNP or prion-related protein gene (PRNT) loci. Specifically, between the PRND c.28T>C, c.151A>G and c.385G>C and the PRNP codon 143, PRND c.99C>T and the PRNP codon 102 or PRND SNPs (c.28T>C, c.151A>G and c.385G>C) and PRNT SNP (c.321T>C). Furthermore, we confirmed that the genotype distribution of the PRNP p.His143Arg was significantly different according to that of the PRND c.28T>C (P < 0.0001). Finally, using PolyPhen-2 and PROVEAN, we predicted that two non-synonymous SNPs, c.65C>T and c.286G>A, in the PRND gene can have a detrimental effect on Doppel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic characteristics of the PRND gene in Korean native black goats."
https://openalex.org/W2898371262,"East Asia emits more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than any other region, yet little is known about attitudes towards climate change in this region. A cross-sectional survey investigating climate change knowledge, concern and behavior change was administered to 1118 university students at nine universities across Taiwan in June 2016. Knowledge was assessed with a 15-item quiz while concern and behavioral change were self-reported on 5-point Likert scales. The relationship of these three variables with various socio-demographic variables was investigated through Kruskal-Wallis tests and ordinal logistic regressions. Knowledge was homogeneous by region but differed sharply by socioeconomic position. Concern appears high by international standards, with 65% reporting being “somewhat concerned” and 28% being “very concerned,” while climate change denial was negligible. Students expressing greater concern were more likely to be from eastern and southern Taiwan, regions more vulnerable to extreme weather events. However, these high concern levels did not translate into action, as only 38% of respondents reported “some” and 11% reported “very much” behavioral change in response to climate change. Higher levels of behavioral change were reported by students expressing greater concern and students with lower levels of climate change knowledge. In contrast with studies of Western societies, our findings suggest an East Asian model in which the conflict between economic growth and the environment is playing out in different ways, such that the crucial need is for policy leadership and not more education."
https://openalex.org/W2949320143,"In comparison to neutral faces, facial expressions of emotion are known to gain attentional prioritization, mainly demonstrated by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). Recent evidence indicated that such a preferential processing can also be elicited by neutral faces when associated with increased motivational salience via reward. It remains, however, an open question whether impacts of inherent emotional salience and associated motivational salience might be integrated. To this aim, expressions and monetary outcomes were orthogonally combined. Participants (N = 42) learned to explicitly categorize happy and neutral faces as either reward- or zero-outcome-related via an associative learning paradigm. ERP components (P1, N170, EPN, and LPC) were measured throughout the experiment, and separately analyzed before (learning phase) and after (consolidation phase) reaching a pre-defined learning criterion. Happy facial expressions boosted early processing stages, as reflected in enhanced amplitudes of the N170 and EPN, both during learning and consolidation. In contrast, effects of monetary reward became evident only after successful learning and in form of enlarged amplitudes of the LPC, a component linked to higher-order evaluations. Interactions between expressions and associated outcome were absent in all ERP components of interest. The present study provides novel evidence that acquired salience impacts stimulus processing but independent of the effects driven by happy facial expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2898092908,"It is important to understand if, and to what extent, the pig can utilize xylose as an energy source if xylanase releases free xylose in the small intestine. The experimental objectives were to determine the effects of industry-relevant dietary xylose concentrations and adaptation time on xylose retention efficiency and metabolism, diet digestibility and energy value, nitrogen balance, and hindgut fermentation. Forty-eight pigs were housed in metabolism crates and randomly assigned to one of four treatments with increasing D-xylose levels (n = 12/treatment) in 2 replications of a 22-d experiment with 3 collection periods. The control diet was xylose-free (0%), to which either 2, 4, or 8% D-xylose was added. Adaptation effects were assessed during three fecal and urine collection periods: d 5–7, 12–14, and 19–21. On d 22, pigs from the 0 and 8% treatments were euthanized; cecal and colon digesta were collected. Dietary xylose did not affect the total tract digestibility of dry matter, gross energy, or crude protein (P>0.10). Digesta short chain fatty acids concentrations and molar proportions and cecal pH were not different (P>0.10). This experiment utilized a targeted metabolomics approach to characterize and quantify urine xylose and metabolite excretion. Xylose retention decreased from 60% to 47% to 41% when pigs were fed diets containing 2, 4, or 8% xylose, respectively. In the 4 and 8% treatments, xylose retention was greater in the 2nd and 3rd collection periods compared to the 1st. A comprehensive pathway for xylose metabolism was proposed and D-threitol was confirmed as the major urinary metabolite of xylose. In conclusion, pigs can metabolize xylose, but with considerably lower efficiency than glucose, and may be able to adapt with time to utilize xylose more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2898242233,"Background Dogs are important reservoirs of rabies, a zoonotic viral encephalitis that kills thousands of people in Asia and Africa annually. Mass dog vaccination is recommended for the prevention of rabies in both humans and dogs. Mass vaccinations should be conducted annually but more frequent campaigns may be required in areas with high dog turnover rates. Consequently, a good understanding of dog demography is essential for the control of the disease. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dog demography on rabies vaccination coverage following a mass vaccination campaign with at least 70% vaccination coverage. Methodology/Principal findings A dog population model was constructed to explore the effect of dog demography on rabies vaccination coverage decline. Important model parameters were identified through a comprehensive literature search on dog demography in Africa. A system dynamics approach was adopted to build a dog population model to simulate the effects of demographic processes on rabies vaccination coverage. Vensim PLE Plus software was used to construct the model. Multivariate sensitivity simulations using data from 22 studies and 12 African countries were performed to investigate the effect of dog turnover rates on vaccination coverage decline. In addition, an adjusted vaccination coverage to estimate the proportion of vaccinated dogs with adequate immunity at 12 months post-vaccination was calculated. The results demonstrated that the vaccination coverage and adjusted vaccination coverage remained over 30% and 20% respectively at 12 months if annual mass vaccinations achieved at least 70% coverage. Conclusions/Significance The results demonstrated that annual mass vaccination campaigns with at least 70% vaccination coverage would maintain a herd immunity of 20‒45% between campaigns."

However, no such studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia on Saudi women using OCs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OC-induced changes of thrombin generation (TG) in the absence and presence of activated protein C (APC) or thrombomodulin (TM) in Saudi women. Methods A total of 115 adult women, 47 on oral contraception (OC users) and 68 controls (not using OCs) were recruited from the obstetrics-gynecology outpatient clinic in Saudi Arabia. OCs that were used in this study include the following: Marvelon, Gynera, Cerrazetem, Yasmine, Microlut, Gracial and Diane. The plasma calibrated automated thrombinography (CAT) was used to determine TG which was expressed as endogenous thrombin potential (ETP; nM/min), lag time (min), peak (nM) and time-to-peak (ttpeak; min). In the presence of TM or APC, TG parameters were expressed relative to the parameters in the absence of TM or APC. Results and conclusion As in other populations, our study demonstrated that OC usage induced prothrombotic changes in plasma of Saudi women, including resistance to the inhibitory actions of TM and APC. More specifically, OC usage in our population predominantly influenced TG and APC/TM sensitivity in overweight and obese individuals, a finding that needs confirmation in large cohort studies. The effects of APC and TM on TG parameters showed a positive association, and the correlation coefficients were higher in OC users for both ETP and peak values."

To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms through which Lb. casei GCRL163 adapts to persistent elevated temperature, label-free quantitative proteomics of cell-free extracts was used to characterize the global responses of the strain cultured anaerobically in bioreactors at 30 to 45°C, pH 6.5, together with GC-MS for fatty acid methyl ester analysis at different growth phases. At higher growth temperatures, repression of energy-consuming metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, was observed, while PTS- and ABC-type transporter systems associated with uptake of nitrogen and carbon sources were up-regulated. Alkaline shock protein Asp23_2 was only detected at 45°C, expressed at high abundance, and presumptive α-L-fucosidase only at 40 and 45°C, with highly increased abundance (log2-fold change of 7) at 45°C. We identified a novel SecB homolog as a protein export chaperone putatively involved in posttranslational translocation systems, which was down-regulated as growth temperature increased and where the modelled 3D-structure shared architectural similarities with the Escherichia coli SecB protein. Membrane lipid analyses revealed temporal changes in fatty acid composition, cyclization of oleic acid to cyclopropane and novel cyclopentenyl moieties, and reduced synthesis of vaccenic acid, at higher temperatures. An 18kDa α-crystallin domain, Hsp20 family heat shock protein was more highly up-regulated in response to heat stress compared to other molecular chaperones, suggesting this protein could be a useful biomarker of prolonged heat stress in Lb. casei GCRL163."

Binding studies were performed using displacement of [125I]-NKA binding to NK2 receptors and displacement of [3H]-Septide binding to NK1 receptors expressed in CHO cells. Functional studies examining the increase in intracellular calcium levels and cyclic AMP stimulation were performed using the same cell lines. A correlation was demonstrated between binding affinities (Ki) and potency to increase intracellular calcium (EC50) for NK2 and NK1 receptors. Ranking compounds by their relative affinity (Ki) or potency (EC50) at NK2 or NK1 receptors indicated that the most selective NK2 agonists tested were [Lys5,MeLeu9,Nle10]-NKA(4-10) (NK1/NK2 Ki ratio = 674; NK1/NK2 EC50 ratio = 105) and [Arg5,MeLeu9,Nle10]-NKA(4-10) (NK1/NK2 Ki ratio = 561; NK1/NK2 EC50 ratio = 70). The endogenous peptide, NKA, lacked selectivity with an NK1/NK2 Ki ratio = 20 and NK1/NK2 EC50 ratio = 1. Of the compounds selected for evaluation in cyclic AMP stimulation assays, [β-Ala8]-NKA(4-10) had the greatest selectivity for activation of NK2 over NK1 receptors (NK1/NK2 EC50 ratio = 244), followed by [Lys5,MeLeu9,Nle10]-NKA(4-10) (ratio = 74), and NKA exhibited marginal selectivity (ratio = 2.8)."

The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of sintering temperature and holding time on the physical and mechanical properties of the sintered part. 50wt.% SS316L and 50wt.% HA were mixed with a binder system of palm stearin (PS) and polyethylene (PE) at 61 vol.% powder loading. Rheological properties show a pseudo-plastic behaviour of the feedstock, where viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. The feedstock was injection moulded into a tensile bar shape while thermal debinding was carried out at 320°C and 500°C. The brown parts were sintered at 1000, 1100, 1200 and 1300°C, with three different sintering times of 1, 3 and 5 hours in the furnace. It was found that the highest sintered density measured was 95.61% of the theoretical density. In addition, the highest hardness and Young’s modulus measured were 150.45 HV and 52.61 GPa respectively, which are higher than those of human bone. The lowest percentage of carbon content was 0.022wt.% given by the sample sintered at 1300°C for 1 hour. Therefore, SS316L/HA composite with good mechanical and physical properties was successfully produced through the PIM process."

Forty-nine 12-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were either sham-operated (Sham, one group) or orchidectomized (Orx, four groups) and fed a control diet for 120 days to establish bone loss and atherosclerotic lesions. Thereafter, rats were assigned to the various treatment groups (n = 9 to 10 per group): 1) Sham and 2) Orx groups received AIN93M, containing 75 IU vitamin E and served as control, and the other three Orx groups received either 3) 500 IU vitamin E, 4) 500 mg aspirin, or 5) 500 IU vitamin E + 500 mg aspirin per kg diet for 90 days. After 90 days of treatment, rats were sacrificed, necropsied, and tissues were collected for analyses. Results show that 500 IU vitamin E was able to reduce the development of atherosclerosis lesion formation and aortic streak area compared to Orx control. More importantly, 500 mg aspirin completely reversed the fatty streak area and made the atherosclerotic lesions disappear. Vitamin E and aspirin were not able to reverse bone loss as shown by whole body, lumbar and femoral bone mineral content and bone mineral density due to gonadal hormone deficiency. Instead, 500 mg aspirin somewhat increased the trabecular separation while decreased trabecular thickness compared to Orx control. Our findings suggest that both, vitamin E and aspirin exert anti-atherogenic effects and aspirin is more effective than vitamin E in preventing atherosclerosis lesions in Orx rats."
https://openalex.org/W2898185770,"The aim of this study was done to determine whether dexamethasone treatment prevents posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) development and attenuates brain damage after severe IVH in newborn rats. Severe IVH was induced by injecting; 100 μL of blood into each lateral ventricle of postnatal day 4 (P4) Sprague-Dawley rats. Dexamethasone was injected intraperitoneally into rat pups at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.1 mg/kg on P5, P6, and P7, respectively. Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral function tests, such as the negative geotaxis test and the rotarod test, were performed. On P32, brain tissues were obtained for histological and biochemical analyses. Dexamethasone treatment significantly improved the severe IVH-induced increase in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling-positive cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and ED-1 positive microglia, and the decrease in myelin basic protein. IVH reduced a survival of 71%, that showed a tendency to improve to 86% with dexamethasone treatment, although the result was not statistically significant. However, dexamethasone failed to prevent the progression to PHH and did not significantly improve impaired behavioral tests. Similarly, dexamethasone did not decrease the level of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -1α and ß, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α after severe IVH. Despite its some neuroprotective effects, dexamethasone failed to improve the progress of PHH and impaired behavioral tests after severe IVH."

PCP was diagnosed via nested PCR-mediated detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii in induced sputum samples, endotracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. PCP PCR was performed weekly to check for negative conversion.The overall survival rate was 35.8%. Seventy-four patients (91.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 6 (7.4%) required high-flow nasal oxygen treatment. The PCP PCR-negative conversion rate was 70.5% (survivors, 97%; non-survivors, 63.5%); the median time to conversion was 10 (7.0-14.0) days. On univariate analysis, the APACHE II score (p < 0.001), renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (p = 0.04), PCP PCR-negative conversion (p = 0.003), and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (first 24 hours) (p < 0.001) significantly correlated with mortality. On multivariate analysis, PCP PCR-negative conversion (hazard ratio, 0.433; 95% confidence interval, 0.203-0.928; p = 0.031) and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (first 24 hours) (hazard ratio, 0.988; 95% confidence interval, 0.983-0.993; p < 0.001) independently predicted prognosis.Determination of PCP PCR-negative conversion and PaO2/FiO2 ratios may help physicians predict treatment failure and mortality in non-HIV PCP patients with respiratory failure."

Such technologies enable students to get a gradual feedback about their performance and to provide adapted learning materials. It is particularly important in the domain of foreign language learning which requires intense daily practice. One of the main inputs of adaptive learning systems is the user's understanding of a reading material. The reader's understanding can be divided into two parts: the objective understanding and the subjective understanding. The objective understanding can be measured by comprehension questions about the content of the text. The subjective understanding is the reader's perception of his own understanding. The subjective understanding plays an important role in the reader's motivation, self-esteem and confidence. However, its automatic estimation remains a challenging task. This paper is one of the first to propose a method to estimate the subjective understanding. We show that using the eye gaze to predict the subjective understanding improves the estimation by 13% as compared to using comprehension questions."
https://openalex.org/W2898561566,"Forming accurate impressions of others' trustworthiness is a critical social skill, with faithfulness representing a key aspect of trust in sexual relationships. Interestingly, there is evidence for a small degree of accuracy in facial impressions of sexual unfaithfulness. Theoretical accounts suggest that these impressions may function to help with partner selection, and may be universal. If so, impressions should be similar for perceivers from different cultures and accuracy should not be limited to own-race faces. We tested these predictions by asking Caucasian and Asian women to judge the likelihood of unfaithfulness from the faces of Caucasian males whose past sexual history was known. In two studies we found high cross-cultural agreement in these impressions, consistent with universality in the impressions themselves. In Study 1, we found an other-race effect in impression accuracy, with significantly less accurate cross-race impressions by Asian women than own-race impressions by Caucasian women. Asian women showed no accuracy. Interestingly, in Study 2, Asian women who had grown up in the West showed small but significant accuracy in their impressions, with no other-race effect. Results are consistent with a degree of universality in the accuracy of this important aspect of social perception, provided that perceivers have experience with the faces being assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2898343493,"The cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP1) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that regulates cell signaling pathways involved in fundamental cellular processes including cell death, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and inflammation. It recruits ubiquitination substrates thanks to the presence of three baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains at its N-terminal extremity. We previously demonstrated that cIAP1 promoted the ubiquitination of the E2 factor 1 (E2F1) transcription factor. Moreover, we showed that cIAP1 was required for E2F1 stabilization during the S phase of cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. Here, we report that E2F1 binds within the cIAP1 BIR3 domain. The BIR3 contains a surface hydrophobic groove that specifically anchors a conserved IAP binding motif (IBM) found in a number of intracellular proteins including Smac. The Smac N-7 peptide that includes the IBM, as well as a Smac mimetic, competed with E2F1 for interaction with cIAP1 demonstrating the importance of the BIR surface hydrophobic groove. We demonstrated that the first alpha-helix of BIR3 was required for E2F1 binding, as well as for the binding of Smac and Smac mimetics. Overexpression of cIAP1 modified the ubiquitination profile of E2F1, increasing the ratio of E2F1 conjugated with K11- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains, and decreasing the proportion of E2F1 modified by K48-linked ubiquitin chains. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that cIAP1 was required for the recruitment of E2F1 onto chromatin. Lastly, we identified an E2F-binding site on the cIAP1-encoding birc2 gene promoter, suggesting a retro-control regulation loop."
https://openalex.org/W2898347085,"The hyaluronic acid component of the glycocalyx plays a role in cell mechanotransduction by selectively transmitting mechanical signals to the cell cytoskeleton or to the cell membrane. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical link between the hyaluronic acid molecule and the cell cytoskeleton by means of atomic force microscopy single molecule force spectroscopy. Hyaluronic acid molecules on live cells were targeted with probes coated with hyaluronic acid binding protein. Two different types of events were observed when the detachment of the target molecule from the probe occurred, suggesting the presence of cytoskeleton- and membrane-anchored molecules. Membrane-anchored molecules facilitated the formation of tethers when pulled. About 15% of the tested hyaluronic acid molecules were shown to be anchored to the cytoskeleton. When multiple molecules bonded to the probe, specific detachment patterns were observed, suggesting that a cytoskeletal bond needed to be broken to improve the ability to pull tethers from the cell membrane. This likely resulted in the formation of tethering structures maintaining a cytoskeletal core similar to the ones observed for cells over-expressing HA synthases. The different observed rupture events were associated with separate mechanotransductive mechanisms in an analogous manner to that previously proposed for the endothelial glycocalyx. Single cytoskeleton anchored rupture events represent HA molecules linked to the cytoskeleton and therefore transmitting mechanical stimuli into the inner cell compartments. Single membrane tethers would conversely represent the glycocalyx molecules connected to areas of the membrane where an abundance of signalling molecules reside."

The exposure of interest was intended vs unintended pregnancy, and the outcome was self-report of modern contraceptive use (hormonal methods, intrauterine device, sterilization, and/or consistent condom use) at 12 (range 6–18) months post-partum. A log-binomial model was used to estimate relative risks of modern contraceptive use post-partum based on intent of the index pregnancy, adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, education, relationship and HIV status of pregnancy partner, contraceptive use prior to pregnancy, years since HIV diagnosis, ART regimen, and CD4 cell count. Results Among 455 women, 110 women reported 110 incident pregnancies with report on intent. Women had a baseline median age of 29 years, baseline CD4 count 403 cells/mm3, and were living with HIV for 3.8 years. Fifty pregnancies (45%) were reported as unintended and 60 (55%) as intended. Postpartum, 64% of women with unintended and 51% with intended pregnancy reported modern contraception (p = 0.24). In adjusted models, there was no association between pregnancy intent and post-partum contraception. However, contraceptive use prior to the referent pregnancy was positively associated with post-partum contraceptive use (aRR 1.97 (95% CI 1.12–3.48, p = 0.02), while higher baseline CD4 cell count was associated with lower post-partum contraceptive use (aRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–0.99, p = 0.02). Conclusions Almost half of incident pregnancies among WLWH in this cohort were unintended. Experiencing an unintended pregnancy was not associated with post-partum contraceptive use. Creative strategies to support contraceptive uptake for birth spacing and prevention of unintended pregnancies in the post-partum period are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2898416967,"Green algae of the genus Halimeda have modular siphonous thalli composed of multiple repeated segments. Morphological variation among the segments has been related to various environmental factors, which often jointly affect their size and shape. The segments are bilaterally symmetric, which means that their shape variation can be decomposed into the symmetric and asymmetric components. Asymmetric variation might reflect both environmental heterogeneity and developmental instability of morphogenetic processes during the development of segments. In the present study, we examined if segment shape in H. tuna is related to their size and if an allometric relationship can also be found with respect to their asymmetry. Relative contributions of directional and fluctuating asymmetry to the segment shape variation within individual plants were investigated at two close localities in the northern Adriatic Sea. A series of equidistant semilandmarks were set along the outline of the segments, and analyzed by geometric morphometrics using two parallel methods to optimize their final position. Symmetric variation was strongly constrained by allometry, which also explained differences between populations. Smaller segments were significantly more asymmetric, but the difference in asymmetry between populations could not be explained solely by this allometric relationship. These differences between populations might have been caused by variation in local environmental factors. We conclude that members of the genus Halimeda represent an intriguing model system for studies of morphometric symmetry and asymmetry of sessile marine organisms, including effects of allometric relationships and infraspecific variation in relation to environmental factors of the benthic coastal habitats."

Methods Children whose mothers had been randomized to receive either an oral dose of 2g of azithromycin or placebo during labour were visited at home at the end of infancy by trained study nurses blind to the treatment allocation. The follow-up visit of these cohorts (exposed and non-exposed to azithromycin), which was not part of the original trial design, was conducted between November 2014 and May 2015 when the infants were 11 to 13 months of age. During visits, nurses recorded anthropometrical measurements and transcribed information from the infants’ welfare cards. Results Four-hundred and sixty-five (79.6%) of the 584 infants aged 11–13 months at the time of the survey were recruited. The proportion of children with an age-adjusted Z-score <-2SD for mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) was lower among those exposed to azithromycin [1.3% versus 6.3%, OR = 0.21 95%CI (0.06,0.72), p = 0.006] and there was weak evidence of a difference in the proportion of infants with weight-for-age (WAZ) Z-score <-2SD [7.1% versus 12.1%, OR = 0.58 95%CI (0.33,1.04), p = 0.065]. For all other malnutrition indicators the proportions were similar in the exposed and un-exposed cohort. Conclusions Our results show that azithromycin in labour may have a beneficial effect in MUAC among children who are below the curve. Larger studies with closer follow-up are warranted.

https://openalex.org/W2898320826,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic disease caused by thermodymorphic fungi of the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex, (Paracoccidioides spp.). Patients with PCM reveal specific cellular immune impairment. Despite the effective treatment, quiescent fungi can lead to relapse, usually late, the serological diagnosis of which has been deficient. The present study was carried out with the objective of investigating a biomarker for the identification of PCM relapse and another molecule behaving as an immunological recovery biomarker; therefore, it may be used as a cure criterion. In the evolutionary analysis of the proteins identified in PCM patients, comparing those that presented with those that did not reveal relapse, 29 proteins were identified. The interactions observed between the proteins, using transferrin and haptoglobin, as the main binding protein, were strong with all the others. Patient follow-up suggests that cerulosplamin may be a marker of relapse and that transferrin and apolipoprotein A-II may contribute to the evaluation of the treatment efficacy and avoiding a premature decision."
https://openalex.org/W2898466672,"Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has become the emerging technology due to its ability to provide intelligent and cost-effective healthcare monitoring solution. The biological sensors used in WBAN are energy-constrained and required to be functional for a longer duration. Also, the sensed data should be communicated in reasonable time. Therefore, network lifetime and delay have become the primary concerns in the design of WBAN. In this paper, Receive Diversity based Transmission Data Rate Optimization (RDTDRO) scheme is proposed to improve the network lifetime and delay efficiency of Multi level-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) based WBAN. In the proposed RDTDRO scheme, minimum energy consumption is ensured by optimizing the transmission data rate with respect to a given transmission distance and number of receive antennas while satisfying the Bit Error Rate (BER) requirements. The performance of proposed RDTDRO is analyzed in terms of network lifetime and delay difference and is compared with conventional Baseline and Rate optimized schemes. The results show that at a transmission distance of 0.3 m, the proposed RDTDRO scheme with a receive diversity order of 4 achieves 1.30 times and 1.27 times improvement in network lifetime over conventional Baseline and Rate optimized schemes respectively. From the results, it is also evident that at a transmission distance of 0.3 m, the proposed RDTDRO scheme with a receive diversity order of 4 is delay efficient as it achieves delay difference of 0.75 μs and 0.29 μs over conventional Baseline and Rate optimized schemes respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2898375044,"Ostreid oysters (the ‘true oysters’) represent a large and commercially important family of bivalve molluscs. Several species, such as the Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas), the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the European oyster (Ostrea edulis) and the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata), are currently farmed at a large scale. However a number of other species may also be suitable for commercial-scale aquaculture. One such species is the ‘black-lip oyster’, a large Saccostrea species of uncertain taxonomic affinity found in northern Australia. Here, phylogenetic analysis of the COI gene places this oyster within a clade identified in a previous study of Japanese Saccostrea species, ‘Saccostrea lineage J’. To facilitate comparisons between this oyster and the better-studied S. glomerata, de novo transcriptomes were generated from larval stages and adult tissues of both species. Patterns of orthology indicated an expansion of repetitive elements within Saccostrea genomes when compared to M. gigas and C. virginica, which may be reflected in increased evolutionary rates and/or genome sizes. The generation of high-quality transcriptomes for these two commercially relevant oysters provides a valuable resource for gene identification and comparison of molecular processes in these and other mollusc species."
https://openalex.org/W2898460672,"Adverse systemic effect caused by betel nut had been reported for decades. Our aim was to determine whether betel nut had detrimental impact on the development of colorectal polyps in general population. Participants who attended health examinations at the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) from 2010 to 2016 were included in the study. The habit of betel nut chewing was obtained from a self-reported questionnaire. Colorectal polyps were diagnosed by colonoscopies operated by experienced physicians. A logistic regression model was used for the association between betel nut chewing with the presence of colorectal polyps. After adjustment for pertinent information such as age, gender, biochemistry data and personal history, the odd ratios (ORs) of colorectal polyps among betel nut chewers was 1.49 (95%CI: 1.14-1.94). Besides, betel nut chewers in the higher percentage body fat (PBF) group had higher risk for developing colorectal polyps with ORs of 2.07 (95%CI:1.23-3.47). Subjects with habit of betel nut chewing were associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps in Taiwanese general population. Screening for betel nut chewing history and encouraging cessation might offer improved quality of life. A further research for this association was warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2898252815,"Mammalian neuraminidases are responsible for the removal of sialic acids from glycoproteins and glycolipids and function in a variety of biological phenomena such as lysosomal catabolism and control of cell differentiation and growth. Disruption of Neu3 and Neu4 genes has led to the generation of a mouse model revealing severe neurological disorders. In this study a morphological analysis was performed on the epididymis of 3 month-old neu3-/-neu4-/- mice as compared with wild type animals. In neu3-/-neu4-/- mice the majority of tubules of the main epididymal duct were large and lined by differentiated epithelial cells, but revealing lysosomal abnormalities in principal and basally located cells. Of particular note was the presence of aberrant epididymal tubules (ATs) juxtaposed next to the main tubules. ATs were small and of different shapes. Layers of myoid cells encased ATs, which they shared with those of the main tubules, but no interstitial space existed between the two. While some ATs were a dense mass of cells, others revealed a distinct lumen devoid of spermatozoa. The latter revealed an undifferentiated epithelium consisting of cuboidal cells and basal cells, with junctional complexes evident at the luminal front. The absence of spermatozoa from the lumen of the ATs suggests that they were not in contact with the main duct, as also implied by the undifferentiated appearance of the epithelium suggesting lack of lumicrine factors. Despite the presence of ATs, the main duct contained ample spermatozoa, as the neu3-/-neu4-/- mice were fertile. Taken together the data suggest that absence of Neu3 and Neu4 leads to defects in cell adhesion and differentiation of epithelial cells resulting in aberrant tubular offshoots that fail to remain connected with the main duct. Hence Neu3 and Neu 4 play an essential role in the guidance of epithelial cells during early embryonic formation."
https://openalex.org/W2898513370,"Intervening effectively to prevent students' harmful use of alcohol remains a challenge. Harmful alcohol use has been noted as the most dominant public health problem facing universities today. This study sought to investigate the diversity in staff and student perceptions of the contribution alcohol makes to student life in a Danish university setting. Increasing understanding of staff and students' perceptions of how alcohol fits into student life is required to amend future public health intervention for this population.This Q methodology study included 38 staff members and 105 students from Aarhus University, Denmark. Participants used online Q sorting software, to rank 40 statements about the contribution alcohol makes to the university student experience from strongly agree to disagree. To support the interpretation of the factors, self-reported alcohol consumption and demographic data were collected. In addition qualitative data was collected on the participant's reasons for the ranking of the items they most strongly agreed or disagreed with.Using principal components analysis, five statistically independent viewpoints for students and four for staff were identified. The findings provide evidence to inform approaches to prevent harmful alcohol use. Some viewpoints suggest a need for tailored secondary and tertiary prevention and intervention that focusses on individuals and/or sub-groups who are at risk of consuming alcohol at harmful levels. Other viewpoints suggest the need for primary universal prevention to support the maintenance of healthy norms which can prevent harmful alcohol behaviour. Public health campaigns need to ensure that interventions targeting harmful alcohol use at universities challenge problematic perceptions and attitudes while also bolstering exposure to positive norms."
https://openalex.org/W2898145706,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) entry is dependent on the envelope glycoprotein (Env) that is present on the virion and facilitates fusion between the envelope and the cellular membrane. The protein consists of two subunits, gp120 and gp41, with the former required for binding the CD4 receptor and either the CXCR4 or CCR5 coreceptor, and the latter for mediating fusion. The requirement of fusion for infection has made Env an attractive target for HIV therapy development and led to the FDA approval of enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor. Continued development of entry inhibitors is warranted because enfuvirtide resistant HIV-1 strains have emerged. In this study, a novel HIV-1 fusion assay was validated using neutralizing antibodies and then used to investigate the mechanism of action of eCD4-Igmim2, an HIV-1 inhibitor proposed to cooperatively bind the CD4 binding site and the sulfotyrosine-binding pocket of gp120. Greater reduction in fusion levels was observed with eCD4-Igmim2 in the fusion assay than all of the gp120 antibodies evaluated. Lab adapted isolates, HIV-1HXB2 and HIV-1YU2, were sensitive to eCD4-Igmim2 in the fusion assay, while primary isolates, HIV-1BG505 and HIV-1ZM651 were resistant. These results correlated with greater IC50 values for primary isolates compared to the lab adapted isolates observed in a virus neutralization assay. Analysis of gp120 models identified differences in the V1 and V2 domains that are associated with eCD4-Igmim2 sensitivity. This study highlights the use of a fusion assay to identify key areas for improving the potency of eCD4-Igmim2."
https://openalex.org/W2898536662,"Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) become increasingly important for assessing the effectiveness of a drug or medical device. In order for a PROM to be claimed in labeling, the PROM has to be valid, reliable and able to detect a change if the targeted disease status changes. One approach to assess the quality of a patient reported outcome measure (PROM) is to investigate the association between the PROM and an objective clinical endpoint measuring the status of a disease/condition. However, methods assessing the association between continuous and discrete variables are limited, especially for correlated measurements. In this paper, we propose a method to assess such association with any type of samples with or without correlation. The method involves estimating the probability revealing the status of a subject's disease/condition (called truth thereafter) through the subject's reported outcomes. The probability is a conditional probability revealing truth given the relative location of the subject's objective outcome compared to the subject-specific latent threshold in the objective endpoint. A consistent estimator for the probability is derived. The operating characteristics of the consistent estimator are illustrated using simulation. Our method is applied to hypothetical clinical trial data generated for an ophthalmic device as an illustration."
