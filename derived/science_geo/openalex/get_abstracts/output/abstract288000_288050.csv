https://openalex.org/W1981518435,"Ion exchange, gel filtration chromatography, and gas chromatographymass spectrometry analyses have demonstrated that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), an extremely strong complexing agent commonly used in decontamination operations at nuclear facilities, is causing the low-level migration of cobalt-60 from intermediate-level liquid waste disposal pits and trenches in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory burial grounds. Because it forms extremely strong complexes with rare earths and actinides, EDTA or similar chelates may also be contributing to the mobilization of these radionuclides from various terrestrial radioactive waste burial sites around the country."
https://openalex.org/W2108232730,Surface water changes associated with El Ni침o have been known to affect deleteriously top carnivores along coastal South America. Data on the breeding strategies of Gal치pagos penguins and other seabirds indicate that the biological effects of El Ni침o extend much farther west. The breeding biology of these seabirds is adapted to frequent changes in productivity which are associated with El Ni침o.
https://openalex.org/W2004152798,The 1-benzoyl-3-phenylurea insecticide diflubenzuron is a potent inhibitor for the conversion of (14)C-labeled glucose to (14)C-labeled chitin in isolated abdomens of newly emerged adult milkweed bugs (Oncopeltus fasciatus Dallas). The inhibitory activity of 24 diflubenzuron analogs in this in vitro chitin-synthesizing system is in good agreement with their toxicity to fifth instar nymphs of this species. These insecticides act quickly and directly within the integument to ultimately block the terminal polymerization step in chitin formation.

https://openalex.org/W1997797873,"By use of observations of zodiacal light, the symmetry plane or plane of maximum density of interplanetary dust at elongations of 32 degrees to 50 degrees from the sun has been found to be closer to the orbital plane of Venus than to the invariable plane. This suggests that the plane of maximum density in this region is being gravitationally perturbed closer to the orbital plane of Venus."

https://openalex.org/W2013757450,"A case is made that too much emphasis is placed on storage in connection with the use of solar energy. At present, any solar input is of value and only a small perturbation on the nation's energy picture. The use of hydroelectric installations as solar backup is discussed. Wind energy is described as suitable for winter-peaking utilities. Reliability through grid connection and storage research for the long term are discussed. (MHR)"
