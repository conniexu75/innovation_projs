The thousands of proteins within a cell function as modules and networks to coordinate their biological activities. Large-scale efforts are underway to build protein interaction maps that reveal cellular proteome architecture. Here, Wade Harper and colleagues use affinity purification mass spectrometry to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes and build the largest experimentally derived human proteome interaction network to date, termed BioPlex 2.0. Containing over 29,000 novel co-associations and 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities, BioPlex 2.0 is more than double the size of their earlier interaction network BioPlex 1.0 and will be a valuable resource for exploring uncharacterized proteins and candidate disease-linked genes. The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in part through networks of protein–protein interactions that assemble functionally related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways. Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating how genome variation contributes to disease1,2,3. Here we present BioPlex 2.0 (Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust affinity purification–mass spectrometry methodology4 to elucidate protein interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions, BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering5 of interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness6,7 are enriched within 53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified 442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome organization."

The epigenetic regulation of T cell dysfunction and therapeutic reprogrammability (for example, to immune checkpoint blockade) is not well understood. Here we show that T cells in mouse tumours differentiate through two discrete chromatin states: a plastic dysfunctional state from which T cells can be rescued, and a fixed dysfunctional state in which the cells are resistant to reprogramming. We identified surface markers associated with each chromatin state that distinguished reprogrammable from non-reprogrammable PD1hi dysfunctional T cells within heterogeneous T cell populations from tumours in mice; these surface markers were also expressed on human PD1hi tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Our study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy as we define key transcription factors and epigenetic programs underlying T cell dysfunction and surface markers that predict therapeutic reprogrammability."
https://openalex.org/W2614980328,"A mutation that increases the secretion of Zika virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in infected hosts enhances the ability of the virus to infect its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and might have contributed to the recent Zika epidemic. Several flaviviruses, such as dengue fever virus and Zika virus, are transmitted by mosquitos. Gong Cheng and colleagues have previously shown that the acquisition of flaviviruses by mosquitoes can be influenced by the flavivirus non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which can be secreted into the serum of an infected host and acquired by the mosquitoes together with the virus. Here, the authors show that such a mechanism also operates to enhance the acquisition of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection by its mosquito vector A. aegypti. The authors identify a mutation in NS1 that enhances its secretion and hence serves to increase mosquito acquisition of the virus. In a survey of NS1 proteins from Asian isolates of ZIKV, the authors also find that the mutation is observed in all isolates collected after 2013. The authors speculate that this mutation in NS1 may have contributed to the rapid spread of the recent epidemic. Zika virus (ZIKV) remained obscure until the recent explosive outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013–2014) and South America (2015–2016)1,2,3. Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV has evolved into African and Asian lineages. The Asian lineage of ZIKV was responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas1,3. However, the underlying mechanisms through which ZIKV rapidly and explosively spread from Asia to the Americas are unclear. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes from an infected mammalian host and subsequently enhances viral prevalence in mosquitoes4. Here we show that NS1 antigenaemia determines ZIKV infectivity in its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti, which acquires ZIKV via a blood meal. Clinical isolates from the most recent outbreak in the Americas were much more infectious in mosquitoes than the FSS13025 strain, which was isolated in Cambodia in 2010. Further analyses showed that these epidemic strains have higher NS1 antigenaemia than the FSS13025 strain because of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at residue 188 in NS1. ZIKV infectivity was enhanced by this amino acid substitution in the ZIKV FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes that acquired ZIKV from a viraemic C57BL/6 mouse deficient in type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mouse). Our results reveal that ZIKV evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 protein, resulting in increased NS1 antigenaemia. Enhancement of NS1 antigenaemia in infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and prevalence in mosquitoes, which could have facilitated transmission during recent ZIKV epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2615073964,"Reprogrammed cellular metabolism is a common characteristic observed in various cancers. However, whether metabolic changes directly regulate cancer development and progression remains poorly understood. Here we show that BCAT1, a cytosolic aminotransferase for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is aberrantly activated and functionally required for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in humans and in mouse models of CML. BCAT1 is upregulated during progression of CML and promotes BCAA production in leukaemia cells by aminating the branched-chain keto acids. Blocking BCAT1 gene expression or enzymatic activity induces cellular differentiation and impairs the propagation of blast crisis CML both in vitro and in vivo. Stable-isotope tracer experiments combined with nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic analysis demonstrate the intracellular production of BCAAs by BCAT1. Direct supplementation with BCAAs ameliorates the defects caused by BCAT1 knockdown, indicating that BCAT1 exerts its oncogenic function through BCAA production in blast crisis CML cells. Importantly, BCAT1 expression not only is activated in human blast crisis CML and de novo acute myeloid leukaemia, but also predicts disease outcome in patients. As an upstream regulator of BCAT1 expression, we identified Musashi2 (MSI2), an oncogenic RNA binding protein that is required for blast crisis CML. MSI2 is physically associated with the BCAT1 transcript and positively regulates its protein expression in leukaemia. Taken together, this work reveals that altered BCAA metabolism activated through the MSI2-BCAT1 axis drives cancer progression in myeloid leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2616130684,"Controlling plant disease has been a struggle for humankind since the advent of agriculture. Studies of plant immune mechanisms have led to strategies of engineering resistant crops through ectopic transcription of plants' own defence genes, such as the master immune regulatory gene NPR1 (ref. 1). However, enhanced resistance obtained through such strategies is often associated with substantial penalties to fitness, making the resulting products undesirable for agricultural applications. To remedy this problem, we sought more stringent mechanisms of expressing defence proteins. On the basis of our latest finding that translation of key immune regulators, such as TBF1 (ref. 3), is rapidly and transiently induced upon pathogen challenge (see accompanying paper), we developed a 'TBF1-cassette' consisting of not only the immune-inducible promoter but also two pathogen-responsive upstream open reading frames (uORFsTBF1) of the TBF1 gene. Here we demonstrate that inclusion of uORFsTBF1-mediated translational control over the production of snc1-1 (an autoactivated immune receptor) in Arabidopsis thaliana and AtNPR1 in rice enables us to engineer broad-spectrum disease resistance without compromising plant fitness in the laboratory or in the field. This broadly applicable strategy may lead to decreased pesticide use and reduce the selective pressure for resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2616271045,"In humans and other mammalian species, lesions in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus cause profound sleep impairment, indicating a crucial role of the preoptic area in sleep generation. However, the underlying circuit mechanism remains poorly understood. Electrophysiological recordings and c-Fos immunohistochemistry have shown the existence of sleep-active neurons in the preoptic area, especially in the ventrolateral preoptic area and median preoptic nucleus. Pharmacogenetic activation of c-Fos-labelled sleep-active neurons has been shown to induce sleep. However, the sleep-active neurons are spatially intermingled with wake-active neurons, making it difficult to target the sleep neurons specifically for circuit analysis. Here we identify a population of preoptic area sleep neurons on the basis of their projection target and discover their molecular markers. Using a lentivirus expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or a light-activated chloride channel for retrograde labelling, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation, and optrode recording, we show that the preoptic area GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus are both sleep active and sleep promoting. Furthermore, translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing identify candidate markers for these neurons, and optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations demonstrate that several peptide markers (cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and tachykinin 1) label sleep-promoting neurons. Together, these findings provide easy genetic access to sleep-promoting preoptic area neurons and a valuable entry point for dissecting the sleep control circuit."

https://openalex.org/W2615096297,"The human glucagon receptor, GCGR, belongs to the class B G-protein-coupled receptor family and plays a key role in glucose homeostasis and the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Here we report the 3.0 Å crystal structure of full-length GCGR containing both the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain in an inactive conformation. The two domains are connected by a 12-residue segment termed the stalk, which adopts a β-strand conformation, instead of forming an α-helix as observed in the previously solved structure of the GCGR transmembrane domain. The first extracellular loop exhibits a β-hairpin conformation and interacts with the stalk to form a compact β-sheet structure. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange, disulfide crosslinking and molecular dynamics studies suggest that the stalk and the first extracellular loop have critical roles in modulating peptide ligand binding and receptor activation. These insights into the full-length GCGR structure deepen our understanding of the signalling mechanisms of class B G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2614263878,"In the absence of specialized immune cells, the need for plants to reprogram transcription to transition from growth-related activities to defence is well understood. However, little is known about translational changes that occur during immune induction. Using ribosome footprinting, here we perform global translatome profiling on Arabidopsis exposed to the microbe-associated molecular pattern elf18. We find that during this pattern-triggered immunity, translation is tightly regulated and poorly correlated with transcription. Identification of genes with altered translational efficiency leads to the discovery of novel regulators of this immune response. Further investigation of these genes shows that messenger RNA sequence features are major determinants of the observed translational efficiency changes. In the 5' leader sequences of transcripts with increased translational efficiency, we find a highly enriched messenger RNA consensus sequence, R-motif, consisting of mostly purines. We show that R-motif regulates translation in response to pattern-triggered immunity induction through interaction with poly(A)-binding proteins. Therefore, this study provides not only strong evidence, but also a molecular mechanism, for global translational reprogramming during pattern-triggered immunity in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2615485935,"Knowledge of all correlation functions of a system is equivalent to solving the corresponding many-body problem. Already a finite set of correlation functions can be sufficient to describe a quantum many-body system if correlations factorise, at least approximately. While being a powerful theoretical concept, an implementation based on experimental data has so far remained elusive. Here, this is achieved by applying it to a non-trivial quantum many-body problem: A pair of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional atomic superfluids. From measured interference patterns we extract phase correlation functions up to tenth order and analyse if, and under which conditions, they factorise. This characterises the essential features of the system, the relevant quasiparticles, their interactions and possible topologically distinct vacua. We verify that in thermal equilibrium the physics can be described by the quantum sine-Gordon model, relevant for a wide variety of disciplines from particle to condensed-matter physics. Our experiment establishes a general method to analyse quantum many-body systems in experiments. It represents a crucial ingredient towards the implementation and verification of quantum simulators."
https://openalex.org/W2614183691,"New and rapid political and economic changes in Myanmar are increasing the pressures on the country's forests. Yet, little is known about the past and current condition of these forests and how fast they are declining. We mapped forest cover in Myanmar through a consortium of international organizations and environmental non-governmental groups, using freely-available public domain data and open source software tools. We used Landsat satellite imagery to assess the condition and spatial distribution of Myanmar's intact and degraded forests with special focus on changes in intact forest between 2002 and 2014. We found that forests cover 42,365,729 ha or 63% of Myanmar, making it one of the most forested countries in the region. However, severe logging, expanding plantations, and degradation pose increasing threats. Only 38% of the country's forests can be considered intact with canopy cover >80%. Between 2002 and 2014, intact forests declined at a rate of 0.94% annually, totaling more than 2 million ha forest loss. Losses can be extremely high locally and we identified 9 townships as forest conversion hotspots. We also delineated 13 large (>100,000 ha) and contiguous intact forest landscapes, which are dispersed across Myanmar. The Northern Forest Complex supports four of these landscapes, totaling over 6.1 million ha of intact forest, followed by the Southern Forest Complex with three landscapes, comprising 1.5 million ha. These remaining contiguous forest landscape should have high priority for protection. Our project demonstrates how open source data and software can be used to develop and share critical information on forests when such data are not readily available elsewhere. We provide all data, code, and outputs freely via the internet at (for scripts: https://bitbucket.org/rsbiodiv/; for the data: http://geonode.themimu.info/layers/geonode%3Amyan_lvl2_smoothed_dec2015_resamp)."
https://openalex.org/W2735511229,"Availability of directly-acting antivirals (DAAs) has changed the treatment landscape of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The high price of DAAs has restricted their use in several countries. However, in some countries such as India, generic DAAs are available at much cheaper price. This study examined whether generic DAAs could be cost-saving and how long it would take for the treatment to become cost-saving/effective.A previously-validated, mathematical model was adapted to the HCV-infected population in India to compare the outcomes of no treatment versus treatment with DAAs. Model parameters were estimated from published studies. Cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment using available DAAs was calculated, using a payer's perspective. We estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DAAs versus no treatment. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Compared with no treatment, the use of generic DAAs in Indian HCV patients would increase the life expectancy by 8.02 years, increase QALYs by 3.89, avert 19.07 DALYs, and reduce the lifetime healthcare costs by $1,309 per-person treated. Treatment became cost-effective within 2 years, and cost-saving within 10 years of its initiation overall and within 5 years in persons with cirrhosis. Treating 10,000 HCV-infected persons could prevent 3400-3850 decompensated cirrhosis, 1800-2500 HCC, and 4000-4550 liver-related deaths. The results were sensitive to the costs of DAAs, pre- and post-treatment diagnostic tests and management of cirrhosis, and quality of life after sustained virologic response.Treatment with generic DAAs available in India will improve patient outcomes, provide a good value for money within 2 years, and be ultimately cost-saving. Therefore, in this and similar settings, HCV treatment should be a priority from a public health as well an economic perspective."
https://openalex.org/W2615830025,"Beaver are an integral component of hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes within North American stream systems, and their propensity to build dams alters stream and riparian structure and function to the benefit of many aquatic and terrestrial species. Recognizing this, beaver relocation efforts and/or application of structures designed to mimic the function of beaver dams are increasingly being utilized as effective and cost-efficient stream and riparian restoration approaches. Despite these verities, the notion that beaver dams negatively impact stream habitat remains common, specifically the assumption that beaver dams increase stream temperatures during summer to the detriment of sensitive biota such as salmonids. In this study, we tracked beaver dam distributions and monitored water temperature throughout 34 km of stream for an eight-year period between 2007 and 2014. During this time the number of natural beaver dams within the study area increased by an order of magnitude, and an additional 4 km of stream were subject to a restoration manipulation that included installing a high-density of Beaver Dam Analog (BDA) structures designed to mimic the function of natural beaver dams. Our observations reveal several mechanisms by which beaver dam development may influence stream temperature regimes; including longitudinal buffering of diel summer temperature extrema at the reach scale due to increased surface water storage, and creation of cool—water channel scale temperature refugia through enhanced groundwater—surface water connectivity. Our results suggest that creation of natural and/or artificial beaver dams could be used to mitigate the impact of human induced thermal degradation that may threaten sensitive species."
https://openalex.org/W2616838116,"T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. TIGIT recognizes nectin and nectin-like adhesion molecules and thus plays a critical role in the innate immune response to malignant transformation. Although the TIGIT nectin-like protein-5 (necl-5) interaction is well understood, how TIGIT engages nectin-2, a receptor that is broadly over-expressed in breast and ovarian cancer, remains unknown. Here, we show that TIGIT bound to the immunoglobulin domain of nectin-2 that is most distal from the membrane with an affinity of 6 μm, which was moderately lower than the affinity observed for the TIGIT/necl-5 interaction (3.2 μm). The TIGIT/nectin-2 binding disrupted pre-assembled nectin-2 oligomers, suggesting that receptor-ligand and ligand-ligand associations are mutually exclusive events. Indeed, the crystal structure of TIGIT bound to the first immunoglobulin domain of nectin-2 indicated that the receptor and ligand dock using the same molecular surface and a conserved “lock and key” binding motifs previously observed to mediate nectin/nectin homotypic interactions as well as TIGIT/necl-5 recognition. Using a mutagenesis approach, we dissected the energetic basis for the TIGIT/nectin-2 interaction and revealed that an “aromatic key” of nectin-2 is critical for this interaction, whereas variations in the lock were tolerated. Moreover, we found that the C-C′ loop of the ligand dictates the TIGIT binding hierarchy.

Here TIGIT expression can be counter-productive, because it directly opposes the activity of the activating DNAM-1 receptor, thereby limiting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity of some tumors in vitro (2Berry R. Rossjohn J. Brooks A.G. The Ly49 natural killer cell receptors: a versatile tool for viral self-discrimination.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to acting as ligands for nectin receptors, nectin and nectin-like molecules are one of the major constituents of adherins junctions and thus play a central role in a number of cellular processes including adhesion, migration, and proliferation (3Brooks A.G. Posch P.E. Scorzelli C.J. Borrego F. Coligan J.E. NKG2A complexed with CD94 defines a novel inhibitory natural killer cell receptor.J. Exp.

Rev. 1997; 155: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Nectin and nectin-like protein function is dependent on their ability to associate into homo- and hetero-dimers both within the plane of the same membrane (in cis) and between opposing cell membranes (in trans) to form a tight network of “zippers” between adjacent cells (4Lazetic S. Chang C. Houchins J.P. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Human natural killer cell receptors involved in MHC class I recognition are disulfide-linked heterodimers of CD94 and NKG2 subunits.J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4741-4745PubMed Google Scholar). Nectin and necl homo-dimers are formed via interactions between the most membrane distal of their three extracellular Ig domains (D1), which contain signature “lock” and “key” motifs that serve to latch the molecules together (26Harrison O.J. Vendome J. Brasch J. Jin X. Hong S. Katsamba P.S. Ahlsen G. Troyanovsky R.B. Troyanovsky S.M. Honig B. Shapiro L. Nectin ectodomain structures reveal a canonical adhesive interface.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these lock and key motifs are also conserved in the first Ig domain of the nectin receptors and a recent structure of TIGIT bound to necl-5 revealed a binding mode that was similar to that observed for nectin/nectin dimeric interactions (27Stengel K.F. Harden-Bowles K. Yu X. Rouge L. Yin J. Comps-Agrar L. Wiesmann C. Bazan J.F. Eaton D.L. Grogan J.L. Structure of TIGIT immunoreceptor bound to poliovirus receptor reveals a cell-cell adhesion and signaling mechanism that requires cis-trans receptor clustering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5399-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, whether this docking mode is conserved in other receptor-ligand pairings within this axis remains unclear. Here we present a comprehensive structural and biophysical analysis of the TIGIT/nectin-2 interaction that broadens our knowledge of the molecular details underpinning nectin receptor/ligand interactions. To study the interaction between TIGIT and nectin-2, we expressed and purified their corresponding ectodomains from Escherichia coli and mammalian expression systems, respectively. Notably, TIGIT and nectin-2 both contain the signature lock and key motifs within their respective D1 domains (Fig. 1A). Thus, to assess whether the recombinant TIGIT and nectin-2 ectodomains associated in solution, we performed size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS). Using this approach, nectin-2 eluted at ∼1.91 ml and had a mass of 62 kDa, approximately twice that expected for a monomer based on amino acid sequence (36.5 kDa) (Fig. 1B). The dimeric status of nectin-2 is in agreement with both structural data and solution-based studies that suggest nectin-2 forms a stable homo-dimer (KD ∼0.4 μm) in solution (26Harrison O.J. Vendome J. Brasch J. Jin X. Hong S. Katsamba P.S. Ahlsen G. Troyanovsky R.B. Troyanovsky S.M. Honig B. Shapiro L. Nectin ectodomain structures reveal a canonical adhesive interface.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By contrast, TIGIT eluted at a volume of ∼2.47 ml, and had a mass of 11.9 kDa, in good agreement with a monomer based on amino acid sequence (11.7 kDa). The monomeric nature of TIGIT in solution was consistent with previous NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation data that suggested that the dissociation constant for TIGIT self-association was high (KD > 1 mm) (27Stengel K.F. Harden-Bowles K. Yu X. Rouge L. Yin J. Comps-Agrar L. Wiesmann C. Bazan J.F. Eaton D.L. Grogan J.L. Structure of TIGIT immunoreceptor bound to poliovirus receptor reveals a cell-cell adhesion and signaling mechanism that requires cis-trans receptor clustering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5399-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When TIGIT and nectin-2 were pre-mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio, a single peak, with a calculated mass of ∼49 kDa was evident at 1.93 ml (Fig. 1B). Because this peak was well separated from that observed for the TIGIT monomer, we concluded it represented a TIGIT·nectin-2 complex (predicted mass 48.2 kDa) rather than a mixture of TIGIT monomer and nectin-2 dimer. Accordingly, isolated TIGIT and nectin-2 ectodomains are able to associate in solution and this interaction is concomitant with a dissociation of the nectin-2 homodimer. Although limited cellular staining experiments suggest nectin-2 is a poor ligand for TIGIT (14Stanietsky N. Simic H. Arapovic J. Toporik A. Levy O. Novik A. Levine Z. Beiman M. Dassa L. Achdout H. Stern-Ginossar N. Tsukerman P. Jonjic S. Mandelboim O. The interaction of TIGIT with PVR and PVRL2 inhibits human NK cell cytotoxicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17858-17863Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), our SEC-MALS data suggested that the affinity of TIGIT for nectin-2 was relatively high. To formally assess the strength of the TIGIT/nectin-2 interaction, we performed direct binding studies using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As a negative control we used the structurally related molecule KIR2DS4, which did not bind to TIGIT (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the entire nectin-2 ectodomain (EC) bound robustly to TIGIT with an apparent affinity (KD(app)) of 5.8 ± 0.6 μm (Fig. 1C). Although this affinity was lower than that observed for the binding of TIGIT to necl-5 (KD = 3.2 ± 0.4 μm), it was at the higher end of the range typically observed for NK cell receptor/ligand interactions (e.g. KIR3DL1:HLA-B57, KD = 17 μm (8Sullivan L.C.

Notably, the second and third Ig domains of nectin-2 appeared to be superfluous to the interaction, because a truncated form of nectin-2 comprising only the first, membrane distal Ig domain (nectin-2-D1) bound to TIGIT with similar affinity (KD(app) = 3.7 ± 0.5 μm) as the entire nectin-2 ectodomain (Fig. 1C). Thus, the first Ig domain of nectin-2 mediates a strong interaction with TIGIT. To understand the molecular basis for the recognition of nectin-2 by TIGIT, we determined the crystal structure of TIGIT bound to nectin-2-D1 to 3.1-Å resolution (Table 1). The structure refined very well, to an Rfac/Rfree of 21.4/23.0, respectively, and the electron density at the TIGIT/nectin-2 interface was unambiguous, thereby permitting a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that underpin the interaction. The crystallographic asymmetric unit comprised two molecules of TIGIT and two molecules of nectin-2 that together formed a symmetrical double-winged structure (Fig. 2A). Within this heterotetrameric arrangement, the two TIGIT molecules form the “body” (see “Discussion”), whereas the nectin-2 molecules lie at the extremities and correspond to the “wings.”Table 1X-ray crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsData collection statisticsTemperature (K)100X-ray sourceMX2 Australian SynchrotronSpace groupP43212Cell dimensions68.50, 68.50, 253.9190, 90, 90Resolution (Å)85–3.1 (3.27–3.1)Total number of observations81,489 (12,229)No. unique observations11,784 (1677)Multiplicity6.9 (7.3)Data completeness99.8 (100)I/σI6.3 (1.7)Rpim (%)9.6 (41)CC(1/2)0.986 (0.532)Refinement statisticsNon-hydrogen atoms Protein3418 Sugar25Rfactor (%)aRfactor = Σhkl‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σhkl|Fo| for all data excluding the 5% that comprised the Rfree used for cross-validation.21.4Rfree (%)23R.m.s. deviation from ideality Bond lengths (Å)0.007 Bond angles (°)0.96Ramachandran plot Favored regions (%)97.3 Allowed regions (%)2.4 Disallowed regions (%)0.3B factor, all atoms (Å2)71a Rfactor = Σhkl‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σhkl|Fo| for all data excluding the 5% that comprised the Rfree used for cross-validation. Open table in a new tab Both TIGIT and nectin-2 D1 adopted β-sandwich-folds (sheet 1, ABED; sheet 2, C″C′CFG) and possess a strand topology that is classical of the Ig-variable domain superfamily (30Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. The immunoglobulin fold. Structural classification, sequence patterns and common core.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, TIGIT and nectin-2 D1 are closely structurally conserved, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) of 1 Å over 80 aligned Cα atoms. Although the TIGIT and nectin-2 secondary structure elements superpose well, the two molecules differ in the size and conformation of the connecting loops. In particular, the C-C′ and D-E loops are markedly extended (by 15 and 5 residues, respectively) in nectin-2, thereby allowing us to confidently verify the identity of each molecule within the electron density map (Fig. 2, B and C). Neither TIGIT nor nectin-2 D1 underwent significant conformational changes upon complex formation (TIGIT r.m.s. deviation 0.42 Å over 96 Cα atoms, nectin-2 r.m.s. deviation 0.35 Å over 111 Cα atoms) compared with their previously published unliganded forms (PDB codes 3Q0H and 4DFH (31Liu J.

A sugar moiety derived from the mammalian expression system is visible at the single predicted N-linked glycosylation site (Asn137) on the F-strand of one of the nectin-2 protomers and does not impact on TIGIT binding (Fig. 2A). TIGIT and nectin-2 D1 interacted over a broad region that encompassed the breadth of their corresponding C″C′CFG sheets as well as the interconnecting C″C′ and FG loops (Fig. 3). The total solvent-accessible surface area that was buried upon the interaction was 1,560 A2. The relatively small interface was offset, however, by a high degree of shape complementarity (Sc = 0.74, where an Sc value of 1 represents a geometrically perfect fit), which is considerably greater than that typically observed for other NK cell receptor/ligand interactions such as Ly49C-H2-Kb (0.58) (28Dam J.

Med. 2008; 205: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interactions at the TIGIT/nectin-2 interface are primarily non-polar in nature, with a total of 7 H-bonds and only a single solitary salt bridge (Table 2). The primary points of contact are derived from signature AX6G lock and TF/YP key interactions derived from the C′C″ and FG loops, respectively. Since TIGIT and nectin-2 possess both a lock and a key, these motifs form complementary interactions that serve to latch the two molecules together (Fig. 2A). Here the prominent aromatic residue of the key (Tyr113 in TIGIT and Phe145 in nectin-2) inserts into a concave hydrophobic pocket, making extensive interactions with both main chain and side chain atoms within, and directly after, the AX6G lock (Ala67-Gly74 in TIGIT and Ala83-Gly90 in nectin-2) (Fig. 3, A and B). The lock and key interactions, which reside at the periphery of the interface, are further supplemented by additional contacts primarily derived from residues on the face of the more centrally located C-, C′-, and F-sheets (Fig. 3C). Here, the side chains of the second and third positions of a semiconserved VTQ motif (ISL in nectin-2) appear to play a prominent role. In particular, Thr55 (in TIGIT) forms a bridge between the C′ and C sheets, whereas Gln56 extends toward the F-strand forming H-bonds with the hydroxyl of Ser66 and the carbonyl of Thr144 (Fig. 3C).Table 2Contacts between TIGIT and nectin-2TIGITNectin-2TypeThr-55CG2Ser-66CB,OVDWThr-55OG1,CG2,OG1His-86NE2,CD2VDWGln-56OE1Ser-66OGH-BondGln-56NE2,CB,CD,OE1Ser-66OG,OG,CBVDWGln-56NE2Ala-143CB,CVDWGln-56OE1Thr-144OH-BondGln-56NE2,CD,OE1Thr-144N,O,CVDWGln-56OE1Phe-145CBVDWAsn-58ND2Ser-149OGH-BondAsn-58ND2Ser-149N,CBVDWGlu-60OE1Ser-149OG,CBVDWIle-68CG2Phe-145CD2VDWIle-68CD1Pro-146O,CVDWIle-68CD1Gly-148CA,NVDWAsn-70ND2Ser-66CBVDWAsn-70CBPhe-145CD2,CE2VDWAsp-72OD2Tyr-64OHVDWLeu-73CD1Tyr-64CB,CG,CD2VDWLeu-73CB,CD1Phe-145CD1,CE1,CB,CG,CZVDWGly-74OPhe-145CZ,CE2VDWTrp-75OPhe-145CZVDWHis-76CBPhe-145CZ,CE2VDWHis-76CG,CD2,ND1,CE1,NE2Pro-146CB,OVDWHis-111CE1Glu-141OE1VDWHis-111ND1Glu-141OE1Salt bridgeHis-111CG,CD2,ND1Ala-143CBVDWHis-111NE2Ser-149OGH bondHis-111CE1Ser-149OGVDWThr-112N,OLeu-67CD2VDWTyr-113CB,CG,CD1,CE1His-86CD2,CBVDWTyr-113CD2,CE2,CZ,OHMet-89CB,CG,S.D.,OVDWTyr-113CE1,CZ,OHGly-90O,CVDWTyr-113OHPro-91OH bondTyr-113CZ,OHPro-91O,CVDWTyr-113CD1,CE1,CZ,OHSer-92OG,CB,NVDWPro-114OSer-92OGH bondPro-114CA,C,CBSer-92OG,CBVDWPro-114OPro-94CB,CGVDWAsp-115OAsn-81ND2,CB,CGVDWAsp-115C,OPro-94CG,CBVDWGly-116CA,CAsn-81CG,ND2,OD1VDWThr-117OG1Thr-69CB,CG2,OG1VDWThr-117OG1,CBGln-71NE2VDWThr-117NAsn-81OD1H bondThr-117N,CA,CB,OAsn-81CG,OD1,ND2VDWThr-117OG1,CG2Glu-141OE1VDW Open table in a new tab The architecture of the TIGIT/nectin-2 structure is closely related to that previously observed for TIGIT bound to necl-5 D1 (27Stengel K.F.

Activation of DNA end resection involves phosphorylation of the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease EXO1 by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) and by the cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2. After activation, EXO1 must also be restrained to prevent over-resection that is known to hamper optimal HR and trigger global genomic instability. However, mechanisms by which EXO1 is restrained are still unclear. Here, we report that EXO1 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system soon after DSB induction in human cells. ATR inhibition attenuated DNA-damage-induced EXO1 degradation, indicating that ATR-mediated phosphorylation of EXO1 targets it for degradation. In accord with these results, EXO1 became resistant to degradation when its SQ motifs required for ATR-mediated phosphorylation were mutated. We show that upon the induction of DNA damage, EXO1 is ubiquitinated by a member of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) family of ubiquitin ligases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Importantly, expression of degradation-resistant EXO1 resulted in hyper-resection, which attenuated both NHEJ and HR and severely compromised DSB repair resulting in chromosomal instability. These findings indicate that the coupling of EXO1 activation with its eventual degradation is a timing mechanism that limits the extent of DNA end resection for accurate DNA repair.

These breaks arise as a result of both exogenous (for e.g. ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs) and endogenous (for e.g. reactive oxygen species and stalled replication forks) insults. DSBs can be repaired by one of two major pathways in eukaryotes: 1) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), an error-prone process wherein the DNA ends are directly rejoined after limited end processing (1Burma S. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Role of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in maintaining genomic integrity.DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and 2) homologous recombination (HR), an error-free pathway that uses the undamaged sister chromatid as a template for repair (2Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J. Regulation of homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar).

Recent evidence suggests that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that are active in S and G2 phases regulate repair pathway choice by promoting DNA end resection that stymies NHEJ and facilitates HR (for review, see Ref. 6Ferretti L.P.

End resection results in the generation of 3′-ended single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is rapidly coated by replication protein A (RPA), which is then replaced with Rad51 to generate a nucleoprotein filament that copies information from the sister chromatid. DNA end resection occurs in a two-step manner (for review, see Refs. 7Symington L.S. Gautier J. Double-strand break end resection and repair pathway choice.Annu. Rev.

Phosphorylation of EXO1 by CDKs stimulates DNA end resection by promoting the recruitment of EXO1 to DNA breaks via interactions with BRCA1 (23Tomimatsu N. Mukherjee B. Catherine Hardebeck M.

The functional consequences of serine 714 phosphorylation are not well understood. Given that EXO1 is a key HR exonuclease in eukaryotic cells, it is important to understand how such an enzyme is kept on a tight rein after it is activated to prevent excessive DNA end resection. Excessive ssDNA would pose a threat to genomic integrity as they would be prone to breakage and could even trigger global genomic instability by exhausting the existing pool of RPA (39Toledo L.I. Altmeyer M. Rask M.B. Lukas C. Larsen D.H. Povlsen L.K. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Bartek J. Lukas J.

Nussenzweig A. Naked replication forks break apRPArt.Cell. 2013; 155: 979-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extensive DNA end resection would also cause a switch in the DSB repair mode from error-free HR to the highly deleterious single-strand-annealing pathway (41Ochs F. Somyajit K. Altmeyer M. Rask M.B. Lukas J. Lukas C. 53BP1 fosters fidelity of homology-directed DNA repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 42Zong D. Chaudhuri A.R. Nussenzweig A. More end resection is not merrier.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 699-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a mechanism by which resection is restrained in human cells that involves the degradation of EXO1 after DNA damage in a phosphorylation- and ubiquitination-dependent manner. In the course of our studies on EXO1 we were intrigued to find that EXO1 levels rapidly declined in HEK-293 cells treated with the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT), which induces replication fork-associated DSBs (43Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Arrest of replication forks by drug-stabilized topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes as a mechanism of cell killing by camptothecin.Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). A reduction in EXO1 levels was also seen in additional human cell lines treated with CPT (supplemental Fig. 1a) or other genotoxic agents (supplemental Fig. 1b). By following EXO1 levels over a longer time period after CPT treatment, we found that the decrease in EXO1 was transient, showing recovery by ∼16 h post-CPT treatment (supplemental Fig. 1c). By synchronizing cells in different phases of the cell cycle, we determined that EXO1 levels were cell cycle-dependent, with the highest levels observed in phases where HR is operative, i.e. in S and G2 (supplemental Fig. 1d). However, the rapid reduction in EXO1 levels after DNA damage could not be attributed to cell-cycle changes, as no major differences in cell-cycle distribution were observed for at least 8 h post-CPT treatment (supplemental Fig. 1e). No changes in EXO1 transcript levels were seen after CPT treatment (supplemental Fig. 1f), indicating that post-transcriptional mechanisms were involved in the decrease in EXO1 levels. Indeed, the decrease in EXO1 appeared to be due to proteasomal degradation as this could be inhibited by treatment of cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 1b). By treating cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), we found that the half-life of EXO1 was considerably shortened upon the induction of DNA damage by ionizing radiation (IR) or CPT (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, treatment of cells with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A in the absence of DNA damage also resulted in destabilization of EXO1, indicating that phosphorylation of EXO1 might trigger its degradation (Fig. 1c). EXO1 is known to be phosphorylated at serine 714 by ATM and ATR in response to ionizing radiation and DNA replication inhibitors, respectively (35Bolderson E. Richard D.J. Edelmann W. Khanna K.K. Involvement of Exo1b in DNA damage-induced apoptosis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3452-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36El-Shemerly M. Hess D. Pyakurel A.K. Moselhy S. Ferrari S. ATR-dependent pathways control hEXO1 stability in response to stalled forks.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CPT-induced EXO1 degradation was attenuated by pretreatment of cells with caffeine, a broad-specific inhibitor of both ATM and ATR kinases (44Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Inhibition of ATM and ATR kinase activities by the radiosensitizing agent, caffeine.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a).

Curtin N.J. Richardson C.J. Smith G.C. Durkacz B.W. Radiosensitization and DNA repair inhibition by the combined use of novel inhibitors of DNA-dependent protein kinase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6008-6015PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on EXO1 degradation (supplemental Fig. 2a). On the other hand, pretreatment of cells withVE822, a specific inhibitor of ATR (47Leszczynska K.B. Dobrynin G. Leslie R.E. Ient J. Boumelha A.J. Senra J.M. Hawkins M.A. Maughan T. Mukherjee S. Hammond E.M. Preclinical testing of an Atr inhibitor demonstrates improved response to standard therapies for esophageal cancer.Radiother. Oncol. 2016; 121: 232-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATR resulted in stabilization of EXO1 (Fig. 2, b and c). Taken together, these observations indicated that EXO1 degradation might be triggered by ATR-mediated phosphorylation events. Knockdown of second-tier kinases that function downstream of ATR and ATM, CHK1 and CHK2, respectively (48Stracker T.H. Usui T. Petrini J.H. Taking the time to make important decisions: the checkpoint effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and the DNA damage response.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), had no effect on EXO1 levels (supplemental Fig. 2b), implying that direct phosphorylation of EXO1 by ATR might trigger its degradation. To test this possibility, we mutated serine 714 of EXO1 to alanine, and expressed siRNA-resistant V5-tagged S714A-EXO1 in HEK-293 cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous EXO1 (23Tomimatsu N. Mukherjee B. Catherine Hardebeck M. Ilcheva M. Vanessa Camacho C. Louise Harris J. Porteus M. Llorente B. Khanna K.K. Burma S. Phosphorylation of EXO1 by CDKs 1 and 2 regulates DNA end resection and repair pathway choice.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, upon challenging these cells with CPT, we found that mutation of the serine 714 phosphorylation site did not affect EXO1 degradation appreciably (Fig. 2d). We reasoned that EXO1 might be phosphorylated at additional SQ sites upon DNA damage. This line of reasoning was based upon the observation that EXO1 with mutated serine 714 (S714A-EXO1) was still recognized by anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) ATM/ATR substrate antibody in immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, whereas EXO1 with mutation of all six potential SQ phosphorylation sites in its C-terminal tail (S432A/S652A/S674A/S676A/S694A/S714A; henceforth referred to as 6A-EXO1) was no longer recognized by this antibody (supplemental Fig. 2c). Moreover, CPT-induced phosphorylation of S714A-EXO1 was attenuated by pretreatment of cells with the ATR inhibitor VE822 (47Leszczynska K.B. Dobrynin G. Leslie R.E. Ient J. Boumelha A.J. Senra J.M. Hawkins M.A. Maughan T. Mukherjee S. Hammond E.M. Preclinical testing of an Atr inhibitor demonstrates improved response to standard therapies for esophageal cancer.Radiother. Oncol. 2016; 121: 232-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), thereby implicating ATR in EXO1 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 2d). Significantly, unlike wild-type EXO1, 6A-EXO1 was very stable after the induction of DNA damage (Fig. 2e). We, therefore, concluded that DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation of the C terminus of EXO1 triggers its degradation. As EXO1 appears to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Fig. 1b), we next sought to determine if EXO1 phosphorylation upon DNA damage serves as trigger for its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. To determine whether EXO1 was directly ubiquitinated in vivo, we co-expressed V5-EXO1 and His6-ubiquitin in HeLa cells (49Hao Y.H. Doyle J.M. Ramanathan S. Gomez T.S. Jia D. Xu M. Chen Z.J.

Regulation of WASH-dependent actin polymerization and protein trafficking by ubiquitination.Cell. 2013; 152: 1051-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The cells were exposed to CPT, His6-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were captured under denaturing conditions using Ni2+-agarose beads, and ubiquitinated forms of EXO1 were detected by Western blotting with anti-V5 antibody. We found that EXO1 was ubiquitinated at low levels in unstressed cells and that EXO1 ubiquitination increased dramatically in response to DNA damage (Fig. 3a). The modified forms of EXO1 were not seen in cells expressing conjugation-defective His6-ubiquitin (ΔGG) (50Doyle J.M. Gao J. Wang J. Yang M. Potts P.R. MAGE-RING protein complexes comprise a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 963-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), confirming that they represented ubiquitinated EXO1. Importantly, the DNA-damage-induced increase in EXO1 ubiquitination was not seen in cells treated with the ATR inhibitor caffeine (Fig. 3b) or in cells expressing 6A-EXO1 (Fig. 3c), indicating that phosphorylation of EXO1 by ATR serves to target it for ubiquitination. In light of the apparent link between EXO1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, we were interested in the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) family of ubiquitin ligases, which typically recognize and ubiquitinate phosphorylated substrates (51Silverman J.S.

SCF ubiquitin ligases regulate multiple DNA-damage-response pathways (51Silverman J.S. Skaar J.R. Pagano M. SCF ubiquitin ligases in the maintenance of genome stability.Trends Biochem.

Notably, a Cullin1-containing SCF has been reported to target CHK1 for degradation after it is phosphorylated by ATR in a manner similar to that observed for EXO1 (54Zhang Y.W. Brognard J.

Given the importance of gut microbes in digestion, a genetically engineered microbe could potentially degrade some ingested phenylalanine from the diet prior to absorption. To test this, a phenylalanine lyase gene from Anabaena variabilis (AvPAL) was codon-optimized and cloned into a shuttle vector for expression in Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23C (pHENOMMenal). Functional expression of AvPAL was determined in vitro, and subsequently tested in vivo in homozygous PAHenu2 (PKU model) mice. Initial trials of two PAHenu2 homozygous (PKU) mice defined conditions for freeze-drying and delivery of bacteria. Animals showed reduced blood phe within three to four days of treatment with pHENOMMenal probiotic, and blood phe concentrations remained significantly reduced (P < 0.0005) compared to untreated controls during the course of experiments. Although pHENOMMenal probiotic could be cultured from fecal samples at four months post treatment, it could no longer be cultivated from feces at eight months post treatment, indicating eventual loss of the microbe from the gut. Preliminary screens during experimentation found no immune response to AvPAL. Collectively these studies provide data for the use of a genetically engineered probiotic as a potential treatment for PKU."
https://openalex.org/W2616648530,"In liver steatosis (i.e. fatty liver), hepatocytes accumulate many large neutral lipid storage organelles known as lipid droplets (LDs). LDs are important in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, but the signaling mechanisms that stimulate LD metabolism in hepatocytes are poorly defined. In adipocytes, catecholamines target the β-adrenergic (β-AR)/cAMP pathway to activate cytosolic lipases and induce their recruitment to the LD surface. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether hepatocytes, like adipocytes, also undergo cAMP-mediated lipolysis in response to β-AR stimulation. Using primary rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells, we found that treatment with the β-AR agent isoproterenol caused substantial LD loss via activation of cytosolic lipases adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). β-Adrenergic stimulation rapidly activated PKA, which led to the phosphorylation of ATGL and HSL and their recruitment to the LD surface. To test whether this β-AR-dependent lipolysis pathway was altered in a model of alcoholic fatty liver, primary hepatocytes from rats fed a 6-week EtOH-containing Lieber-DeCarli diet were treated with cAMP agonists. Compared with controls, EtOH-exposed hepatocytes showed a drastic inhibition in β-AR/cAMP-induced LD breakdown and the phosphorylation of PKA substrates, including HSL. This observation was supported in VA-13 cells, an EtOH-metabolizing human hepatoma cell line, which displayed marked defects in both PKA activation and isoproterenol-induced ATGL translocation to the LD periphery. In summary, these findings suggest that β-AR stimulation mobilizes cytosolic lipases for LD breakdown in hepatocytes, and perturbation of this pathway could be a major consequence of chronic EtOH insult leading to fatty liver.

This observation was supported in VA-13 cells, an EtOH-metabolizing human hepatoma cell line, which displayed marked defects in both PKA activation and isoproterenol-induced ATGL translocation to the LD periphery. In summary, these findings suggest that β-AR stimulation mobilizes cytosolic lipases for LD breakdown in hepatocytes, and perturbation of this pathway could be a major consequence of chronic EtOH insult leading to fatty liver. The liver is an important mediator of fat storage and lipid homeostasis in the body. Hepatocytes, the most abundant cell type of the liver, constitutively regulate their lipid content via import, synthesis, storage, metabolism, and secretion of fatty acids in response to a variety of physiological conditions such as nutrient flux or energy expenditure (1.Rui L. Energy metabolism in the liver.Compr. Physiol. 2014; 4: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Disruption of this balance can lead to fatty liver disease, an ailment that is often observed in the obese and exacerbated by the overconsumption of alcohol (2.O'Shea R.S. Dasarathy S. McCullough A.J. Alcoholic liver disease.Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2010; 105: 14-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3.Lieber C.S.

Thus, there is a critical clinical need to understand the mechanisms that govern hepatocellular lipid regulation. Within hepatocytes, fatty acids are packaged as triglycerides (TGs) 2The abbreviations used are: TG, triglyceride; LD, lipid droplet; β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Iso, isoproterenol; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; NES, nuclear export sequence; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; sfGFP, superfolder GFP; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; Fsk, forskolin; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; MDH, monodansylpentane; ORO, Oil Red O. or sterol esters and stored within specialized organelles known as lipid droplets (LDs). Although once thought to be inert sites of TG storage, LDs are now understood to have widespread metabolic importance and are regulated by a distinct proteome of constitutively and dynamically associated proteins (5.Guo Y.

In the liver, catabolism of LDs is mediated in part by lipophagy or the autophagic targeting of LDs for lysosomal degradation (10.Singh R. Kaushik S. Wang Y. Xiang Y. Novak I. Komatsu M. Tanaka K.

Indeed, several studies from our lab and others have helped define the role of vesicular trafficking mediators such as Rab GTPases in guiding the interaction of LDs with autophagic membranes as a requirement for LD catabolism under nutrient starvation (12.Rasineni K.

In addition to lipophagy, however, many cell types catabolize LDs through the action of cytosolic lipases that interact and function directly on the LD monolayer (18.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S.

This lipolytic machinery is integral to adipocyte function and is regulated largely by β-adrenergic activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, leading to phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), as well as members of the perilipin family of coat proteins that regulate the access of lipases and other regulatory cofactors to the LD (21.Brasaemle D.L.

Perilipin 5 improves hepatic lipotoxicity by inhibiting lipolysis.Hepatology. 2015; 61: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the mechanisms that regulate lipolysis in hepatocytes remain poorly defined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hepatocytes, like adipocytes, also utilize a lipolytic machinery that is activated by β-adrenergic stimuli to break down and subsequently catabolize LDs. We report that β-adrenergic stimulation of hepatocytes using the agonist isoproterenol causes LD loss via the cAMP/PKA pathway. This process requires the cytosolic lipases ATGL and HSL, which are phosphorylated and trafficked to LDs within 60 min of stimulation. Importantly, we find that the activation of this pathway is significantly perturbed in hepatocytes subjected to either chronic or acute EtOH exposure, leading to steatotic cells. We first sought to determine whether LD catabolism is inducible in hepatocytes upon activation of the β-adrenergic (β-AR)/cAMP pathway by testing the effect of cAMP-elevating agents isoproterenol and forskolin on Hep3B hepatoma cells and freshly isolated primary rat hepatocytes. Isoproterenol is a selective agonist for β-AR receptors, a class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that stimulates cAMP elevation through Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. Forskolin is a direct and potent activator of adenylyl cyclase and served as a GPCR-independent positive control for cAMP elevation. To test the effect of β-AR stimulation on LD catabolism, Hep3B cells were first loaded with oleic acid (150 μm, 16 h) to induce the formation of LDs, then washed, and chased in oleic acid-free, full-serum medium (10% FBS) in the presence or absence of the isoproterenol (50 μm). As seen in confocal images from Fig. 1 (A and A′), isoproterenol-treated cells had a marked reduction in LDs after just 4 h. Quantification revealed a 33% reduction in total LD area per cell during this time (n = 7 experiments; *, p < 0.05). Interestingly, the effect of isoproterenol on Hep3B LDs was selective to larger-sized LDs (>2 μm2) relative to the overall LD population, in which a significant 44% reduction was observed, whereas there was no significant reduction in smaller sized LDs (0–2 μm2; supplemental Fig. S1A). Similar results were observed in primary rat hepatocytes. Following hepatocyte isolation, the cells were equilibrated in regular growth medium (no oleic acid) on collagen-coated glass coverslips for 24 h before treatment with cAMP agonists. As seen in confocal images and quantification in Fig. 1 (C and D), isoproterenol caused a 22% reduction in total LD area per cell, and direct cAMP elevation by forskolin + IBMX caused an even more dramatic 48% loss over the course of 24 h. As observed in the Hep3B cells, the agonist-induced LD loss in primary rat hepatocytes was preferential to relatively larger-sized LDs (>5 μm2), where we observed a 36 and 68% loss by isoproterenol and forskolin + IBMX, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1B). These data demonstrate that LD breakdown in hepatocytes is inducible by β-AR stimulation and that cAMP elevation is a potent stimulus for LD catabolism. Isoproterenol is a widely used agonist for β-AR stimulation and triggers the canonical activation of PKA downstream of cAMP elevation in many cells and tissues. To confirm in our hepatocyte cell models that the cAMP/PKA pathway was indeed being activated by isoproterenol, we used quantitative FRET microscopy and Western blot analysis to establish the potency and time course of PKA activation following treatment. First, we transfected Hep3B cells with the FRET-based PKA biosensor AKAR4, which was targeted to the cytosol by a C-terminal nuclear export sequence (NES). This biosensor has been thoroughly characterized as a highly specific indicator of subcellular PKA activation in live cells and in real time (30.Depry C. Allen M.D. Zhang J. Visualization of PKA activity in plasma membrane microdomains.Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Upon cAMP elevation, activated PKA phosphorylates the AKAR4 biosensor, resulting in a real-time increase in AKAR4 FRET intensity, whereas the CFP donor fluorescence decreases simultaneously and thus can be measured as a ratio of FRET/CFP (supplemental Fig. S2). As seen in Fig. 2, representative ratiometric images depicting FRET/CFP show PKA activity levels before treatment and at 5 min post-treatment with cAMP agonists. At 5 min, both 50 μm isoproterenol (Fig. 2, A and A′) and 10 μm forskolin (Fig. 2, C and C′) caused a substantial elevation in PKA activity as detected by an increase in the ratio of FRET/CFP. Quantification of this increase showed a 14% increase in PKA activity by isoproterenol (Fig. 2B) and an even more substantial 45% increase by forskolin (Fig. 2D). Consistent with this, we also treated primary rat hepatocytes with cAMP-elevating agents to detect the presence of PKA-phosphorylated substrates by Western blot analysis using an antibody raised against a PKA-specific phosphorylated amino acid motif (RRX(pS/T)). As seen in Fig. 2E, Western blot analysis of cell lysates treated for 1 h with either 50 μm isoproterenol or 10 μm forskolin + 0.5 mm IBMX showed an increase in the number and intensity of PKA-phosphorylated substrates. As expected, forskolin was more potent than isoproterenol in its ability to activate PKA, which is consistent with FRET biosensor findings and the relative potency of these agonists to induce LD breakdown in primary rat hepatocytes, as was observed in Fig. 1. Given that isoproterenol activated the cAMP/PKA pathway in our hepatocyte models, we reasoned that this pathway was also responsible for mediating the loss in LD content following stimulation. To test this, we treated primary rat hepatocytes with isoproterenol in the presence and absence of H89, a potent pharmacological agent that inhibits PKA. As seen in Fig. 3 (A, A′, and A′), 50 μm isoproterenol treatment for 24 h caused a nearly 40% reduction in LD area per cell in the absence of the inhibitor. (n = 3, p < 0.05). However, in the presence of H89, isoproterenol caused no reduction in LD area per cell, suggesting that β-AR stimulation of hepatocytes results in LD loss via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Based on adipocyte studies, it is well established that the cAMP/PKA pathway mediates LD breakdown through the process of lipolysis, in which PKA activates and recruits cytosolic lipases ATGL and HSL from the cytosol to the LD surface, thus allowing for the hydrolysis of free fatty acids from glycerol and sterol ester backbones (7.Brasaemle D.L.

To test the contribution of the lipolysis pathway in isoproterenol-induced LD breakdown, pretreatment for 2 h with the ATGL inhibitor atglistatin (10 μm; Fig. 3, C, C′, and C′) or the HSL inhibitor CAY10499 (10 μm; Fig. 3, D, D′, and D′) each prevented LD breakdown following isoproterenol treatment (50 μm, 24 h), suggesting that in addition to PKA activation, cytosolic lipase activity is involved in LD breakdown following β-AR stimulation in hepatocytes. Importantly, both ATGL and HSL are known to be phosphorylated in response to PKA activity, and this stimulates both lipase activation and recruitment to the LD (7.Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L.

To test whether ATGL and HSL are phosphorylated downstream of isoproterenol treatment in hepatocytes, we probed their phosphorylation states by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies. As seen in Fig. 3E, we detected an increase in HSL phosphorylation (Ser-660) in primary rat hepatocytes within 1 h of isoproterenol treatment. However, pretreatment with H89 (10 μm, 2 h) completely blocked isoproterenol-induced HSL phosphorylation, suggesting that β-AR stimulation caused HSL phosphorylation in a PKA-dependent manner. As a positive control, direct cAMP elevation by 10 μm forskolin + 0.5 mm IBMX resulted in a substantial increase in phosphorylated HSL (Fig. 3E). In agreement with this, we observed a similar pattern of ATGL phosphorylation in Hep3B cells that were pretreated overnight with 10 μm H89 to reduce basal phospho-ATGL levels, then washed, and treated for 4 h with cAMP-elevating agents. As seen in Fig. 3F, 50 μm isoproterenol treatment increased ATGL phosphorylation (Ser-404), but this effect was not observed in cells stimulated with isoproterenol in the presence of H89 during the 4-h treatment. In addition, cAMP elevation by forskolin + IBMX also increased ATGL phosphorylation. These data suggest that hepatocyte β-ARs stimulate lipolysis through the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cytosolic lipases HSL and ATGL. The process of lipolysis is in large part regulated by the spatial recruitment of lipases from the cytoplasm to the LD surface. To test whether β-AR stimulation in hepatocytes alters the spatial distribution of cytosolic lipases, we examined the effect of forskolin and isoproterenol treatment on ATGL and HSL localization. First, we tested the recruitment of endogenous ATGL to LDs by Western blotting of isolated LDs in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells, a hepatocyte model that is commonly used for isolating hepatocellular LDs because of high levels of baseline LD content (6.Fujimoto Y.

As seen in Fig. 4 (A and B), ATGL was detected in both the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) and in isolated LDs under DMSO control conditions. Upon treatment with forskolin (10 μm, 1 h), we observed a significant 31% increase in LD-enriched ATGL levels relative to Plin2 (n = 3, p < 0.05). To further test the trafficking of ATGL to the LD in real-time, we used live-cell microscopy of Hep3B cells expressing an EGFP-tagged ATGL(S47A) mutant construct. The S47A mutation blocks the fatty-acid hydrolysis activity of ATGL (19.Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L. ATGL has a key role in lipid droplet/adiposome degradation in mammalian cells.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which allowed us to visualize the spatial dynamics of the lipase while avoiding the implicit reduction of LD levels caused by overexpression of active ATGL. Importantly, the cAMP-induced spatial dynamics we observed in the S47A mutant were confirmed using WT ATGL-EGFP (supplemental Movie S1). As seen in Fig. 4 (C and C′), treatment with isoproterenol increased ATGL(S47A)-EGFP intensity around LDs that were labeled with MDH, a LD-specific dye. The redistribution of ATGL from the cytoplasm to the LD was more graphically seen in pseudocolored heat map images depicting the fluorescence intensity of the EGFP channel (Fig. 4, E and E′), whereby we observed a substantial decrease in cytosolic ATGL intensity (yellow arrows) while ATGL intensity around the LDs simultaneously increased. To quantify these changes across multiple cells, we measured the EGFP fluorescence intensity within regions of interest surrounding several LDs in each cell before isoproterenol treatment and 60 min after treatment, normalized to cytosolic EGFP fluorescence intensity at each corresponding time point. The ratios of LD/cytosolic EGFP fluorescence intensity before and after treatment were quantified as a fold change in LD-localized EGFP intensity. This analysis revealed a nearly 2-fold increase in lipase localization around the LD following isoproterenol treatment within 60 min (n = 10 cells from three independent experiments; *, p < 0.05). To test whether direct cAMP elevation had a similar effect, cells treated with 10 μm forskolin also showed a significant increase in ATGL(S47A)-EGFP intensity around the LD within 60 min, but this effect was blocked by 2-h pretreatment with 10 μm H89 (n = 13–14 cells from three independent experiments; *, p < 0.05). We also tested the effects of these agonists on a superfolder GFP (sfGFP)-tagged HSL construct (HSL-sfGFP) expressed in Hep3B cells. As seen in Fig. 5, isoproterenol caused a ∼50% increase in HSL localization around the LD, a more modest redistribution compared with that of ATGL, within just 30 min of treatment (n = 13 cells from three independent experiments; *, p < 0.05).

In this study, we applied an eDNA method to estimate the distribution of the Japanese clawed salamander, Onychodactylus japonicus, in headwater streams. Additionally, we compared the detection of eDNA and hand-capturing methods used for determining the distribution of O. japonicus. For eDNA detection, we designed a qPCR primer/probe set for O. japonicus using the 12S rRNA region. We detected the eDNA of O. japonicus at all sites (with the exception of one), where we also observed them by hand-capturing. Additionally, we detected eDNA at two sites where we were unable to observe individuals using the hand-capturing method. Moreover, we found that eDNA concentrations and detection rates of the two water sampling areas (stream surface and under stones) were not significantly different, although the eDNA concentration in the water under stones was more varied than that on the surface. We, therefore, conclude that eDNA methods could be used to determine the distribution of macroorganisms inhabiting headwater systems by using samples collected from the surface of the water."

Abnormal regulation of the FGFR1-Klotho receptor complex may cause a resistance to the phosphaturic action of FGF23. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the regulation of renal Klotho and FGF receptor (FEFR)-1 in healthy and uremic rats induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. In normal rats, the infusion of rat recombinant FGF23 enhanced phosphaturia and increased renal FGFR1 expression; however, Klotho expression was reduced. Uremic rats on a highphosphate (HP) diet presented hyperphosphatemia with marked elevation of FGF23 and an increased fractional excretion of phosphate (P) that was associated with a marked reduction of Klotho expression and an increase in FGFR1. After neutralization of FGF23 by anti-FGF23 administration, phosphaturia was still abundant, Klotho expression remained low, and the FGFR1 level was reduced. These results suggest that the expression of renal Klotho is modulated by phosphaturia, whereas the FGFR1 expression is regulated by FGF23. Calcitriol (CTR) administration prevented a decrease in renal Klotho expression. In HEK293 cells HP produced nuclear translocation of β-cateniv together with a reduction in Klotho. Wnt/β-catenin inhibition with Dkk-1 prevented the P-induced down-regulation of Klotho. The addition of CTR to HP medium was able to recover Klotho expression. In summary, high FGF23 levels increase FGFR1, whereas phosphaturia decreases Klotho expression through the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.—Muñoz-Castañeda, J.

https://openalex.org/W2614142082,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene, resulting in production of a truncated farnesylated-prelamin A protein (progerin). We previously reported that XPA mislocalized to the progerin-induced DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites, blocking DSB repair, which led to DSB accumulation, DNA damage responses, and early replication arrest in HGPS. In this study, the XPA mislocalization to DSBs occurred at stalled or collapsed replication forks, concurrent with a significant loss of PCNA at the forks, whereas PCNA efficiently bound to progerin. This PCNA sequestration likely exposed ds-ssDNA junctions at replication forks for XPA binding. Depletion of XPA or progerin each significantly restored PCNA at replication forks. Our results suggest that although PCNA is much more competitive than XPA in binding replication forks, PCNA sequestration by progerin may shift the equilibrium to favor XPA binding. Furthermore, we demonstrated that progerin-induced apoptosis could be rescued by XPA, suggesting that XPA-replication fork binding may prevent apoptosis in HGPS cells. Our results propose a mechanism for progerin-induced genome instability and accelerated replicative senescence in HGPS.—Hilton, B. A., Liu, J., Cartwright, B.

They are ubiquitous in modern technology (pharmaceuticals, coatings), consumer products (foams, emulsions) and also serve vital biological functions (tear film of the eye, pulmonary surfactants in the lung). A common feature in all these examples is the presence of surface-active molecules at the air-liquid interface. Though they form only molecular-thin layers, these surfactants produce complex surface stresses on the free surface, which have important consequences for the dynamics and stability of the underlying thin liquid film. Here we conduct simple thinning experiments to explore the fundamental mechanisms that allow the surfactant molecules to slow the gravity-driven drainage of the underlying film. We present a simple model that works for both soluble and insoluble surfactant systems in the limit of negligible adsorption-desorption dynamics. We show that surfactants with finite surface rheology influence bulk flow through viscoelastic interfacial stresses, while surfactants with inviscid surfaces achieve stability through opposing surface-tension induced Marangoni flows."

One of the ways by which the host immune system fights M. tuberculosis infection is by mounting an inflammatory reaction that results in the formation of granulomas (1Russell D.G. Cardona P.J.

A subset of the invading pathogens utilize the host granulomas to its advantage, surviving within these structures for a prolonged time and resurrecting upon sensing a weakened host immune system (4Zahrt T.C.

In the recent years, studies revealed that M. tuberculosis accumulates triacylglycerol (TAG) in hypoxic environments (9Low K.L. Rao P.S. Shui G. Bendt A.K. Pethe K. Dick T. Wenk M.R. Triacylglycerol utilization is required for regrowth of in vitro hypoxic nonreplicating Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin.J.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses host triacylglycerol to accumulate lipid droplets and acquires a dormancy-like phenotype in lipid-loaded macrophages.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002093Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The bulk of these accumulated TAGs are synthesized by bacterial TAG synthase utilizing fatty acids, including host-derived fatty acids. Of note, within granulomas of TB patients, a distinctive population of lipid-laden macrophages, designated foamy macrophages, contains TAG-filled lipid droplets (13Peyron P. Vaubourgeix J. Poquet Y. Levillain F. Botanch C. Bardou F. Daffé M. Emile J.F. Marchou B. Cardona P.J. de Chastellier C. Altare F. Foamy macrophages from tuberculous patients' granulomas constitute a nutrient-rich reservoir for M. tuberculosis persistence.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000204Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These lipid droplets likely provide lipid-rich microenvironments for M. tuberculosis. However, it remains unclear how some host lipids are cleaved before their fatty acid components are imported into the bacteria. A substantial answer addressing this will help better our understanding of latent TB biology. In an effort to address this question, we chose to study the hydrolytic enzymes that were perceived to be secreted from M. tuberculosis. In this respect, a literature survey led to the finding of a report suggesting that M. tuberculosis harbors approximately half a dozen such enzymes (14Målen H. Berven F.S. Fladmark K.E. Wiker H.G. Comprehensive analysis of exported proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.Proteomics. 2007; 7: 1702-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Subsequently, most of these proteins were studied in detail by other groups (15Lun S. Bishai W.R.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2014; 34: 686-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, none of these molecules are associated with the host lipid catabolism. In the present work, using a multiscale approach that comprises in silico, in vitro, and ex vivo studies, we show that a mycobacterial gene, Rv2672, of hitherto unknown function encodes a secretory protein that exhibits both protease and lipase activities, catalyzes the hydrolysis of host lipids, and is up-regulated in M. tuberculosis in an in vitro model of latency and a mouse model of M. tuberculosis infection. Based on these functions, we propose its name as mycobacterial secreted hydrolase 1 (Msh1). Furthermore, we show that msh1 is not essential for M. tuberculosis growth in culture medium in vitro; however, an ex vivo study in foamy macrophages with wild-type and Rv2672 knockdown (KD) strains showed the importance of this enzyme in facilitating growth of the pathogen in lipid-rich hypoxic environments. To map the pervasiveness of Msh1 and to derive insight into the structural features it encompasses, bioinformatics approaches were used. A search, using BLASTP, to identify the homologs of Msh1 in the currently available sequence databases showed that Msh1 is conserved only in actinomycetes, particularly among mycolic acid-containing taxa such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and Nocardia (Fig. 1A). Mycolic acid-containing bacteria represent a unique phyletic cluster in the evolutionary classification of actinomycetes, which encompasses several pathogenic strains that pose a threat to human health. Furthermore, a comparative amino acid sequence analysis of Msh1 revealed that it shares as high as ∼60% identity with its homologs in the genus Mycobacterium (Fig. 1A). However, it shares a moderate (<30%) identity with homologs from other higher organisms. Msh1 comprises 528 amino acids that include an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a lipobox motif, LAAC, at positions 27–30 (Fig. 1B). A search in the conserved domain database (19Marchler-Bauer A. Derbyshire M.K. Gonzales N.R. Lu S. Chitsaz F. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. He J. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Marchler G.H. Song J.S. Thanki N. et al.CDD: NCBI's conserved domain database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D222-D226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar) to find whether Msh1 possesses conserved functional domain(s) revealed that Msh1 contains two α/β-hydrolase domains, one (Domain A) with putative protease functionality and the other (Domain B) a putative lipase (Fig. 1B). The presence of a signal peptide in Msh1 with a lipobox motif prompted us to investigate different subcellular fractions to determine its localization, which will further help in identifying its physiological substrate(s) and determining its plausible biological function. For this purpose, recombinant Msh1 was prepared by overexpressing Msh1 in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc24517 system followed by purification to a high degree of homogeneity (Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequently, polyclonal antibody against the Msh1 was raised in rabbit using the standard protocol. Subcellular fractions of the whole-cell lysate of M. tuberculosis were prepared using multistep centrifugation, and the presence of Msh1 in these fractions was examined by immunoblotting. The results clearly demonstrated that Msh1 is present in all the fractions (cytoplasm, cell envelope, and culture filtrate). Of note, the presence in the culture filtrate confirms secretion of Msh1 in the extracellular environments. Interestingly, analysis of the corresponding cell fractions of M. smegmatis, an avirulent counterpart of M. tuberculosis, showed that Msh1 homolog MSMEG_2786 in M. smegmatis is confined to cytosolic and cell envelope fractions only (Fig. 2C). To obtain the first insight into the function of Msh1, in vitro assays were set up to examine lipase and protease activities as predicted by the bioinformatics studies. Proteolytic activity was examined using a universal protease substrate, β-casein (Sigma), and different concentrations of the Msh1. Msh1 cleaved the substrate into smaller size fragments (Fig. 2D), confirming that it indeed exhibits a protease activity. Furthermore, to determine whether Msh1 hydrolyzes esters, an enzymatic assay was performed using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (NPP) (C16:0) as the substrate (Fig. 2E). The enzyme activity follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km, Vmax, and Kcat values of 3898 ± 298 μm, 1.5 ± 0.16 μm min−1, and 274 ± 34 s−1, respectively. Values of these kinetic parameters lie within the range of those of the reported lipases (20Guo J. Chen C.P. Wang S.G. Huang X.J. A convenient test for lipase activity in aqueous-based solutions.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2015; 71: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Pencreac'h G. Baratti J.C.

Technol. 1996; 18: 417-422Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether Msh1 is indeed a lipase, we performed assays with lipase-specific substrates tributyrin (composed of butyric acid (C4:0) and glycerol) and triolein (made up of oleic acid (C18:1) and glycerol) that are unfavorable for hydrolysis by esterases. The results (Fig. 2F) of these experiments clearly demonstrated that Msh1 exhibits significant levels of hydrolysis of these substrates, confirming its function as a lipase. Moreover, the inhibition of Msh1 lipase activity by orlistat, a well known lipase inhibitor, further validated our claim (Fig. 2G). We then showed that Domain A exhibits protease activity, but the plausible lipase activity of Domain B could not be tested as the required amount of protein could not be prepared because of poor overexpression of this domain. However, as a whole enzyme, Msh1 exhibits both lipase and protease activities. After establishing that Msh1 is secreted and exhibits distinctive lipase activity, we next asked whether Msh1 hydrolyzes host-derived lipids. To assess this, total lipids were extracted from macrophages RAW 264.7 and incubated with Msh1 for 2 or 4 h at 37 °C followed by analysis of hydrolyzed products using TLC (Fig. 3A). As evident from Fig. 3A, Msh1 does exhibit hydrolytic activity against host-derived lipids. Of all the spots corresponding to different lipids belonging to the host lipid pool, the one with an Rf of 0.15 was diminished significantly compared with other spots. Furthermore, we tested the activity, if any, of a well characterized lipoprotein lipase from Pseudomonas species (Sigma) on macrophage lipids. The results showed that, unlike Msh1, the Pseudomonas lipoprotein did not exhibit a noticeable hydrolytic activity against macrophage lipids (Fig. 3B). However, it showed lipase activity for NPP as mentioned earlier (Fig. 2F). These observations suggested that indeed the mycobacterial Msh1 has specificity toward lipids derived from its natural host, macrophages. Hypoxia has long been perceived as a prominent environmental factor that triggers metabolic realignment in bacilli, often inducing latency, quiescence, and increased lipid metabolism (22Deb C. Lee C.-M. Dubey V.S. Daniel J. Abomoelak B. Sirakova T.D. Pawar S. Rogers L. Kolattukudy P.E.

Sohaskey C.D. Nonreplicating persistence of mycobacterium tuberculosis.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Based on the above results, we analyzed whether the expression levels of Msh1 are altered in an in vitro Wayne model of hypoxia (23Wayne L.G. Sohaskey C.D. Nonreplicating persistence of mycobacterium tuberculosis.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Briefly, M. tuberculosis was grown in Sauton's medium with limited aeration in sealed vials for 14 days to gradually establish hypoxic conditions followed by analysis of Msh1 expression in both whole-cell lysates and culture filtrate by anti-Msh1 immunoblotting. In agreement with our hypothesis, expression levels of Msh1 were significantly elevated in both fractions, further substantiating the role of this enzyme under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3, C and D). The host responds to M. tuberculosis infection by inducing the formation of a granuloma, a collection of inflammatory cells including lipid-loaded foamy macrophages, to contain mycobacterial pathogens under hypoxic, nutrient-limited environments. However, M. tuberculosis is able to survive inside granulomatous lesions for long-term periods using nutrients, particularly lipids, derived from the host (24Lovewell R.R. Sassetti C.M. VanderVen B.C. Chewing the fat: Lipid metabolism and homeostasis during M. tuberculosis infection.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2016; 29: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our study reveals that Msh1 is a secretory protein, hydrolyzes host-derived lipids, and is overexpressed under hypoxia. Together, these observations strongly indicate a possible role of Msh1 in the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed Msh1 expression and proliferation of M. tuberculosis in both foamy and normal macrophages. Infection of both macrophage types was performed with M. tuberculosis at an m.o.i. of 10 followed by analysis of Msh1 levels using anti-Msh1 immunoblotting. Notably, an elevated level of Msh1 was observed in foamy macrophage whole-cell extracts compared with its normal counterpart 12 and 24 h postinfection (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, we examined the role of Msh1 in the proliferation of M. tuberculosis within the foamy macrophages. For this, an Rv2672 KD strain of M. tuberculosis was generated (Fig. 4B). No significant difference was observed in bacterial growth of the wild-type and the Rv2672 KD strains in culture medium (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, normal and foamy macrophages were infected separately with wild-type and Rv2672 KD strains of M. tuberculosis at an m.o.i. of 10. Bacillary load was examined by plating macrophage lysates prepared 12 and 24 h postinfection, respectively. Interestingly, bacterial loads of the native and the Rv2672 KD strains were largely similar in normal macrophages, whereas there was a significant difference in bacterial counts of Rv2672 KD relative to the control strain in lipid-rich foamy macrophages, particularly at the 24-h time point (Fig. 4D). Overall, these results clearly suggest that the presence of Msh1 augments the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in lipid-rich intracellular environments. To decipher the expression profile of Msh1 in the granulomatous lesions in vivo, we analyzed its expression in mouse lungs following M. tuberculosis infection. BALB/c mice were infected with wild-type M. tuberculosis by the aerosol route, and lungs were harvested after 28 and 56 days of infection. Subsequently, expression levels of Msh1 were checked by Western blotting using lung homogenates. As depicted in Fig. 4E, a significant level of Msh1 was observed in mouse lung homogenates 56 days postinfection when granulomas were distinctly visible. Msh1 was up-regulated by ∼12-fold with respect to day 1 as analyzed using ImageJ (25Abràmoff M.D. Magalhães P.J. Ram S.J. Image processing with ImageJ.Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with our previous observations, clearly indicating that Msh1 is important for M. tuberculosis to meet its energy requirement at latent stages of intracellular growth. M. tuberculosis has infected 2 billion of the global population in the form of latent infection. Reactivation presents a major problem in curbing TB infections, particularly in high-burden nations. Although the current drug regimen is effective against actively replicating bacteria, this set of drugs is proven ineffective to control the increasing burden of TB cases due to their inability to eradicate latent infections. Over the course of many millennia, M. tuberculosis has developed strategies to outsmart the agents of host armamentarium, a notable one being hypoxia. For survival under such environments that essentially reduce the aerobic efficiency, the pathogen tends to use host-derived lipids/fatty acids as a major source of nutrition (24Lovewell R.R. Sassetti C.M. VanderVen B.C. Chewing the fat: Lipid metabolism and homeostasis during M. tuberculosis infection.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2016; 29: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, delineating the molecular mechanism underlying host lipid hydrolysis is an important area to address. The present study, which dissects the function of a novel enzyme, Msh1, of M. tuberculosis, sheds the first insight into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, which is relevant in many aspects. The finding that Msh1 is conserved exclusively in actinomycetes suggests that these organisms have developed a unique common trait during the course of evolution, potentially to survive in harsh host environments. Msh1 is a bifunctional enzyme with distinct protease and lipase domains. The present study deciphered that M. tuberculosis does require Msh1 for its growth in a hypoxic macrophage model. Because survival in these environments requires host lipids (24Lovewell R.R. Sassetti C.M. VanderVen B.C. Chewing the fat: Lipid metabolism and homeostasis during M. tuberculosis infection.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2016; 29: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the pertinence of Msh1 lipase activity is understood; however, the relevance of protease activity in Msh1 needs to be examined. Moreover, the up-regulation of Msh1 in a hypoxic macrophage model and a mouse model of TB infection clearly demonstrated that M. tuberculosis requires Msh1 for its persistence in stress conditions, such as granulomas filled with lipid-loaded macrophages. On the basis of the results of the present study combined with available literature data, we propose a model (Fig. 5) depicting how M. tuberculosis likely manages to use host lipids for its advantage. Primarily, in hypoxic stress situation, it uses Msh1 to hydrolyze host lipids and takes up the lipid-derived fatty acids into its cytoplasm through fatty acid transport proteins. The import of these fatty acids replenishes the bacillary cytoplasmic lipid reservoir. Furthermore, it is likely that M. tuberculosis re-esterifies these fatty acids into TAG mainly by its intracellular TAG synthase and/or likely uses these fatty acids to generate other lipids. In conclusion, the functional characterization of Msh1, which provides the first-ever insight into the host lipid catabolism by an M. tuberculosis enzyme, augments the current understanding of the persistence strategies latent M. tuberculosis uses. These results together suggest that Rv2672 is a potential molecular drug target. Abolishing its function by small molecule compounds could open up new strategies to combat latent M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the trait that Rv2672 is overexpressed in hypoxic environments opens up the possibility that it could be a useful biomarker for latent TB diagnosis. Future studies to address whether M. tuberculosis contains additional factor(s) involved in this important metabolic process would shed further insight into the host lipid catabolism.

The progression and pseudoprogression groups were then unblinded and supervised feature selection was performed using MFs, size and signal intensity features. A support vector machine model was obtained and evaluated using a prospective test cohort.The model gave a classification accuracy, using a combination of MFs and size features, of more than 85% in both retrospective and prospective datasets. A different feature selection method (Random Forest) and classifier (Lasso) gave the same results. Although not apparent to the reporting radiologist, the T2-weighted hyperintensity phenotype of those patients with progression was heterogeneous, large and frond-like when compared to those with pseudoprogression.Analysis of heterogeneity, in T2-weighted MR images, which are acquired routinely in the clinic, has the potential to detect an earlier treatment response allowing an early change in treatment strategy.

https://openalex.org/W2614543182,"How each metalloprotein assembles the correct metal at the proper binding site presents challenges to the cell. The di-iron enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) uses a diferric-tyrosyl radical (FeIII2-Y•) cofactor to initiate nucleotide reduction. Assembly of this cofactor requires O2, FeII, and a reducing equivalent. Recent studies show that RNR cofactor biosynthesis shares the same source of iron, in the form of [2Fe-2S]-GSH2 from the monothiol glutaredoxin Grx3/4, and the same electron source, in the form of the Dre2-Tah18 electron transfer chain, with the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) machinery required for maturation of [4Fe-4S] clusters in cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Here, we further investigated the interplay between the formation of the FeIII2-Y• cofactor in RNR and the cellular iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein biogenesis pathways by examining both the iron loading into the RNR β subunit and the RNR catalytic activity in yeast mutants depleted of individual components of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) and the CIA machineries. We found that both iron loading and cofactor assembly in RNR are dependent on the ISC machinery. We also found that Dre2 is required for RNR cofactor formation but appears to be dispensable for iron loading. None of the CIA components downstream of Dre2 was required for RNR cofactor formation. Thus, the pathways for RNR and Fe-S cluster biogenesis bifurcate after the Dre2-Tah18 step.

Iron is an essential element for all eukaryotes because of its role as a redox-active cofactor in many fundamental biological reactions including respiration, ribosomal biogenesis, DNA replication, and repair. Many cytosolic and nuclear enzymes use iron as a cofactor in the form of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) 4The abbreviations used are: Fe-Siron-sulfur clusterRNRribonucleotide reductaseISCiron-sulfur cluster assemblyCIAcytosolic iron-sulfur protein assemblyRT-qPCRreverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCRFeIII2-Y•diferric-tyrosyl radical. clusters, heme, mono-iron, and di-iron. Given the abundance of metalloproteins in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes, a main challenge for the cell is to load the Fe2+ onto the proper binding site and convert it to into the active forms (1Waldron K.J.

One family of di-iron enzymes is the class Ia ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). RNRs catalyze the conversion of ribonucleoside 5′-diphosphates (NDPs) to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides in some prokaryotes and all eukaryotes, providing the monomeric building blocks for DNA replication and repair (2Nordlund P. Reichard P. Ribonucleotide reductases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 3Hofer A. Crona M. Logan D.T. Sjöberg B.M. DNA building blocks: Keeping control of manufacture.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All class Ia RNRs utilize a diferric-tyrosyl radical (FeIII2-Y•) metallocofactor to catalyze the nucleotide reduction reaction. The level of the tyrosyl radical (Y•) of the FeIII2-Y• cofactor is directly correlated with the catalytic activity of the RNR enzyme (4Huang M. Parker M.J. Stubbe J.

The RNR holoenzyme consists of α and β subunits with a likely active quaternary structure of (α2)m(β2)n (6Cotruvo J.A. Stubbe J. Class I ribonucleotide reductases: Metallocofactor assembly and repair in vitro and in vivo.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 733-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subunit α contains the active site where NDPs are reduced and the allosteric effector-binding sites that control substrate specificity and overall activity. Subunit β houses the FeIII2-Y• cofactor that is assembled from FeII, O2, and a reducing equivalent. Structural and biochemical studies of Escherichia coli α2 and β2 support a mechanism in which the Y• in β is required for the reversible oxidation, over a distance of 35 Å, of a conserved cysteine within the active site of α into a transient thiyl radical, which initiates the nucleotide reduction reaction (7Minnihan E.C.

Previous biochemical studies of the E. coli NrdB (β2) as well as other eukaryotic β2s have demonstrated that the FeIII2-Y• cofactor can be generated in vitro by self-assembly from apo-β2, FeII, and O2, with FeII serving as both the metal ligand and the source of the obligatory reducing equivalent (Fig. 1A) (4Huang M.

Moreover, the self-assembly process is difficult to control and of varying efficiency, pointing to the importance of a regulated and catalyzed biosynthesis pathway in vivo. The RNR of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an excellent model system for studying the proteins involved in the RNR metallocofactor biosynthesis. S. cerevisiae RNR has two β isoforms, Rnr2 (β) and Rnr4 (β′), which readily form the active ββ′ heterodimer from apo-β2 and apo-β′2 (5Perlstein D.L. Ge J. Ortigosa A.D. Robblee J.H. Zhang Z. Huang M.

Dre2 contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster and a [4Fe-4S] cluster. In vivo, Dre2 forms a complex with the diflavin reductase Tah18, thus constituting an electron-transfer chain in which electrons are relayed from NADPH via the FAD- and FMN-containing Tah18 to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of Dre2 (19Netz D.J.

Biol. 2010; 6: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to being essential to RNR cofactor formation, Grx3/4 and Dre2-Tah18 are also required for cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly pathway (CIA). The CIA pathway is responsible for biogenesis of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in many cytosolic and nuclear proteins that function in divergent processes such as ribosome maturation, tRNA modification, and DNA replication and repair (21Netz D.J.

Biogenesis of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur proteins and their role in genome stability.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1853: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The first step of CIA involves formation of a transient [4Fe-4S] cluster on the scaffold protein complex Cfd1-Nbp35, which requires a sulfur-containing compound synthesized by the mitochondrial Fe-S cluster assembly (ISC) machinery and exported via the mitochondrial inner membrane ABC transporter Atm1 (Fig. 1B). In addition, CIA requires Grx3/4 function and reducing equivalents from Dre2-Tah18 (21Netz D.J. Mascarenhas J. Stehling O. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur proteins.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Dre2-Tah18 electron donor complex acts at an early step in CIA, and is required for the generation of the N-terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster of Nbp35 (19Netz D.J. Stümpfig M. Doré C. Mühlenhoff U. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Tah18 transfers electrons to Dre2 in cytosolic iron-sulfur protein biogenesis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have established that the formations of two different iron-containing cofactors, the FeIII2-Y• of RNR and the [4Fe-4S] cluster in cytosolic and nuclear proteins, share the requirement of Grx3/4, likely as an iron donor, and of Dre2-Tah18 as the source of electrons. In this work, we further investigate the connection between the two processes. In particular, we asked whether iron loading and/or radical cofactor formation in RNR is dependent on specific components of the ISC or CIA machinery. Our results indicate that the ISC machinery, together with Grx3/4, is essential for both iron loading and radical cofactor formation in RNR. In contrast, the CIA components are dispensable for these steps with the exception of Dre2 that supplies electrons for RNR cofactor formation, downstream of the iron-loading step. To determine the contribution of the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S biogenesis machineries to the radical cofactor assembly process in RNR, we examined the effects of depletion of individual components of the ISC and CIA on the catalytic activity of ββ′ by a previously developed permeabilized cell-based RNR activity assay (14Zhang Y. Liu L. Wu X. An X. Stubbe J. Huang M. Investigation of in vivo diferric tyrosyl radical formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rnr2 protein: Requirement of Rnr4 and contribution of Grx3/4 AND Dre2 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41499-41509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Toward this end, individual ISC and CIA genes were placed under the control of the glucose-repressible GAL1 promoter by homologous recombination-based replacement of the native promoters at their respective chromosomal loci (23Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). These strains were grown in rich media containing either galactose (YPGal, GAL promoter-on) or glucose (YPD, GAL promoter-off) for 40 h before being harvested for assays of RNR ββ′ catalytic activity in the presence of an excess of the α subunit. Wild-type cells grown in YPD exhibited 70% of the RNR activity compared with growth in YPGal (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our previous report (14Zhang Y. Liu L. Wu X. An X. Stubbe J. Huang M. Investigation of in vivo diferric tyrosyl radical formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rnr2 protein: Requirement of Rnr4 and contribution of Grx3/4 AND Dre2 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41499-41509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), GalDRE2 cells grown in YPD only had 15% of the RNR activity as those grown in YPGal. Under the same growth conditions, all six Gal-ISC and Gal-CIA mutants characterized exhibited various degrees of reduction in RNR activity (Fig. 2A). The differences in the ββ′ activity may reflect the severely decreased β and β′ protein levels in the Gal-ISC and Gal-CIA mutants (Fig. 2B). As observed previously Dre2-depleted cells had a significantly reduced β protein level (16Zhang Y. Li H.R. Zhang C.G. An X.X. Liu L.L. Stubbe J. Huang M.X. Conserved electron donor complex Dre2-Tah18 is required for ribonucleotide reductase metallocofactor assembly and DNA synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E1695-E1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore corrected the Rnr2 activity results for β protein levels. The resulting relative Rnr2 activities fell into two groups: those for GalNFS1 and GalATM1 cells were lower than those for GalDRE2 cells, whereas those for GalCFD1, GalNBP35, GalNAR1, and GalCIA1 cells were much higher (Fig. 2C). The correction for Rnr2 protein levels seemed justified because its decrease was mainly because of a lower transcription of the RNR2 gene and thus lower mRNA levels (Fig. 2D). Our recent study had shown that the decrease in Rnr2 and Rnr4 mRNA levels in the GalDRE2 mutant is partially because of Cth1/2-mediated mRNA degradation (16Zhang Y. Li H.R. Zhang C.G. An X.X. Liu L.L. Stubbe J. Huang M.X. Conserved electron donor complex Dre2-Tah18 is required for ribonucleotide reductase metallocofactor assembly and DNA synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E1695-E1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results provided a first hint that the later CIA components may not play a major role in RNR cofactor biogenesis. We searched for an experimental condition under which the Rnr2/4 levels do not alter strongly. From previous work, we knew that under iron-limiting conditions the Rnr2 levels hardly change (15Mühlenhoff U. Molik S. Godoy J.R. Uzarska M.A. Richter N. Seubert A. Zhang Y. Stubbe J. Pierrel F. Herrero E. Lillig C.H. Lill R. Cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins function in intracellular iron sensing and trafficking via their bound iron-sulfur cluster.Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We therefore repeated the experiment of Fig, 2 and grew the cells in the synthetic iron-free instead of rich medium, with either galactose (GAL-on) or glucose (GAL-off) as the sole carbon source, for 40 h before harvesting them for RNR activity assay and protein analysis. Protein blotting revealed more consistent Rnr2 protein levels across the strains under both GAL-on and GAL-off conditions when cells were iron-starved, although the levels were still slightly lower in the Gal mutants relative to the wild-type under GAL-off conditions (Fig. 3A). Hardly any variation in RNR activity (5.01–5.67 nmol dCDP/A600 cells) was found among the wild-type and Gal strains under iron-free and GAL-on conditions (Fig. 3B), as opposed to the high variation (11.9–22.8 nmol dCDP/A600 cells) in the iron-rich and GAL-on (YPGal) medium (Fig. 2A). Under iron-free and GAL-off conditions, RNR activity of these strains clearly fell into two categories. All the Gal-CIA strains with the exception of GalDRE2 had an RNR activity comparable with that of the wild-type. On the contrary, GalDRE2 and the two ISC mutants GalNFS1 and GalATM1 had a drastically diminished RNR activity relative to the wild-type (Fig. 3B). After correction for Rnr2 protein levels, the relative specific activities of ββ′ were drastically lower in cells depleted of Nfs1, Atm1, or Dre2, ranging from 3 to 34% of the level of the wild-type under Gal-off conditions (Fig. 3C). By contrast, depletion of the CIA components Cfd1, Nbp35, Nar1, and Cia1 did not cause any decrease in the RNR specific activity. (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results strongly indicated that the assembly of the metallocofactor in RNR, as measured by the catalytic activity of ββ′, requires the mitochondrial ISC system and Dre2, but not the rest of the CIA components downstream of Dre2. Our recent studies have demonstrated that in vivo assembly of the FeIII2-Y• cofactor in β (Rnr2) of the yeast RNR requires Grx3/4 as the source of iron, Dre2-Tah18 as the source of reducing equivalents, as well as β′ (Rnr4) that stabilizes β in a conformation to allow stable iron binding (14Zhang Y.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E1695-E1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One unresolved question was whether the iron loading into β occurs independently of the electron delivery step. Another important issue was the potential involvement of the ISC and CIA machineries in these two steps. Maturation of the electron-transferring [2Fe-2S] cluster in Dre2 is dependent on the ISC and Grx3/4, whereas iron binding of Grx3/4 is independent of Dre2 (15Mühlenhoff U. Molik S. Godoy J.R.

Biol. 2010; 6: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To address which components of the ISC and CIA are required for iron loading into β of the RNR, we used an established 55Fe radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation assay in wild-type, Gal-ISC, and Gal-CIA mutant cells (24Stehling O. Smith P.M. Biederbick A. Balk J. Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Investigation of iron-sulfur protein maturation in eukaryotes.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 55Fe loading into β was decreased 2.5- to 5-fold in the GalNFS1, GalATM1, and GalGRX3/grx4Δ mutants, but was unaffected in the GalDRE2, GalCFD1, GalNBP35, and GalNAR1 mutants relative to the wild-type control (Fig. 4A). To monitor the efficiency of protein depletion in the Gal-ISC and Gal-CIA mutants, we measured in parallel the 55Fe incorporation into Leu1, the cytosolic Fe-S cluster-containing isopropylmalate isomerase. 55Fe loading into Leu1 was greatly diminished in all ISC- and CIA-depleted mutant cells, consistent with the notion that Fe-S cluster assembly in this cytosolic protein depends on both the ISC and CIA machineries (Fig. 4B). The protein levels of Rnr2, Leu1, as well as individual ISC and CIA components being depleted were monitored by Western blotting. The levels of Rnr2 and Leu1 were comparable across the strains except for the marked decrease of Leu1 in the GalGRX3/grx4Δ mutant (Fig. 4C), an observation consistent with earlier findings (15Mühlenhoff U. Molik S. Godoy J.R. Uzarska M.A. Richter N. Seubert A. Zhang Y. Stubbe J. Pierrel F. Herrero E. Lillig C.H. Lill R. Cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins function in intracellular iron sensing and trafficking via their bound iron-sulfur cluster.Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Together, our results indicated that iron loading into RNR was dependent on the ISC but none of the CIA components. We conclude that iron loading into β can occur in the absence of electron delivery from Dre2. The molecular requirements for correct metalation of many metalloenzymes are poorly understood. In this study, we dissected the key steps involved in the assembly of the FeIII2-Y• metallocofactor of the yeast RNR. Based on our previous observation that RNR cofactor assembly and the CIA share the same sources of iron and electron supply, we further examined the requirement of individual ISC and CIA components for RNR iron acquisition and cofactor formation. In particular, we asked whether the steps of iron loading and electron delivery are interdependent during cofactor assembly in RNR or can occur in a stepwise fashion. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, iron loading into RNR is dependent on the mitochondrial ISC system and the previously identified cytosolic Grx3/4, but not on the CIA machinery. Second, the electron donor Dre2 is dispensable for the iron-loading step in RNR cofactor assembly, suggesting that iron can assemble with β relatively stably without being converted to the active cofactor FeIII2-Y• by further electron supply (Fig. 1B). Third, none of the CIA components downstream of Dre2 participates directly in the RNR radical cofactor formation. The requirement of the mitochondrial ISC machinery for iron loading into RNR is likely because of the essential role of ISC in the biogenesis of the cytosolic Fe-S proteins Grx3/4 and Dre2. Their maturation requires the ISC but not the CIA machinery (15Mühlenhoff U. Molik S. Godoy J.R. Uzarska M.A. Richter N. Seubert A. Zhang Y. Stubbe J. Pierrel F. Herrero E. Lillig C.H. Lill R.

Biol. 2010; 6: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed a severe diminution of the RNR activity in ISC- and Dre2-depletion mutants but not in any of the other CIA mutants downstream of Dre2. The increase of RNR ββ′ catalytic activity in CIA-depletion mutants relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 3C) suggests that under iron-limiting conditions, blocking of the CIA pathway may allow for more bioavailable iron to be funneled into RNR, thereby enhancing its cofactor assembly process. This notion was consistent with the observed moderate increase of 55Fe incorporation into the RNR β (15Mühlenhoff U. Molik S. Godoy J.R. Uzarska M.A. Richter N. Seubert A. Zhang Y. Stubbe J. Pierrel F. Herrero E. Lillig C.H. Lill R.

Dre2 (together with its electron supply partner Tah18) (Fig. 1B) stands unique among all the CIA components identified to date because of its dual role as an electron donor both in cytosolic Fe-S protein maturation and in RNR cofactor assembly. It is evident from our studies that Dre2 is essential for assembly of the active FeIII2-Y• cofactor of RNR but dispensable for the initial step of iron loading into β. Iron loading also appears to occur independently of the Dre2-mediated electron-delivery step during the maturation of [4Fe-4S] in cytosolic and nuclear proteins, as depletion of Dre2 leads to an increase in 55Fe incorporation into the CIA scaffold protein Cfd1 but abolishes 55Fe-S insertion in all the rest of the CIA components and downstream substrate proteins (19Netz D.J. Stümpfig M. Doré C. Mühlenhoff U. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Tah18 transfers electrons to Dre2 in cytosolic iron-sulfur protein biogenesis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although Dre2 is unlikely directly involved in the iron loading step mediated by Grx3/4, we cannot rule out the possibility that Dre2 can become critical for loading of the correct metal (e.g. iron versus manganese) into RNR under conditions of skewed cellular metal pools. All yeast strains used for RNR activity assay in this study were of the S288C strain background. GalNFS1, GalATM1, GalCFD1, GalNBP35, GalNAR1, and GalCIA1 strains were constructed in the BY4741 strain (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) and GalDRE2 in BY4742 (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0) by replacing the endogenous promoters with the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter that was marked by HIS3MX6 as described (23Longtine M.S.

Transformants were selected on synthetic complete histidine dropout agar plates (SC-His) containing 1% raffinose and 1% galactose, and confirmed by PCR diagnosis as well as Western blot using specific antibodies recognizing individual CIA and ISC components. The GalGRX4grx3Δ strain was described previously (15Mühlenhoff U. Molik S. Godoy J.R. Uzarska M.A. Richter N. Seubert A. Zhang Y. Stubbe J. Pierrel F. Herrero E. Lillig C.H. Lill R.

The strains used for 55Fe incorporation analysis were of the W303 background. Rich YP medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% of one of the following three carbohydrates as the sole carbon source: glucose (YPD) that represses the GAL1 promoter (GAL-off), raffinose (YP-Raffinose) that keeps the GAL1 promoter at the basal level of transcription activity (uninduced state), or galactose (YPGal) that activates the GAL1 promoter (induced state or GAL-on). Synthetic complete (SC) medium contained 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (YNB) (MP Biomedicals), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 20 amino acids (Sigma) as described (25Burke D. Sawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Press, Long Island, NY2000Google Scholar), and the indicated carbon source. The iron-free medium was based on the SC medium except for the use of an iron-free YNB (Sunrise Science Products). All solid media contained 2% Bacto Agar that was added before autoclaving. Radiolabeling of yeast cells with 55FeCl3 and measurement of 55Fe incorporation into RNR and Leu1 by immunoprecipitation were performed as described (26Pierik A.J. Netz D.J. Lill R.

Cells were harvested from early- to mid-log phase cultures and total RNA was extracted by using a hot-phenol method (27Köhrer K. Domdey H.

First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out by M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs) on aliquots of 1 μg RNA with a random primer mix. The single-stranded cDNA products were used in quantitative PCR on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System based on SYBR Green fluorescence. Sequences of oligonucleotide pairs used were 5′-CCTAAAGAGACCCCTTCCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCTTGTGATTTTCAGCGTC-3′ for RNR2; 5′-CATAAGGCTGCTTTCATCGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGGCCATTGCTAAACC-3′ for RNR4; 5′-GTATGTGTAAAGCCGGTTTTG-3′ and 5′-CATGATACCTTGGTGTCTTGG-3′ for ACT1.

The role of oxidative stress in many diseases supports the possibility that processes that are associated with Nrf2 activation might offer therapeutic potential. Nrf2 deficiency induces osteoclastogenesis, which is responsible for bone loss, by activating receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-mediated signaling; however, the effects of Keap1 deficiency remain unclear. By using Keap1-deficient newborn mice, we observed that talus and calcaneus bone formation was partially retarded and that osteoclast number was reduced in vivo without severe gross abnormalities. In addition, Keap1-deficient macrophages were unable to differentiate into osteoclasts in vitrovia attenuation of RANKL-mediated signaling and expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), a key transcription factor that is involved in osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, Keap1 deficiency up-regulated the expression of Mafb, a negative regulator of NFATc1. RANKL-induced mitochondrial gene expression is required for down-regulation of IFN regulatory factor 8 (IRF-8), a negative transcriptional regulator of NFATc1. Our results indicate that Keap1 deficiency down-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1β and mitochondrial gene expression and up-regulated Irf8 expression.

We show that besides the RR motif, a minimal, functional h-region in the signal peptide is required for Tat-dependent export in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we identified mutations in the h-region that synergistically suppressed the export defect of a TorA[KQ]-30aa-MalE Tat reporter protein in which the RR motif was replaced with a lysine-glutamine pair. Strikingly, all suppressor mutations increased the hydrophobicity of the h-region. By systematically replacing a neutral residue in the h-region with various amino acids, we detected a positive correlation between the hydrophobicity of the h-region and the translocation efficiency of the resulting reporter variants. In vitro cross-linking of residues located in the periplasmically-oriented part of the TatBC receptor to TorA[KQ]-30aa-MalE reporter variants harboring a more hydrophobic h-region in their signal peptides confirmed that unlike in TorA[KQ]-30aa-MalE with an unaltered h-region, the mutated reporters moved deep into the TatBC-binding cavity.

Tat-dependent precursor proteins are targeted to the Tat translocase by N-terminal signal peptides, consisting of a positively charged amino-terminal n-region that harbors the highly conserved Tat consensus motif S/T-R-R-X-F-L-K, a central hydrophobic core (h-region), and a polar carboxyl-terminal c-region containing the signal peptidase recognition site (10Berks B.C.

Various site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the two adjacent twin-arginine residues (RR) within the Tat consensus motif, from which the name of the Tat pathway is derived, are important determinants for the productive recognition and binding of Tat signal peptides by the Tat translocase. Depending on the sensitivity of the reporter system used in the respective studies, even the conservative substitution of the twin-arginines by a lysine pair either significantly reduced or completely abolished transport in most cases (11Stanley N.R.

In Escherichia coli four genes (tatA, tatB, tatC, and tatE) encode the membrane-integral components of the Tat translocase that assemble on demand to form an active translocon. Previous studies revealed that the TatB and TatC components are assembled into higher-order 1:1 complexes in which at least four TatB monomers form a dome-like core structure that is surrounded by an outer ring of TatC molecules, thereby creating a deeply membrane-embedded binding cavity for the Tat substrate (17Blümmel A.S.

Several studies revealed that TatC is primarily responsible for the recognition and binding of the Tat consensus motif present in Tat signal peptides. Using site-directed cross-linking analysis, the cytosolic N terminus and the first cytosolic loop of TatC were shown to contact the signal peptide close to the RR motif in the n-region upon membrane binding. Vice versa, Tat precursors carrying photocross-linkers next to the RR motif were found in close proximity to TatC (13Alami M. Lüke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Müller M.

The cross-links between TatC and the Tat signal peptide were strictly dependent on an intact RR motif and were not obtained when the arginine residues had been replaced by a lysine pair (13Alami M.

Importantly, the interactions between TatC and the precursor did not require the presence of TatB, indicating a hierarchy in the targeting process (13Alami M. Lüke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G.

Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). According to this model and the findings of recent cross-linking studies, TatC acts as the primary substrate receptor that first recognizes the Tat signal peptide via its RR motif. Subsequently, the signal peptide insertase activity of TatC triggers a deep, hairpin loop-like insertion of the signal peptide into an enclosed binding cavity jointly formed by TatB and TatC (37Fincher V. McCaffery M. Cline K. Evidence for a loop mechanism of protein transport by the thylakoid ΔpH pathway.FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a process that was shown to strictly depend on the presence of an intact RR motif (16Fröbel J. Rose P. Lausberg F. Blümmel A.S. Freudl R. Müller M. Transmembrane insertion of twin-arginine signal peptides is driven by TatC and regulated by TatB.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this so-called stage of advanced binding, the signal peptide is primarily located in close proximity to TatB, which in addition to the Tat consensus motif, also contacts the hydrophobic core (h-region) of the signal peptide as well as the surface-exposed regions of the folded mature domain, suggesting a cage-like structure of the TatB monomers surrounding the folded Tat substrate (13Alami M. Lüke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Müller M. Differential interactions between a twin-arginine signal peptide and its translocase in Escherichia coli.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 25Maurer C. Panahandeh S. Jungkamp A.C. Moser M. Müller M. TatB functions as an oligomeric binding site for folded Tat precursor proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 4151-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As noted above, the RR motif is indisputably a major binding determinant of Tat precursor proteins to the Tat translocase. Here, we examined the contribution of the hydrophobic core of Tat signal peptides in TatBC receptor binding and analyzed the importance of the hydrophobicity of the h-region of the TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide) reductase (TorA) signal peptide for in vivo Tat transport. We found that, besides an intact RR motif, a minimal uninterrupted h-region in the signal peptide is required for Tat-dependent export in E. coli. Furthermore, we identified mutations in the hydrophobic core that compensate for the loss of the RR residues and significantly restored the export of an otherwise transport-defective TorA[KQ]-30aa-MalE reporter protein by increasing the hydrophobicity of the h-region. A positive correlation between the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic core and the translocation efficiency of the respective reporter variants could be observed, indicating that the newly introduced hydrophobic residues might increase the binding affinity of the Tat precursor proteins to the hydrophobic substrate-binding cavity formed by TatB and TatC. Importantly, in vitro cross-linking results strongly suggest that the mutations in the h-region exert their effect on the advanced-stage binding of the TorA signal peptide to the TatBC receptor complex. Based on our combined results, we propose that the h-region of Tat signal peptides significantly contributes to the overall binding affinity and thus, besides the Tat consensus motif, is a second major binding determinant of Tat precursors to the TatBC receptor complex. Previously, a sensitive reporter system based on the Tat-specific fusion protein TorA-MalE was established that allows an easy in situ detection of Tat-dependent protein translocation on indicative media (22Kreutzenbeck P. Kröger C. Lausberg F. Blaudeck N. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. Escherichia coli twin arginine (Tat) mutant translocases possessing relaxed signal peptide recognition specificities.J. Biol.

Genetic evidence for a tight cooperation of TatB and TatC during productive recognition of twin-arginine (Tat) signal peptides in Escherichia coli.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e39867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The plasmid-encoded TorA-MalE reporter protein consists of the signal peptide of the Tat substrate trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) fused to the mature protein part of the normally Sec-dependent maltose-binding protein (MalE). Because the presence of MalE in the periplasm is strictly required for maltose uptake (38Hengge R. Boos W. Maltose and lactose transport in Escherichia coli: examples of two different types of concentrative transport systems.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the Tat-specific export of TorA-MalE into the periplasm is directly linked with the ability of cells to utilize maltose and thus to grow on maltose minimal medium (MMM) as well as to form red colonies on MacConkey maltose (MCM) agar plates (22Kreutzenbeck P.

Studies on the thylakoidal ΔpH-dependent pathway, which is closely related to the Tat system in bacteria, revealed that both the RR motif and the hydrophobic region of the signal peptide are required for efficient transport in plant chloroplasts (20Cline K. Mori H. Thylakoid DeltapH-dependent precursor proteins bind to a cpTatC-Hcf106 complex before Tha4-dependent transport.J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine whether an intact hydrophobic region is also a prerequisite for effective Tat-dependent export in bacteria, we replaced a hydrophobic valine residue (position 23) in the center of the h-region by a negatively-charged aspartate, resulting in an interruption of the hydrophobic core (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the positive control expressing the unaltered TorA-MalE reporter, the export of the mutated TorA[V23D]-MalE variant was completely abolished because the respective strain GSJ101 (a malE-negative derivative of the tat deletion strain DADE) co-expressing the Tat translocase did not grow on MMM and formed pale colonies on MCM (Fig. 1B). The export defect of TorA[V23D]-MalE was also directly demonstrated by cell fractionation experiments using EDTA-lysozyme spheroplasting to yield a combined cytosolic/membrane (C/M) fraction and a periplasmic fraction (P), which were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis using MalE-specific antibodies. Several MalE-derived polypeptides, which are present in the combined fraction of C/M of the positive control, represent the unprocessed precursor protein and its cytosolic degradation products, whereas mature-sized MalE that has been translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane can be detected in the periplasmic fraction (P) (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) (40Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Müller M. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R.

In full agreement with the in situ phenotypes described above, the unprocessed precursor accumulates in the cytosol and no mature MalE can be detected in the periplasmic fraction of GSJ101 co-expressing the Tat translocase and the mutated TorA[V23D]-MalE reporter (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), showing that the negatively-charged aspartate in the hydrophobic core is not tolerated by the bacterial Tat system and renders the precursor inactive for translocation. We previously demonstrated that a set of mutations in the TatBC receptor can suppress the export defect of another transport-incompetent TorA-MalE variant, TorA[KQ]-MalE, in which the crucial RR residues had been replaced with a lysine-glutamine pair, most likely by sufficiently increasing the overall binding affinity of the signal peptide to the TatBC-binding site and thus allowing export (22Kreutzenbeck P.

Polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase known to inhibit the cellular response to hypoxia and tumorigenesis. Nickel compounds are well-established human carcinogens that induce tumorigenesis partly through their hypoxia-mimicking effects. Despite previous research efforts, the role of Plk3 in the hypoxic response induced by hypoxia or nickel is not completely understood. Here, we show that NiCl2 (Ni(II)) or hypoxia reduces the protein level and shortens the half-life of cytoplasmic Plk3 in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. We identify SIAH2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with the cellular hypoxic response, to be the ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of Plk3. We show that SIAH2 binds to Plk3 and mediates its ubiquitination primarily through its polo-box domain. We report that USP28, a deubiquitinase known to be inhibitable by Ni(II) or hypoxia, may also contribute to the suppression of the Plk3 protein by Ni(II). We also show that Plk3 in turn suppresses the SIAH2 protein level in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Our study revealed an interesting mutual regulation between Plk3 and SIAH2 and uncovered a regulatory network that functions to fine-tune the cellular hypoxic response.

Previous work has shown that although the Plk3 mRNA level oscillates in the cell cycle, its protein level remains fairly stable (16Helmke C. Becker S. Strebhardt K.

Although ectopically expressed Plk3 has been shown to be rapidly degraded in the nucleus (18Alberts G.F. Winkles J.A.

Recent studies have shown that Plk3 phosphorylates and destabilizes HIF-1α in a Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL)-independent fashion (9Xu D. Yao Y. Jiang X. Lu L. Dai W.

Accordingly, PLK3−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a much higher level of HIF-1α in response to Ni(II) or hypoxia (10Xu D. Yao Y. Lu L. Costa M. Dai W.

These data suggest that regulation of the hypoxic (or hypoxic-like) responses through the HIF transcription factor may be a key mechanism that connects Plk3 and nickel carcinogenesis (21Xu D. Wang Q.

Regulators and effectors of Siah ubiquitin ligases.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 67: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, among the list of substrates of SIAH2 are those involved in hypoxia-associated functions, such as PHDs (22Nakayama K. Qi J. Ronai Z. The ubiquitin ligase Siah2 and the hypoxia response.Mol.

Biophys. 2013; 67: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SIAH2 positively regulates the hypoxic response by promoting degradation of PHDs thereby stabilizing HIF-1α (22Nakayama K. Qi J.

Regulators and effectors of Siah ubiquitin ligases.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 67: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SIAH2 itself is also subjected to regulation by a number of protein kinases that are activated by various stress conditions, including hypoxia (22Nakayama K. Qi J. Ronai Z. The ubiquitin ligase Siah2 and the hypoxia response.Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Qi J. Kim H. Scortegagna M. Ronai Z.A. Regulators and effectors of Siah ubiquitin ligases.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 67: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence supports a prominent role of SIAH2 in multiple cancers (23Qi J. Kim H. Scortegagna M. Ronai Z.A. Regulators and effectors of Siah ubiquitin ligases.Cell Biochem.

Siah: a promising anticancer target.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance, elevated expression of SIAH2 has been detected in lung cancers (23Qi J. Kim H. Scortegagna M. Ronai Z.A. Regulators and effectors of Siah ubiquitin ligases.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 67: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Wong C.S. Möller A. Siah: a promising anticancer target.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the regulation of Plk3 by Ni(II) and hypoxia. We found that the Plk3 protein level can be suppressed by Ni(II) or hypoxia in lung carcinoma, lung epithelial, and HEK293T cells. The suppression is mediated mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). SIAH2, a hypoxia-responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with and mediates Plk3 degradation by UPS. The polo-box domain (PBD) of Plk3 appears to be the primary motif that mediates the interaction between Plk3 and SIAH2 as well as degradation of Plk3. We observed that the SIAH2 protein level can be induced by Ni(II). The deubiquitinase USP28 may also be involved in Plk3 degradation in response to Ni(II). Interestingly, Plk3 in turn suppresses the protein level of SIAH2 in a manner dependent on the kinase activity of Plk3. Together, our study revealed a potentially important regulatory network involving Plk3, SIAH2, and the HIF transcription factor. This network may function to fine-tune the cellular hypoxic response and contribute to carcinogenesis. Given the involvement of Plk3 in the hypoxic response (10Xu D. Yao Y. Lu L. Costa M. Dai W. Plk3 functions as an essential component of the hypoxia regulatory pathway by direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38944-38950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we examined whether Plk3 expression is regulated by Ni(II) in A549 lung carcinoma and BEAS-2B lung branchial epithelial cells. Western blotting (WB) showed that the protein level of Plk3 could be inhibited by Ni(II) in dose- and time-dependent manners (Fig. 1, A–D). As expected, the protein levels of HIF-1α and VEGF-A were both increased by Ni(II) (Fig. 1, C and D). Long-term and low-dose Ni(II) treatments led to persistently lowered levels of Plk3 and elevated levels of HIF-1α (Fig. 1E). We also observed reduced levels of Plk3 mRNA upon Ni(II) treatments, which were accompanied by a corresponding increase in the mRNA levels of VEGF-A (Fig. 1, G–J). The activities of AKT and ERK were significantly suppressed, whereas that of p38 was dramatically increased by Ni(II) (Fig. 1F). Given that PLK3 is a serum-inducible gene (17Winkles J.A. Alberts G.F. Differential regulation of polo-like kinase 1, 2, 3, and 4 gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Chase D. Feng Y.

J. 1998; 333: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the suppression of Plk3 mRNA by Ni(II) was likely a result of reduced activities of ERK and AKT. The elevated VEGF-A mRNA levels were clearly a result of Ni(II)-induced HIF activation (Fig. 1, C and D). Multiple reports have shown that the mRNA level of Plk3 does not closely correlate with its protein level (8Bahassi el M. Conn C.W. Myer D.L. Hennigan R.F. McGowan C.H. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J.

Plk3 is considered an immediate early response gene whose mRNA level can be quickly induced by serum growth factors after serum starvation, whereas its protein level is stable throughout the cell cycle (8Bahassi el M. Conn C.W. Myer D.L. Hennigan R.F. McGowan C.H. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J.

J. 1998; 333: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we checked the effect of serum on Plk3 protein expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was no consistent increase in the Plk3 protein level after serum treatment despite the activation of ERKs, manifested as the increased levels of phosphorylated ERKs. This confirms the disconnection between the mRNA and protein levels of Plk3. The data also suggest that suppression of the Plk3 mRNA level by Ni(II) may not contribute significantly to the lowered Plk3 protein level. UPS is a common mechanism for post-translational regulation of protein levels or functions (26Bett J.S. Proteostasis regulation by the ubiquitin system.Essays Biochem. 2016; 60: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Plk3 protein is suppressed by Ni(II) through UPS, we examined the effect of MG132, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome (28Kisselev A.F. van der Linden W.A. Overkleeft H.S. Proteasome inhibitors: an expanding army attacking a unique target.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 99-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Our results showed that inhibition of the proteasome largely prevented the effect of Ni(II) or hypoxia on Plk3 in both A549 and BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 2, B–E), indicating that the Plk3 protein was indeed suppressed by Ni(II) or hypoxia through UPS. To determine whether Ni(II) affects the half-life of the Plk3 protein, we used cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis, and tracked the Plk3 protein level with or without co-treatments with Ni(II) in A549 cells. We observed a significant drop in the half-life of the Plk3 protein from 14 to 8 h upon Ni(II) treatment (Fig. 2, F and G). Ectopically expressed Plk3 protein has been shown to locate in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of HEK293T cells, but nuclear Plk3 is quickly degraded via UPS (18Alberts G.F. Winkles J.A. Murine FGF-inducible kinase is rapidly degraded via the nuclear ubiquitin-proteosome system when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine whether Plk3 degradation also occurs in the cytoplasm, we checked the effect of Ni(II) on the Plk3 protein at the subcellular level in A549 cells. As shown in Fig. 2H, the endogenous Plk3 protein was only detectable in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic Plk3 protein behaved in the same way as did the total Plk3 in response to Ni(II) and MG132 shown in Fig. 2B. These data indicate that nuclear Plk3 may indeed be very unstable and that Ni(II)-mediated suppression of Plk3 also occurs in the cytoplasm. Given the evidence that Plk3 is degraded via UPS, we checked whether Plk3 is ubiquitinated and whether Ni(II) can affect its ubiquitination. We first transfected the plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged ubiquitin into A549 cells followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with an anti-FLAG antibody. WB with an anti-Plk3 antibody showed that ubiquitination of the endogenous Plk3 protein after ectopic expression of ubiquitin was detectable and significantly elevated by Ni(II) and/or MG132 (Fig. 2, I and J). We next co-transfected both plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged ubiquitin and GFP-tagged Plk3 into HEK293T cells followed by the same IP experiment. We found that ectopically expressed Plk3 was also ubiquitinated and that Ni(II) and/or MG132 increased Plk3 ubiquitination, as shown in both IP and total protein samples (Fig. 2K). We repeated the experiment in Fig. 2K with extended controls. As shown in Fig. 2L, significant ubiquitination of endogenous Plk3 was detectable and enhanced by MG132 and/or Ni(II) when ubiquitin alone was transfected into HEK293T cells. This was also the case with ectopically expressed Plk3 when GFP-tagged Plk3 alone or GFP-tagged Plk3 and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin were introduced into HEK293T cells (Fig. 2M). As expected, MG132 and/or Ni(II) elevated ubiquitination of ectopically expressed Plk3. In contrast, much lower levels of ubiquitinated endogenous Plk3 were detected in HEK293T cells after co-transfection of empty GFP and FLAG vectors despite that MG132 enhanced the levels of the endogenous Plk3 in both control and nickel-treated cells (Fig. 2N). A previous study showed that the protein level of USP28, a deubiquitinase known to regulate MYC and HIF-1α (29Flügel D. Görlach A. Michiels C. Kietzmann T.

A role for the deubiquitinating enzyme USP28 in control of the DNA-damage response.Cell. 2006; 126: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), can be inhibited by Ni(II) or hypoxia in an HIF-dependent fashion (32Li Q. Kluz T. Sun H. Costa M. Mechanisms of c-myc degradation by nickel compounds and hypoxia.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To check whether USP28 is also involved in the suppression of Plk3 by Ni(II) or hypoxia, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged ubiquitin and HA-tagged USP28 into A549 cells and examined the response of the endogenous Plk3 protein level. As shown in Fig. 3A, whereas USP28 did not significantly affect the basal level of Plk3 protein, it was able to largely reverse the suppressive effect of Ni(II) on Plk3. However, ectopic expression of USP28 without ubiquitin failed to prevent the suppression of endogenous Plk3 (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the effect of USP28 on the Plk3 protein requires the presence of excessive ubiquitin. Similar results were observed on the ectopically expressed Plk3 protein in HEK293T cells where GFP-tagged Plk3 was transfected with or without FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Fig. 3, D–F). These data demonstrate that USP28 is able to stabilize Plk3 in the presence of ectopically expressed ubiquitin, likely by reducing its ubiquitination and preventing subsequent degradation. Note that the protein level of ectopically expressed USP28 could be inhibited by Ni(II) (Fig. 3, A–F), confirming the previous observation (32Li Q. Kluz T. Sun H. Costa M. Mechanisms of c-myc degradation by nickel compounds and hypoxia.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The suppression of the ectopically expressed USP28 driven by a CMV promotor in the expression plasmid by Ni(II) suggests that this process is unlikely dependent completely on HIF-mediated transcriptional events. This observation is in agreement with the previous report (32Li Q. Kluz T. Sun H. Costa M. Mechanisms of c-myc degradation by nickel compounds and hypoxia.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine whether Plk3 can interact with USP28 directly, we ectopically expressed HA-tagged USP28 in A549 cells and performed a reciprocal IP with an anti-Plk3 antibody and an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, G and H, we did not detect any interaction between Plk3 and USP28. Similar IP experiments using HEK293T cells ectopically co-expressing Plk3 and USP28 produced the same result (Fig. 3, I and J). In contrast, specific interactions between Plk3 and HIF-1α as well as between USP28 and c-Myc were detectable (Fig. 3, G and H), as demonstrated in previous studies (10Xu D. Yao Y. Lu L. Costa M. Dai W. Plk3 functions as an essential component of the hypoxia regulatory pathway by direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38944-38950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Popov N. Wanzel M. Madiredjo M. Zhang D. Beijersbergen R. Bernards R. Moll R. Elledge S.J. Eilers M. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP28 is required for MYC stability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the effect of USP28 on the suppression of the Plk3 protein level by Ni(II) probably works through an indirect mechanism. It is also possible that the interaction between Plk3 and USP28 is weak and/or transient, which requires a more sensitive assay to detect. Given that both Ni(II) and hypoxia reduce the Plk3 protein level and that these two conditions are both known to activate the HIF transcription factor by stabilizing its α subunit, we checked whether the suppression of Plk3 by Ni(II) is HIF-dependent. Our data show that the HIF pathway is unlikely to be directly involved in this process as ectopic expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1α showed limited effects on the Plk3 protein level (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Moreover, ectopic expression of pVHL or PHDs had little effect on the level of the Plk3 protein (supplemental Fig. S1, C–E). Furthermore, the CRL family ubiquitin ligases, which regulate HIF-α degradation, are unlikely involved in this process either because inhibition of this family of E3 ligases did not affect the Plk3 protein level (supplemental Fig. S1, F and G). In search for the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates Plk3 ubiquitination in response to Ni(II) or hypoxia, SIAH2 caught our attention. SIAH2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that stabilizes HIF-1α by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of PHDs in response to hypoxia (22Nakayama K. Qi J. Ronai Z. The ubiquitin ligase Siah2 and the hypoxia response.Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Given that both Ni(II) and hypoxia inhibit Plk3 protein expression, we reasoned that SIAH2 could be the E3 ligase that mediates Plk3 ubiquitination and degradation. To test this, we first checked whether menadione, an SIAH2 inhibitor (33Shah M. Stebbins J.L. Dewing A. Qi J. Pellecchia M. Ronai Z.A. Inhibition of Siah2 ubiquitin ligase by vitamin K3 (menadione) attenuates hypoxia and MAPK signaling and blocks melanoma tumorigenesis.Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2009; 22: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), could reverse the inhibitory effect of Ni(II) on the Plk3 protein level. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, menadione dose-dependently elevated the basal level of Plk3 protein and reversed the suppressive effect of Ni(II). Similar reversal effects were also observed under hypoxia (Fig. 4C). We next determined whether SIAH2 can reduce the protein level of Plk3. We ectopically expressed SIAH2 and Plk3 into HEK293T cells and then measured Plk3 protein levels with or without the presence of menadione. As shown in Fig. 4D, ectopic expression of SIAH2 strongly reduced the Plk3 protein level, and menadione largely prevented this effect. Note that the level of SIAH2 was also raised by menadione, consistent with the notion that SIAH2 can mediate its own ubiquitination and degradation (23Qi J. Kim H. Scortegagna M. Ronai Z.A. Regulators and effectors of Siah ubiquitin ligases.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 67: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

The RAGE ligand ODN2006, a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide resembling pathogenic hypomethylated CpG DNA, promotes rapid lysosomal RAGE degradation through activation of protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), which phosphorylates RAGE. PKCζ overexpression enhances RAGE degradation, while PKCζ knockdown stabilizes RAGE protein levels and prevents ODN2006-mediated degradation. We identify that RAGE is targeted by the ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit F-box protein O10 (FBXO10), which associates with RAGE to mediate its ubiquitination and degradation. FBXO10 depletion in cells stabilizes RAGE and is required for ODN2006-mediated degradation. These data suggest that modulation of regulators involved in ubiquitin-mediated disposal of RAGE might serve as unique molecular inputs directing RAGE cellular concentrations and downstream responses, which are critical in an array of inflammatory disorders, including acute lung injury.—Evankovich, J., Lear, T., Mckelvey, A., Dunn, S., Londino, J., Liu, Y., Chen, B.

https://openalex.org/W2614275364,"Canonical pre-mRNA splicing requires snRNPs and associated splicing factors to excise conserved intronic sequences, with a minimum intron length required for efficient splicing. Non-canonical splicing-intron excision without the spliceosome-has been documented; most notably, some tRNAs and the XBP1 mRNA contain short introns that are not removed by the spliceosome. There have been some efforts to identify additional short introns, but little is known about how many short introns are processed from mRNAs. Here, we report an approach to identify RNA short introns from RNA-Seq data, discriminating against small genomic deletions. We identify hundreds of short introns conserved among multiple human cell lines. These short introns are often alternatively spliced and are found in a variety of RNAs-both mRNAs and lncRNAs. Short intron splicing efficiency is increased by secondary structure, and we detect both canonical and non-canonical short introns. In many cases, splicing of these short introns from mRNAs is predicted to alter the reading frame and change protein output. Our findings imply that standard gene prediction models which often assume a lower limit for intron size fail to predict short introns effectively. We conclude that short introns are abundant in the human transcriptome, and short intron splicing represents an added layer to mRNA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2614324880,"In asses, semen collection, cryopreservation, and artificial insemination (AI) with frozen-thawed semen have been scarcely described and success rate, particularly following AI, is reportedly low. In the absence of reliable protocols, assisted reproductive technologies cannot support the conservation efforts aimed at endangered wild ass species and domestic donkey breeds. Two experiments were conducted in this study. In experiment 1 we evaluated freezing Abyssinian donkey (N = 5, 4 ejaculates each) spermatozoa using three freezing extenders (Berliner Cryomedium + glycerol, BC+G; BotuCrio, BOTU; INRAFreeze, INRA) and two cryopreservation techniques (liquid nitrogen vapour, LNV; directional freezing, DF). Post-thaw evaluation indicated that BOTU and INRA were similar and both superior to BC+G (P ≤ 0.004 for all motility tests), and that DF was superior to LNV (P < 0.002 for all evaluation parameters). In experiment 2, relying on these results, we used Abyssinian donkey sperm frozen in BOTU and INRA by DF for AI (N = 20). Prior to AI, thawed samples were diluted in corresponding centrifugation media or autologous seminal fluids at 1:1 ratio. No difference was found between BOTU and INRA or between the addition of seminal fluids or media, all resulting in ~50% pregnancy, and no differences were noted between males (N = 4). The size of pre-ovulatory follicle was a significant (P = 0.001) predictor for AI success with 9/10 pregnancies occurring when follicular size ranged between 33.1-37.4 mm, no pregnancy when it was smaller, and only one when larger. A number of ass species face the risk of extinction. Knowledge gained in this study on the Abyssinian donkey can be customised and transferred to its closely related endangered species and breeds."
https://openalex.org/W2615124649,"Bladder hyperreflexia is a common non-motor feature of Parkinson’s disease. We now report on the contractility of the isolated primate detrusor strips devoid of nerve input and show that following MPTP, the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contraction was increased. These responses were unaffected by dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists A77636 and ropinirole respectively. Contractions by exogenous carbachol, histamine or ATP were similar and no differences in the magnitude of noradrenaline-induced relaxation were seen in detrusor strip obtained from normal and MPTP-treated common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). However, the neurogenic contractions following electrical field stimulation of the intrinsic nerves (EFS) were markedly greater in strips obtained from MPTP treated animals. EFS evoked non-cholinergic contractions following atropine were also greater but the contribution of the cholinergic innervation as a proportion of the overall contraction was smaller in the detrusor strips of MPTP treated animals, suggesting a preferential enhancement of the non-cholinergic transmission. Although dopaminergic mechanism has been proposed to underlie bladder hyperreflexia in MPTP-treated animals with intact bladder, the present data indicates that the increased neurogenically mediated contractions where no extrinsic innervation exists might be due to long-term adaptive changes locally as a result of the loss of the nigrostriatal output."
https://openalex.org/W2951544625,"Neural mechanisms which bind items into sequences have been investigated in a large body of research in animal neurophysiology and human neuroimaging. However, a major problem in interpreting this data arises from a fact that several unrelated processes, such as memory load, sensory adaptation, and reward expectation, also change in a consistent manner as the sequence unfolds. In this paper we use computational simulations and data from two fMRI experiments to show that a host of unrelated neural processes can masquerade as sequence representations. We show that dissociating such unrelated processes from a dedicated sequence representation is an especially difficult problem for fMRI data, which is almost exclusively the modality used in human experiments. We suggest that such fMRI results must be treated with caution and in many cases the assumed neural representation might actually reflect unrelated processes."
https://openalex.org/W2614626856,"The design and generation of an optimal expression construct is the first and essential step in in the characterization of a protein of interest. Besides evaluation and optimization of process parameters (e.g. selection of the best expression host or cell line and optimal induction conditions and time points), the design of the expression construct itself has a major impact. However, the path to this final expression construct is often not straight forward and includes multiple learning cycles accompanied by design variations and retesting of construct variants, since multiple, functional DNA sequences of the expression vector backbone, either coding or non-coding, can have a major impact on expression yields. To streamline the generation of defined expression constructs of otherwise difficult to express proteins, the Modular Protein Expression Toolbox (MoPET) has been developed. This cloning platform allows highly efficient DNA assembly of pre-defined, standardized functional DNA modules with a minimal cloning burden. Combining these features with a standardized cloning strategy facilitates the identification of optimized DNA expression constructs in shorter time. The MoPET system currently consists of 53 defined DNA modules divided into eight functional classes and can be flexibly expanded. However, already with the initial set of modules, 792,000 different constructs can be rationally designed and assembled. Furthermore, this starting set was used to generate small and mid-sized combinatorial expression optimization libraries. Applying this screening approach, variants with up to 60-fold expression improvement have been identified by MoPET variant library screening."
https://openalex.org/W2615542944,"Although animal research requires adherence to various regulations and standards, the manner in which compliance is maintained and the degree of additional constraints varies between institutions. Regulatory burden, particularly if institutionally imposed, has become a concern for institutions as increased regulatory expectations result in decreased resources available for research efforts. Faculty, research staff, and support staff engaged in animal research were surveyed to determine what institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) processes were considered burdensome, the perceived value of some suggested modifications, and satisfaction with the IACUC administrative office and the animal resource unit. Although the results revealed overwhelming satisfaction with the IACUC administrative office and the animal resource unit, several IACUC processes were deemed burdensome, and therefore there would be value in modifying IACUC processes. When comparing the value of modifying IACUC processes, different groups within the animal care and use program (ACUP) tended to have different responses on many of the topics. This survey identified several perceived burdensome IACUC processes that would likely benefit individuals if modified. In today’s environment of shrinking budgets for biomedical research, minimizing regulatory burden—particularly unnecessary, self-imposed burden—in the ACUP is particularly important to ensure that costs, time, and effort are appropriate to achieve animal welfare and quality of research endeavors.—Norton, J.

https://openalex.org/W2616277759,"Pain in opioid-dependent patients is common but data measuring the course of pain (and its correlates) using validated scales in patients initiating methadone treatment are sparse. We aimed to assess pain and its interference in daily life, associated correlates, and undertreatment before and during methadone treatment.This is a secondary analysis using longitudinal data of a randomized trial comparing two methadone initiation models. We assessed the effect of methadone initiation and other correlates on pain intensity and interference (using the Brief Pain Inventory) at months 0, 6 and 12 using a mixed multinomial logistic regression model.The study group comprised 168 patients who had data for either pain intensity or interference for at least one visit. Moderate to severe pain was reported in 12.9% of patients at M0, 5.4% at M6 and 7.3% at M12. Substantial interference with daily functioning was reported in 36.0% at M0, 14.5% at M6 and 17.1% at M12. Of the 98 visits where patients reported moderate to severe pain or substantial interference, 55.1% reported no treatment for pain relief, non-opioid analgesics were reported by 34.7%, opioid analgesics by 3.1% and both opioid and non-opioid analgesics by 7.1%. Methadone was associated with decreased pain intensity at 6 months (OR = 0.29, p = 0.04) and 12 months (OR = 0.30, p = 0.05) of follow-up and tended to be associated with substantial pain interference. Suicide risk was associated with both pain intensity and pain interference.Methadone in opioid-dependent patients can reduce pain. However, undertreatment of pain in methadone patients remains a major clinical concern. Patients with pain are at higher risk of suicide. Adequate screening and management of pain in this population is a priority and needs to be integrated into routine comprehensive care."
https://openalex.org/W2616311661,"Pathogens exert selective pressure which may lead to substantial changes in host immune responses. The human complement receptor type 1 (CR1) is an innate immune recognition glycoprotein that regulates the activation of the complement pathway and removes opsonized immune complexes. CR1 genetic variants in exon 29 have been associated with expression levels, C1q or C3b binding and increased susceptibility to several infectious diseases. Five distinct CR1 nucleotide substitutions determine the Knops blood group phenotypes, namely Kna/b, McCa/b, Sl1/Sl2, Sl4/Sl5 and KCAM+/-.CR1 variants were genotyped by direct sequencing in a cohort of 441 healthy individuals from Brazil, Vietnam, India, Republic of Congo and Ghana.The distribution of the CR1 alleles, genotypes and haplotypes differed significantly among geographical settings (p≤0.001). CR1 variants rs17047660A/G (McCa/b) and rs17047661A/G (Sl1/Sl2) were exclusively observed to be polymorphic in African populations compared to the groups from Asia and South-America, strongly suggesting that these two SNPs may be subjected to selection. This is further substantiated by a high linkage disequilibrium between the two variants in the Congolese and Ghanaian populations. A total of nine CR1 haplotypes were observed. The CR1*AGAATA haplotype was found more frequently among the Brazilian and Vietnamese study groups; the CR1*AGAATG haplotype was frequent in the Indian and Vietnamese populations, while the CR1*AGAGTG haplotype was frequent among Congolese and Ghanaian individuals.The African populations included in this study might have a selective advantage conferred to immune genes involved in pathogen recognition and signaling, possibly contributing to disease susceptibility or resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2615445159,"Background The decision to become a living liver donor is a stressful event. Ambivalence in decision making may result in psychological distress. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide a description of the ambivalence of potential living liver donors, to examine the predictors of ambivalence, and to compare the ambivalence of potential living liver donors with that of actual living liver donors. Methods This descriptive and correlational study was conducted in a medical center from August 2013 to December 2015. Self-reported questionnaires were used to collect data. A total of 263 potential living liver donors who were assessed for donation to their parents were included in this study. Results The mean age of the total sample was 30.7 years (SD = 6.39, range = 20–47), and males comprised 53.6% of the sample. The majority of the potential donors had a college education (70.8%) and were single (63.5%). Of the total sample, the mean score for ambivalence was 4.27 (SD = 1.87, range = 0–7). Multivariate analysis revealed that the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of quality of life (β = -0.24, p < 0.01), family support (β = -0.17, p = 0.007), and intimacy (β = -0.13, p = 0.04) were significant protective predictors of ambivalence. Actual living liver donors had significantly lower ambivalence (3.82 versus 4.60), higher intimacy with recipients (3.55 versus 3.34), higher MCS (45.26 versus 42.80), and higher family support (34.39 versus 29.79) than did the remaining potential living liver donors. Conclusion Ambivalence is common in potential living liver donors. The MCS of quality of life, family support, and intimacy were protective predictors in terms of ambivalence. Future research should explore other factors and design interventions targeted toward reducing ambivalence, promoting family support, and enhancing the mental dimensions of quality of life in potential living liver donors."
https://openalex.org/W2614341800,"To investigate the impact of national implementation of age restriction on fluoroquinolone prescription in children and adolescents.Data collected from the database of Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea, a national health insurance system to analyze fluoroquinolone prescribing practice in children and adolescents younger than 18 years, between 2007 and 2015. The age restriction was implemented in December 2009. The annual prescription rate of FQ per 100,000 person-years was calculated and an autoregressive model was used to predict the prescription pattern if an intervention had not occurred.A total of 505,859 children received systemic fluoroquinolone during the study period-297,054 ciprofloxacin, and 208,805 levofloxacin. After implementation of the drug utilization review program, the annual prescription rate for ciprofloxacin declined by 97.5% (from 840 to 21 per 100,000 person-years, P < 0.001), and for levofloxacin by 96.4% (from 598 to 11 per 100,000 person-years, P < 0.001). The decline was more dramatic in the outpatient setting than in the inpatient setting for both drugs.The dramatic and sustained decline in prescription number and change in prescription pattern after the regulatory action suggests that the implementation under drug utilization review program was successful in controlling excessive and inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones in children, possibly guiding towards more judicious and selective prescription behavior."
