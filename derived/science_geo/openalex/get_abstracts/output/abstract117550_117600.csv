We designed studies to determine whether eNOS is localized to plasmalemmal microdomains implicated in signal transduction called caveolae. Using immunoblot analysis, eNOS protein was detected in caveolar membrane fractions isolated from endothelial cell plasma membranes by a newly developed detergent-free method; eNOS protein was not found in noncaveolar plasma membrane. Similarly, NOS enzymatic activity was 9.4-fold enriched in caveolar membrane versus whole plasma membrane, whereas it was undetectable in noncaveolar plasma membrane. 51-86% of total NOS activity in postnuclear supernatant was recovered in plasma membrane, and 57-100% of activity in plasma membrane was recovered in caveolae. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that eNOS heavily decorated endothelial caveolae, whereas coated pits and smooth plasma membrane were devoid of gold particles. Furthermore, eNOS was targeted to caveolae in COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type eNOS cDNA. Studies with eNOS mutants revealed that both myristoylation and palmitoylation are required to target the enzyme to caveolae and that each acylation process enhances targeting by 10-fold. Thus, acylation targets eNOS to plasmalemmal caveolae. Localization to this microdomain is likely to optimize eNOS activation and the extracellular release of nitric oxide.

We demonstrate that ERK, JNK, and p38 are activated by distinct combinations of stimuli in T cells that simulate full or partial activation through the T cell receptor. These kinases are regulated by reversible phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr, and the dual specific phosphatases PAC1 and MKP-1 previously have been implicated in the in vivo inactivation of ERK or of ERK and JNK, respectively. Here we characterize a new MAP kinase phosphatase, MKP-2, that is induced in human peripheral blood T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and is expressed in a variety of nonhematopoietic tissues as well. We show that the in vivo substrate specificities of individual phosphatases are unique. PAC1, MKP-2, and MKP-1 recognize ERK and p38, ERK and JNK, and ERK, p38, and JNK, respectively. Thus, individual MAP kinase phosphatases can differentially regulate the potential for cross-talk between the various MAP kinase pathways. A hyperactive allele of ERK2 (D319N), analogous to the Drosophila sevenmaker gain-of-function mutation, has significantly reduced sensitivity to all three MAP kinase phosphatases in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2169357831,"The yeast cadmium factor gene (YCF1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was isolated according to its ability to confer cadmium resistance, encodes a 1,515-amino acid ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein with extensive sequence homology to the human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) (Szczypka, M., Wemmie, J. A., Moye-Rowley, W. S., and Thiele, D. J.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22853-22857). Direct comparisons between S. cerevisiae strain DTY167, harboring a deletion of the YCF1 gene, and the isogenic wild type strain, DTY165, demonstrate that YCF1 is required for increased resistance to the toxic effects of the exogenous glutathione S-conjugate precursor, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, as well as cadmium. Whereas membrane vesicles isolated from DTY165 cells contain two major pathways for transport of the model compound S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione (DNP-GS), an MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive pathway and an electrically driven pathway, the corresponding membrane fraction from DTY167 cells is more than 90% impaired for MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive DNP-GS transport. Of the two DNP-GS transport pathways identified, only the MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive pathway is subject to inhibition by glutathione disulfide, vanadate, verapamil, and vinblastine. The capacity for MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive conjugate transport in vitro strictly copurifies with the vacuolar membrane fraction. Intact DTY165 cells, but not DTY167 cells, mediate vacuolar accumulation of the fluorescent glutathione-conjugate, monochlorobimane-GS. Introduction of plasmid borne, epitope-tagged gene encoding functional YCF1 into DTY167 cells alleviates the 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene-hypersensitive phenotype concomitant with restoration of the capacity of vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from these cells for MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive DNP-GS transport. On the basis of these findings, the YCF1 gene of S. cerevisiae is inferred to encode an MgATP-energized, uncoupler-insensitive vacuolar glutathione S-conjugate transporter. The energy requirements, kinetics, substrate specificity, and inhibitor profile of YCF1-mediated transport demonstrate that the vacuolar glutathione conjugate pump of yeast bears a strong mechanistic resemblance to the MRP1-encoded transporter of mammalian cells and the cognate, but as yet molecularly undefined, function of plant cells.

Animal and plant cells have the capacity to eliminate a broad range of lipophilic toxins from the cytosol after their conjugation with glutathione (Ishikawa, 1992; Martinoia et al., 1993; Li et al., 1995). This process, mediated by a GS-X pump, ( 1The abbreviations used are: GS-X pumpglutathione S-conjugate transporting ATPaseABC transporterATP binding cassette transport proteinAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateCDNB1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzeneDNP-GSS-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathioneF-ATPasemitochondrial H+-ATPaseFCCPcarbonylcyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneGSSGoxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide)HA12CA5 epitope (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) of human influenza hemagglutininMDRgene encoding multiple drug resistance ABC transporter (P-glycoprotein or putative P-glycoprotein homolog)metolachlor2-chloro-N-(2′-ethyl-6′-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)-acetamideMRP1gene encoding multidrug resistance-associated proteinP-ATPaseplasma membrane H+-ATPaseV-ATPasevacuolar H+-ATPaseYCF1gene encoding yeast cadmium factorPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideNBFnucleotide binding foldCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorGSTglutathione S-transferaseMes4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid.) a novel MgATP-dependent transporter that catalyzes the efflux of glutathione S-conjugates and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) from the cytosol via the plasma membrane and/or endomembranes, is thought to constitute a terminal phase of xenobiotic detoxification. glutathione S-conjugate transporting ATPase ATP binding cassette transport protein adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione mitochondrial H+-ATPase carbonylcyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide) 12CA5 epitope (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) of human influenza hemagglutinin gene encoding multiple drug resistance ABC transporter (P-glycoprotein or putative P-glycoprotein homolog) 2-chloro-N-(2′-ethyl-6′-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)-acetamide gene encoding multidrug resistance-associated protein plasma membrane H+-ATPase vacuolar H+-ATPase gene encoding yeast cadmium factor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride nucleotide binding fold cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. The metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics comprises three main phases (Ishikawa, 1992). Phase I is a preparatory step in which toxins are oxidized, reduced, or hydrolyzed to introduce or expose functional groups of the appropriate reactivity. Cytochrome P450s and mixed function oxidases are examples of phase I enzymes. In phase II, the activated derivative is conjugated with GSH, glucuronic acid, or glucose. In the case of the GSH-dependent pathway, S-conjugates of GSH are formed by cytosolic glutathione S-transferases. In the final phase, phase III, of the GSH-dependent pathway, GS-conjugates are eliminated from the cytosol by the GS-X pump. A remarkable feature of the last component of the GSH-dependent pathway, the GS-X pump, is the pharmacological and agronomic importance of the compounds it recognizes. Established transport substrates for the mammalian GS-X pump include the arachidonic acid metabolites, leukotriene C4, and prostaglandin A2, GS-conjugates of the anticancer drugs cisplatin, chlorambucil, and acrolein, GSSG, and the model compounds S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione (DNP-GS) and monochlorobimane-GS (Ishikawa et al., 1995). In plants, the GS-X pump is competent in the transport of GS-conjugates of the chloroacetanilide and triazine herbicides, metolachlor and simetryn, respectively, as well as GSSG, DNP-GS, and monochlorobimane-GS (Martinoia et al., 1993; Li et al., 1995). In spite of its relevance for understanding how cells combat chemotherapeutic agents and herbicides and the interest shown in this class of transporter because of its exclusive use of MgATP, rather than preformed transmembrane ion gradients, as a direct energy source for organic solute transport, the molecular identity of any GS-X pump has remained elusive. Critical, therefore, is the recent finding that the 190-kDa membrane glycoprotein encoded by the human multidrug resistance-associated protein gene (MRP1), implicated in the resistance of small cell lung cancer cell lines to a number of chemotherapeutic drugs (Cole et al., 1992), catalyzes the MgATP-dependent transport of leukotriene C4 and related glutathione S-conjugates (Leier et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994; Zaman et al., 1995). MRP1 is a member of the ABC (ATP binding cassette) superfamily of transporters. Distributed throughout the major taxa, ABC transporters catalyze the MgATP-dependent transport of peptides, sugars, ions, and lipophiles across membranes. All are constituted of one or two copies each of two basic structural elements, a hydrophobic, integral membrane sector, containing approximately 6 transmembrane α-helices, and a cytoplasmically oriented ATP-binding domain (nucleotide binding fold, NBF) (Hyde et al., 1990; Higgins, 1995). The NBFs, a diagnostic feature of ABC transporters, are 30% identical between family members over a span of about 200 amino acid residues, and each encompasses a Walker A and Walker B box (Walker et al., 1982) and an ABC signature motif (Higgins, 1995). The most thoroughly investigated ABC family members in eukaryotes include the mammalian P-glycoproteins (MDRs), some of which are implicated in drug resistance and others in lipid translocation (Ruetz and Gros, 1994); the pleiotropic drug resistance protein (PDR5) and STE6 peptide-mating pheromone transporter of yeast; the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, mutation of which is associated with cystic fibrosis in man; the malarial, Plasmodium falciparum, chloroquine transporter (PFMDR1); and the major histocompatibiliy complex transporters responsible for peptide translocation and antigen presentation in T lymphocytes (reviewed in Balzi and Goffeau(1995) and Higgins(1995)). Sequence comparisons between MRP1 and other ABC transporters reveal two major subgroups (Cole et al., 1992; Szczypka et al., 1994). One consists of MRP1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cadmium factor (YCF1) gene, the Leishmania P-glycoprotein-related molecule (Lei/PgpA), and the CFTRs. The other consists of the MDRs, major histocompatibiliy complex transporters, and STE6. However, of all the ABC transporters showing structural similarity to MRP1, YCF1 bears the closest resemblance. Unlike the similarities between MRP1, Lei/PgpA, and CFTR, which center on the NBFs, those between MRP1 and YCF1 are found throughout the sequence. YCF1 is 42.6% identical (63.4% similar) to MRP1, possesses NBFs with an equivalent spacing of conserved residues, and is collinear with respect to the location, extent, and alternation of putative transmembrane and extramembrane domains (Szczypka et al., 1994). Two features of YCF1 and MRP1 that distinguish them from other ABC transporters are their possession of a truncated CFTR-like regulatory domain rich in charged amino acid residues and an approximately 200 amino acid residue N-terminal extension. Thus, a potentially strategically important conclusion to derive from these considerations is the possibility that yeast YCF1 and human MRP1 bear so close a resemblance that they catalyze the same, or at least overlapping, reactions. Anecdotal evidence in support of an MRP1-like function for YCF1 is 4-fold. First, there is a strong association between cellular GSH levels and resistance to cadmium, implicating this peptide as one of the first lines of defense against this heavy metal (Singhal et al., 1987). If YCF1 confers resistance to cadmium through the transport of GS•Cd complexes, or derivatives thereof, it may also be competent in the transport of other GS-conjugates. Second, vacuolar membrane vesicles from wild type S. cerevisiae catalyze high rates of MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive S-conjugate transport, and the kinetics of the transporter involved are akin to those of the mammalian and plant vacuolar GS-X pumps. ( 2Z.-S. Li and P. A. Rea, unpublished results.) Third, vacuole-deficient mutants of S. cerevisiae exhibit markedly increased sensitivity to cadmium, ( 3M. Szczypka and D. J. Thiele, unpublished results.) suggesting that one requirement for efficient elimination or detoxification of this metal is maintenance of a sizable vacuolar compartment. Fourth, S. cerevisiae yAP-1 transcription factor transcriptionally activates both the YCF1 gene and GSH1 gene (Wemmie et al., 1994; Wu and Moye-Rowley, 1994). Since GSH1 encodes γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, an enzyme critical for GSH synthesis, expression of the YCF1 gene and fabrication of one of the precursors for transport by the GS-X pump are coordinately regulated. In this report we demonstrate, through investigations of transport of the model compounds, DNP-GS and monochlorobimane-GS, by isolated membrane vesicles and intact cells, respectively, that YCF1 is indeed a membrane protein responsible for catalyzing MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive uptake of glutathione S-conjugates into the vacuole of wild type S. cerevisiae. In so doing, we show that yeast YCF1 is not only a structural homolog but also a functional homolog of human MRP1. Two strains of S. cerevisiae were used in these studies: DTY165 (MATα ura3-52 his6 leu2-3,-112 his3-Δ200 trp1-901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ) and the isogenic ycf1Δ mutant strain, DTY167 (MATα ura3-52 his6 leu2-3,-112 his3-Δ200 trp1-901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ, ycf1::hisG). The strains were routinely grown in rich (YPD) medium, or, when transformed with plasmid containing functional YCF1 gene, in synthetic complete medium (Sherman et al., 1983) or AHC medium (Kim et al., 1994) lacking the appropriate amino acids. Escherichia coli strains XL1-blue (Stratagene) and DH11S were employed for the construction and maintenance of plasmid stocks (Ausubel et al., 1987). Plasmid pYCF1-HA, encoding epitope-tagged YCF1, was constructed in several steps. A 1.4-kb SalI-HindIII fragment, encompassing the carboxyl-terminal segment of the open reading frame of YCF1, from pIBIYCF1 (Szczypka et al., 1994), was subcloned into pBluescript KS+. Single-stranded DNA was prepared and used as template to insert DNA sequence encoding the human influenza hemagglutinin 12CA5 epitope immediately before the termination codon of the YCF1 gene by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The sequence of the primer for this reaction, with the coding sequence for the 12CA5 epitope underlined, was 5′-GTTTCACAGTTTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTTTCATTGACC-3′. After confirming the boundaries and fidelity of the HA-tag coding region by DNA sequencing, the 1.4-kb SalI-HindIII DNA fragment was exchanged with the corresponding wild type segment of pJAW50 (Wemmie et al., 1994) to generate pYCF1-HA. For the routine preparation of vacuolar membrane vesicles, 15 ml of stationary phase cultures of DTY165 or DTY167 were diluted into 1-liter volumes of fresh YPD medium, grown for 24 h at 30°C to an OD600 nm of approximately 0.8 and collected by centrifugation. After washing with distilled water, the cells were converted to spheroplasts with Zymolyase 20T (ICN) (Kim et al., 1994) and intact vacuoles were isolated by flotation centrifugation of spheroplast lysates on Ficoll 400 step gradients as described by Roberts et al. (1991). Both the spheroplast lysis buffer and Ficoll gradients contained 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM PMSF to minimize proteolysis. The resulting vacuole fraction was vesiculated in 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Mes (pH 6.9) containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mM PMSF, pelleted by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 25 min, and resuspended in suspension medium (1.1 M glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM Tris-EGTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM Tris-Mes, pH 7.6) (Kim et al., 1995). For the experiment shown in Fig. 4, 1 ml of partially purified vacuolar membrane vesicles (1.1-1.2 mg of protein), prepared by Ficoll flotation, were subjected to further fractionation by centrifugation through a 30-ml linear 10-40% (w/v) sucrose density gradient at 100,000 × g for 2 h. Successive fractions were collected from the top of the centrifuge tube and, after determining sucrose concentration refractometrically, the fractions were diluted with suspension medium. The diluted fractions were sedimented at 100,000 × g and resuspended in 100-μl aliquots of suspension medium for assay. For the immunoblots shown in Fig. 5 and the marker enzyme analyses shown in Table 4, crude microsomes were prepared by homogenization of spheroplasts in suspension medium and the sedimentation of total membranes at 100,000 × g for 35 min.Figure 5:A, Effect of transformation with pYCF1-HA or pRS424 on MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive [3H]DNP-GS uptake by vacuolar membranes purified from DTY165 and DTY167 cells.

The final membrane preparations were either used immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −85°C. α-Mannosidase was determined according to Opheim(1978) using p-nitrophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside as substrate. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was estimated as FMN-promoted reduction of NADPH (Kubota et al., 1977). GDPase was measured as the rate of liberation of Pi from GDP (Yanagisawa et al., 1990) in reaction buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. V-ATPase, F-ATPase, and P-ATPase were assayed as bafilomycin A1 (1 μM), azide (1 mM), and vanadate (100 μM) inhibited ATPase activity, respectively, at pH 8.0 (V-ATPase, F-ATPase) or pH 6.5 (P-ATPase) (Rea and Turner, 1990). Unless otherwise indicated, [3H]DNP-GS uptake was measured at 25°C in 200-μl reaction volumes containing 3 mM ATP, 3 mM MgSO4, 5 μM gramicidin-D, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 16 units/ml creatine kinase, 50 mM KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 400 mM sorbitol, 25 mM Tris-Mes (pH 8.0), and 66.2 μM [3H]DNP-GS (8.7 mCi/mmol) (Li et al., 1995). Gramicidin D was included in the uptake medium to abolish the H+ electrochemical potential difference (Δμ¯H+ Cells were grown in YPD medium for 24 h at 30°C to an OD600 nm of approximately 1.4, and 100-μl aliquots of the suspensions were transferred to 15-ml volumes of fresh YPD medium containing 100 μMsyn-(ClCH2,CH3)-1,5-diazabucyclo-[3.3.0]-octa-3,6-dione-2,8-dione (monochlorobimane) (Kosower and Pazhenchevsky, 1980). After incubation for 6 h, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with YPD medium lacking monochlorobimane, and viewed without fixation under an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a BP-490 UV excitation filter, AFC-0515 barrier filter, and Nomarski optics attachment. Membrane samples were subjected to one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7-12% (w/v) concave exponential gradient gels after delipidation with acetone:ethanol (Parry et al., 1989). The separated polypeptides were electrotransferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters at 60 V for 4 h at 4°C in a Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and reversibly stained with Ponceau-S (Rea et al., 1992). The filters were blocked and incubated overnight with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (20 μg/ml) (Boehringer-Mannheim). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1/1000 dilution) (Boehringer-Mannheim) and incubation in buffer containing H2O2 (0.03% w/v), diaminobenzidine (0.6 mg/ml) and NiCl2 (0.03% w/v) (Rea et al., 1992). Protein was estimated by a modification of the method of Peterson(1977). [3H]DNP-GS (specific activity, 8.7 mCi/mmol) and monochlorobimane-GS were synthesized enzymatically and purified by a modification of the procedure of Kunst et al. (1989) (Li et al., 1995). Metolachlor-GS was synthesized by general base catalysis and purified by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography (Li et al., 1995). GSH and CDNB were purchased from Fluka; AMP-PNP, aprotinin, ATP, creatine kinase (type I from rabbit muscle, 150-250 units/mg of protein), creatine phosphate, FCCP, GSSG, gramicidin D, leupeptin, PMSF, verapamil, and vinblastine were from Sigma; monochlorobimane was from Molecular Probes; cellulose nitrate membranes (0.45-μm pore size, HA filters) were from Millipore; [3H]glutathione [(glycine-2-3H]-L-Glu-Cys-Gly; 44 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN; and metolachlor was a gift from CIBA-Geigy, Greensboro, NC. All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Fisher, Fluka, or Sigma. If the YCF1 gene product were to participate in the detoxification of S-conjugable xenobiotics, mutants deleted for this gene would be expected to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of these compounds than wild type cells. This is what was found (Fig. 1). The isogenic wild type strain DTY165 and the ycf1Δ mutant strain, DTY167, were indistinguishable during growth in YPD medium lacking CDNB: both strains grew at the same rate after a brief lag. However, the addition of CDNB to the culture medium caused a greater retardation of the growth of DTY167 cells (Fig. 1B) than DTY165 cells (Fig. 1A). Inhibitory concentrations of CDNB resulted in a slower, more linear, growth rate for at least 24 h for both strains, but DTY167 underwent growth retardation at lower concentrations than did DTY165. The optical densities of the DTY167 cultures were diminished by 65, 82, 85, and 91% by 40, 50, 60, and 70 μM CDNB, respectively, after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1B), whereas the corresponding diminutions for the DTY165 cultures were 14, 31, 59, and 92% (Fig. 1A). The increase in sensitivity to CDNB conferred by deletion of the YCF1 gene was similar to that seen with cadmium (data not shown). Vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from DTY165 cells exhibited high rates of MgATP-dependent [3H]DNP-GS uptake (Fig. 2). Providing that creatine phosphate and creatine kinase were included in the uptake media to ensure ATP regeneration, addition of 3 mM MgATP increased the initial rate of DNP-GS uptake by 122-fold to a value of 12.2 nmol/mg/min. The same membrane fraction from DTY167 cells, although capable of similar rates of MgATP-independent DNP-GS uptake, was only 17-fold stimulated by MgATP and capable of an initial rate of uptake of only 1.7 nmol/mg/min (Fig. 2). Direct comparisons between vacuolar membrane vesicles from DTY165 and DTY167 cells demonstrated that deletion of the YCF1 gene selectively abolished MgATP-energized, Δμ¯H+ Agents that dissipate both the pH (ΔpH) and electrical (Δψ) components of the Δμ¯H+ Of these two pathways, the Δψ-dependent pathway predominated in membranes from DTY167 cells (Table 1). FCCP, gramicidin D, and bafilomycin A1 diminished net DNP-GS uptake by DTY167 vacuolar membranes from 15.4 ± 0.4 nmol/mg/10 min to between 4.3 ± 0.3 and 6.4 ± 0.3 nmol/mg/10 min. Moreover, although the effects of FCCP or gramicidin D and V-ATPase inhibitors in combination were slightly greater than those seen when these agents were added individually, the transport remaining was only about 10% of that seen with wild type membranes and only 2-4-fold stimulated by MgATP. In conjunction with the negligible inhibitions seen with NH4Cl, alone, indicating that Δψ, not ΔpH, is the principal driving force for the transport activity remaining in their vacuolar membranes, DTY167 cells are inferred to be preferentially impaired in MgATP-energized, Δμ¯H+Tabled 1 The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, did not promote DNP-GS uptake by vacuolar membrane vesicles from either DTY165 or DTY167 cells (Table 1), indicating a requirement for hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of ATP regardless of whether uptake was via the YCF1- or Δψ-dependent pathway. Examination of the concentration dependence of [3H]DNP-GS uptake revealed a near total abolition of high affinity, MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive transport by vacuolar membrane vesicles from the ycf1Δ mutant strain (Fig. 3). When measured in the presence of uncoupler (gramicidin D), the rate of DNP-GS uptake by vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from DTY165 cells increased as a simple hyperbolic function of MgATP (Fig. 3A) and DNP-GS concentration (Fig. 3B) to yield Km values of 86.5 ± 29.5 μM (MgATP) and 14.1 ± 7.4 μM (DNP-GS) and a Vmax of 51.0 ± 6.3 nmol/mg/10 min (DNP-GS). By contrast, uncoupler-insensitive uptake by the corresponding membrane fraction from DTY167 cells was more than 15-fold slower over the entire concentration range, showed no evidence of saturation and increased as a linear function of both DNP-GS and MgATP concentration (Fig. 3). MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive DNP-GS uptake by vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from DTY165 cells was sensitive to inhibition by vanadate, vinblastine, verapamil, GSSG and glutathione S-conjugates other than DNP-GS (Table 2 and Table 3). One hundred μM concentrations of metolachlor-GS, azidophenacyl-GS, and monochlorobimane-GS and 1 mM GSSG inhibited uptake by about 50% (Table 2), while vanadate, vinblastine, and verapamil exerted 50% inhibitions at concentrations of 179, 89, and 203 μM, respectively (Table 3). None of these agents significantly inhibited residual MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive DNP-GS uptake by vacuolar membrane vesicles from DTY167 cells (Table 2 and Table 3).Tabled 1Tabled 1 The capacity for MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive [3H]DNP-GS uptake strictly copurified with the vacuolar membrane fraction (Table 4). By comparison with crude microsomes (total membranes) prepared from whole spheroplast homogenates of DTY165 cells, vacuolar membrane vesicles derived from vacuoles purified by the Ficoll flotation technique (see “Materials and Methods”) were coordinately enriched for DNP-GS uptake and both of the vacuolar membrane markers assayed, α-mannosidase and bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase (V-ATPase) activity. The respective enrichments of MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive DNP-GS uptake, α-mannosidase and bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity were 28-, 53- and 22-fold. By contrast, the vacuolar membrane fraction was 4.5-, 6.3-, 11.1- and 4.3-fold depleted of NADPH cytochrome c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum), latent GDPase (Golgi), vanadate-sensitive ATPase (plasma membrane), and azide-sensitive ATPase activity (mitochondrial inner membrane), respectively. Accordingly, when vacuolar membrane vesicles derived from Ficoll-flotated vacuoles were subjected to further fractionation on linear 10-40% (w/v) sucrose density gradients, MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive [3H]DNP-GS uptake, α-mannosidase and bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity were found to comigrate and exhibit identical density profiles (Fig. 4). Immunoblots of vacuolar membranes from pYCF1-HA-transformed DTY165 or DTY167 cells, probed with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody, demonstrated incorporation of YCF1-HA polypeptide into the vacuolar membrane fraction (Fig. 5B). Immunoreaction with the 12CA5 epitope was not detectable in lanes loaded with membranes from pRS424-transformed cells but the same quantities of membranes prepared from pYCF1-HA-transformed cells yielded a single intensely immunoreactive band with an electrophoretic mobility (Mr = 156,200) commensurate with a computed mass of 172 kDa for the fusion protein encoded by YCF1-HA (Fig. 5B). Direct participation of the plasmid-borne YCF1-HA gene product in DNP-GS transport and CDNB detoxification was verified by the finding that vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from pYCF1-HA-transformed DTY167 cells exhibited a 6-fold enhancement of MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive [3H]DNP-GS uptake (Fig. 5A) which was accompanied by a decrease in the susceptibility of such transformants to growth retardation by exogenous CDNB (Fig. 6). Whereas pYCF1-HA-transformed DTY167 cells exhibited a similar resistance to growth retardation by CDNB as untransformed DTY165 cells (compare Fig. 6B with Fig. 1A), the same mutant strain showed neither increased vacuolar DNP-GS transport in vitro nor decreased susceptibility to CDNB in vivo after transformation with parental plasmid pRS424, lacking the YCF1-HA insert (Fig. 6B). Monochlorobimane, a membrane-permeant, nonfluorescent compound, is specifically conjugated with GSH by cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) to generate the intensely fluorescent, membrane-impermeant S-conjugate, monochlorobimane-GS (Shrieve et al., 1988; Oude Elferink et al., 1993; Ishikawa et al., 1994). Given that the GS-X pumps of both animal and plant cells exhibit activity toward a broad range of S-conjugates, including monochlorobimane-GS (Ishikawa et al., 1994; Martinoia et al., 1993), and DNP-GS uptake by the yeast enzyme was reversibly inhibited by this compound (Table 2), suggesting competition between monochlorobimane-GS and DNP-GS for a common uptake mechanism, exogenous monochlorobimane satisfies the minimum requirements of a sensitive probe for monitoring the intracellular transport and localization of its S-conjugate. Fluorescence microscopy of DTY165 and DTY167 cells after incubation in growth medium containing monochlorobimane provided direct evidence that YCF1 contributes to the vacuolar accumulation of its glutathione S-conjugate by intact cells (Fig. 7). DTY165 cells exhibited an intense punctate fluorescence, corresponding to the vacuole as determined by Nomarski microscopy, after 6 h of incubation with monochlorobimane (Fig. 7, A and C). The fluorescence associated with vacuolar monochlorobimane-GS was by comparison severely attenuated in most, and completely absent from many, DTY167 cells (Fig. 7, B and D). The experiments described demonstrate that uptake of the model glutathione S-conjugate, DNP-GS, by vacuolar membrane vesicles isolated from S. cerevisiae proceeds by two parallel pathways: one that is directly energized by MgATP and another that is driven by the inside-positive Δψ established by the V-ATPase (Fig. 8). Of these two pathways, only the former is catalyzed by YCF1. Vacuolar membrane vesicles purified from the wild type strain, DTY165, are competent in both MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive uptake and uncoupler-sensitive uptake but membranes from the ycf1Δ strain, DTY167, are more than 90% deficient in MgATP-dependent, uncoupler-insensitive uptake. Three primary findings implicate MgATP, rather than a preformed electrochemical gradient, as the immediate energy source for YCF1-mediated DNP-GS transport. (i) Abrogation of the development of an inside-acid, inside-positive Δμ¯H+ YCF1-independent uptake, by contrast, has the characteristics of a DNP-GS (anion) uniport driven by the inside-positive Δψ established as a result of electrogenic H+-translocation by the V-ATPase. Much of the DNP-GS transport activity remaining in the vacuolar membrane fraction from ycf1Δ mutants is abolished by V-ATPase inhibitors and electrogenic uncouplers (FCCP and gramicidin D) but unaffected by vanadate, verapamil, vinblastine, and electroneutral uncouplers (NH4Cl) (Fig. 8). The functional resemblance between the YCF1-encoded DNP-GS transporter of S. cerevisiae and the GS-X pumps of animal and plant cells is striking. Like YCF1-mediated transport, DNP-GS uptake by membrane vesicles derived from rat liver canaliculus (Akerboom et al., 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1990), MRP1-transfected human cells (Leier et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994) and plant vacuoles (Martinoia et al., 1993; Li et al., 1995) is sensitive to inhibition by vanadate and GSSG but not GSH. Moreover, in strict correspondence with the functional characteristics of MRP1 (Muller et al., 1994) and the plant vacuolar GS-X pump (Li et al., 1995), YCF1-catalyzed DNP-GS transport is also subject to inhibition by S-conjugates of herbicides (e.g. metolachlor-GS) and the alkaloids, vinblastine and verapamil. These similarities, in combination with the congruence of their kinetic parameters, notably Km(DNP-GS) and Km(MgATP) (see Table 4 in Li et al., 1995), suggest that the glutathione-conjugate transporters of animals, plants, and yeast are catalytically equivalent. Two important corollaries therefore follow. First, YCF1 is not only a structural homolog of MRP1 but also a functional homolog. By implication, the yeast YCF1 gene and ycf1Δ mutants, respectively, fulfill the requirements of probes for and null backgrounds against which the corresponding genes from molecularly less well characterized systems, such as plants, may be identified. Second, it is probable that MRP1 and YCF1 serve similar roles in vivo. Since the glutathione S-conjugation reaction mediated by cytosolic GSTs is known to be instrumental in the detoxification of lipophilic electrophiles derived from exogenous or endogenous sources, it has been proposed that through the concerted actions of GSTs and the GS-X pump, mammalian and plant cells can confer a common structural determinant on and increase the water solubility of the toxins in question and thereby eliminate them from the cytosol by MgATP-dependent transport (Ishikawa et al., 1991; Martinoia et al., 1993; Li et al., 1995). The existence of ostensibly the same transport function in the vacuolar membrane of wild type cells, the increased sensitivity of ycf1Δ mutants to the toxic effects of CDNB and the capacity of plasmid-encoded YCF1 to rescue the hypersensitive mutant phenotype collectively indicate operation of an analogous transport-based, detoxification mechanism in yeast. The tight association between YCF1 and the vacuolar membrane is notable. YCF1-mediated DNP-GS transport copurifies with α-mannosidase and V-ATPase activity but not with any of the nonvacuolar membrane markers examined (NADPH cytochrome c reductase, GDPase, F-ATPase, P-ATPase), exposure of intact wild type cells to monochlorobimane results in vacuolar localization of its fluorescent GS derivative, and expression of functional plasmid-encoded YCF1-HA in ycf1Δ cells enhances vacuolar DNP-GS uptake concomitant with rescue of the CDNB hypersensitive phenotype. Localization of YCF1 to the vacuolar membrane may be instructive in the context of two other recent studies. The first of these is the demonstration that cisplatin-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 (HL-60/R-CP) cells, displaying functional overexpression of the GS-X pump, mediate MgATP-dependent accumulation of monochlorobimane-GS into intracellular vesicles (Ishikawa et al., 1994). Given the capacity of HL-60/R-CP cells for the eventual excretion of monochlorobimane-GS, this finding is consistent with the initial accumulation of S-conjugates into intracellular vesicles by the GS-X pump and their subsequent elimination by exocytosis. The second of these is the finding that temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae sec6-4 mutants, defective in the final step of the vesicular secretory pathway (fusion with the plasma membrane) accumulate secretory vesicles containing glutathione S-conjugate pump activity at the nonpermissive temperature (St-Pierre et al., 1994). Since the transporter concerned is kinetically similar to the GS-X pump of mammalian cells and the corresponding functions of plant and yeast vacuolar membrane vesicles but the rates and extents of transport by yeast secretory vesicles are some 30-40-fold lower, two alternative explanations may apply. Either the secretory vesicles prepared by St-Pierre et al.(1994) were 2-4% contaminated with vacuolar membrane vesicles or the presence of GS-X pump activity in this fraction reflects its redistribution in preparation for the fusion of S-conjugate-loaded vesicles with the plasma membrane. Further experiments are required to distinguish between these alternatives but the second interpretation would agree with the conclusions of Ishikawa et al.(1994) and implicate ultimate exocytosis of intracellularly compartmented glutathione S-conjugates in both animal and yeast cells. A fundamental distinction between animal, yeast and plant cells may therefore correspond to the necessity for “storage excretion” in plants (Martinoia et al., 1993). Mammalian and yeast cells have the option of excreting conjugates to the external medium, for eventual elimination by the kidneys in mammals, but terrestrial plants are primarily dependent on the sequestration of noxious compounds in their large central vacuoles. Thus, what might be an intermediate step in the elimination of xenobiotics from the cytosol of mammalian, and possibly yeast cells, intracellular compartmentation, probably constitutes the ultimate phase of detoxification in plants. Given MRP's membership of a new subclass of ABC transporter and its involvement in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, disclosure of its functional and structural equivalent in an organism of such manipulability as yeast opens the way for its detailed molecular characterization. In addition, since it is now evident that the transport of herbicides in plants after their conjugation with GSH is catalyzed by a similar transporter, there is a strong possibility that studies of yeast YCF1 will also directly impinge on xenobiotic detoxification in plants and bioremediation in general."

Upon ligand binding, steroid receptors interact with specific DNA sequences and regulate the transcriptional activity of target genes (1.Carson-Jurica M.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

However, in natural target genes, the binding site can deviate considerably from the consensus sequence. Analysis of natural and synthetic promoters has shown that steroid receptors are able to act synergistically with a variety of other transcription factors(2.Truss M. Beato M. Endocr.

Double stranded oligonucleotides spanning three copies of the ARR-1S, GTGGTGCAGGGATCAGGGAG; ARR-2S, CAGGGATCAGGGAGTCTCAC; ARR-3S region, GAGTCTACAATCTCCTG and the ARR-2S mutants (mutations are underlined); ARR-2S-1, CAGGGGATGAGGGAGTCTCAC; ARR-2S-2, CAGGGATCAGGGACTCTCAC; and ARR-2S-3, CAGGGATCAGCGAGTCTCAC, containing SalI compatible ends were inserted in the SalI site of PSA-12-LUC. All constructs were verified by sequencing. LNCaP cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method essentially as described (29.Chen C. Okyama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4789) Google Scholar), using 1 × 106 cells per 25-cm2 flask, 5 μg of the appropriate PSA-LUC construct, and where indicated 2.5 μg of pAR0 or PSTC GR 3-795 (GR expression vector). After overnight incubation with the precipitate, the culture medium was removed and replaced by phosphate-buffered saline, containing 15% glycerol (incubation for 90 s at room temperature). Subsequently, transfected cells were incubated in culture medium in the absence or presence of the appropriate hormone (R1881 or dexamethasone) for at least 24 h. Transfections were performed at least three times in duplicate, using at least two independent plasmid isolates. Luciferase activities were corrected for variations in protein concentrations within the 100 μl of cell extracts. Luciferase activities and relative induction factors are expressed as mean and standard error (S.E.). Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol). Next, 100 μl of Luciferin (0.25 μM) (Sigma), 0.25 μM ATP was added to 100 μl of each extract, and luciferase activity was measured in a LUMAC 2500 M Biocounter (LUMAC, Landgraaf, The Netherlands). After a delay of 2 s (according to supplier), the light emission during 5 s was recorded. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al.(30.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

AR synthesis was in the presence of 10 μM ZnCl2. Production in Escherichia coli, and purification of AR(DBD) was done as described previously(27.De Vos P. Claessens F. Winderickx J. Van Dijck P.

For gel retardation assays, 20-50 × 103 cpm of each probe was added to 20 μl of reaction mixture, containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μM ZnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 μl of 10 × binding buffer (100 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 300 mM KCl, 62.5 mM MgCl2, and 30% glycerol), and in indicated cases 10 μg of LNCaP nuclear protein, in vitro translated AR (7-10 fmol) or AR(DBD) (5 pmol). In experiments using the AR antibody Sp197 (epitope amino acid residues 1-20), 0.1-μl portions of antiserum were added to the reaction mixture(32.Kuiper G.G.J.M. de Ruiter P.E. Trapman J. Boersma W.J.A. Grootegoed J.A. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Incubation was for 30 min at room temperature. In addition to oligonucleotides described above (100-fold excess of) double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a C/EBP binding site, 5′-GACCTTACCACTTTCACAATCTGCTAG-3′(33.Crossly M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and a glucocorticoid response element, 5′-TCGACTGTACAGGATGTTCTAGCTACT-3′ (Promega), were used in competition experiments. Samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide (19:1) gel and electrophoresed in a 50 mM Tris-HCl, 41.5 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA buffer for 2 h at 150 V and room temperature. Subsequently, gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. In a previous study we analyzed androgen regulation of the PSA promoter in COS cells which were co-transfected with several different PSA promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs and the AR expression vector pAR0(23.Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A.G.M. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This resulted in the functional characterization of an ARE (AGAACAgcaAGTGCT), which is closely related to the consensus sequence, at position −170, and the identification of a second region, from −539 to −324, important for PSA promoter activity. Essentially the same data were obtained in LNCaP cells which endogenously express the AR and PSA gene (Fig. 1A). Transfection of PSA-4-LUC (−632/+12) or PSA-5-LUC (−539/+12) resulted in an approximately 7-fold higher LUC activity in the presence of R1881 than in its absence. Similar results were found with constructs containing longer promoter fragments (up to approximately 4 kilobases (data not shown)). Removal of the −539 to −324 fragment (PSA-6-LUC) caused a 3.5-fold drop in relative induction. Subsequent removal of the −324 to −157 region (containing the ARE sequence at position −170) resulted in the complete abolishment of androgen induction (construct PSA-7-LUC). To investigate in more detail sequences in the −539 to −324 region important for PSA promoter activity, a series of exonuclease III deletions was generated (see Fig. 1B for PSA promoter fragments in different constructs). Transfection of LNCaP cells with constructs PSA-8-LUC, PSA-9-LUC, and PSA-10-LUC resulted in a high (6-7-fold) androgen-regulated PSA promoter activity, which is comparable to that of the PSA-5 construct. Importantly, construct PSA-11-LUC, starting at −376, showed a low (2.2-fold), androgen-induced activity, which is identical to that of PSA-6 (starting at −324). These results indicated sequences in the region −395 to −376 to be essential for high androgen-induced PSA promoter activity. Co-transfection with the AR expression plasmid pAR0 resulted in considerably higher PSA promoter activity, both in absolute values as well as in relative induction levels without affecting the significance of the −324 to −157 region containing the ARE at position −170, and the −395 to −376 region (Fig. 1A). The co-transfection experiments showed again that truncation of the promoter from −395 to −376 gives rise to a markedly lower androgen induced activity (compare PSA-10 and PSA-11); deletion of the −324 to −157 region again resulted in a complete loss of androgen inducibility of the PSA promoter (compare PSA-6 and PSA-7). Mutations in the ARE at −170 in construct PSA-4-LUC resulted in an almost complete inhibition of androgen activation of the PSA promoter ((23.Riegman P.H.J. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A.G.M. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and data not shown), indicating cooperativity between the −395 to −376 region and the ARE sequence at position −170. To confirm that the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT(−170) was able to interact directly with the AR, gel retardation experiments were done with LNCaP nuclear extracts, in vitro synthesized AR, and AR DNA-binding domain (AR(DBD)) produced in E. coli (Fig. 2, A-C). Using LNCaP nuclear extract, addition of an AR-specific antibody (Sp197) to the incubation mixture resulted in the visualization of a stable, specifically supershifted AR-ARE(−170) complex (compare Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4). The retarded complexes visible in the absence of antibody Sp197 (lane 1) are considered to be nonspecific because a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ARE(−170) did not inhibit the formation of these complexes (lane 3). Additionally, none of these bands was supershifted after adding the specific AR antibody (lane 2). A specific AR•ARE(−170) retarded complex could be observed if in vitro synthesized AR was used, addition of the Sp197 antibody again resulted in the formation of a much more stable supershifted complex (Fig. 2B). Application of the AR(DBD) in the gel retardation assay revealed a clear AR(DBD)•ARE(−170) complex in the absence of antibody (Fig. 2C). To further elucidate the properties of the −395 to −375 region, one and three copies of an oligonucleotide, spanning this region (−400 to −366; GTGGTGCAGGGATCAGGGAGTCTCACAATCTCCTG (denoted ARR, androgen response region) underlined in Fig. 1B) were inserted in front of a “minimal” PSA promoter, starting at position −174. The minimal PSA promoter (PSA-12-LUC), which contains the TATA box and ARE(−170), was approximately 6 times more active in R1881-treated, pARO co-transfected LNCaP cells than in the absence of hormone (Fig. 3A). Constructs PSA-12.1s-LUC and PSA-12.1as-LUC, containing one ARR copy in sense and antisense orientation, respectively, gave rise to an increased R1881-induced activity of the promoter (22-23-fold induction). PSA-12.3-LUC, with three ARR copies, showed a 185-fold higher promoter activity in the presence of R1881, clearly indicating cooperativity between the ARR motifs. Importantly, even three ARR copies did not affect basal PSA promoter activity in the absence of hormone. This suggested that ARR activity could be directly androgen regulated. To investigate this further, one or three ARR copies were inserted in front of a minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked to the LUC gene and co-transfected with pAR0 to LNCaP cells. Basal TK promoter activity was hardly inducible by androgen (Fig. 3B). The construct containing one ARR (TK-1-LUC) showed a 4.7-fold higher LUC activity in the presence of R1881 than in the absence of hormone. TK-3-LUC (with three ARR copies) showed a 104-fold induction. In the absence of hormone, the ARR-TK-LUC reporters had the same activity as the TK-LUC basal construct. To find out whether the AR could directly interact with the ARR(−400 to −366), a series of in vitro protein-DNA interaction experiments was carried out. First of all, nuclear extract of LNCaP cells grown in the presence of R1881 was used to study proteins interacting with the ARR. Gel retardation analysis with this extract revealed the presence of at least three specific complexes (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3). Incubation with antibody Sp197 did not result in a visible supershift (Fig. 4A, lane 2; compare Fig. 2A for ARE(−170) shifts), nor could one of the complexes be competed with an excess of unlabeled ARE(−170) (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Identical complexes were formed with extracts from cells grown in the absence or presence of hormone, indicating that the expression or activity of none of the proteins visualized in Fig. 4B is androgen regulated. If in vitro synthesized AR was used in AR-ARR gel retardation assays in the presence of Sp197 a very weak retarded complex could be detected (Fig. 4C), suggesting the presence of a low affinity AR binding site in the ARR. In agreement with this observation, a 100-fold excess of ARR could partially compete the formation of an AR•ARE(−170) complex (Fig. 4C, lanes 3-6). A similar excess of unlabeled ARE completely inhibited the formation of the AR•ARE complex. The unrelated C/EBP oligo had no effect on AR•ARE complex formation. The most sensitive assay, gel retardation with AR(DBD), produced in E. coli clearly revealed the formation of an AR(DBD)•ARR complex (Fig. 4D). To find the precise sequence in ARR which was responsible for AR binding, the ARR was subdivided into three partially overlapping fragments. Gel retardation assay with AR(DBD) and the three ARR subfragments 1S (GTGGTGCAGGGATCAGGGAG (−400 to −381)), 2S (CAGGGATCAGGGAGTCTCAC (−394 to −375)), and 3S (GAGTCTCACAATCTCCTG (−383 to −366)) showed that 2S contained the AR binding sequence, no or extremely weak binding was detected with 1S and 3S (Fig. 5A). Next, three copies of 1S, 2S, and 3S were inserted in front of the minimal PSA promoter construct PSA-12-LUC and co-transfected with pAR0 to LNCaP cells. The construct containing three copies of the 1S region (PSA-1S-LUC) gave rise to a 9.6-fold higher activity in the presence of R1881 than in the absence (Fig. 5B). Construct PSA-2S-LUC, containing three copies of 2S gave rise to a 128-fold higher activity upon R1881 treatment. The construct with three copies of 3S (PSA-3S-LUC) produced a 7.1-fold higher activity in the presence of R1881. So, there is complete concordance between the presence of AR binding and functional, hormone-dependent enhancer activity in 2S, and the absence of these activities in 1S and 3S. Sequence alignment showed that in 2S the highest percentage of homology to the ARE consensus sequence is in the sequence GGATCAgggAGTCTC. This sequence deviates in 2 out of 6 most essential positions, (positions 2, 3, and 5 in each half-site, underlined) and overall in 6 out of 12 positions from the ARE consensus GGTACAnnnTGTTCT. To test whether this sequence could indeed be responsible for low affinity AR binding, gel retardation analyses were performed with five ARR-2S mutants (mutations are underlined). Two mutants expected to decrease AR affinity to the putative AR binding site, ARR-2S-1 (GGATGAgggAGTCTC) and ARR-2S-2 (GGATCAgggACTCTC), and one presumed silent mutant, ARR-2S-3 (GGATCAgcgAGTCTC), were tested for their AR binding capacity (Fig. 6A). Gel retardation experiments confirmed our hypothesis: AR binding to ARR-2S-1 and ARR-2S-2 was almost completely abolished; ARR-2S-3 did not show a marked difference in AR affinity as compared to ARR-2S. AR(DBD) gel retardation with mutants with a higher homology to the consensus ARE sequence (ARR-2S-4 and ARR-2S-5: GGATCAgggAGTTCC and GGAACAgggTGTTCC, respectively) substantiated these findings. Next, mutated 2S elements were tested in LNCaP cells for enhancer activity. To this end, three of the mutant oligonucleotides, 2S-1, 2S-2 (both abolishing AR-binding), and 2S-3 (spacer mutation), were cloned in front of the minimal PSA promoter construct PSA-12-LUC. PSA-2S-1-LUC and PSA-2S-2-LUC were hardly more active than PSA-12-LUC upon R1881 induction in AR co-transfected LNCaP cells (Fig. 6B). Construct PSA-2S-3-LUC showed a 100-fold higher activity in the presence than in the absence of R1881. These data strongly suggest the importance of the GGATCAgggAGTCTC motif in androgen-regulated activity of the ARR in the PSA promoter. Because on the one hand the DNA motif for high affinity AR and GR binding is identical and on the other hand AR and GR might show specificity on individual promoters, we investigated whether GR was able to mediate PSA promoter activity. LNCaP cells were co-transfected with the GR expression plasmid PSTC-GR and selected PSA-LUC constructs. Without GR co-transfection, no response of the different PSA promoters to dexamethasone was observed (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 7A, the pattern of PSA promoter activity induced by dexamethasone in the presence of GR turned out to be identical to AR mediated activity (compare with Fig. 1A): the ARE at position −170 could function as a glucocorticoid response element and the ARR(−400 to −366) was needed for maximal dexamethasone inducibility. Co-transfection of LNCaP cells with PSTC-GR and the constructs containing one and three copies of the ARR(−400) linked to the minimal PSA promoter or TK promoter showed a very strong synergistic, dexamethasone"

Briefly, the cells were incubated overnight in phosphate-free medium, then transferred to fresh medium containing 32Pi (0.2 mCi/ml) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The cells were then activated for 12.5 min with PMA (1 μg/ml/108 cells), after which their p47phox was isolated and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described before(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p47phox was isolated by immunoprecipitation from resting neutrophils exactly as described elsewhere(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Park J.-W. El Benna J. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L. Chanock S.J. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Labeling with protein kinase A was performed by incubating a reaction mixture containing 1 μg of p47phox, 50 μM (1 μCi) [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 μg of protein kinase A (catalytic subunit) in 50 μl of a buffer containing 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM NaF, and 0.2 mM β-glycerophosphate for 30 min at 37°C. For the protein kinase C reaction, 1 μg of immunopurified p47phox was incubated with 0.5 μg of protein kinase C in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM (1 μCi) [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg/ml diolein, and 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30°C. Phosphorylation by MAP kinase was accomplished by incubating 1 μg of p47phox with 0.5 μg of MAP kinase (p42-ERK2) and 50 μM (1 μCi) [γ-32P]ATP under the conditions used for the protein kinase A reaction. Immunoprecipitated or recombinant 32P-labeled p47phox was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose using the Laemmli (13.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Towbin et al. (14.Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) systems, respectively. Labeled p47phox was detected on the immunoblot by a specific anti-peptide antibody (15.Park J-W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by autoradiography for 1 to 2 h. The band corresponding to p47phox was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by high voltage electrophoresis and chromatography on a cellulose thin layer plate as described elsewhere(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were detected by exposing the thin layer plates to Reflexion film (DuPont NEN) for 24-72 h at −70°C with an intensifying screen. For the peptide-containing serines 359 and 370, phosphorylation was analyzed by digesting the blotted p47phox with Glu-C, separating the resulting peptides by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and subjecting the resulting gel to autoradiography. Phosphorylated peptide 359/370 appears as a radioactive band at ≈4 kDa. Each autoradiogram is representative of two or three separate experiments, each carried out with a different transfection. During the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase in phagocytes and B lymphocytes, p47phox becomes extensively phosphorylated. Using CNBr cleavage followed by proteolysis, Tricine gel electrophoresis, and Edman degradation, we showed that the targets of phosphorylation in p47phox are the serine residues lying between Ser303 and Ser379 inclusively, and that among these serines the following are phosphorylated: Ser303, Ser304, Ser320, Ser328, Ser345, Ser348, Ser359 and/or Ser370, and Ser379(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the last phosphorylated much less extensively than the rest. The methods employed in that study were elaborate and time-consuming, however, and presented certain limitations: in qualitative analysis because manual Edman degradation is only reliable through the first 10-15 cycles (18.Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in quantitative analysis because of unequal losses of phosphorylated peptides during the workup of the samples. A simpler and more quantifiable method would be the analysis of phosphorylation by two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping(17.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out experiments to identify the phosphopeptides on the tryptic peptide map of 32P-labeled p47phox. Our approach was to express p47phox Ser → Ala mutants in EBV-transformed p47phox-deficient B lymphocytes; to load these lymphocytes with 32Pi and then activate them with PMA to label their p47phox; and finally to purify the labeled p47phox mutants, map them, and look for differences between those maps and the map of 32P-labeled WT p47phox. In a tryptic digest of p47phox, the phosphorylation targets are distributed among several peptides (Table 1; trypsin is unable to split Lys-Pro and Arg-Pro bonds)(17.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Of these, the peptide containing Ser379 and Ser381 would probably be difficult to see because it would contain very little 32P relative to the other peptides(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 1, left) showed that the map of WT p47phox contained six major phosphopeptides (arrows), all of which were seen in each of 15 separate experiments, together with several minor phosphopeptides whose presence in the maps was inconstant. Taking into consideration the serines known to be phosphorylated during oxidase activation (10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the peptides generated by tryptic digestion of p47phox (Table 1), we made a number of mutants in which two or more serines had been converted to alanines, and used these together with mutants containing a single Ser → Ala change to identify the labeled peptides on the two-dimensional map.Tabled 1Figure 1:Phosphopeptide maps of p47phoxisolated from PMA-activated p47phox-deficient B lymphocytes expressing WT and mutant forms of p47phox. Labeling and activation of EBV-transformed p47phox-deficient B lymphoblasts expressing WT and mutant p47phox, isolation and purification of the labeled p47phox, and phosphopeptide mapping were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutations are indicated in a corner of each panel; 47S = WT. The point of application of the sample is indicated by the dot in the lower left corner of each panel. Missing peptides are outlined with dotted lines. Left, mutations that produce a change in the phosphopeptide map. Arrows show the major phosphorylated peptides. Right, mutations that have no effect on the phosphopeptide map.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Restricting our analysis to the six constant phosphopeptides (Fig. 1), we found that maps of p47phox mutants containing single Ser → Ala mutations were the same as WT maps (Fig. 1, left) except for the map of S320A, which lacked a single spot, and the map of S315A, which lacked two spots (Fig. 1, left). The latter result suggests that at least two peptides were produced, probably because of partial cleavage at the sequence RKR (residues 316-318). Sequences containing basic residues in tandem are known to be susceptible to partial cleavage(17.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Certain of the peptides of interest contain two serines, and it may be that the elimination of both serines is necessary to eliminate a spot corresponding to such a peptide. In accord with this idea, a single spot was eliminated from the phosphopeptide maps of S303A,S304A and S345A,S348A (Fig. 1, left). The map of the sextuple mutant S328A-S379A lacked two spots: one known to correspond to the peptide Ser345/345, and another that by elimination has to represent the two peptides Ser328 and Ser359/370, because the spots corresponding to the remaining phosphopeptides (i.e. Ser303/304, Ser315, and Ser320) were present on the map. ( 2There is too little 32P in Ser379 to produce a spot on the autoradiogram under the conditions used for these experiments(11.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).) It appears that the phosphorylated peptides Ser328 and Ser359/370 coincide on the tryptic peptide map. Finally, these results suggest that Ser310 is not phosphorylated during oxidase activation. A diagram of the tryptic peptide map of WT p47phox giving the identities of the major peptides is shown in Fig. 2. This diagram also shows the location of 32Pi, which proved to be a useful marker for identifying peptides on maps with missing spots. 32Pi lies at a level between peptides Ser315 and Ser345/348, and migrates toward the anode, while the phosphopeptides all migrate toward the cathode. The location of the 32Pi spot relative to the point of application of the sample (marked by a plus sign (+) in the lower left corner of the figure) provides a mobility standard that allows the identification of individual peptides even in the absence of information concerning the overall distribution of spots on the chromatogram, as would occur under conditions in which only one or two peptides are phosphorylated. Using tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we compared the sites of phosphorylation of p47phox from activated human neutrophils and EBV-transformed normal B lymphocytes. The results (Fig. 3) showed that the same six major phosphopeptides appeared in both maps. These findings suggest that the p47phox phosphopeptide assignments made through the experiments described above are valid for neutrophils as well as B lymphocytes, and that this method can therefore be employed to study the phosphorylation of p47phox during the activation of neutrophils and probably other phagocytes as well. We employed tryptic phosphopeptide mapping to identify the sites phosphorylated by various kinases thought to be involved in the regulation of O22 production by the respiratory burst oxidase. For this purpose, p47phox immunopurified from resting neutrophils was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP together with the kinase of interest (protein kinase A, protein kinase C, or MAP kinase), then repurified and analyzed either by CNBr cleavage followed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (19.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 166: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) or by tryptic peptide mapping. As shown previously with p47phox that had been phosphorylated in intact cells(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the sites phosphorylated in vitro by all three kinases were located in the C-terminal CNBr peptide of the labeled p47phox (Fig. 4). Peptide mapping showed that protein kinase C phosphorylated all the p47phox peptides except the peptide corresponding to Ser345/348 (Fig. 5, top), while protein kinase A, a more selective kinase, phosphorylated only the Ser320 peptide and the Ser328 and/or the Ser359/370 peptides (Fig. 5, middle). When p47phox phosphorylated by protein kinase C or protein kinase A was cleaved by Glu-C endopeptidase and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a labeled fragment appeared at 4 kDa (Fig. 6), indicating that the peptide containing Ser359/370 was phosphorylated. The status of Ser328 remained unresolved, although its phosphorylation in PMA-activated neutrophils suggests that it was probably phosphorylated at least by protein kinase C. MAP kinase, used here as an example of a proline-directed kinase, phosphorylated only the Ser345/348 peptide, as expected from the sequences around the target serines in p47phox (Fig. 5, bottom). Taken together, these results suggest that the three kinases could play different roles in regulating the activity of the respiratory burst oxidase.Figure 5:Phosphopeptide maps of p47phoxphosphorylated with protein kinase C (top), protein kinase A (middle), and MAP kinase (bottom). The experiment was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” using p47phox purified from human neutrophils. The point of application of the sample is indicated by the dot in the lower left corner of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6:Phosphorylation of phosphopeptide 359/370 by protein kinase C and protein kinase A. The experiment was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A labeled band at ≈4 kDa is seen in both tracks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On the phosphopeptide maps of purified p47phox that had been labeled with a known kinase, major spots were seen that were not present on the maps of p47phox labeled in whole cells. These spots were disregarded as irrelevant to the physiological labeling pattern of activated p47phox. Tryptic peptide mapping of p47phox labeled with 32P either in intact cells or in a cell-free system provides an efficient way of identifying which of the target peptides are phosphorylated, and in combination with image analysis of radioactivity could yield important information on the relative quantities of phosphate on various of the serines of the protein. The results obtained by tryptic peptide mapping retain a certain amount of ambiguity, however, because they provide no information as to which of the two serines on a two-serine peptide is (are) phosphorylated. Whether it is important to answer that question will depend on studies correlating structure and function in Ser → Ala mutants of p47phox, although a partial answer is provided by our recent report showing that Ser → Ala mutations of individual serines from position 303 to 370 have little effect on oxidase activity(11.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The present results provide some information as to the order of phosphorylation of the target serines on p47phox. Except for the mutant S315A, whose anomalous properties were discussed above, mutations affecting the serines on a single tryptic peptide caused the loss of at most one spot on the phosphopeptide map. This finding suggests that there is no target serine whose phosphorylation is absolutely dependent on the phosphorylation of a serine on a different peptide, or the phosphorylation of a group of such serines. Rather, it appears that these serines can be phosphorylated in any order. We previously showed that when the respiratory burst oxidase is activated, serines Ser303, Ser304, Ser320, Ser328, Ser345, Ser348, Ser359 and/or Ser370, and Ser379 of p47phox are phosphorylated(10.El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The present studies confirm the earlier results by another method, and in addition have shown that Ser315 is also phosphorylated, bringing the total number of phosphorylated serines in the C-terminal region of activated p47phox to 9 or 10. Ser379 has already been found to play an important role in oxidase activation and p47phox translocation, and it is likely that protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of other target serines is equally important. In fact, several lines of evidence already support a role for protein kinase C in oxidase activation. For example, PMA, an activator of several forms of protein kinase C, is a powerful stimulator of O22 production in whole cells(20.Wolfson M. McPhail L.C. Nasrallah V.N. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2057-2062PubMed Google Scholar). Purified p47phox is a good substrate for protein kinase C in vitro(21.Kramer I.M. Verhoeven A.J. van der Bend R.L. Weening R.S. Roos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2352-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (and other kinases), blocks PMA-induced O22 generation as well as the phosphorylation of p47phox(22.Combadiere C. El Benna J. Pedruzzi E. Hakim J. Perianin A. Blood. 1993; 82: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. McCormick S. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we show in this study that the phosphopeptide map of p47phox isolated from PMA-activated neutrophils and EBV-transformed B lymphocytes is identical to the phosphopeptide map of p47phox phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C, except for the absence of the Ser345/348 peptide from the latter map. These findings suggest that one or more of the PMA-responsive forms of protein kinase C could be a critical mediator of oxidase activation. We showed recently that Ser345 and Ser348 are not required for oxidase activation(11.Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), since the S345A,S348A mutant of p47phox is fully active in EBV-transformed B cells. This finding suggests that, in contrast to protein kinase C, phosphorylation of p47phox by proline-directed kinases such as MAP kinase may have little to do with oxidase activation. The role of target serines in the regulation of oxidase activity is currently under investigation in our laboratory. Phosphorylation of p47phox was also shown to occur upon addition of dibutyryl cAMP to neutrophil cytoplasts or cytosol, suggesting that p47phox is also a substrate for protein kinase A(24.Kramer I.J.M. van der Bend R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dibutyryl cAMP did not induce O22 production, however, indicating that phosphorylation by protein kinase A alone is not sufficient to activate the oxidase. It is possible, in fact, that the the phosphorylation of p47phox by protein kinase A prevents the assembly of the oxidase, since the elevation of neutrophil cAMP inhibits O22 production(25.Tyagi S.R. Olson S.C. Burnham D.N. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3498-3504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that protein kinase A phosphorylates fewer target serines than protein kinase C, phosphorylating only peptides Ser320, Ser359/370, and possibly Ser328 (a maximum of four target serines), in contrast to the five peptides (up to seven target serines) phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The protein kinase A targets could be responsible for the negative regulation of p47phox phosphorylation and oxidase activation by protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W2046353892,"A protein kinase was located in the cytosol of pea mesophyll cells. The protein kinase phosphorylates, in an ATP-dependent manner, chloroplast-destined precursor proteins but not precursor proteins, which are located to plant mitochondria or plant peroxisomes. The phosphorylation occurs on either serine or threonine residues, depending on the precursor protein used. We demonstrate the specific phosphorylation of the precursor forms of the chloroplast stroma proteins ferredoxin (preFd), small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase (preSSU), the thylakoid localized light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (preLHCP), and the thylakoid lumen-localized proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex of 23 kDa (preOE23) and 33 kDa (preOE33). In the case of thylakoid lumen proteins which possess bipartite transit sequences, the phosphorylation occurs within the stroma-targeting domain. By using single amino acid substitution within the presequences of preSSU, preOE23, and preOE33, we were able to tentatively identify a consensus motif for the precursor protein protein kinase. This motif is (P/G)Xn(R/K)Xn(S/T)Xn(S∗/T∗), were n = 0-3 amino acids spacer and S∗/T∗ represents the phosphate acceptor. The precursor protein protein kinase is present only in plant extracts, e.g. wheat germ and pea, but not in a reticulocyte lysate. Protein import experiments into chloroplasts revealed that phosphorylated preSSU binds to the organelles, but dephosphorylation seems required to complete the translocation process and to obtain complete import. These results suggest that a precursor protein protein phosphatase is involved in chloroplast import and represents a so far unidentified component of the import machinery. In contrast to sucrose synthase, a cytosolic marker protein, the precursor protein protein kinase seems to adhere partially to the chloroplast surface.

INTRODUCTIONChloroplasts and mitochondria contain their own genome; however, the vast majority of their proteins is encoded in the nucleus and synthesized in the cytosol. In general these proteins carry NH2-terminal targeting domains which direct them to the proper organelle in a posttranslational event. Whereas some knowledge about the components and mechanisms which are involved in the recognition and translocation of the precursors on the organellar surface has accumulated (Hirsch et al., 1994; Schnell et al., 1994; Gray and Row, 1995; Soll, 1995), almost nothing is known about the events which take place in the cytosol, after the precursor emerges from the ribosome and before binding to the chloroplast. A loosely folded precursor, however, seems to be a prerequisite for membrane translocation. In all import systems aggregation of highly hydrophobic membrane proteins and premature folding has to be prevented. To attain or maintain such an import-competent, soluble conformation, some (Waegemann et al., 1990) but not all proteins need the help of cytosolic factors in vitro (Pilon et al., 1992). A 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsc70) ( 1The abbreviations used are: hsc70heat shock protein homologue of 70 kDaSSUsmall subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphospate carboxylase/oxygenaseFdferredoxinLHCPchlorophyll a/b-binding protein of the light-harvesting complexOE2323-kDa polypeptide of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem IIOE3333-kDa polypeptide of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem IIF1ββ-subunit of mitochondrial ATPaseMDHperoxysomal malate dehydrogenasepre-precursor form ofi-intermediate processed precursor form ofwtwild typePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).) was found to be involved in the transport of proteins to different destinations, e.g. mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and chloroplasts (Deshaies et al., 1988; Zimmermann et al., 1988; Waegemann et al., 1990). It was also shown that precursor proteins readily interact with hsc70 during translation (Beckmann et al., 1990). Whereas this interaction seems a rather general phenomenon (Ellis and van der Vies, 1991), two cytosolic factors have been described which act as specific chaperones for mitochondrial precursors. These factors, called presequence binding factor and mitochondrial import stimulation factor, have been purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate and rat liver cytosol, respectively, and were shown to recognize mitochondrial presequences and stimulate their import into the organelle (Murakami et al., 1992; Hachiya et al., 1993, 1995). Such cytosolic factors which interact specifically with the organellar targeting domain could be even more important in a plant cell, because the plastids represent an additional compartment to which the cytosolic synthesized precursors have to be properly routed. Whereas the mitochondrial presequences share an overall similar framework, i.e. positively charged residues, amphiphilic α-helical structure in plants, fungi, and mammals (von Heijne, 1986; Hartl et al., 1989), the plastid-directing transit sequences are much more heterogenous in length and secondary structure. The only common features of the chloroplast transit domains are an uncharged NH2-terminal region, a characteristic stromal processing site, and a particularly high content of serine and threonine residues (Karlin-Neumann and Tobin, 1986; von Heijne and Nishikawa, 1991; von Heijne et al., 1989). In order to understand the series of events which ultimately yield a specific and productive routing of precursor proteins to plastids, we have started an investigation on cytosolic components which could be involved in these processes.Here we report the specific phosphorylation of several chloroplast precursor proteins within the stroma-targeting portion of the transit sequences, but not of their mature forms. Phosphorylation seems to inhibit import of precursor proteins into chloroplasts. Mitochondrial or peroxisomal precursors are not recognized by the protein kinase. The protein kinase, which belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family, is a plant-specific enzyme. It was shown to be located in the cytoplasm, but it also adheres to the chloroplast outer envelope.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of preSSU/SSU, preLHCP/LHCP, preOE23/iOE23, preOE33, preFd, and preF1βSeveral plasmids for the overexpression of proteins in Escherichia coli were used. Pet 11c expression vector containing the cDNAs for preSSU and SSU, respectively, both from tobacco, were provided by Dr. R. Klein, University of Kentucky (Klein and Salvucci, 1992). cDNAs for preLHCP and LHCP from pea, both in pDS 12 expression vectors are described in Paulsen et al.(1990). Dr. K. Cline, University of Florida, provided the cDNA clones for preOE23, iOE23, and preOE33 from pea, all in pet 3c plasmids (Cline et al., 1993). The coding sequence for pea preFd was cloned in expression plasmid pet 21d by PCR using full-length preFd cDNA in BscII as template. The sequence of the used forward primer which contains an in frame NcoI site was 5′-CCCCCCCATGGCAACCACACCAGC-3′. The sequence of the reverse primer containing an in frame XhoI site was 5′-GAAAAATTAAGCCTCGAGATC-3′. The PCR product and vector pet 21d were digested with NcoI and XhoI and ligated. The preFd/pet 21d clone obtained was controlled by sequencing. The gene encoding the mitochondrial preF1β from tobacco (Boutry and Chua, 1985) was obtained from Dr. Boutry, University of Louvaine, as a part-length clone (amino acid 1-513) in pEMBL 12. After digestion with NcoI which contains the initiation ATG and SalI, the insert was ligated into an appropriately digested pet 21d vector.With the exception of preLHCP/LHCP plasmids which were transformed into the E. coli strain JM101 all plasmids were introduced in BL21De3 E. coli cells for expression. Expression and isolation of the overproduced proteins was done as described by Paulsen et al.(1990), with the exception that preF1β was expressed at 30°C instead of 37°C. PreF1β and preFd were expressed with a C-terminal His-Tag.Site-directed Mutagenesis of preSSU, preOE23, and preOE33Exchange of serine 31 and serine 34 of tobacco preSSU for alanine yielding cpreSSU-M31-S/A and cpreSSU-M34-S/A, respectively, or the exchange of both amino acids together for alanine resulting in cpreSSU-M31/34-S/A was done by PCR using preSSU cDNA in pet 11c as template. The primers for mutagenesis contain an AflII site, which is an endogenous restriction site in the preSSU cDNA near the mutated region. The exchange of serine for alanine was achieved by a single base exchange (T into G) for each serine. The used forward primer sequences were 5′-CACTGGCCTTAAGGCAGCTGCCTCATTCC-3′, 5′-CACTGGCCTTAAGTCAGCTGCCGCATTCC-3′, and 5′-CACTGGCCTTAAGGCAGCTGCCGCATTCC-3′ for cpreSSU-31-S/A, cpreSSU-M34-S/A, and cpreSSU-M31/34-S/A, respectively. The universal reverse primer for all mutants was 5′-GTTAATTGGTGGCCACACCTGCATGCATTGCAC-3′, which resembles a NsiI restriction site in the preSSU cDNA. The PCR products were digested with AflII and NsiI and ligated into the wild type preSSU cDNA which had been cut by the same restriction enzymes. The clones obtained were sequenced and transformed into BL21De3 cells for expression.Exchange of serine 22 for alanine in preOE23 yielding cpreOE23-M22-S/A was done by recombinant PCR (Innis et al., 1990). For the two primary PCR runs cpreOE23/pet 3c was used as template. For the first amplification T7-promotor-primer (= outside primer) was used as forward primer. The sequence for the reverse primer containing the point mutation (A into C) was 5′-CTTGGCGTTGAGCTAAGGTTCTAG-3′ (= inside primer). For the second amplification, the outside primer sequence was 5′-GATCAGATCTGATATCATC-3′, resembling a region in the multiple cloning site of pet 3c. As an inside primer resembling the complementary sequence of the inside primer of the first primary PCR, including the respective point mutation (T into G), we used 5′-CTAGAACCTTAGCTCAACGCCAAG-3′. The two primary PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis and polyethyleneglycol precipitation. The secondary PCR which was performed by mixing the two primary PCR products, which overlap in the inside primer sequence, with the above described outside primers produce full-length cpreOE23 containing the mutation serine 22 into alanine. This PCR product and pet 3c were digested with NdeI and EcoRV and ligated. The clone cpreOE23-M22-S/A was controlled by sequencing and transformed into BL21De3 cells to produce preOE23-M22-S/A.Exchange of threonine 21 for alanine in preOE33 was also done by recombinant PCR as decribed above. The two outside primers were identical with those of the preOE23 mutation. As inside primers we used 5′-GCGTAGCAACGCATTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAATGCGTTGCTACGC-3′, respectively, containing the mutations (A into G) and (T into C). The template for the two primary amplifications was cpreOE33/pet 3c. The PCR product of the secondary amplification was digested with NdeI and SacI and ligated into appropriate digested pet 24c vector. The obtained clone was controlled by sequencing and transformed into BL21De3 cells to produce preOE33-M21-T/A.PreSSU-M54-R/D was also created by recombinant PCR. As outside primers we used T7-promotor primer and T7-terminator primer. We used the two complementary inside primers 5′-CGGCGGAGATGTGCAATGCATGC-3′ and 5′-GCATGCATTGCACATCTCCGCCG-3′ containing the mutation AGA into GAT and TCT into ATC, respectively. The template DNA for both primary amplifications was tobacco cpreSSU/pet 11c. The PCR product of the secondary amplification was digested with NcoI and NsiI and ligated into appropriate digested wild type cpreSSU/pet 21d. The obtained clone was controlled by sequencing and was transformed in E. coli BL21De3. The protein (preSSU-M54-R/D) was expressed with a C-terminal His-Tag.Preparation of Cytoplasm-enriched Fraction from Pea Mesophyll CellsProtoplasts were prepared from 10-12-day-old pea seedlings as described by Hracky and Soll(1986). The membrane-free cytosolic fraction was frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.Preparation of Chloroplasts and “Chloroplast Supernatant”Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 10-12-day-old peas (Waegemann and Soll, 1991). For the chloroplast supernatant, the isolated chloroplasts were kept in isotonic solution (Waegemann and Soll, 1991) on ice for 30 min in the dark. After reisolation of the organelles by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was used as the chloroplast supernatant and was prepared fresh for each experiment.Phosphorylation AssayA standard phosphorylation (50 μl) was performed in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M MnCl2 with 2.5 μM ATP plus 2-5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). For kinase activity, 10-20 μg of a cytoplasm-enriched protein fraction or 10 μg of wheat germ extract protein were added. The assays contained 1-3 μg of purified overexpressed proteins as substrates which were dissolved in 8 M urea prior to the experiment. The final urea concentration in the phosphorylation assay was 160 mM. The reaction was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and terminated with SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) followed by autoradiography.Analysis of Phosphorylated Amino AcidFor the determination of the phosphoacceptor amino acid, 10 phosphorylation assays with the respective protein substrate were performed and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the bands containing the phosphorylated proteins were excised from the gel. After equilibration (3 × 10 min) in 125 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 45 mM β-mercaptoethanol, the respective protein was electroeluted from the gel slices according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The eluted protein was precipitated with methanol and chloroform (Wessel and Flügge, 1984) and subsequently hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for 2 h at 110°C. The hydrochloric acid was removed by evaporation, and the sample was dissolved in H2O and analyzed by high voltage electrophoresis on Silica Gel 60 chromatography plates (Schleicher & Schüll) according to Hunter and Sefton(1980). The electrophoresis was performed in the presence of 20-40 μg of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine as standards. After electrophoresis at 500 V for 4 h, the plate was dried, sprayed with ninhydrin reagent to mark the phosphoamino acid standards, and exposed on x-ray film.Sucrose Synthase AssaySucrose synthase activity was measured by a coupled enzymatic reaction resulting in the conversion of NAD into NADH (Geigenberger and Stitt, 1993). The first step was performed in a final volume of 100 μl in 20 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM sucrose, and 4 mM UDP with 70 μg of protein of the chloroplast supernatant or cytoplasm. After 30 min at 25°C, the reaction was terminated by incubating for 4 min at 95°C. The produced UDP-glucose was measured in a second step which was performed in a final volume of 600 μl with 50 μl of the first enzyme reaction in 200 mM glycine, pH 8.7, 0.1 mM NAD, and 25 μg of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. NADH production was determined at 334 nm.Preparation of Wheat Germ ExtractUnroasted wheat-germ was ground in liquid nitrogen and subsequently thawed in 40 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, containing 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM magnesium acetate, and 4 mM dithiothreitol. After centrifugation of the homogenate at 10000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was spun again as above. The resulting supernatant was frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Prior to use an aliquot was quickly thawed and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 15 min to remove membranes, ribosomes, and insoluble material.Partial Purification of the Precursor Protein Protein Kinase ActivityPrecursor protein protein kinase activity was enriched from wheat germ extract. Immediately before each chromatography step the homogenate was spun at 250,000 × g for 20 min to remove membranes and insoluble material. The supernatant (50-60 mg of protein) was applied to a 18-ml Q-Sepharose FF column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in TEMP buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing the column with 6 volumes of TEMP buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 500 mM in TEMP buffer. The kinase activity eluted at 240-440 mM NaCl. The active fractions of four Q-Sepharose purifications were pooled, adjusted to pH 7.5, concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell, and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The Q-Sepharose pool (50-60 mg of total protein) was then adjusted to 1 M NaCl, centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and loaded subsequently onto two 50-ml phenyl-Sepharose FF columns (low substitution, Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 M NaCl. After washing the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The active fractions of both columns were pooled, concentrated (7-9 mg of total protein), and finally applied to a 120-ml Superdex 75 Hiload column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Protein kinase activity was predominantly found in fractions 14/15 (0.15-0.25 mg of total protein). After concentrating to 100 μl of Superdex-fraction 14/15 was stored in 50% glycerol at −20°C.Protease Treatment of ChloroplastsIntact isolated pea chloroplasts were incubated with thermolysin (100 μg of thermolysin/mg of chlorophyll) in 330 mM sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM CaCl2 for 20 min on ice. The final chlorophyll concentration was 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml. The treatment was terminated by the addition of a 2-fold molar excess of α-macroglobulin for 15 min on ice. After reisolation of the chloroplasts by centrifugation (1500 × g; 1 min). The organelles were resuspended in 330 mM sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6.Analytical MethodsProtein was determined by the method of Bradford(1976) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli(1970). Silver staining of the gels was done as described in Blum et al.(1987).RESULTSSpecific Phosphorylation of Chloroplast Precursor ProteinsPosttranslational modification of proteins by phosphorylation is an important mechanism in the regulation of cellular processes. The introduction of a phosphate group into a given polypeptide chain is likely to alter its three-dimensional conformation. The import-competent conformation or the exposure of certain motifs for recognition by chaperones, presequence binding factors, or receptors could be influenced by a phosphorylation event within the presequence. The high content of serine and threonine residues in the chloroplast transit sequences suggests a phosphorylation of precursor proteins. To address this question, several chloroplast precursor proteins and their mature proteins were overexpressed in E. coli, recovered in a partially purified form from inclusion bodies (Fig. 1A), and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). As examples of typical soluble stromal proteins, we used the precursor and the mature forms of the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (preSSU/SSU) and of ferredoxin (preFd/Fd). As a member of the thylakoid membrane the precursor and the mature form of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of the light-harvesting complex II (preLHCP/LHCP) were used. The transit sequence of preLHCP has typical stroma directing properties and is cleaved by the stromal processing peptidase in one step in the stroma. Two precursor proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex associated with photosystem II (preOE23•preOE33) were also analyzed. These proteins, which reside at the lumenal side of the thylakoid membranes, possess, in contrast to preLHCP, bipartite presequences consisting of an amino-terminal stroma-targeting domain and an additional thylakoid transfer domain. The stroma-targeting domains of preOE23 and preOE33 are cleaved off in the stroma to yield intermediate sized precursors which are further translocated across the thylakoids and processed finally in the thylakoid lumen. For the OE23 protein this intermediate precursor lacking the stroma-targeting domain, but still possessing the thylakoid transfer domain (iOE23), was also available. Beside these chloroplast proteins we also used overexpressed precursors from the other organelles in the plant cell to which precursor proteins are directed by NH2-terminal-cleavable presequences in a posttranslational manner. As a constituent of plant mitochondria, the precursor of the β-subunit of the ATPase (preF1β) from tobacco was expressed, and as a member of the peroxisomes, we used the precursor and the mature form of malate dehydrogenase (preMDH/MDH) (gift of Ch. Gietl, München) (Gietl et al., 1994).Each of the above described proteins was subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation assay with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of cytoplasmic proteins isolated from pea mesophyll protoplasts (Fig. 1B). All chloroplast precursors examined, i.e. preSSU, preFd, preLHCP, preOE23, and preOE33 became phosphorylated (indicated by > in Fig. 1B). Their mature forms or the intermediate processed form of OE23 (iOE23), however, were not able to serve as a substrate for the cytosolic protein kinase activity, indicating that the phosphorylation occurred in the stromal targeting domain of the transit sequence. The cytoplasm used in the phosphorylation assays is likely to contain several protein kinases (Ranjeva and Boudet, 1987). We observed the phosphorylation of several endogenous proteins in the absence of added precursor proteins (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The pattern of endogenous phosphorylation varied with the different batches of cytoplasm used, while the precursor protein protein kinase activity seemed more stable. This could be due to the long isolation procedure of a cytosolic fraction from protoplasts (see “Materials and Methods”) and to different lengths of storage. The endogenous phosphoproteins were similar to those described by Hracky and Soll(1986). To ascertain that this phosphorylation is specific for chloroplast precursor proteins and not a general event, other precursor proteins carrying NH2-terminal presequences but which are destined for different locations inside the plant cell were also subjected to in vitro phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1B the plant mitochondrial preF1β could not be phosphorylated. The peroxysomal preMDH and also the mature MDH were phosphorylated only very weakly. We conclude that the radioactive label is probably incorporated into the mature part of MDH. Altogether these data demonstrate that a protein kinase is localized in cytoplasm enriched from pea mesophyll cells which is able to specifically phosphorylate precursor proteins destined for the chloroplast compartment. The phosphorylation seems to occur exclusively in the stroma-targeting domain of the presequence.Determination of the Phosphorylation SitesFor most protein kinases the amino acids serine, threonine, or tyrosine serve as phosphoacceptor amino acids. A common feature of all chloroplast transit sequences is their high content (20-30%) of serine and threonine. To determine the identity of the phosphoacceptor group the 32P-labeled precursor proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, excised from the gel, and electroeluted. The eluted proteins were precipitated by CHCl3/MeOH followed by acid hydrolysis at 110°C. The hydrolysate was analyzed by high voltage electrophoresis on silica gel thin layer chromatography plates. We found that serine serves as the phosphate acceptor in preSSU (Fig. 2A), preFd (Fig. 2B), and preOE23 (Fig. 2C), whereas preOE33 was phosphorylated exclusively on a threonine residue (Fig. 2D). In the case of preLHCP, both amino acids incorporated labeled phosphate in almost equal amounts (Fig. 2E). An endogenous phosphorylation site with threonine as phosphate acceptor is present very close to the NH2 terminus of mature LHCP. This site is involved in the regulation of light harvesting in the thylakoids in vivo (Bennett, 1991). Thus this internal phosphorylation site might also be recognized in our in vitro phosphorylation experiments when the precursor form and cytosol are used in the phosphorylation assay. Taken together these results suggest that the functional precursor protein protein kinase belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family.Figure 2:Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated chloroplast precursor proteins. Precursor proteins were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation with wheat germ extract (10 μg of protein) and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electroelution and precipitation the proteins were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl and subsequently analyzed by high voltage electrophoresis on silica gel thin layer chromatography plates. The positions of the phosphoamino acid standards phosphoserine (P-Ser) and phosphothreonine (P-Thr) are indicated beside the respective autoradiogram. A, preSSU; B, preFd; C, preOE23; D, preOE33; E, preLHCP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the phosphorylation sites exactly and to find a putative consensus motif in the chloroplast transit peptides phosphorylated preSSU was treated with the protease trypsin. This resulted in one radioactive labeled fragment (not shown). Sequencing of this peptide revealed that this fragment represents indeed a part of the preSSU transit sequence from tobacco. The fragment comprises amino acid 31-39 of preSSU. Three serines are present in this fragment which could serve as potential phosphate acceptors (Fig. 3). Two of these serines were exchanged for alanine by in vitro mutagenesis. The mutations affected serine 31 and serine 34 which were exchanged either separately resulting in the clones cpreSSU-M31-S/A and cpreSSU-M34-S/A or simultaneously yielding cpreSSU-M31/34-S/A (Fig. 3). The three mutated cDNAs were subsequently expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4, C) and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation as before (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4, 32P). The phosphorylation experiments of the mutated precursor proteins resulted in a reduced 32P incorporation into preSSU-M31-S/A (Fig. 4A, lane 2, 32P) and no incorporation into preSSU-M34-S/A and preSSU-M31/34-S/A (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4, 32P). From these data we conclude that serine 34 is the actual phosphoacceptor in tobacco preSSU, whereas serine 31 might function in the recognition or binding of the kinase.Figure 3:Amino acid sequence of chloroplast precursor proteins and the introduced mutations. Amino acids are listed in the single-letter code. A, the marked box in preSSU-WT indicates the phosphorylated tryptic fragment which was sequenced.

J., Lehrach, H., Housman, D., Buckler, A., Gusella, J. F., and MacDonald, M. E.(1993) Hum. Mol. Genet. 1, 697-703). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of GRK4 with those of the closely related GRK5 and GRK6 suggested the apparent loss of 32 codons in the amino-terminal domain and 46 codons in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK4. These two regions undergo alternative splicing in the GRK4 mRNA, resulting from the presence or absence of exons filling one or both of these apparent gaps. Each inserted sequence maintains the open reading frame, and the deduced amino acid sequences are similar to corresponding regions of GRK5 and GRK6. Thus, the GRK4 mRNA and the GRK4 protein can exist as four distinct variant forms.The human GRK4 gene is composed of 16 exons extending over 75 kilobase pairs of DNA. The two alternatively spliced exons correspond to exons II and XV. The genomic organization of the GRK4 gene is completely distinct from that of the human GRK2 gene, highlighting the evolutionary distance since the divergence of these two genes. Human GRK4 mRNA is expressed highly only in testis, and both alternative exons are abundant in testis mRNA.The four GRK4 proteins have been expressed, and all incorporate [3H]palmitate. GRK4 is capable of augmenting the desensitization of the rat luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor upon coexpression in HEK293 cells and of phosphorylating the agonist-occupied, purified β2-adrenergic receptor, indicating that GRK4 is a functional protein kinase.

Receptors are phosphorylated by GRKs in vitro on multiple serine and threonine residues on intracellular loops and/or the carboxyl-terminal tail. GRK-phosphorylated receptors are bound by arrestin proteins, leading to the functional removal of the receptor from the signaling pathway by preventing further receptor coupling to G proteins(3.Palczewski K.

The “β-adrenergic receptor kinases,” GRK2 and GRK3, were identified by their functional ability to phosphorylate β2-adrenergic receptors and are widely distributed throughout the body(2.Inglese J.

Functional activity of the GRK4 kinase has not yet been reported, and GRK4 is the least well understood member of the GRK family. Sallese et al.(11.Sallese M. Lombardi M.S. DeBlasi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have recently described an alternatively spliced exon encoding 32 amino acids in the amino-terminal region of human GRK4. In this paper, we define the structure of the human GRK4 gene and show that the GRK4 gene transcript undergoes extensive alternative splicing to generate four distinct forms of GRK4 mRNA that encode four forms of the GRK4 protein. We demonstrate the functional ability of GRK4 to augment desensitization of the LH/CG receptor in transfected cells and to phosphorylate the agonist-occupied, purified β2-adrenergic receptor. DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using standard conditions(12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each 100-μl reaction contained 1 × Thermo buffer, 200 μM each dNTP, 500 nM each oligonucleotide primer, and 10 ng of first-strand cDNA template. Reactions were assembled except for polymerase and heated for 5 min at 95°C, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) were added. Reactions were cycled 35 times for 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 3 min at 72°C, followed by a final 10-min extension at 72°C. The amino-terminal coding region of the GRK4 cDNA was amplified from human testis first-strand cDNA using the primers 5′-ctcctcggtctcgcagaatcc (in the 5′-untranslated region) and 5′-aggtagttatgggcaactcta (antisense to RVAHNYL), while the carboxyl-terminal coding region was amplified using the primers 5′-aacatgggatccccccctttctgtcctgat (encoding PPFCPD) and 5′-gcaccggaattctcagcattgcttgggttc (antisense to EPKQC∗). Product DNA bands were cut from agarose gels and TA subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) or digested with BamHI and EcoRI (underlined sites) and subcloned into pBSII (Stratagene). Human genomic DNA or individual cosmid DNAs were amplified by a long-accurate PCR technique (13.Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Taq and Tli DNA polymerases (Promega) were mixed 20:1 by volume, and PCR was carried out using standard buffer and nucleotide conditions as described above. Reactions were cycled 35 times for 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 55-65°C, and 10 min at 72°C, followed by a final 10-min extension at 72°C. Reactions were performed with a series of primers spanning individual introns and their flanking exons as determined by DNA sequencing. The GRK4 gene was contained on the overlapping cosmids 8C10A12 (14.Lin C.S. Altherr M. Bates G. Whaley W.L. Read A.P. Harris R. Lehrach H. Wasmuth J.J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Somatic Cell Mol.

Bucan M. Richards J. Romano D. Whaley W.L. Falcone B. Ianazzi J. Wexler N.S. Wasmuth J.J. Collins F.S. Lehrach H. Haines J.L. Gusella J.F. Genomics. 1991; 9: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Double-stranded sequencing of cDNAs was carried out by chain termination using Sequenase 2 (Amersham Corp./U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and specific primers. For direct sequencing from cosmid DNAs, cycle sequencing was performed using radiolabeled oligonucleotide primers and the fmolTM sequencing kit (Promega). Primers located randomly throughout the cDNA sequence were used to identify intron locations, and specific primers were prepared to sequence through each exon and into the exon/intron junction. Nylon filters containing 2 μg of human tissue poly(A) RNAs transferred from agarose gels were obtained from CLONTECH (human MTN I and MTN II). Blots were hybridized (12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) overnight with the random prime-labeled IT11A clone(4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 697-703Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which lacks both alternative exons II and XV. The blot was washed in 0.2 × SSC buffer at 65°C and exposed to x-ray film for 5 days at −70°C. Blots were then stripped of probe and rehybridized at 55°C with end-labeled antisense 48-mer oligonucleotides specific for the amino-terminal (bases 306-353) and carboxyl-terminal (bases 1839-1886) alternative exons. Oligonucleotide probes were washed in 2 × SSC buffer at 55°C and exposed to x-ray film for 3 days at −70°C. A fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and the carboxyl-terminal 115 amino acids of GRK4α (the long form including exon XV) was constructed by inserting the amplified GRK4 DNA fragment (see above) into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Protein was expressed by induction of Escherichia coli strain NM522 bearing the pGEX-GRK4-CT plasmid with 500 μM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and growth for 2 h at 30°C, and the fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose as described(5.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum was raised in two rabbits using this purified protein as immunogen(5.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified GRK4 antipeptide antibody raised against a peptide sequence from GRK4δ was obtained from Santa Cruz Biochemicals. The antigen peptide (IPWQNEDCLTMVPSEKEVEP) is interrupted in the GRK4α and GRK4β sequences by the addition of exon XV, and this antibody was found to recognize only GRK4β and GRK4β (data not shown). Immunoblotting was performed as described(5.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the crude GRK4-CT antiserum at 1:2500 dilution or affinity-purified antibody at 1 μg/ml. Briefly, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked by incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antiserum in 3% bovine serum albumin was allowed to bind for 1 h and washed, and the membrane was incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce) for 1 h. Avidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was included to detect biotinylated molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). After washing, the membrane was developed using Western blue reagent (Promega). The full-length GRK4 variants were reconstructed from amplified amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the cDNA, which were engineered to introduce BamHI and NotI sites to the immediate 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the cDNA. These short and long GRK4 halves were joined in all four combinations by ligation at the unique internal BspEI site and inserted into pSL1180 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All amplified clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All four forms of cDNA were inserted into pVL1393 (Pharmingen) using the BamHI and NotI sites and into pRK5 (18.Eaton D.L. Wood W.I. Eaton D. Hass P.E. Hollingshead P. Wion K. Mather J. Lawn R.M. Vehar G.A. Gorman C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using XmaI and SpeI/XbaI. Recombinant GRK4 baculoviruses were produced by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with pVL1393 vectors bearing individual GRK4 inserts and BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen). Expression of GRK4 forms in Sf9 cells was induced by infection of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml with the appropriate recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Cells were grown for 48 h after infection; harvested by centrifugation; and stored frozen in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA, and 20 mM NaCl supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (buffer A). COS-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of GRK4 cDNAs in the pRK5 vector using lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and labeled with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid, 200 μCi/ml [3H]myristic acid, or 100 mCi/ml 35S-protein labeling mixture (Dupont NEN) for 24 h, beginning 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Proteins were solubilized, immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-GRK4 antiserum, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously for GRK6(19.Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dried gels, pretreated with Amplify (Amersham Corp.), were exposed to x-ray film for 2 months at −80°C. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 25 μg of rat LH/CG receptor cDNA (20.McFarland K.C. Sprengel R. Phillips H.S. Kohler M. Rosemblit N. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) in the pcDNAI vector in the presence of 12.5 μg of pRK5 vector or pRK5 containing individual GRK cDNAs. Cells were split into 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) 1 day after transfection and labeled by incubation with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine for 24 h. Cells were assayed for total cAMP accumulation in presence of human CG for 15 min. cAMP was purified using Dowex and Alumina chromatography (21.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) and measured as percent conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP. LH/CG receptor expression was measured using 125I-labeled LH (2 ng/ml) binding to whole cells in the absence and presence of excess (2 μg/ml) human CG(22.Rodriguez M.C. Xie Y.-B. Wang H. Collison K. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 327-336PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor levels were determined to be within 2-fold for all transfection groups in all experiments. Sf9 cells from 250 ml of culture infected with GRK4α baculovirus, frozen in 10 ml of buffer A, were thawed and lysed by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Crude lysates were spun at 1000 × g to separate unlysed cells and nuclei. The lysate was supplemented with deionized Lubrol PX to 1% (w/v) and NaCl to 100 mM and rotated for 1 h at 4°C. The lysate was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The detergent-solubilized fraction was diluted 10-fold in buffer A with 100 mM NaCl to reduce Lubrol to 0.1%, filtered through a 0.2-μm Nalgene filter, and passed over a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). GRK4α protein was eluted with a 100-ml gradient of 100-1000 mM NaCl in buffer A plus 0.1% Lubrol. Fractions containing immunoreactive GRK4 eluted at 400-500 mM NaCl and were pooled for use in functional assays. The ability of partially purified GRK4 to phosphorylate purified β2-adrenergic receptor in phospholipid vesicles was assessed as described previously for GRK5(5.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were performed in a 25-μl total volume containing 100 μM [β-γ P]ATP (500-200 dpm/pmol), 1 pmol of β2-adrenergic receptor in vesicles, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor-(14-21)-amide peptide. Assays were incubated for 10 min at 30°C after addition of freshly prepared(-)-isoproterenol or (±)-propranolol (each at 100 μM). Assays were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and products were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were fixed, stained, and dried for autoradiography using x-ray film. Human β2-adrenergic receptors were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells by alprenolol affinity chromatography and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles as described(23.Pitcher J. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Receptors were reconstituted in vesicles of 100% phosphatidylcholine or in vesicles of 5% phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and 95% phosphatidylcholine. Lipids were all 99% pure grade from Sigma. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of human GRK4 (4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 697-703Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with that of bovine GRK5 (5.Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other G protein-coupled receptor kinases indicated the absence of two stretches of residues in GRK4 that are conserved in other members of this family of kinases. One apparent gap of 32 amino acid residues occurred after Gln17 in the amino-terminal domain of GRK4, while the second gap of 46 amino acids occurred after Glu515 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (numbering based on the longest (GRK4α) sequence reported here). To determine whether these gaps were present in the mRNA encoding GRK4, PCR amplification across both of these regions was performed using cDNA prepared from human testis poly(A) RNA from two patient samples. For both cDNA samples, each of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal reactions yielded product bands of sizes consistent with the reported sequence (containing the apparent gaps), as well as larger bands consistent with a sequence having these gaps filled (data not shown). Surprisingly, the longer products were more abundant in all reactions. All product bands were subcloned and sequenced. Comparison of the DNA sequences of the short and long PCR-amplified clones indicated that the longer clones were analogous to the shorter clones and to the previously reported GRK4 sequence, with additional nucleotide sequences occurring precisely at the predicted gaps, for each of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal products. These insertions each maintained the open reading frame, and deduced amino acid sequences of these insertions corresponded well to sequences found in GRK5 and GRK6 (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal insertion is identical to that reported by Sallese et al.(11.Sallese M. Lombardi M.S. DeBlasi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of alternative internal sequences in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of GRK4 suggested the existence of four distinct forms of GRK4 mRNA and thus of GRK4 protein. These variants could arise from alternative splicing of a single GRK4 gene transcript at two distinct sites. To determine whether these inserted sequences lie on distinct exons within the GRK4 gene, the exon/intron organization of the human GRK4 gene was determined. Gene fragments corresponding to all exons and all exon/intron junctions were sequenced directly from individual cosmid DNAs using specific radiolabeled oligonucleotide primers. The size of each intron was determined by polymerase chain reaction using pairs of primers from the flanking exons and the corresponding cosmid DNA as template. A schematic diagram of the GRK4 gene structure is shown in Fig. 2, and the precise exon/intron junction sequences are summarized in Table 1. The GRK4 gene, exclusive of promoter regions, spans ∼ 75 kb and is composed of 16 exons. The trapped exons used to identify the GRK4 gene (4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 697-703Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) correspond to exons IV and XIII. The amino-terminal insertion corresponds to exon II, of 96 bases (32 codons), flanked by 18- and 4.3-kb introns. The carboxyl-terminal insertion corresponds to exon XV, of 138 bases (46 codons), flanked by 825- and 2050-base pair introns. Since these observed alternative exons are appropriately located within the GRK4 gene, four forms of GRK4 mRNA result from alternative splicing of a single gene.Tabled 1 We have called the longest form of GRK4, with both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal alternative exon sequences, GRK4α. The deduced GRK4α protein sequence, which is essentially colinear with GRK5 and GRK6, has 578 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 66.5 kDa. The next shorter form, lacking only the amino-terminal alternative exon (32 codons), is GRK4β (546 amino acids, 62.9 kDa), while the variant lacking only the carboxyl-terminal alternative exon (46 codons) is GRK4β (532 amino acids, 61.2 kDa). GRK4β is identical to the splice variant described by Sallese et al.(11.Sallese M. Lombardi M.S. DeBlasi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), who called it GRK4A. The shortest variant, missing both alternative exons, is GRK4δ (500 amino acids, 57.6 kDa). This is the originally described GRK4 sequence and has been called IT11 (4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 697-703Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and GRK4B(11.Sallese M. Lombardi M.S. DeBlasi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Several differences were noted between the sequences obtained here and the originally reported sequence(4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 697-703Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and several polymorphisms were noted within the samples analyzed here. All numbering refers to the longest (GRK4α) form reported here. Gly562 was observed in all cDNA clones from two patient cDNA samples, in amplified genomic fragments from an independent patient, and in cosmid BJ56, rather than Asp as described previously. The original IT11A clone (4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 697-703Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was resequenced in this region and found to encode Asp562 as reported. In one patient cDNA sample, all clones contained Leu61, Val142 instead of Arg61, Ala142, which was found in all other cDNA and genomic DNA samples. Cosmid L142C5 encodes Ile247 instead of Val. Cosmid BJ56 carries a silent C rarr; T polymorphism within Ser519. Both cDNA samples, one genomic DNA sample, and cosmid BJ56 all encode Ala486, while cosmid BJ56w4-3 encodes Val486, the one previously reported polymorphism in the human GRK4 sequence(4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G. Altherr M. Duyao M. Groot N. Church D. Wasmuth J.J. Lehrach H. Housman D. Buckler A. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol.

Based on PCR/Northern analysis of human cDNA libraries, GRK4 mRNA was reported to have a widespread, but low level, distribution in human tissues(4.Ambrose C. James M. Barnes G. Lin C. Bates G.

https://openalex.org/W1582652395,"Adducin is a membrane skeleton protein originally described in human erythrocytes that promotes the binding of spectrin to actin and also binds directly to actin and bundles actin filaments. Adducin is associated with regions of cell-cell contact in nonerythroid cells, where it is believed to play a role in regulating the assembly of the spectrin-actin membrane skeleton. In this study we demonstrate a novel function for adducin; it completely blocks elongation and depolymerization at the barbed (fast growing) ends of actin filaments, thus functioning as a barbed end capping protein (Kcap~100 nM). This barbed end capping activity requires the intact adducin molecule and is not provided by the NH2-terminal globular head domains alone nor by the COOH-terminal extended tail domains, which were previously shown to contain the spectrin-actin binding, calmodulin binding, and phosphorylation sites. A novel difference between adducin and other previously described capping proteins is that it is down-regulated by calmodulin in the presence of calcium. The association of stoichiometric amounts of adducin with the short erythrocyte actin filaments in the membrane skeleton indicates that adducin could be the functional barbed end capper in erythrocytes and play a role in restricting actin filament length. Our experiments also suggest novel possibilities for calcium regulation of actin filament assembly by adducin in erythrocytes and at cell-cell contact sites in nonerythroid cells.

Our experiments also suggest novel possibilities for calcium regulation of actin filament assembly by adducin in erythrocytes and at cell-cell contact sites in nonerythroid cells. Precise control of actin filament length is an important functional consideration in a number of tissues including striated muscle (1.Huxley H.E. Brachet J. Mirsky A.E. The Cell: Biochemistry, Physiology, Morphology. 4.. Academic Press, New York1960: 365-481Google Scholar) and the erythrocyte membrane skeleton(2.Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R. Lux S. Stossel T.P. Blood Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). These two examples are similar with respect to the uniform lengths of the filament population, although the actual lengths themselves are different, 1 μm in skeletal muscle (3.Page S.G. Huxley H.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 19: 369-390Google Scholar) and 33-37 nm in erythrocytes (4.Byers T.J. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6153-6157Google Scholar, 5.Liu S. Derick L.H. Palek J.

These uniform length distributions suggest strict regulation of actin filament growth because pure actin filaments polymerize to an exponential length distribution at steady state in vitro(7.Oosawa F. Asakura S. Horecker B. Kaplan N.O. Marmur J. Scheraga H.A. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, London1995: 1-204Google Scholar). In muscle, control of actin filament growth is achieved by capping the fast growing (barbed) ends with capZ (8.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar, 9.Schafer D.A. Hug C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 61-70Google Scholar) and by capping the slow growing (pointed) ends with tropomodulin(10.Fowler V.M. Sussman M.A. Miller P.G. Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Google Scholar, 13.Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Google Scholar, 14.Ursitti J.A. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1633-1639Google Scholar), but a barbed end capping protein has not yet been identified. A conserved mechanism of actin filament length regulation between striated muscle and erythrocytes would require a barbed end capping protein to be identified in erythrocytes. There are five known actin binding proteins that are associated with the short erythrocyte actin filaments: spectrin, band 4.1, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, band 4.9, and adducin. Most of these proteins can be ruled out because they bind along the sides of actin filaments and have been shown directly not to block actin polymerization from the barbed filament ends (for reviews see (15.Bennett V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 107-121Google Scholar, 16.Gilligan D.M. Bennett V. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 74-83Google Scholar, 17.Fowler V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 86-96Google Scholar)). However, several observations raised the possibility that adducin, which was initially characterized as a calmodulin-binding protein(18.Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Google Scholar), might be a candidate for a novel erythrocyte barbed end capping protein. Adducin is associated in stoichiometric amounts with the short erythrocyte actin filaments (one α,β heterodimer per filament) (18.Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind to spectrin-actin complexes and promote spectrin binding to actin (Kd = ~80 nM)(19.Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Google Scholar, 20.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Google Scholar), as well as to bind directly to F-actin (Kd = ~280 nM) and to bundle actin filaments(20.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Google Scholar, 21.Taylor K.A. Taylor D.W. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1976-1983Google Scholar). Curiously, although the 39-kDa NH2-terminal globular #x0201C;head” domains of both α and β adducin contain a region of sequence homology to the actin-binding domain of the α-actinin family of actin binding proteins(22.Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Google Scholar), the isolated head domains of either α or β adducin do not appear to bind F-actin or spectrin-actin complexes in cosedimentation assays (23.Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Google Scholar). Indeed, the 33-kDa COOH-terminal extended tail domains of both the α and β adducin subunits were recently shown to be sufficient for binding to spectrin-actin complexes and for recruitment of additional spectrin molecules(24.Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Google Scholar). Thus, the functional significance of the actin binding sequence homology in the head domain of adducin remained an open question and suggested that adducin might have additional actin-binding properties. In this study, we show that whole adducin blocks elongation and depolymerization from the fast growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments. In contrast, neither the isolated head or tail domains have barbed end capping activity on their own. We further demonstrate that unlike other barbed end capping proteins, the capping activity of adducin is down-regulated by calmodulin in the presence of calcium. Sequencing of adducin cDNAs from erythrocytes and other tissues has demonstrated that adducins are a unique family of proteins associated with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton in erythroid and nonerythroid cells (for a review see (16.Gilligan D.M. Bennett V. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 74-83Google Scholar)). The combination of adducin's calcium/calmodulin-regulated barbed end capping, actin bundling, and enhancement of spectrin-actin binding activities indicates that adducins represent a new type of regulated actin filament binding and barbed end capping protein. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder (25.Pardee J.D. Spudich B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Google Scholar) and subsequently gel filtered on Superose 6 to remove actin nuclei and minor contaminants. Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared by the method of Kouyama and Mihashi (26.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Google Scholar) with the modifications of Weber et al.(27.Weber A. Northrop J. Bishop M.F. Ferrone F.A. Mooseker M.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2528-2536Google Scholar); labeled and unlabeled actin was stored on ice in buffer A (see below) and used within 1 week. Human erythrocyte adducin was prepared from the low salt extract of human erythrocyte ghosts by the method of Bennett (28.Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Google Scholar) as modified by Hughes and Bennett (24.Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C in storage buffer (10% sucrose, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM sodium azide, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Calmodulin was purified from bovine brain as described(29.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Google Scholar). Nonmuscle capping protein (30.Schafer D.A. Korshunova Y.O. Schroer T.A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 453-465Google Scholar) was purified from erythrocyte cytosol. ( 1P. A. Kuhlman and V. M. Fowler, manuscript in preparation.) The adducin tail domains were expressed using the bacterial expression vector pGEMEX and purified as described in Hughes and Bennett(24.Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Google Scholar). The adducin head domain was purified after digestion of human erythrocyte adducin with trypsin(23.Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Google Scholar). Buffer A (2 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM Na2ATP, 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.005% sodium azide, final pH = 8.0 at 25°C) was used in all assays. In all pyrene fluorescence experiments the amount of labeled actin was 5% to prevent internal quenching of the probe. The assay used to quantitate inhibition of actin polymerization at the barbed ends utilized the method of Casella et al. (8.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar) in which polymerization was seeded using a crude low ionic strength extract of erythrocyte membranes containing spectrin-actin oligomeric complexes(8.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar, 31.Lin D.C. Lin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2345-2349Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μM G-actin was primed for rapid polymerization by addition of Mg2+ to 0.2 mM and incubated for 5 min. Next, all other components of the assays were added (e.g. adducin at the concentrations indicated in the figures, 50 μg/ml spectrin-actin complexes), and actin polymerization was initiated by increasing the KCl concentration to 1 mM and the MgCl2 concentration to 0.4 mM (final). Actin polymerization was followed by monitoring the increased pyrene fluorescence of labeled F-actin (excitation at 365 nm and emission of 407 nm) using a SLM8000 spectrofluorimeter. The fluorescence data were saved to a computer disc for subsequent analysis. Actin depolymerization was initiated by dilution of a 20 μM stock of F-actin (polymerized overnight at 4°C) to a final concentration of 1 μM in buffer A alone or buffer A containing adducin or capping protein; actin depolymerization was indicated by a decrease in pyrene fluorescence. The sample temperature was maintained at a constant 25°C for all actin polymerization experiments and at 37°C for actin depolymerization experiments using a circulating water bath. Initial rates of polymerization and depolymerization were determined using the linear regression analysis feature of the graphics program Cricket Graph running on a Macintosh. 5 μM G-actin in buffer A was mixed with increasing amounts of adducin or capping protein and polymerized by the addition of KCl and Mg2+ to 100 and 2 mM, respectively. After 24 h of incubation at 4°C, F-actin was collected by sedimentation for 1 h at 435,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 rotor at 4°C. (The sensitivity of adducin to proteolytic degradation during prolonged incubations at room temperature made it necessary to do this experiment at 4°C.) The supernatant was carefully removed, and the G-actin remaining in the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid using tRNA as a carrier(32.Fowler V.M. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5978-5989Google Scholar). The precipitated G-actin and the F-actin were solubilized in equivalent volumes of SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels(33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The amount of actin in each sample was determined by pyridine elution of Coomassie Blue from the stained gel slices (34.Fenner C. Traut R.R. Mason D.T. Wikman-Coffelt J. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 595-602Google Scholar) and quantitated spectroscopically by reading the absorbance at 605 nm with reference to an actin standard curve. We used spectrin-actin complexes (8.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar, 31.Lin D.C. Lin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2345-2349Google Scholar) to seed actin polymerization in a low salt buffer (1 mM KCl, 0.4 mM Mg2+) where actin alone would otherwise not polymerize(8.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar). Under these conditions actin polymerization is expected to be limited to the barbed end due to the low salt concentration as well as the presence of the pointed end actin capping protein tropomodulin in the spectrin-actin complexes (11.Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Google Scholar). ( 2V. M. Fowler, unpublished observations.) Fig. 1A shows that adducin dramatically suppressed the initial rate of polymerization from the spectrin-actin seeds. We quantitated the level of inhibition (capping) as a percentage of the initial polymerization rate in the absence of any adducin (100% capping indicates the complete cessation of actin polymerization). Increasing concentrations of adducin correlated with increasing inhibition of actin polymerization; plotting adducin concentration against the percentage of inhibition demonstrated that saturating concentrations of adducin can completely inhibit actin elongation from the barbed filament end (Fig. 1B). The adducin concentration that produced 50% capping was taken to be the Kcap; under these conditions the Kcap for adducin was approximately 100 nM. The inhibitory effect of adducin on actin elongation is specific for the barbed filament end because adducin does not inhibit the rate of elongation from the pointed ends of gelsolin-capped actin filaments (data not shown). Not only can adducin completely inhibit elongation from the barbed ends of actin filaments, but saturating amounts of adducin (700 nM) also greatly reduce the depolymerization rate of F-actin that has been diluted below its critical concentration (Fig. 2). This effect is primarily due to inhibition of depolymerization from the barbed end because under the conditions of our assays the higher off rate of the barbed ends dominates the depolymerization kinetics; for example, even complete inhibition of depolymerization at the pointed end in these assays would have been expected to lead to only about a 10% reduction in the rate of depolymerization(35.Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observe a similar reduction in the initial rate of actin depolymerization in the presence of saturating amounts (30 nM) of nonmuscle capping protein isolated from erythrocytes (Fig. 2), a known barbed end capping protein (30.Schafer D.A. Korshunova Y.O. Schroer T.A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 453-465Google Scholar).1 The initial rates of depolymerization for actin in the presence of adducin or capping protein were 53 and 56 arbitrary units, respectively, as compared with a rate of 754 arbitrary units for actin alone. Interestingly, after the initial period, the rate of actin depolymerization in the presence of adducin was slower than in the presence of capping protein. We attribute this difference to an effect of adducin on the pointed filament end because adducin reduced (but did not block) the rate of actin depolymerization from the pointed ends of gelsolin capped actin filaments (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of adducin on the rate of actin depolymerization from the barbed filament ends also indicates that adducin does not function by exclusively sequestering actin monomers; monomer sequestering would have been expected to lead to an increase in the rate of actin disassembly, which was also not observed (see below). Finally, these data also rule out possible artifacts in the nucleated actin polymerization assay in Fig. 1 from fluorescence signal quenching due to light scattering and demonstrate that protein aggregation does not occur in these assays. Taken together, the ability of adducin to inhibit both actin polymerization and depolymerization indicates that adducin is a barbed end capping protein with a capping affinity of 100 nM. Complete capping of barbed filament ends by previously described barbed end capping proteins results in an increase of the actin monomer concentration at steady state with the filaments, reflecting the higher critical concentration for the pointed ends(35.Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Google Scholar, 36.Weeds A. MacIver S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 63-69Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that saturating concentrations of nonmuscle capping protein isolated from erythrocytes resulted in about a 3-fold increase in the amount of actin monomer remaining in the supernatant at steady state from 0.4 to 1.3 μM. In contrast, increasing concentrations of adducin (from 100 to 700 nM) led to a considerably smaller increase in the amount of actin monomer in the supernatant from 0.3 to 0.6 μM (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that adducin may reduce the critical concentration at the pointed end of the filament in addition to blocking monomer addition and loss at the barbed filament end. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that adducin reduces the rate of depolymerization while increasing the rate of elongation at the pointed filament end (data not shown). This may be a consequence of adducin reducing the actin monomer off rate for the pointed filament end by its binding along the sides of actin filaments. Finally, the observation that increasing amounts of adducin do not lead to continuously increasing amounts of nonpolymerizable actin also demonstrates that the effects of adducin on polymerization kinetics at the barbed filament end are not solely due to monomer sequestration. In an effort to determine whether the actin filament capping activity of adducin could be localized to either the NH2-terminal globular head or to the COOH-terminal extended tail domains, we tested bacterially expressed tails (24.Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Google Scholar) and a head-neck domain prepared by trypsin digestion of human erythrocyte adducin(23.Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Google Scholar). Neither the head nor the tail domains (tested up to final concentrations of 1 and 5 μM, respectively) had any significant effects on actin polymerization or depolymerization in our assays (data not shown). Therefore, the barbed end capping activity of adducin appears to be an attribute of the entire molecule requiring both the heads and tails. Calmodulin has previously been shown to bind to adducin with a Kd of 0.2-0.5 μM in the presence of calcium(18.Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent binding of calmodulin to adducin prevents adducin from binding to F-actin as well as reducing its ability to bind to spectrin-actin complexes and recruit additional spectrin molecules to the spectrin-actin complexes(19.Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Google Scholar, 20.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that calmodulin in conjunction with calcium was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of adducin on actin polymerization from the barbed filament end. A plot of the percentage of adducin capping activity against calmodulin concentration produced a curve with half-maximal reversal of capping at about 2 μM calmodulin (Fig. 4A). The ability of calmodulin to eliminate the barbed end capping activity of adducin was also seen in actin depolymerization experiments as evidenced by the return of the depolymerization rate in the presence of adducin plus calmodulin to that of pure actin (Fig. 4B). Using both a nucleated actin polymerization assay (8.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Google Scholar) and an F-actin depolymerization assay, we have shown that adducin caps the barbed ends of actin filaments with a Kcapà 100 nM. The association of stoichiometric amounts of adducin with the short actin filaments in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton (18.Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Google Scholar) implies that adducin may indeed be the functional barbed end cap in erythrocytes and supports our hypothesis that the mechanism of restriction of actin filament length in erythrocytes is based on capping actin filaments at both ends to prevent growth or shrinking, similar to striated muscle. Although it has been assumed that the barbed ends of the actin filaments in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton are uncapped, this idea stems mainly from the use of purified membranes or isolated spectrin-actin oligomeric complexes to nucleate actin polymerization(32.Fowler V.M. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5978-5989Google Scholar, 37.Pinder J.C. Ohanian V. Gratzer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 161-164Google Scholar, 38.Pinder J.C. Weeds A.G. Gratzer W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 461-468Google Scholar, 39.Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Ishikawa H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1102-1110Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that the capping activity of adducin might have been inactivated during hemolysis and/or the extraction procedures used to prepare membranes and purify the spectrin-actin complexes used in these experiments. Calmodulin has been demonstrated to regulate the mechanical properties of the erythrocyte membrane in the presence of calcium(40.Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 394-400Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of calcium/calmodulin on the ability of adducin to cap the barbed ends of actin filaments suggests that the effect of calmodulin on membrane mechanics may be partly mediated via changes in actin filament polymerization. Calcium/calmodulin also inhibits adducin binding to F-actin and to spectrin-actin complexes(19.Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Google Scholar, 20.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Google Scholar), as well as inhibiting spectrin-protein 4.1 cross-linking of actin filaments(41.Anderson J.P. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6365-6372Google Scholar, 42.Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1134-1140Google Scholar). These observations emphasize that calmodulin is likely to regulate membrane mechanical properties via multiple effects on membrane skeleton organization. The capping affinity of adducin is considerably lower than has been described for other barbed end capping proteins (e.g. gelsolin = 1 pM; capping protein = 1 nM; for reviews see (9.Schafer D.A. Hug C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 61-70Google Scholar) and (36.Weeds A. MacIver S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 63-69Google Scholar)) and is similar to the affinity of adducin for binding to the sides of actin filaments and bundling them (Kd = ~280 nM)(20.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Google Scholar). It is also striking that the inhibitory effect of calmodulin on the barbed end capping activity of adducin has a similar dependence on calmodulin concentration as that of calmodulin's inhibition of adducin side binding to F-actin and to spectrin-actin complexes(19.Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Google Scholar, 20.Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Google Scholar). Furthermore, the calmodulin binding site on adducin has been proposed to be located on the midregion of the COOH-terminal tail domains(43.Scaramuzzino D.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3398-3402Google Scholar); yet dissection of adducin into NH2-terminal head and COOH-terminal tail domains shows that the entire molecule is required for barbed end capping activity. Therefore, the barbed end capping activity of adducin may be functionally linked to its ability to bind along the sides of actin filaments. The actin-binding sequence homology in the NH2-terminal head domain of the adducin α and β subunits diverges significantly from the consensus actin-binding domain found in the functional members of the α-actinin protein family (similarity: α-adducin 47.9%, β-adducin 40.7%; identity: α-adducin 21.6%, β-adducin 12.8%). ( 3P. A. Kuhlman, unpublished observations.) In addition, both the α and β subunits of adducin deviate from the sequence found in α-actinin by the presence of an extra portion of sequence; in the case of the α subunit, this is in one of the regions identified as the actin-binding site(44.Kuhlman P.A. Hemmings L. Critchley D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 201-204Google Scholar). The divergence from the consensus actin-binding sequence has been suggested to explain the lack of binding to actin filaments by the head domain of adducin(22.Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Google Scholar). However, we would propose that this actin-binding site in the NH2-terminal head domain of adducin may have, through divergent evolution, developed the capability to bind to actin so as to cap the barbed end of the filament. Actin monomers in the filament are oriented such that subdomains 1 and 3 are exposed at the barbed end of the actin filament(45.Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Google Scholar, 46.Kabsch W. Mannherz H.-G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Google Scholar). It may be significant that a portion of the α-actinin actin binding site has been demonstrated to be on subdomain 1 of actin(47.Lebart M.-C. Mejean C. Roustan C. Benyamin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5642-5648Google Scholar, 48.Levine B.A. Moir A.J.G. Patchell V.B. Perry S.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 44-48Google Scholar, 49.McGough A. Way M. DeRosier D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 433-443Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we propose that the barbed end capping activity of the NH2-terminal head domain is reliant on the side binding of the adducin COOH-terminal tails to actin filaments. It is likely that the COOH-terminal tail domains of the α and β subunits possess an F-actin binding site based on their ability to bind to spectrin-actin complexes and to promote spectrin binding to actin (24.Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Google Scholar). Binding of the tails along each strand of the actin filament in a polarized fashion (21.Taylor K.A. Taylor D.W. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1976-1983Google Scholar) could position the head domains to bind to a site in subdomain 1 of the terminal actin monomer at the barbed filament end, hence interfering with association of new actin monomers as well as stabilizing the filament and preventing monomer dissociation. A model depicting binding of adducin tails to actin and capping the barbed end of the actin filament by adducin heads is shown in Fig. 5. In addition to promoting spectrin binding to actin, binding of adducin tails along the sides of the erythrocyte actin filaments may also play a role in stabilizing them at their pointed filament ends, as suggested by the actin critical concentration experiment (Fig. 3). The multifunctional actin binding properties of adducin may not be unique; tensin is another protein that has been shown to cap actin filament barbed ends as well as to bind along the sides of actin filaments and bundle them(50.Lo S.H. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Google Scholar, 51.Chuang J.-Z. Lin D.C. Lin S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1095-1109Google Scholar). The actin capping properties of adducin suggest that adducin could provide a link between membranes and the barbed ends of spectrin-associated actin filaments. In erythrocytes, adducin has been shown to bind directly to stomatin(52.Sinard J.H. Stewart G.-H. Argent A.C. Morrow J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 421Google Scholar), a membrane protein that is associated with ion channels and has been genetically linked to hereditary stomatocytosis(2.Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R. Lux S. Stossel T.P. Blood Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar). In nonerythroid cells, adducin is associated with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton at cell-cell contact sites on the lateral borders of the plasma membrane of epithelial cells(53.Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Google Scholar). Protein kinase C phosphorylation of adducin in cultured epithelial cells induces redistribution of adducin away from cell-cell contact sites(53.Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Google Scholar). Functional linkage of adducin's barbed end capping activity to the filament side binding activity of the tails may imply that phosphorylation of tails by protein kinase C (23.Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Google Scholar) could also regulate adducin's capping function, as we have demonstrated here for calcium/calmodulin. It is tempting to speculate that adducin could be a regulatory target for signal transduction pathways that lead to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton at cell-cell contact sites.

https://openalex.org/W2118656164,"The phospholipase C-β1 (PLC-β1) signaling pathway was reconstituted by addition of purified PLC to phospholipid vesicles that contained purified recombinant m1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor, Gq, and 2-4 mol % [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In this system, the muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulated steady-state PLC activity up to 90-fold in the presence of GTP. Both GTP and agonist were required for PLC activation, which was observed at physiological levels of Ca2+ (10-100 nM). PLC-β1 is also a GTPase-activating protein for Gq. It accelerated steady-state GTPase activity up to 60-fold in the presence of carbachol, which alone stimulated activity 6-10-fold, and increased the rate of hydrolysis of Gq-bound GTP by at least 100-fold. Despite this rapid hydrolysis of Gq-bound GTP, the receptor maintained >10% of the total Gq in the active GTP-bound form by catalyzing GTP binding at a rate of at least 20-25 min-1, ~10-fold faster than previously described. These and other kinetic data indicate that the receptor and PLC-β1 coordinately regulate the amplitude of the PLC signal and the rates of signal initiation and termination. They also suggest a mechanism in which the receptor, Gq, and PLC form a three-protein complex in the presence of agonist and GTP (stable over multiple GTPase cycles) that is responsible for PLC signaling.

INTRODUCTIONHeterotrimeric G proteins transmit signals from cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors (such as PLC-β( 1The abbreviations used are: PLCphospholipase CGAPGTPase-activating proteinm1AChRm1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateNTAnitrilotriacetic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateBSAbovine serum albuminQNB1-quinuclidinyl benzilate.) enzymes, adenylyl cyclase, or ion channels) by transiting a controlled cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis. GTP binding to the α subunit activates G proteins and allows them, in turn, to activate effectors. They are deactivated when they hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Receptors increase the rate at which G proteins bind GTP. Agonist-bound receptor thus determines the rate of G protein activation, and hydrolysis of bound GTP determines the rate of deactivation. The relative rates of activation and deactivation determine the steady-state concentration of the activated G protein and, therefore, the amplitude of the signal transmitted through the receptor-G protein-effector pathway (see (1.Ross E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221Google Scholar, 2.Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Google Scholar, 3.Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar) for reviews).Until recently, the rate of GTP hydrolysis by G protein α subunits was not known to be regulated directly, although there was evidence that GTP hydrolysis in cells may occur faster than had been described for purified G proteins(1.Ross E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221Google Scholar). A model for such regulation was the small monomeric GTP-binding proteins, such as p21ras. For these proteins, GTP hydrolysis is negligible in the absence of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate hydrolysis dramatically. For example, the rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to p21ras is increased by Ras GAP ~105-fold (from 1.2 × 10-4 s-1 to 19 s -1)(4.Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Google Scholar). Numerous GAPs specific for one or more small GTP-binding proteins have now been identified. They regulate signal duration and/or amplitude, but apparently do not directly transmit signal(5.McCormick F. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 345-359Google Scholar).Only two GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins have been described so far, one each for Gq and Gt. The Gq GAP is PLC-β, the principal effector regulated by Gqα(6.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar). When purified Gq and m1AChR were co-reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, addition of purified recombinant PLC-β1 stimulated steady-state GTPase activity >20-fold when the muscarinic agonist carbachol was added to stimulate GTP binding(6.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic arguments and preliminary measurements of the rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP in this system suggested that PLC-β1 stimulates hydrolysis of Gq-bound GTP >50-fold, from ~0.8 min-1 to at least 40 min-1(6.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar).The Gq GAP activity described for PLC-β1 is reciprocally specific for the PLC-β family and the Gq family. PLC-β1, PLC-β2, and PLC-β3 are all Gq GAPs, ( 2G. Berstein, G. H. Biddlecome, J. Wang, and E. M. Ross, unpublished data.) and preliminary data suggest that the PLC-β encoded by the Drosophila NorpA gene is a GAP for Drosophila visual Gq(7.Ross E.M. Berstein G. Karandikar M. Masaki T. Endothelium-derived Factors and Vascular Functions. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1994: 211-218Google Scholar). In contrast, neither PLC-γ (not G protein-regulated) nor adenylyl cyclase (regulated by Gs, but not by Gq) has Gq GAP activity.2 In addition, while PLC-β1 is a GAP for the Gq family members Gq, G11, and G14, it is not a GAP for Gi, Go, Gs, or Gz(6.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar, 7.Ross E.M. Berstein G. Karandikar M. Masaki T. Endothelium-derived Factors and Vascular Functions.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6246-6253Google Scholar).2The Gt GAP also involves the Gt effector protein, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. In this case, however, both the γ subunit of the phosphodiesterase and a second, unidentified membrane protein are required to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Gt(9.Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Google Scholar, 10.Slepak V.Z. Artemyev N.O. Zhu C. Dumke C.L. Sabacan L. Sondek J. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

Phosphodiesterase γ and the membrane-bound factor together can increase the hydrolysis rate constant of Gt from 0.05 s-1 to >1 s-1, approaching the physiological deactivation rate of photoreceptor signaling(13.Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Google Scholar).Not all G protein-regulated effectors are GAPs. We have been unable to detect Gs GAP activity in several preparations of adenylyl cyclase(14.May D.C. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15829-15833Google Scholar). However, the existence of other G protein GAPs is strongly predicted because the rates of deactivation of many G protein-mediated signaling processes are significantly faster than the rates of hydrolysis of bound GTP by isolated G proteins (reviewed in (1.Ross E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 207-221Google Scholar)).The finding that PLC-β1 is a GAP for Gq raises the question of how a signal can be generated when an effector that is a GAP terminates its own stimulus. Indeed, the discovery of PLC-β1 as a Gq GAP was sparked by our failure to detect GTP-supported stimulation of PLC activity by muscarinic agonists when m1AChR, Gq, and PLC-β1 were co-reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles(15.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Google Scholar). Although our measurements of GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis, and accumulation of activated Gq-bound GTP suggested that added PLC-β1 should be substantially activated, the Gq GAP activity of PLC-β1 accelerated GTP hydrolysis, and no phospholipase stimulation was observed. More recently, Nakamura et al.(8.Nakamura F. Kato M. Kameyama K. Nukada T. Haga T. Kato H. Takenawa T. Kikkawa U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6246-6253Google Scholar) succeeded in demonstrating stimulation of PLC activity by carbachol plus GTP in a similarly reconstituted system, suggesting that the three proteins are sufficient to generate signal in response to agonist in the presence of GTP. However, activation was modest (2.2-fold), leaving open the question of how receptor-promoted GTP binding can keep up with GAP-stimulated hydrolysis.For this study, we have modified our previous reconstitution protocol (6.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar, 15.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Google Scholar) to develop a system that generates a large IP3 signal in response to GTP and carbachol (50-100-fold stimulation). This system provides an experimental model in which to study PLC-β1 activity in terms of the regulation of the Gq GTPase cycle. The data reported here reconcile the rates of receptor-stimulated GTP binding by Gq and of GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis with the steady-state concentration of Gq-bound GTP and activated PLC-β1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[γ-32P]GTP was synthesized as described by Johnson and Walseth (16.Johnson R.A. Walseth T.F. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 135-168Google Scholar) and purified by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography using a 20-350 potassium Pi gradient (pH 7.0). Background in the GTPase assay was <0.3%. [α-32P]GDP was prepared as described by Ferguson and Higashijima (17.Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 188-192Google Scholar) and purified as described for [γ-32P]GTP. NTA-Ni2+-agarose was from QIAGEN Inc. Lubrol 12A9 was a gift from Zeneca. Cholate and deoxycholate were from Sigma and were purified as described previously (18.Ross E.M. Schatz G. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 222-229Google Scholar). CHAPS was from Sigma. 3-(2′-Aminobenzhydryloxy)tropane-agarose (19.Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13575-13579Google Scholar) was the gift of T. Haga and K. Haga (University of Tokyo). Sources of other materials are listed elsewhere(15.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Google Scholar).Recombinant ProteinsAll proteins used in this study were expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus vectors. The rat PLC-β1 cDNA (20.Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 161-169Google Scholar) was modified to replace the first seven codons with Met-Gly-His6 and ligated into pVL1393(21.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Mouse Gqα cDNA (22.Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Google Scholar) that extended to a site ~170 base pairs beyond the termination codon was cut with EcoNI just after the initiation codon and ligated with a 5′-BamHI/EcoNI duplex linker into pVL1393(21.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). This construct does not contain a His6 tag, and the coding sequence begins at the first of two in-frame methionine residues (MTLESIMACC …). All cDNA constructs were prepared using standard procedures(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and recombinant viruses were prepared as described previously(24.Wong S.K.-F. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Google Scholar, 25.Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Google Scholar). Baculoviruses that encode Gβ subunits, Gγ subunits, and Gi,1α (26.Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Google Scholar, 27.Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Simon M. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Google Scholar) were gifts from J. Iñiguez-Lluhí, T. Kozasa, and A. G. Gilman (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Methods for the growth of Sf9 cells and expression of recombinant proteins have been described previously(25.Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Google Scholar).Membrane Preparation and Protein ExtractionAll protein purification steps were conducted at 4°C except as indicated. Sf9 cells were harvested, and membranes were prepared 48-60 h after infection as described by Parker et al.(25.Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Google Scholar), except that 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 μg/ml DNase I were included in the final step to disrupt DNA aggregates. Thawed membranes (5 mg/ml) were extracted by stirring for 1 h in extraction buffer, and the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. m1AChR was purified as described previously(19.Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13575-13579Google Scholar, 25.Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Google Scholar).Purification of Gq SubunitsGβ1γ2 was purified exactly as described by Kozasa and Gilman(26.Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Google Scholar). Purification of Gqα was based on the same approach. Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding Gqα, Gβ2His6, and Gγ2His6. Membrane proteins were extracted with 1% cholate in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μM GDP, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. All chromatography buffers contained 20 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Buffer G1 also contained 0.5% Lubrol 12A9 and 10 μM GDP. Buffer G2 contained the components of buffer G1 plus 0.2% cholate and 3 μM GTPγS. Buffer G3 contained 0.3% cholate. Buffer G4 contained 1% cholate, 20 μM AlCl3, 10 mM NaF, and 10 mM total MgCl2. Buffer G5 contained 0.4% cholate and 1 mM dithiothreitol (but no 2-mercaptoethanol).The extraction supernatant (100 ml) was diluted 5-fold into buffer G1 and mixed with 12 ml of NTA-Ni2+-agarose. The mixture was stirred for 1 h, and the NTA-Ni2+-agarose was collected in a chromatography column. The resin was washed with buffer G1, buffer G1 plus 0.5 M NaCl, buffer G1 plus 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM imidazole, buffer G1 plus 1 M NaCl, and buffer G1. Each wash step was deemed complete when the absorbance base line (280 nm) remained flat for at least 24 ml. The column was then moved to room temperature and washed with buffer G2 (100 ml) to remove the endogenous Sf9 αi-like protein and with buffer G3 (80 ml) to remove residual GTPγS and Lubrol. Gqα was separated from the Gβ2His6•Gγ2His6 dimer at room temperature in buffer G4 (100 ml), and the eluate was collected at 0°C. The Al3+/F- concentration in the eluate was reduced at least 1000-fold by repeated concentration (Amicon PM-10 membrane) and dilution in buffer G5. Gq was prepared by mixing Gqα and Gβ1γ2 in a 1:2 molar ratio. The concentration of active Gqα was determined according to bound GDP(28.Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Google Scholar), and the Gβ1γ2 concentration was based on total protein(29.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Google Scholar).The estimated purity of Gqα was >95%, and that of Gβ1γ2 was >85% (Fig. 1). No Sf9 cell Giα was detectable in the Gqα preparation by silver staining or by immunoblotting (P-960 antibody) (30.Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 215-233Google Scholar). We were also unable to detect contamination with Sf9 cell Gqα by comparing the bands detected on a single immunoblot that was sequentially probed with an antibody that recognizes Sf9 cell Gqα (Z811) (31.Gutowski S. Smrcka A. Nowak L. Wu D. Simon M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Google Scholar) and with a second antibody that recognizes only recombinant Gqα. The yield of Gqα was 130-150 μg/liter of Sf9 cells; the yield of Gβ1γ2 was 340 μg/liter of Sf9 cells.Purification of PLC-β1Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus encoding PLC-β1-His6. Peripheral membrane proteins were extracted with 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and the extract (220 ml) was stirred with 8 ml of NTA-Ni2+-agarose for at least 1 h. All wash buffers contained the components of buffer P (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) plus NaCl or imidazole as indicated. The resin was washed as follows: 1) with 1 M NaCl until A280 nm returned to zero; 2) with a gradient of 1 M NaCl to 100 mM NaCl plus 10 mM imidazole (12 ml); 3) with 100 mM NaCl plus 10 mM imidazole (30 ml); 4) with a gradient of 100 mM NaCl plus 10 mM imidazole to 1 M NaCl plus 10 mM imidazole (12 ml); and 5) with 1 M NaCl plus 10 mM imidazole (30 ml). PLC-β1 was eluted with 100 mM NaCl plus 50 mM EDTA in buffer P (30 ml). The NTA-Ni2+-agarose eluate was loaded onto a Pharmacia Biotech HR5/5 MonoQ column equilibrated with 10 mM NaCl in buffer Q (20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Buffer Q, with the NaCl concentrations indicated below, was used for all steps of the MonoQ chromatography. The column was washed with 10 mM NaCl (5 ml) and then with 100 mM NaCl until A280 nm returned to zero. PLC-β1 was eluted with a 15-ml gradient of 100-600 mM NaCl. PLC-β1 eluted between 200 and 300 mM NaCl in four 1-ml fractions. The pooled MonoQ fractions were diluted 10-fold into buffer S (20 mM MES (pH 6.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and loaded onto a Pharmacia Biotech HR5/5 MonoS column equilibrated with 10 mM NaCl in buffer S. Buffer S, with NaCl added as indicated below, was used for all steps of the MonoS chromatography. The column was washed with 5 mM NaCl (5 ml) and then with 200 mM NaCl until A280 nm returned to zero. PLC-β1 was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 200-700 mM NaCl. PLC-β1 eluted between 350 and 450 mM NaCl in four 1-ml fractions, which were pooled, concentrated to at least 1 mg/ml (Amicon Centricon-30), and stored at −80°C. PLC-β1 was >98% pure (Fig. 1). Bands at ~100 and ~50 kDa are proteolytic products. The His6 tag did not alter the behavior of the protein (compare with Refs. 6 and 15).Protein-Phospholipid Vesiclesm1AChR and Gq were co-reconstituted into lipid vesicles by gel filtration. A mixture (75 μl) of phosphatidylethanolamine (1650 μM), phosphatidylserine (980 μM), cholesteryl hemisuccinate (180 μM), and [3H]PIP2 (100 μM, 88-165 cpm/pmol) was dried under argon; rehydrated in 20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), and 0.3% deoxycholate (pH ~8.0); and sonicated under argon at room temperature for 20 min. The cloudy suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1300 × g at 4°C, and the clear supernatant was removed to a separate tube. Recovery of [3H]PIP2 in this supernatant was at least 90% and usually >97%. Phospholipid-detergent micelles (75 μl, 205 nmol of phospholipid) were mixed with purified Gq (35 pmol of Gqα) and held on ice for 15 min before addition of purified m1AChR (10-13 pmol). Column buffer (20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), and 100 mM NaCl) was added to bring the total volume to 150 μl, and the mixture was applied to a 6.6 × 250-mm column of Ultrogel AcA34. Protein-phospholipid vesicles (750 μl) were recovered in the void volume, 0.1 mg/ml protease-free BSA was added, and the vesicles were stored at −80°C. Recovery in the vesicles of applied m1AChR was 5-13%, that of Gq coupled to m1AChR was 11-28%, and that of [3H]PIP2 was 30-50%.Quantitation of Vesicle ProteinsTotal receptor-coupled Gq was measured by carbachol-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding as described previously(15.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Google Scholar). For vesicles that lacked [3H]PIP2, m1AChR was measured by [3H]QNB binding in the filtration assay described previously(15.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Google Scholar). For vesicles that contained [3H]PIP2, m1AChR was measured by a modified centrifugal gel filtration [3H]QNB binding assay in which receptor-bound [3H]QNB was separated from [3H]PIP2 by thin-layer chromatography. Vesicles were incubated for 1 h at 30°C with 49 nM [3H]QNB, with or without 23 μM atropine, and then solubilized in 1% digitonin at 0°C. Solubilized vesicles were diluted 10-fold into column buffer that contained 0.1% digitonin and 2.5 nM [3H]QNB, with or without 10 μM atropine, so that the final concentrations were 6.3 nM [3H]QNB and 11 μM atropine. Receptor-bound [3H]QNB, collected by centrifugal gel filtration, was separated from [3H]PIP2 by chromatographing the sample (lyophilized and resuspended in 10 μl of 70% ethanol) on silica gel in ethanol/acetic acid/water (60:30:10). [3H]PIP2 was retained near the origin (RF = 0-0.2), and [3H]QNB migrated with an RF of 0.4-0.7. [3H]QNB was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Each vesicle preparation was tested in quadruplicate for total binding (QNB) and in duplicate for nonspecific binding (QNB + atropine). Control experiments with vesicles that lacked [3H]PIP2 indicated that this method detects 80-90% of the m1AChR detected by the filtration assay. Receptor concentrations reported here were not corrected for this small loss of receptor.GTPase AssaysMeasurement of GTP hydrolysis has been described previously(6.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.-Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Google Scholar, 32.Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 266-272Google Scholar). The assay medium contained 20 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 μM [γ-32P]GTP (80-200 cpm/fmol) or 10 μM[γ-32P]GTP (4-8 cpm/fmol for GAP-stimulated assays). Unless otherwise indicated, reactions were initiated by addition of vesicles and proceeded for 10 min at 30°C.Nucleotide Binding AssaysBinding of [α-32P]GTP, [35S]GTPγS, or [α-32P]GDP was measured by adsorption of G proteins to BA85 nitrocellulose membranes as described previously(33.Brandt D.R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1656-1664Google Scholar). Final concentrations in the assay were 20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Assays were conducted at 30°C. The concentration of nucleotide and the order of addition of assay components are indicated in the figure legends.PLC Activity AssaysPLC activity was measured as described by Blank et al.(34.Blank J.L. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18206-18216Google Scholar). m1AChR-Gq-[3H]PIP2 vesicles (30 μl) were mixed with assay buffer (60 μl) so that final concentrations were 70 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM EGTA, and 2.3-3.0 mM total MgCl2. GTP (10 μM), CaCl2 (to give 10 nM free Ca2+), and either carbachol (1 mM) or atropine (10 μM) were included except as indicated in the figure legends. The concentrations of free Ca2+ were calculated using constants from Martell and Calvin (35.Martell A.E. Calvin M. Chemistry of the Metal Chelate Compounds. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1952Google Scholar) adjusted for temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The assay mixture (90 μl) was warmed for 3 min at 30°C, and 10 μl of PLC-β1 (1 nM final concentration in 20 mM NaHepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) was added to initiate the assay. The zero time point was taken before addition of PLC-β1. PLC-accessible [3H]PIP2 was measured as [3H]IP3 formed during a 40-min incubation with 1 mM carbachol, 100 nM GTPγS, and 1 μM free Ca2+. No additional product was formed after 30 min, even if fresh PLC was added (data not shown). PLC-accessible PIP2 is reported in the figure legends and ranged from 30 to 70% of the total PIP2.MiscellaneousFor Gqα, Gβγ, m1AChR, and PLC-β1, total protein was estimated by Amido Black staining (29.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Active Gqα was estimated by bound GDP (15.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Google Scholar, 28.Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Google Scholar) and was 40-60% of the amount estimated by Amido Black staining(29.Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli(36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). For enhanced resolution of closely migrating Gqα species, a 42:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio was used, and electrophoresis was continued until the 30-kDa marker left the gel. For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose overnight in cold transfer buffer (37.Mumby S.M. Kahn R.A. Manning D.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 265-269Google Scholar) containing 20% methanol. Proteins were detected as described in the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.).RESULTSSteady-state Regulation of PLC-β1 Activity by Gq and m1AChRSuccessful reconstitution of the regulation of PLC-β1 by receptor is complicated both by the Gq GAP activity of PLC-β1 and by the membrane-bound nature of its PIP2 substrate. To study the regulation of PLC-β1 by muscarinic agonist and GTP in a system composed of known concentrations of pure proteins, purified recombinant Gq and m1AChR were co-reconstituted in a single population of phospholipid vesicles that contained 2-4 mol % [3H]PIP2; purified PLC-β1 was added subsequently. In this system, addition of GTP plus carbachol stimulated steady-state PIP2 hydrolysis substantially, ~60-fold in the example shown in Fig. 2. Stimulation by carbachol plus GTP was blocked by atropine, a muscarinic antagonist. PIP2 hydrolysis was increased only slightly above a low background by either carbachol or GTP alone, and #x0201C;-fold stimulation” in this system depends largely on the basal activity, which may represent only 10-50 cpm. These responses compare well with those observed in natural membranes and many intact cells. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS by itself increased PLC-β1 activity as much or more than did GTP plus carbachol, and the combination of GTPγS and carbachol increased activity 100-200-fold. Stimulation by GTPγS alone evidently reflects nucleotide exchange promoted by unliganded m1AChR because GTPγS-stimulated activity was inhibited ~50% by atropine in the absence of any agonist (data not shown).Figure 2:Reconstitution of Gq-mediated activation of PLC-β1 by m1AChR. m1AChR and Gq were co-reconstituted with [3H]PIP2 as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” The activity of added PLC-β1 was measured in the presence of guanine nucleotide and/or muscarinic ligands.

Conditions were as follows: no addition(-), 10 μM GTP (GTP), 1 mM carbachol (Cch), carbachol plus 10 μM atropine (C+A), and 100 nM GTPγS (γS). All samples contained 10 nM free Ca2+, 2.4 nM Gq, 0.33 nM m1AChR, 1 nM PLC-β1, and 0.56 μM accessible PIP2.

PSGL-1 requires both tyrosine sulfate and O-linked glycans to bind P-selectin. Electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed PSGL-1 purified from human neutrophils indicated that it is a highly extended molecule with an extracellular domain that is ≈50 nm long. Both individual PSGL-1 molecules and rosettes composed of several molecules presumably attached at their transmembrane segments were observed. The extracellular domain of PSGL-1 has 318 residues, including a signal peptide from residues 1-18 and a propeptide from residues 19-41. Using bacterially expressed fusion proteins and synthetic peptides derived from the extracellular domain, we mapped the epitopes for two IgG anti-PSGL-1 monoclonal antibodies, PL1 and PL2. PL2 bound to a region within residues 188-235 that is located in a series of decameric consensus repeats. PL1, which blocks binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin, recognized an epitope spanning residues 49-62. This sequence overlaps the tyrosine sulfation sites at residues 46, 48, and 51 that have been implicated in binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. Our results demonstrate that PSGL-1 is a long, extended molecule and suggest that the P-selectin binding site is located near the N terminus, well above the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1997038287,"The inhibition of proteinase activity by members of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family is a critical regulatory mechanism for a variety of biological processes. Once formed, the serpin enzyme complexes (SECs) are removed from the circulation by a hepatic receptor. The present study suggests that this receptor is very likely the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a prominent liver receptor. In vitro binding studies revealed that antithrombin III (ATIII)•thrombin, heparin cofactor II (HCII)•thrombin, and α1-antitrypsin (α1AT)•trypsin bound to purified LRP, and their binding was inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of LRP-ligand binding activity. In contrast, native or modified forms of the inhibitors were unable to bind to LRP. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which express LRP, mediate the cellular internalization leading to degradation of these SECs, while mouse fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP showed no capacity to internalize and degrade these complexes. SECs were also degraded by HepG2 cells, and this process was inhibited by LRP antibodies, RAP, and chloroquine. The cellular-mediated uptake and degradation was specific for SECs; native or modified forms of the inhibitors were not internalized and degraded. Finally, in vivo clearance studies in rats demonstrated that RAP inhibited the clearance of ATIII•125I-thrombin complexes from the circulation. Together, these results indicate that LRP functions as a liver receptor responsible for the plasma clearance of SECs.

Together, these results indicate that LRP functions as a liver receptor responsible for the plasma clearance of SECs. Serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) are a supergene family comprised of more than 40 members (Carrell and Travis, 1985). Most serpins function to inhibit serine proteinases through the formation of a stable serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) 1The abbreviations used are: SECserpin-enzyme complexLDLRlow density lipoprotein receptorLRPLDLR-related proteingp330glycoprotein 330RAPreceptor-associated proteinATIIIantithrombin IIIHCIIheparin cofactor IIα1ATα1-antitrypsinPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorα2Mα2-macroglobulinα2M∗methylamine-activated α2MPR3proteinase 3ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminTBSTris-buffered salineMEFmouse embryonal fibroblast.(Laskowski and Kato, 1980, Travis and Salvesen, 1983); however, some members such as angiotensinogen and ovalbumin are unable to inhibit proteinases (Doolittle, 1983; Hunt and Dayhoff, 1980). The inhibitory serpins are found in three distinct structural conformations; native (active inhibitor), cleaved (an inactive inhibitor generated after cleavage of its reactive center loop), or complexed with a proteinase. The inhibitory action of serpins affect a broad range of biological processes including coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, connective tissue turnover, complement activation, and phagocytosis (for reviews, see Travis and Salvesen(1983), Bjork and Danielsson(1986), and Carrell and Travis(1985)). serpin-enzyme complex low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR-related protein glycoprotein 330 receptor-associated protein antithrombin III heparin cofactor II α1-antitrypsin plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 urokinase-type plasminogen activator α2-macroglobulin methylamine-activated α2M proteinase 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline mouse embryonal fibroblast. α1-Antitrypsin (α1AT, also referred to as α1-proteinase inhibitor) is the prototypic member of the serpin family and primarily acts to inhibit neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3 (PR3) (Travis and Salvesen, 1982; Carrell and Travis, 1985; Rao et al., 1991). Neutrophil elastase and PR3 degrade connective tissue matrix proteins, and both enzymes can induce emphysema in animal models (Janoff et al., 1977; Senior et al., 1977; Kao et al., 1988). α1AT is present in high concentration in the plasma (>25 μM) and protects the connective tissue-rich lung against excessive proteolysis through its inhibitory action on neutrophil elastase and PR3. The protection of lung tissue by α1AT is evidenced by studies that have genetically linked decreased functional levels of α1AT with the early onset of pulmonary emphysema (Laurell and Eriksson, 1963; Travis and Salvesen, 1983; Carrell, 1986). Antithrombin III (ATIII), a serpin with extensive sequence similarity to α1AT, plays a major role in hemostasis by acting as the principle physiological inhibitor of thrombin and coagulation Factor Xa (for reviews see Bjork and Danielsson(1986), Bjork et al.(1989), and Olson and Bjork(1992)). This inhibitor is present in high concentration in the plasma (5 μM), and its importance is underscored by the observation that reduced functional levels of ATIII are associated with increased risks of thromboembolic disorders (Edeburg, 1965; Lane et al., 1991). Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a 65,000-dalton inhibitor of thrombin, cathepsin G, and chymotrypsin (Tollefsen et al., 1982; Church and Hoffman, 1994; Church et al., 1995) and is present in the human plasma at a concentration of 1.4 μM. Like ATIII, its ability to react with target proteinases is greatly accelerated in the presence of heparin. Individuals exhibiting low levels of HCII but having normal levels of ATIII display thrombotic tendencies (Tran et al., 1985; Sie et al., 1985), suggesting that HCII, like ATIII, is an important inhibitor of thrombin in vivo. An important feature of serpin metabolism was originally identified when Lollar et al.(1980) showed that 125I-thrombin in complex with ATIII was rapidly cleared from the circulation of rabbits by the liver. Additional studies by several groups (Bauer et al., 1982; Fuchs et al., 1982; Pratt et al., 1988) have demonstrated that the liver mediates rapid clearance of complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, α1AT•trypsin, and α1AT•elastase from the circulation. Further, these complexes could compete for one another's clearance, indicating that the plasma elimination of these SECs was occurring via a common receptor pathway. Mast et al.(1991) showed that the kinetics of plasma elimination of the native and cleaved inhibitors were 10-50 times slower than that of the complexed inhibitors, suggesting that the liver receptor might preferentially clear the SEC as opposed to the free serpin. The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) are two prominent hepatic receptors that are members of the LDLR superfamily. This receptor family also includes the very low density lipoprotein receptor and glycoprotein 330 (gp330). LRP is expressed in many tissues and cell types (Moestrup et al., 1992) and is present in high abundance in the liver. The requirement for LRP expression during development was demonstrated when targeted disruption of the LRP gene resulted in termination of the null embryos at day 13.5 during development (Herz et al., 1992). LRP interacts with numerous ligands and is thought to play key roles in both lipoprotein metabolism and proteinase regulation (for reviews, see Krieger and Herz(1994), Strickland et al.(1994, 1995), and Moestrup(1994)). In addition to mediating the catabolism of α2-macroglobulin (α2M)-proteinase complexes (Ashcom et al., 1990), LRP also binds to several SECs, including elastase•α1AT (Poller et al., 1995), urinary-type plasminogen activator (uPA)•PAI-1 (Herz et al., 1992; Nykjaer et al., 1992), and tissue plasminogen activator•PAI-1 (Orth et al., 1992). However, the receptor responsible for the hepatic catabolism of a number of other predominant SECs remained obscure. Studies were therefore initiated to determine if LRP could interact with those SECs. In this report we demonstrate that LRP binds directly to complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin, can mediate their cellular uptake and degradation, and appears responsible for their in vivo clearance from the circulation. LRP was isolated from human placenta as described by Ashcom et al.(1990). Human RAP, expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, was prepared and purified as described previously (Williams et al., 1992). α2M was purified from human plasma by zinc-chelate chromatography as described previously (Ashcom et al., 1990). α2M•methylamine, designated (α2M∗), was prepared by incubation of native α2M with 200 mM methylamine (Sigma) for 30 min at 25°C followed by dialysis against Tris-buffered saline (TBS). HCII was purified from human plasma as described previously (Griffith et al., 1985). Antithrombin III was isolated from human plasma as described (Miller-Andersson et al., 1974). α1AT was purchased from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Inhibitors inactivated by cleavage of the reactive center loop, without complex formation, are referred to as modified or cleaved inhibitors. Modified inhibitors were prepared by incubation of inhibitor in TBS (1 mg/ml) with 100 μl of activated immobilized papain-Sepharose (Pierce) for 30 min at 25°C. To monitor the efficiency of papain to cleave inhibitors, cleaved preparations were tested for their ability to inhibit target proteinases. In addition, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the inhibitors revealed a shift in mobility on 8-16% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) as compared with native inhibitors and also showed that papain treatment did not result in excess proteolysis of the cleaved inhibitors. Thrombin (α-form) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Trypsin was purchased from Sigma. To prepare complexes of ATIII•thrombin and HCII•thrombin, the enzyme and inhibitor were combined in a 1:2 molar ratio and were incubated for 30 min at 25°C. Complexes of α1AT•trypsin were prepared by incubation of trypsin and α1AT at a 1:2 molar ratio for 5 min at 25°C, followed by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) (in a molar amount equal to that of trypsin added) to inhibit any residual trypsin activity. uPA was provided by Jack Henkin (Abbott Park, IL). Active PAI-1 was purchased from Molecular Innovations (Royal Oak, MI). Complexes of uPA•PAI-1 were prepared by incubation of a 1:1 molar ratio of active PAI-1 with uPA for 30 min at 25°C. Proteins were labeled with [125I]iodine to a specific activity ranging from 2 to 10 μCi/μg of protein using IODOGEN (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin, fraction V (BSA) was purchased from Sigma. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the 515-kDa heavy chain of LRP (R777) and another one to a synthetic peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of the 85-kDa light chain of LRP (R704) have been described elsewhere (Kounnas et al., 1992). R777 antibodies were affinity-purified on a column of LRP-Sepharose. R704 antibodies were purified on protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Both of the rabbit antibody preparations were dialyzed against isotonic PBS, heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56°C, and filtered with a 0.45 μM Acrodisc (Corning, Corning, NY) prior to use in cell assays. The mouse monoclonal antibody to LRP, designated 8G1, has been described (Strickland et al., 1990). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed as detailed elsewhere (Kounnas et al., 1993). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated with the native, cleaved, or complexed forms of ATIII, HCII, or α1AT (prepared as described under “Proteins”) at 10 μg/ml in TBS, pH 8.0, for 4 h at 37°C, blocked with 3% BSA, TBS, pH 8.0, then incubated with various concentrations of LRP (0.6-150 nM) in 3% BSA, TBS, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Tween-20 for 18 h at 4°C. For ELISAs measuring the effects of RAP, coated wells were incubated with 20 nM LRP in the presence of increasing concentrations of RAP (0.2-450 nM). LRP binding was detected with the mouse monoclonal antibody 8G1. Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2, ATCC HB 8065) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1% L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). A normal mouse embryonal fibroblast line (MEF) and a mouse embryonal fibroblast cell line that is deficient in LRP biosynthesis (PEA13) were obtained from Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and maintained as described by Willnow and Herz(1994). Cells were seeded into 12-well dishes (Corning) at 2-3 × 105 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cellular internalization and degradation assays were conducted according to Kounnas et al. (1995a). Prior to performing the assays, cultured cells were washed with medium and incubated in medium containing 1% Nutridoma (Boehringer Manneheim), 20 mM Hepes, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1.5% BSA (assay medium). For assays with HepG2 cells, radiolabeled serpin-enzyme complexes (10 nM) in assay medium were incubated with cells for 18 h at 37°C in the presence of RAP (1 μM), LRP antibodies (100 μg/ml), or chloroquine (0.1 mM, Sigma). For assays using antibodies, cultured cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C with assay medium containing antibodies. Antibodies (100 μg/ml) were also included during the cellular assay. For assays utilizing cultured fibroblasts, 125I-proteins (5-10 nM) were added in assay medium either alone or in the presence of RAP (1 μM) for the indicated times. Total radioactivity secreted in the cell culture medium that was soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid was corrected for non-cellular mediated degradation by subtracting the amount of degradation that occurred in parallel wells lacking cells. The amount of radiolabeled ligand that was internalized by cells was defined as the amount of radioactivity that remained associated with the cell pellet following trypsin-EDTA, proteinase K (Sigma) treatment (Chappell et al., 1992). Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/ml)/xylazine (20 mg/ml) at a dose of 90 mg/kg ketamine, 8 mg/kg xylazine. A bolus of 500 μl of ATIII•125I-thrombin (100 nM) in the presence or absence of RAP (110 μM) was injected into the tail vein over a period of approximately 15 s. At selected time intervals following injection (1, 5, 10, and 20 min), blood (200 μl) was collected from the vena cava into 10 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, and an aliquot (50 μl) was counted for its 125I content. In those experiments examining the clearance of 125I-α2M∗, a bolus of 500 μl of 125I-α2M (10 nM) in the presence or absence of RAP (32 μM) was injected. The initial time point, taken 1 min after injection, was considered to represent 100% radioactivity in the circulation. The clearance of each preparation was examined in two rats and the results averaged. The ability of LRP to bind to native, cleaved, or complexed forms of ATIII, HCII, and α1AT was measured using an ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1, LRP binds to ATIII•thrombin (panel A), HCII•thrombin (panel B), and α1AT•trypsin (panel C), while no detectable binding to the native or cleaved forms of ATIII (panel A), HCII (panel B), and α1AT (panel C) was observed. The lack of saturation in these assays indicates that the affinity of LRP for these SECs is weaker than that measured for other LRP ligands. Apparent half-saturation values measured for the binding interaction of these complexes with LRP are estimated to range from 80 to 120 nM. Since RAP is known to inhibit the binding of ligands to LRP (Herz et al., 1991), binding assays were performed to test the effect of RAP on the binding of LRP to ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin. Fig. 2depicts an ELISA in which LRP was incubated with serpin-proteinase-coated wells in the presence of increasing concentrations of RAP. These data demonstrate that RAP is capable of competing for the binding of these SECs to LRP. Cellular uptake and degradation experiments in mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF) which express LRP and in a mutant MEF cell line that lacks LRP (PEA13) were conducted in order to determine the role of LRP in the catabolism of 125I-labeled complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin. For these experiments, trypsin or α-thrombin were labeled with 125I-iodine and then complexed to an inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3, little or no detectable free enzyme remained after addition of inhibitors. Fig. 4shows that LRP-expressing MEF cells, but not LRP-deficient PEA13 cells, were capable of internalizing and degrading complexes of ATIII•125I-thrombin (panels A and B), HCII•125I-thrombin (panels C and D), and α1AT•125I-trypsin (panels E and F). Further, in MEF cells, the uptake and degradation of labeled complexes was inhibited by RAP, an antagonist of the binding of LRP to ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin (see Fig. 2). The ability of RAP to block uptake and degradation of 125I-SECs in LRP-expressing cells and the inability of LRP-deficient cells to mediate SEC uptake and degradation point to LRP as a mediator of the endocytosis of SECs. To further implicate LRP in mediating the uptake and degradation of ATIII•125I-thrombin, HCII•125I-thrombin, and α1AT•125I-trypsin complexes, the effect of LRP antibodies on the degradation of 125I-labeled SECs by HepG2 cells was determined. Fig. 5shows that RAP, LRP antibodies, and chloroquine (a drug that blocks lysosomal degradation) inhibit the degradation of ATIII•125I-thrombin (panel A), HCII•125I-thrombin (panel B), and α1AT•125I-trypsin (panel C). In each case, control antibodies had little effect. These data demonstrate that LRP is capable of mediating the endocytosis leading to lysosomal degradation of labeled ATIII•thrombin, HCII• thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin in HepG2 cells, raising the possibility that LRP can function in vivo to mediate the liver clearance of these complexes. Previous studies examining the clearance of 125I-labeled SECs from plasma in a mouse model have shown that while the complexed form of ATIII, HCII, and α1AT are cleared rapidly by hepatocytes, the clearance of the native and cleaved inhibitors is slow (Mast et al., 1991). We, therefore performed assays to investigate the LRP-mediated cellular endocytosis of 125I-labeled inhibitors in the native, cleaved, or complexed forms. Fig. 6shows the uptake of 125I-ATIII (native, cleaved, and thrombin complexed) in MEF (LRP-expressing cells) (panel A) and PEA13 (LRP-deficient cells) (panel B), 125I-HCII (native, cleaved, and thrombin complexed) in MEF and PEA13 cells (panels C and D, respectively), and 125I-α1AT (native, cleaved, and complexed to trypsin) in MEF and PEA13 cells (panels E and F, respectively). These data demonstrate that the labeled inhibitors alone (native or cleaved) are not endocytosed by mouse fibroblasts. However, complexes of 125I-ATIII•thrombin, 125I-HCII•thrombin, and 125I-α1AT•trypsin are internalized efficiently by LRP-expressing MEF cells but not the mutant LRP-deficient PEA13 cells and this process is inhibited by RAP. Further, these complexes are efficiently degraded in LRP-expressing cells (but not LRP-deficient cells) in a RAP-dependent manner with similar kinetics as shown in Fig. 4(data not shown). These data reveal that proteinase complex formation of ATIII, HCII, and α1AT is required for LRP-mediated endocytosis. Complexes of uPA•PAI-1 bind to LRP with an affinity constant of 1 nM (Nykjaer et al., 1994), while complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin bind to LRP with estimated affinities of 80-120 nM. This observation prompted us to compare the amounts of 125I-labeled SECs that were degraded by cells in an LRP-dependent manner. The first experiments were designed to determine the relative levels of 125I-labeled SEC degraded by mouse fibroblasts expressing LRP (MEF) using a ligand concentration of 1 nM. These data are shown in Fig. 7(panel A) and reveal that the amount of uPA•PAI-1 degraded in an LRP-dependent manner (as determined by the ability of RAP to compete) is approximately 10-fold greater than that of the other SECs examined and approximately 3-fold greater than α2M∗, another LRP ligand. Further experiments were conducted using a dose of 125I-labeled ligand (0.6-150 for ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin (panel B) and 0.6-16.6 nM for uPA•PAI-1 (panel C)). From these data it is evident that at a given concentration of 125I-labeled SEC, approximately 10-fold more uPA•PAI-1 is degraded when compared to the other SECs. For example, at a ligand concentration of 15 nM, approximately 2000 fmol of uPA•PAI-1 is degraded in 18 h, an amount that is achieved when a 10-fold higher concentration (150 nM) of 125I-labeled ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin is used. These data are consistent with the higher affinity of LRP for uPA•PAI-1 (1 nM) and a lower affinity of LRP for ATIII• thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin (approximately 80-120 nM). To evaluate the role of LRP in mediating the plasma clearance of SECs, the effect of RAP on the clearance rate of a representative SEC, the ATIII-thrombin complex, was measured. RAP is known to have a pronounced effect on the removal of 125I-α2M∗ from the mouse circulation (Willnow et al. 1994), and thus 125I-α2M∗ was used as a control for these experiments. The results, shown in Fig. 8, demonstrate that when co-injected with the ligand, RAP significantly delays the clearance of 125I-α2M∗ (Fig. 8A) and ATIII-125I-thrombin complexes (Fig. 8B) from the rat circulation. These studies indicate that a RAP-sensitive hepatic receptor, most likely LRP, plays a major role in the removal of ATIII-125I-thrombin complexes from the circulation. The existence of a hepatic receptor that is responsible for binding and removing SECs from the plasma was demonstrated in early studies (Pizzo and Gonias, 1984; Shifman and Pizzo, 1982; Imber and Pizzo, 1981; Fuchs et al., 1982; Pratt et al., 1988) in which labeled SECs (ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, α1AT•trypsin, and α1AT•elastase) were shown to be rapidly cleared by the liver (half-lives = 3, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively). These complexes apparently all bound to the same receptor, since they were able to cross-compete with one another (Pratt et al., 1988). However, clearance of these molecules was not competed with high concentrations of α2M•proteinase complexes (Fuchs et al., 1982). The clearance mechanism appears specific for the enzyme-complexed form of these serpins, since studies by Mast et al.(1991) demonstrated that the clearance of native and cleaved forms of ATIII, HCII, and α1AT occurred at a considerably slower rate (half-lives > 1 h) than the proteinase-complexed serpins. The data presented in the current study suggest that LRP is the hepatic receptor responsible for the clearance of these complexes. This conclusion is supported by several independent lines of evidence. First of all, we demonstrated that purified LRP can directly bind to several SECs (ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin) coated on microtiter wells, and that the binding is competed by RAP. Second, SECs are internalized and degraded in mouse fibroblasts that express LRP, but not in mouse fibroblasts genetically deficient in LRP. Third, we demonstrated that LRP antagonists, RAP and LRP antibodies, blocked the cellular uptake and degradation of 125I-labeled ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin. Fourth, our studies have shown that the interaction of SECs with LRP has properties expected of the hepatic clearance mechanism; LRP does not recognize the native and cleaved forms of the inhibitors but readily internalizes the proteinase complexed form of the inhibitors. Taken together, these data suggest that the liver receptor responsible for the plasma clearance of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin is LRP. To demonstrate this, in vivo clearance studies were performed in rats. The ability of RAP to inhibit hepatic clearance of ATIII-125I-thrombin indicates that a RAP-sensitive hepatic receptor is responsible for this process. While RAP is known to bind to all members of the LDLR superfamily, only two of these receptors, LDLR and LRP, are known to be expressed in high levels in the liver. Our studies indicate that the LDLR does not play a significant role in the catabolism of SECs, since PEA13 fibroblasts, which express LDLR and are normal in their ability to catabolize LDL (Willnow and Herz, 1994; Kounnas et al., 1995c), are unable to mediate the cellular catabolism of SECs. Thus, the in vivo clearance studies suggest that LRP is playing a prominent role in the hepatic clearance of SECs. Perlmutter et al. (1990a, 1990b) described a SEC receptor on monocytes and HepG2 cells which internalized complexes of α1AT•trypsin and α1AT•elastase, and it is highly likely that this receptor is LRP. In the present investigation, we found that the cellular uptake and degradation of ATIII•thrombin, HCII• thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin by Hep G2 cells is inhibited by anti-LRP IgG. In addition to a receptor that mediates the endocytosis of SECs, studies by several investigators suggest that binding of SECs to the cell surface may result in signal transduction events. Perlmutter et al.(1988) demonstrated that binding of elastase•α1AT complexes to monocytes or macrophages resulted in increased gene expression of α1AT, while Banda et al.(1988) showed that cleaved α1AT stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis. Hoffman et al.(1989) reported that HCII could be cleaved by proteinases to generate products that stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis, suggesting that cleaved serpins release biologically active molecules. While the mechanism of signal transduction by these complexes is unclear, it seems likely that a distinct signaling receptor, different from LRP, may exist and would account for these effects. The existence of a clearance mechanism for SECs is likely important since such complexes are known to dissociate with time, releasing active enzyme along with the cleaved inhibitor (Travis and Salvesen, 1983; Carrell and Boswell, 1986). ATIII is a primary inhibitor of thrombin and FXa and plays a major role in maintaining normal hemostasis (Bjork et al., 1989; Olson and Bjork, 1992). Disruption of the normal balance of thrombin and inhibitor activity results in either thrombosis (Egeberg, 1965; Lane et al., 1991) or bleeding disorders (Owen et al., 1983); therefore, it is clear that maintaining an appropriate amount of thrombin activity is critical for normal hemostasis. The principle action of ATIII may be to localize clotting by inhibiting thrombin that has escaped into the circulation, and the LRP-mediated clearance of ATIII•thrombin complexes may serve to help maintain normal hemostasis. The imbalance of α1AT/proteinase activity has been associated with various pathological conditions such as pulmonary emphysema (Laurell and Eriksson, 1963; Travis and Salvesen, 1983; Carrell, 1986). α1AT has been implicated as a primary modulator of elastase and proteinase 3 activity during inflammatory processes. In acute inflammation, infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, as well as damaged cells, release excessive amounts of proteinases resulting in tissue damage. This damage can be minimized by rapid inhibition of proteinase activity by inhibitors present in body fluids. Elastase and PR3 are released by neutrophils during inflammation and participate in the degradation of extracellular matrix components. Once these enzymes are inhibited by α1AT, the complexes formed are known to be cleared by macrophages and fibroblasts in a receptor-mediated process. LRP is found in high concentration on fibroblasts and macrophages (Moestrup et al., 1992) and has been shown to bind and mediate the uptake of at least two α1AT•proteinase complexes (Poller et al., 1995; this study) and therefore is very likely to represent the receptor responsible for the endocytosis of α1AT•proteinase complexes formed during the inflammatory response. Comparative experiments demonstrated that several higher affinity LRP ligands such as uPA•PAI-1 and α2M∗ were internalized and subsequently degraded to a greater extent than complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin. This is likely related to the weaker affinity of these latter ligands for LRP. Interestingly, the affinity for the interaction of ligands with LRP varies considerably: uPA•PAI-1 (<1 nM; Nyjkaer et al.(1994)), α2M•methylamine (10 nM; Ashcom et al.(1990)), LpL (18 nM; Chappell et al.(1992)), thrombospondin (3-20 nM; Mikhailenko et al.(1995)), pro-uPA (45 nM; Kounnas et al.(1993)), PAI-1 (55 nM; Nykjaer et al.(1994)), hepatic lipase (52 nM; Kounnas et al. (1995a)), apoE (54 nM; Kounnas et al. (1995b)), amyloid precursor protein (80 nM; Kounnas et al. (1995c)), and approximately 80-120 nM for the complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin. The relatively lower affinity of LRP for the SECs (ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin) as compared to other ligands may be compensated for during conditions of thrombosis or inflammation where the plasma or interstitial fluid levels of complexes are greatly elevated. Other factors may also augment LRP-mediated uptake of the SECs. For example cell-surface proteoglycans, which have been shown to facilitate the uptake of a number of LRP ligands including lipoprotein lipase (Chappell et al., 1993), hepatic lipase (Kounnas et al., 1995), and thrombospondin (Mikhailenko et al., 1995), may act to concentrate SECs on the surface of LRP-expressing cells and thereby increase their local concentration. In summary, the current investigation demonstrates that LRP can bind and endocytose complexes of ATIII•thrombin, HCII•thrombin, and α1AT•trypsin, but not the native or the cleaved inhibitors. In vivo clearance studies confirm that LRP functions to remove SECs from the plasma. These findings expand the role of LRP as a SEC receptor. We thank Daniel A. Lawrence for helpful suggestions and J. J. Herz for providing the normal and LRP-deficient mouse embryonal fibroblasts. We greatly appreciate the excellent technical assistance of Fran Battey, Sue Robinson, and Eileen Morgan."

Consistent with previous reports, we detected ryanodine receptor expression in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. In addition, we detected ryanodine receptor expression in various other excitable cells including PC12 and A7r5 cells. Several muscle cell lines (BC3H1, C2C12, L6, and Sol8) weakly expressed ryanodine receptor when undifferentiated but strongly expressed type 1 and type 3 ryanodine receptor isoforms when differentiated into a muscle phenotype.

Expression of ryanodine receptors at the protein level in these cells was confirmed using [3H]ryanodine binding. We also investigated the function of ryanodine receptors in Ca2+ signaling in HeLa cells using single-cell Fura-2 imaging. Neither caffeine nor ryanodine caused a detectable elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in single HeLa cells.

INTRODUCTIONCells have two major mechanisms available for regulating the release of internal Ca2+. In one case, external signals acting on receptors at the cell periphery generate the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which diffuses into the cell and mobilizes Ca2+ by engaging inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum(1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). The other mechanism employs a related, but distinct, family of intracellular channels, the ryanodine receptors (RyRs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: RyRryanodine receptorPCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRbpbase pair(s).) so called because they strongly bind the plant alkaloid ryanodine(2.Fill M. Coronado R. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 453-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RyRs were first identified as the intracellular calcium channels responsible for releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of both skeletal and cardiac muscle. The two striated muscle RyR isoforms have been designated RyR1 (skeletal muscle) and RyR2 (cardiac muscle). A recently identified isoform, referred to as RyR3, appears to be a major isoform in brain and smooth muscle(3.Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V.

Sci. 1993; 14: 98-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).Evidence for the expression of RyRs in various excitable and nonexcitable tissues has mostly been obtained using either molecular or pharmacological methods. For many excitable cells, these approaches have demonstrated the tissue-specific expression and function of RyRs ((6.Ledbetter M.W. Preiner J.K. Louis C.F. Mickelson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31544-31551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (7.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J.

Ryanodine Receptors: Basic and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 119-154Google Scholar)). However, the situation concerning the expression of RyRs in some nonexcitable tissues and their possible participation in agonist-stimulated calcium signals is far from clear(8.Berridge M.J. Cheek T.R. Bennett D.L. Bootman M.D. Sorrentino V. Ryanodine Receptors: Basic and Clinical Aspects. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 119-154Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, for example, effects of ryanodine on agonist-induced calcium signals in intact cells (9.Sanchez-Bueno A. Cobbold P.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10.Nathanson N.M. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1349-1364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and specific ryanodine binding sites in hepatocyte vesicles (11.Shoshan-Barmatz V. Pressley T.A.

Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated. However, the pharmacology of the putative RyR in hepatocytes is very different from those expressed in muscle tissues (9.Sanchez-Bueno A. Cobbold P.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13.McNulty T.J. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and furthermore, the expression of RyR mRNA in hepatocytes has not been detected using molecular techniques(7.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 11.Shoshan-Barmatz V. Pressley T.A. Higham S. Kraus-Friedmann N. Biochem.

For example, in mink lung epithelial cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes, which appear to express RyR3, effects of ryanodine but not caffeine have been observed (3.Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R.

Pinset (Institut Pasteur, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France), and HUVEC cells freshly isolated from human umbilical vein were provided by Dr. D. Collen (Centre for Molecular and Vascular Biology, KU Leuven, Belgium). PC12 cells were differentiated as described previously(23.De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Himpens B. Missiaen L. Borghgraef R. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sol8 and BC3H1 cells were differentiated by reducing the concentration of fetal calf serum in the growing medium to 0.5%. For differentiation of C2C12 cells, cells were grown in medium containing 1% horse serum and 0.5% insulin transferrin selenite. Differentiation of L6 cells was evoked by growing cells in 5% horse serum. For single-cell imaging of HeLa cells, cells were transferred from plastic culture dishes to glass coverslips (22 mm diameter, Chance Propper Ltd, Smethick, Warley, UK). Cells were allowed to attach to the coverslips for 48 h before use.Reverse Transcription and PCR AmplificationTotal RNA was prepared from different tissues and cell lines according to Chirgwin et al.(24.Chirgwin J.J. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). Random primed first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim). RyR cDNAs were amplified using degenerate primers based on sequences conserved among the three RyR isoforms (rabbit RyR1, RyR2, RyR3; human RyR1, RyR3; pig RyR1) and corresponding to the putative membrane-spanning regions M3 and M4(25.Takeshima H.

The sequences of the primers and their position within the rabbit RyR sequences are shown below.Forward primer (RyR1, 14419-14441; RyR2, 14230-14252; RyR3, 14008-14030) was as follows: 5′-CA(C/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)GA(C/T)AT(A/C/T)GCIATGGG-3′. Reverse primer (RyR1, 14929- 14951; RyR2, 14740-14762; RyR3, 14518-14540) was as follows: 5′-A(A/G/T)(A/G)TA(A/G)TT(A/C/G/T)GCIA(A/G)(A/G)TT(A/G)TG(C/T)TC-3′. PCR reactions (100 μl) contained 0.4-2% of the first strand cDNA template, 100 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. Reactions were carried out in a Biometra UNO-Thermoblock for 30 cycles using a denaturing step for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 1 min at 50°C, and extension for 1 min at 72°C. This was followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.Cloning and Sequencing of RT-PCR ProductsPCR products were fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel, and individual bands were purified using the Geneclean II DNA purification kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The purified DNA was cloned into the plasmid vector pGEM-T (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and clones containing inserts of the expected size were sequenced in both directions by dideoxy sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Corp.).Restriction Enzyme Analysis of RT-PCR ProductsRT-PCR products were subjected to restriction enzyme analysis to determine which isoforms were present. For mouse RT-PCR products, three restriction enzymes, SacI, FokI, and AvaII, were chosen. SacI was predicted to cut RyR1 only, to produce fragments of approximately 395 and 135 base pairs (bp). FokI was predicted to cut RyR1 into 500- and 30-bp fragments and cut RyR2 into 200-, 180-, and 150-bp fragments. AvaII was expected to cut RyR1 into 270- and 260-bp fragments and RyR3 into 400- and 130-bp fragments. For rat RT-PCR products, the restriction enzymes SacI, BglII, and EaeI were chosen. SacI should cut RyR1 only into 395- and 135-bp fragments, BglII should cut RyR2 only into 295- and 235-bp fragments, and EaeI should cut RyR3 only into 350- and 180-bp fragments. For human and pig RT-PCR products, the restriction enzymes SacI, BglII, and BstEII were chosen. SacI was expected to cut RyR1 only into 300-, 100-, and 130-bp fragments, BglII was expected to cut RyR2 only into 295- and 235-bp fragments, and BstEII was expected to cut RyR3 only into 280- and 250-bp fragments.Microsomal Preparation and [3H]Ryanodine BindingTotal microsomes were isolated from the various cell lines and from whole rabbit brain as described previously(19.Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The binding assay was based on the optimized conditions described for ryanodine binding to the rabbit brain ryanodine receptor(26.McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Binding to microsomes (1.25 mg/ml) was measured in 10 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 600 mM KCl, 2 mM ATP, 0.89 mM CaCl2 (free Ca2+≈ 100 μM; calculated with MaxChelator (Dr. C. Patton, Stanford University)), 0.8 mM benzamidine, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 nM [3H]ryanodine (DuPont NEN) in the presence or absence of 20 μM unlabeled ryanodine. Incubation was for 1 h at 37°C. Bound and free [3H]ryanodine were separated by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters on a Combi cell harvester (Skatron, Lier, Norway). Filters were washed with 3 × 2.75 ml of ice-cold 10 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl. Assuming that the ryanodine receptors in the various cell lines have a similar affinity for ryanodine as the brain receptor (1.3 nM)(27.McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18454-18460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the values measured in the presence of 8 nM [3H]ryanodine should reflect the relative distribution of the receptors.Single-cell Fura-2 ImagingThe culture medium was replaced with an extracellular medium containing 121 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 6 mM NaHCO3, 5.5 mM glucose, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.3). Cells were loaded with 2 μM Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Molecular Probes Inc.) by incubation for 35-40 min at room temperature (20°C) followed by an extracellular medium wash and a further 20-min incubation to allow de-esterification of the loaded dye. Coverslips were mounted at room temperature on the stage of a Nikon diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescent images were obtained at video rate (40 ms each wavelength) by alternate excitation at 340 or 380 nm using an image-processing system (Imagine, Synoptics Ltd, Cambridge, UK) interfaced to a DEC MicroVAX II microcomputer and then filtered with a 200-ms time constant. The emission signal at 510 nm was collected by a charge-coupled device intensifying camera (Photonic Science, Robertsbridge, Kent, UK), and the digitized signals were stored and processed as described previously(28.O'Sullivan A.J. Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The responses shown in the present study were obtained from four independent trials for each experiment.RESULTSRT-PCR Amplification of RyR IsoformsTo search for RyRs in a range of excitable and nonexcitable cell types from different species we used a RT-PCR assay. In this technique, RNA is used as a template for an initial reverse transcription step to produce cDNA, followed by amplification of specific sequences using PCR. By aligning the previously published RyR sequences (see “Materials and Methods”), we designed degenerate PCR primers to amplify an approximately 530-bp product from the 3′ region of each RyR isoform. This region is highly conserved between isoforms and species but, importantly, also contains sufficient differences to allow the three RyR isoforms to be distinguished. The intron-exon structure of this region has been determined for two RyR isoforms. In the case of pig RyR1 genomic DNA, the primers would be expected to amplify a fragment that spans 4 introns (approximately 1700 bp), ( 2R. Bolt, P. Vegeli, and R. Fries(1992) Sus scrofa RyR1 gene for ryanodine receptor. Submitted 1992 to the EMBL/GenBankTM/DDBJ databases. Accession number Z15155. Unpublished data.) and within human RyR3 genomic DNA, the primers should amplify a fragment that spans at least 1 intron. ( 3V. Sorrentino, G. Giannini, P. Malzac, and M. G. Mattei(1993) Homo sapiens RyR3 gene for ryanodine receptor type 3 (partial). Submitted 1993 to the EMBL/GenBankTM/DDBJ databases. Accession number X74270. Unpublished data.) Interestingly, the intron identified within the human RyR3 gene is in the same position as an intron in the pig RyR1 gene, suggesting that some intron splice sites may be conserved between RyR isoforms and animal species. Therefore, although the intron-exon structure of all three RyR isoforms from each species tested has not been determined, it seems unlikely that PCR amplification of any contaminating genomic DNA would produce the correctly sized PCR product (530 bp).As the majority of cell types tested were of mouse, rat, or human origin, and all three RyR isoforms have been found in various regions of the brain(7.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 31.Furuichi T. Furutama D. Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4794-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the primers by carrying out PCR amplification of cDNA from mouse, rat, and human brain. A product of the predicted size (530 bp) was amplified from all three brain cDNAs (Fig. 1A). Control reactions containing H2O or RNA were negative in the PCR (Fig. 1A). Cloning and sequencing the brain PCR products revealed that the primers were able to specifically amplify all three RyR isoforms. The primers were also able to specifically amplify RyRs from mouse heart (RyR2 and RyR3) and skeletal muscle (RyR1 and RyR3) (data not shown).A range of cell types was subjected to PCR amplification using these primers (Fig. 1B). Only two of the nonexcitable cell types tested, HeLa and LLC-PK1 cells, yielded detectable PCR products. The other nonexcitable cell types, including fibroblasts and Jurkat cells, appeared negative in the PCR. As a positive control for the quality of the cDNA, amplification reactions were also carried out using β-actin PCR primers. Products of the correct size and of equivalent intensity were amplified from all cDNAs tested in this study (data not shown).Using the RyR primeres, products of the predicted size were detected in most excitable cell types, including differentiated and undifferentiated PC12 cells and A7r5 cells. A very faint PCR product was detected in GH3 and Rin m5F cells, indicating that these cell types probably also express RyRs, but very weakly. An interesting pattern of expression was detected in the BC3H1, Sol8, C2C12, and L6 muscle cell lines. By adjusting the culture conditions appropriately (see “Materials and Methods”), these cells can either be maintained in a rapidly growing non-muscle state or differentiated into a muscle phenotype. In the undifferentiated cells, we detected only very weak expression of RyR by PCR. However, differentiation of the cells correlated with the appearance of much more abundant levels of the 530-bp product (Fig. 1B).Tissue-specific Distribution of RyR IsoformsThe amplification products obtained from most of the PCR-positive tissues were cloned and sequenced to determine which isoforms were expressed. Although we sequenced between 5 and 20 clones obtained from these PCR-positive cell types, in some only one or two RyR isoforms were detected. To confirm that these were the only isoforms amplified, we performed restriction digests on these PCR products, using enzymes specific for each isoform (see “Materials and Methods”).Fig. 2 shows the restriction digest analysis of RyR PCR products amplified from differentiated BC3H1 cells, differentiated L6 cells, and HeLa cells. The BC3H1 PCR product was partially cut with SacI (RyR1-specific) and completely cut with AvaII (digests RyR1 and −3) to produce fragments of the expected sizes, suggesting that BC3H1 cells express RyR1 and RyR3. The L6 PCR product was completely cut with SacI and not cut by either BglII (RyR2-specific) or EaeI (RyR3-specific). The HeLa cell PCR product was completely cut with BglII (RyR2-specific) to produce fragments of the expected size. The combined results obtained from sequencing and restriction enzyme digest of the PCR products are presented in Table 1.Figure 2:Restriction enzyme digest of RyR RT-PCR products. RT-PCR products were produced as described under “Materials and Methods.” PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes identified using the manufacturer's suggested protocols, and the fragments produced were subjected to electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel.

In addition, there is conflicting evidence on the expression of ryanodine receptors in A7r5 cells(32.Missiaen L. DeClerck I. Droogmans G. Plessers L. De Smedt H. Raeymaekers L. Casteels R. J. Physiol. 1990; 427: 171-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33.Blatter L.A. Wier W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H576-H586PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore sought to confirm the PCR results and to obtain evidence for RyR expression at the protein level, using a [3H]ryanodine binding assay. Fig. 3 compares the [3H]ryanodine binding for several cell types. The data presented in Fig. 3 are not strictly quantitative, since the different RyR isoforms may have variable affinities for ryanodine. However, the data presented qualitatively demonstrate the expression of RyRs and furthermore may reflect the relative abundance of the proteins if the binding affinities were similar. All the cell lines tested appeared to have much lower [3H]ryanodine binding than in rabbit brain, suggesting that these cells lines have either lower affinity RyR or lower RyR density than brain. The undifferentiated PC12 cells, which display robust responses to RyR agonists such as caffeine(34.Barry V.A. Cheek T.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), had 5.7 times less ryanodine binding activity than brain. A7r5, HeLa cells, and LLC-PK1 epithelial cells displayed a much lower (16-26 times less than brain), but significant, binding activity. The specific [3H]ryanodine binding to Jurkat cells was negligible (not shown), which is consistent with the PCR experiments in which we were unable to detect RyR expression in Jurkat cells.Figure 3:[3H]Ryanodine binding to total microsomal fractions isolated from various cell types. Specific ryanodine binding was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values are expressed in fmol of ryanodine bound per mg of protein. Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three to five experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Attenuation of HeLa Cell Ca2+ Responses by RyanodineThe PCR and restriction digest analysis (Fig. 2 and Table 1) and [3H]ryanodine binding data (Fig. 3) suggested that HeLa cells express RyR2. We investigated the potential contribution of these channels to intracellular calcium signals using single-cell imaging. Application of caffeine (2-40 mM) to the cells did not evoke any measurable [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 4A). In addition, treatment with ryanodine (10 μM) failed to give detectable changes in [Ca2+]i when applied alone or in combination with 10 mM caffeine (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Caffeine does not elevate [Ca2+]i in HeLa cells. The trace in A shows the response of a single Fura-2-loaded HeLa cell perfused with solutions containing increasing caffeine concentrations from 2 to 40 mM (filled bars). Histamine (100 μM; hatched bar), which releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores(20.Bootman M.D. Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Bennett D.L. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24783-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was applied to show that the Ca2+ stores did contain releasable Ca2+ and to demonstrate the typical magnitude of hormonally evoked [Ca2+]i signals. The trace is typical of 40 cells. The trace in B shows the response of a single Fura-2-loaded HeLa cell perfused with solutions containing caffeine (10 mM; filled bar), ryanodine (10 μM; open bar), or caffeine (10 mM) + ryanodine (10 μM). Histamine (100 μM; hatched bar) was again added as a control. The trace is typical of 34 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The lack of caffeine effect suggested that the HeLa cells either expressed a caffeine-insensitive RyR isoform or had a low RyR density. We therefore altered the experimental protocol to maximize the potential effect of the limited number of RyRs. HeLa cells were repetitively stimulated with ATP (100 μM), which mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores in HeLa cells (35.Smit M.J. Bloemers S.M. Leurs R. Tertoolen L.G.J. Bast A. de Laat S.W. Timmerman H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), either in the absence or presence of ryanodine (10 μM) (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). The averaged [Ca2+]i values for peaks 2-7 are shown in Fig. 5, C and D. In control cells, the magnitude of the response to repeated ATP applications decayed only slightly, probably due to desensitization of the Ca2+-signaling pathway(35.Smit M.J. Bloemers S.M. Leurs R. Tertoolen L.G.J. Bast A. de Laat S.W. Timmerman H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The magnitude of ATP-evoked responses in the cells treated with ryanodine diminished significantly, so that the response decayed to about 50% after six ATP applications. The latency of the response to ATP slightly increased in the presence of ryanodine (Fig. 5E).Figure 5:Ryanodine attenuates Ca2+ responses stimulated by repetitive ATP applications. HeLa cells in control extracellular medium were stimulated repetitively with 100 μM ATP (1-min application with 3-min wash), as shown by the filled bars (A and B). In trace B, 10 μM ryanodine (Ry) was present for the time shown (open bar). The traces are representative of 39 (A) and 63 (B) cells. The graphs in C, D, and E show the averaged Ca2+ release data obtained from experiments such as those shown in A and B. In C the magnitude of the response was calculated by normalizing the area of each ATP-evoked Ca2+ response relative to the area of peak 2. In D the amplitude of each ATP-evoked Ca2+ response was calculated by normalizing the maximum [Ca2+]i increase during each response relative to the height of peak 2. The graph in E shows the latency of the response to ATP (time from ATP application to peak) in the presence and absence of ryanodine. The data points are mean ± S.E. of 39 (▪) and 63 (•) cells, respectively. ∗, statistically different with p < 0.002.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe aim of the present study was to investigate the possible expression and function of RyRs in nonexcitable cells. To confirm that our PCR technique could detect RyR expression, we also analyzed several tissues known to have functional RyRs. Consistent with other studies (7.Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S.

https://openalex.org/W1989687646,"We have previously reported that degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the isoprenoid pathway leading to cholesterol production, can be accelerated in cultured cells by the addition of farnesyl compounds, which are thought to mimic a natural, nonsterol mevalonate metabolite(s). In this paper we report accelerated reductase degradation by the addition of farnesol, a natural product of mevalonate metabolism, to intact cells. We demonstrate that this regulation is physiologically meaningful, shown by its blockage by several inhibitory conditions that are known to block the degradation induced by mevalonate addition. We further show that intracellular farnesol levels increase significantly after mevalonate addition. Based on these results, we conclude that farnesol is a nonsterol, mevalonate-derived product that plays a role in accelerated reductase degradation. Our conclusion is in agreement with a previous report (Correll, C. C., Ng, L., and Edwards, P. A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17390-17393), in which an in vitro system was used to study the effect of farnesol on reductase degradation. However, the apparent stimulation of degradation in vitro appears to be due to nonphysiological processes. Our findings demonstrate that in vitro, farnesol causes reductase to become detergent insoluble and thus lost from immunoprecipitation experiments, yielding apparent degradation. We further show that another resident endoplasmic reticulum protein, calnexin, similarly gives the appearance of protein degradation after farnesol addition in vitro. However, after the addition of farnesol to cells in vivo, calnexin remains stable, whereas reductase is degraded, providing further evidence that the in vivo effects of farnesol are physiologically meaningful and specific for reductase, whereas the in vitro effects are not.

The isoprenoid metabolic pathway, which leads to the production of cholesterol among other essential cellular products, is tightly regulated at the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) ( 1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme ACHOChinese hamster ovarySSDsqualene synthase-deficientHMGalfusion protein between the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase and β-galactosidaseMEMminimum essential mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyALLNN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal.) to mevalonate, catalyzed by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, a 97-kDa glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane(1.Liscum L.

We have studied the regulation of the degradation rate of reductase. Although production of sterols has a role in triggering accelerated reductase degradation, it has become clear that an unidentified nonsterol product is necessary for this acceleration to occur. This has been shown by treating cells with a potent competitive inhibitor of reductase, compactin, or by using a cell line, UT2, that lacks HMG-CoA reductase. Under these conditions exogenous cholesterol does not trigger accelerated degradation of reductase, unless the metabolic block is bypassed with exogenous mevalonate(14.Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reciprocal relationship also appears to exist that the nonsterol component requires the presence of the sterol regulatory component to cause accelerated degradation. This has been demonstrated using inhibitors of enzymes in the squalene branch of the isoprenoid pathway(16.Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in our current study using a cell line deficient in squalene synthase. In both of these instances endogenous production of sterols, but not nonsterol products, was effectively blocked, and in both instances accelerated reductase degradation did not occur. The identity of the nonsterol mevalonate-derived regulatory component, however, has remained unknown. Recently Bradfute and Simoni (17.Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (18.Parker R.A. Pearce B.C. Clark R.W. Gordon D.A. Wright J.J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11230-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that reductase degradation can be accelerated in intact cultured cells by the addition of farnesyl derivatives, which appear to act by mimicking the elusive mevalonate-derived metabolite. Here we report acceleration of reductase turnover in intact cells by the addition of farnesol. We demonstrate that this regulation is physiologically meaningful by showing that the effect of farnesol is sensitive to inhibitory agents and a mutational condition that are known to stunt the regulatory effect of exogenously added mevalonate. Furthermore we report that intracellular levels of farnesol increase after mevalonate addition, a treatment known to accelerate reductase degradation, and decrease after compactin addition, a treatment that blocks mevalonate production and is known to increase reductase stability. The possible role of farnesol in regulation of reductase degradation has been recently suggested (19.Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on findings in an in vitro system. However, several findings of ours suggest that reductase protein loss in this system is largely due to nonphysiological causes. We show that a significant fraction of reductase protein becomes detergent-insoluble during incubation with farnesol in vitro, causing a depletion of immunoprecipitable reductase and thus the appearance of degradation. Also, our studies of another endoplasmic reticulum resident protein, calnexin, reveal that this protein likewise appears to be rapidly lost in permeabilized cells in response to farnesol but actually is largely rendered detergent-insoluble. Neither of these apparently nonphysiological effects occur in intact cells treated with farnesol. Based on our findings, we conclude that farnesol is a likely physiological, nonsterol regulatory molecule with a critical role in accelerated reductase degradation.

ALLN and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained as monolayers in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Squalene synthase-deficient CHO (SSD) cells were maintained in the same medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Unless otherwise indicated, medium was replaced 24 h before experiments with MEM containing 5% lipid poor serum, prepared by the method of Rothblat et al.(20.Rothblat G.H. Arbogast L.V. Ouellette L. Howard B.V. In Vitro (Rockville). 1976; 12: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), supplemented with 10 μM compactin and 100 μM mevalonate. Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were washed with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and starved for 1 h in 1 ml of methionine-free MEM/lipid-poor serum followed by a 30-min labeling period in 0.3 ml of starvation medium containing 333 μCi/mmol Tran[35S]label. This medium was removed, and chase medium (MEM/lipid-poor serum containing 2 mM cold methionine) was applied to cells. At various times during the chase period, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the dish in 0.7 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 2 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were removed, and aliquots were taken for total labeled protein quantitation (see below). Supernatants were incubated overnight with 2 μl of anti-reductase antibody, which was prepared against synthetic peptides corresponding to the membrane domain of reductase(21.Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Next 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to adsorb immunoprecipitated protein, and then samples were centrifuged 2 min at 16,000 × g, and pellets were rinsed with solubilization buffer followed by 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Pellets were dissolved in loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 8 M urea, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 15% SDS, 20% glycerol, 25 mg/ml dithiothreitol), incubated 30 min at 37°C, and subjected to 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for 16 h. The gel was fixed in a 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution, impregnated with Enlightning, dried under vacuum, and either exposed to x-ray film at −80°C for quantitation by an LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer or quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager with Molecular Analyst software. For studies of calnexin degradation, the above procedure was followed except for the following changes. After the pulse and chase periods, cells were solubilized in 1.0 ml of HBS buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl) supplemented with 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged 30 min at 16,000 × g, and then supernatants were removed and diluted 10-fold with HBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose and then incubated overnight with 10 μl of anti-calnexin antibody at 4°C. Adsorbance of immunoprecipitated protein was done as in the above procedure, except that washes were done with HBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. From each sample in the pulse-chase procedure, 20 μl was spotted onto a 1-in2 piece of Whatman 3MM paper. These were dried thoroughly and then dropped into boiling 5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min followed by immersion in cold trichloroacetic acid and then cold 95% ethanol. Papers were again dried thoroughly, immersed in Cytoscint scintillation fluid, and counted for radioactivity using a Beckman LS 7500. Cell permeabilization was described by Meigs and Simoni (13.Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13547-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Correll et al.(19.Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the following procedure. Briefly, following metabolic labeling of cell proteins, cells were digitonin-permeabilized in suspension and incubated at 37°C with or without farnesol and with an NADPH-generating system. After various times of incubation, samples were diluted with solubilization buffer (see above), and immunoprecipitation and PAGE were performed as described above. Proteins were separated by 5-15% gradient PAGE for 16 h and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Hoefer TE Series blot transfer unit for 4 h at 300 mA. The membrane was stained with the appropriate primary antibody (anti-reductase or anti-calnexin), washed, and then stained with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. After additional washes, chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad) was added, and membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 5-30 min. Bands were quantified by densitometry. For each experimental condition we used ten 150-mm plates of cells grown to near confluency. Cells were washed with PBS, harvested with trypsin, and resuspended in fresh MEM/lipid-poor serum. Cell suspensions were placed in 40-ml Pyrex glass centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and then pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS. A small aliquot was removed for cell number estimation using a Coulter counter and a hemacytometer and also for protein determination by the method of Lowry et al.(22.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.2 μCi of [3H]farnesol was added as an internal standard to determine recovery, and 1/100 of volume was immediately removed for scintillation counting. Next 300 μl of 10 N sodium hydroxide was added, samples were frozen overnight and then thawed, and 15 ml of a 4:1 mixture of ethanol:hexanes was added and mixed well. Samples were then heated to 80°C for 1 h to saponify lipids. Samples were evaporated to 3-4 ml under N2, and then 10 ml water and 10 ml diethyl ether were added and mixed vigorously. After phases separated the ether was removed to another tube. This extraction was repeated twice more, and then 1 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the pooled ether to remove any traces of aqueous solution. Ether was filtered through cotton and then evaporated under N2 to roughly 0.5 ml. Methanol was added to 10 ml and then evaporated to less than 400 μl under N2. Methanol was added to bring volume to 400 μl, and 1/100 of volume was removed for scintillation counting (Beckman LS-7500) to determine recovery. Samples were stored at −20°C under N2. [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate, either subjected to the above saponification procedure or not, as well as [3H]farnesol were spotted onto a 250 μM Silica Gel G plate, and chromatography was performed using a 4:1 mixture of hexanes:ethyl acetate. The plate was dried, and 1-cm increments were scraped into scintillation vials and counted for radioactivity. Extractions from the above saponification procedure and farnesol standards were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a Hewlett Packard Aminoquant 1090 Series II, complete with a diode array detector for UV light absorbance analysis and outfitted with an Altex Ultrasphere C18 column (particle size, 5 μm; internal diameter, 4.6 × 250 mm). Acetonitrile was used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. For each run, 25 μl of sample was injected, and column output was detected by UV absorbance at 194 nm. Peaks of absorbance were integrated and quantified using the Aminoquant data analysis software and compared with standard curves. Previous work from our laboratory revealed that added farnesyl acetate and farnesyl ethyl ether caused accelerated degradation of reductase in intact CHO cells(17.Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no similar effect was found at the concentrations of farnesol used in that study (approximately 5, 50, and 100 μM). In the current study we tested a wider range of farnesol concentrations and found that as the concentration is raised above 20 μM but kept well below the toxic level of 50 μM, added farnesol causes an acceleration of reductase turnover. As shown in Fig. 1, pulse-chase studies revealed that addition of 30 μM farnesol causes accelerated reductase degradation, with a reduction in half-life from about 9.8 to 5.2 h in six experiments. This effect is comparable with the acceleration induced by added mevalonate under the same experimental conditions (12.Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4356) Google Scholar) and suggests that farnesol, as a natural isoprenoid pathway product, could be a mevalonate-derived, nonsterol regulatory molecule involved in accelerated degradation of reductase. Additionally, we found that 30 μM farnesol causes a decrease in the rate of reductase synthesis (data not shown). This also has been demonstrated to occur due to the addition of mevalonate (14.Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the addition of farnesyl acetate (17.Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in vivo. To begin to test the hypothesis of farnesol as the nonsterol mevalonate-derived regulator involved in reductase degradation, we utilized inhibitors that are known to blunt the accelerated degradation caused by added mevalonate. If farnesol is a mevalonate-derived regulatory molecule, one would expect that the effect of farnesol would exhibit sensitivity to these agents as well. For these experiments we tested ALLN, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases and the proteasome, and thapsigargin, a Ca2+ perturbant that inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase transmembrane pump. Both of these agents have been shown to inhibit the effect of mevalonate on reductase degradation(24.Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Roitelman J. Bar-Nun S. Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16085-16091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the regulatory effect of farnesol is inhibited by ALLN and by thapsigargin, both used at concentrations known to inhibit mevalonate-induced degradation. Our laboratory previously characterized a mutant CHO cell line lacking the enzyme squalene synthase(26.Bradfute D.L. Silva C.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18308-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyzes the condensation of two farnesyl pyrophosphate molecules to form squalene, which is the first step of the sterologenic branch of the mevalonate pathway. Consistent with this previous study, we found that these SSD cells failed to exhibit accelerated degradation of reductase after mevalonate addition (Fig. 3). This cell line thus provided another useful criterion for testing the physiological relevance of the effect of farnesol. As also shown in Fig. 3, the accelerated degradation of farnesol was likewise inhibited in SSD cells as compared with wild type cells. The sensitivity of both mevalonate and farnesol regulation to this mutation lends further credence to the hypothesis that farnesol is a mevalonate-derived nonsterol regulator. The primary reason for using SSD cells in this study was as a criterion to determine whether farnesol shows the characteristics expected of a putative mevalonate-derived regulator (see Fig. 3). However, some of our findings in SSD cells had interesting and important implications regarding the issue of a synergistic requirement between the nonsterol and sterol regulators involved in accelerated reductase degradation. Although it is generally well accepted that the sterol component cannot cause accelerated degradation without the nonsterol component(14.Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), previous reports have disagreed whether the nonsterol component reciprocally requires the sterol component. Our group (15.Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (8.Straka M.S. Panini S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 235-243Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have reported that the sterol product is not required, citing that inhibitors within the sterol branch of the isoprenoid pathway do not prevent a mevalonate-induced response. On the contrary, Correll and Edwards (16.Correll C.C. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have found that inhibitors in the sterol branch do block the effect of mevalonate, suggesting that the sterol component is required. Since the characterization of the SSD mutation(26.Bradfute D.L. Silva C.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18308-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been clear that added mevalonate has a stunted regulatory effect in these cells. In agreement with Bradfute et al.(26.Bradfute D.L. Silva C.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18308-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that exogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol triggers accelerated reductase degradation in SSD cells to the same degree as in wild type cells (data not shown). This is not surprising, given that all isoprenoid metabolites prior to squalene synthase, including the putative nonsterol regulator, would be expected to accumulate in SSD cells and provide the added sterol component with its necessary nonsterol complement. However, we wished to determine whether exogenous farnesol could amplify the accelerated degradation caused by exogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol in SSD cells. We therefore tested a range of concentrations of this regulatory sterol and found that its effect begins to lose potency below 0.1 μM. But interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4, farnesol acts synergistically with 25-hydroxycholesterol to cause a greater acceleration of reductase degradation, which became clear at sterol concentrations of 0.1 μM or less. Based on these results, we conclude that the nonsterol regulatory product does require sterols in order to cause regulated degradation of reductase. Furthermore, this cooperativity of added farnesol and added sterols in inducing accelerated reductase degradation further supports the hypothesis of farnesol as a nonsterol regulatory molecule. Although our findings indicate that farnesol satisfies a variety of criteria one would expect of a putative mevalonate-derived nonsterol regulator, we felt it important to determine whether intracellular levels of farnesol increased after mevalonate addition as would be required. For this purpose we utilized HPLC to analyze the farnesol levels in cells treated with 20 mM mevalonate. As shown in Fig. 5, farnesol levels in both CHO and SSD cells increased by approximately 4.5-fold after 3 h of mevalonate treatment. In a separate experiment, a 3-h treatment with 50 μM compactin caused farnesol levels in CHO cells to drop 43% (data not shown). To ensure that the detected levels of farnesol were not partially due to hydrolysis of endogenous farnesyl pyrophosphate during the saponification procedure, we repeated the experiments with radiolabeled farnesyl pyrophosphate added to the cell suspension before saponification of lipids. Thin layer chromatography revealed that just after saponification, all radioactivity comigrated with farnesyl pyrophosphate and not farnesol, and after subsequent ether extraction essentially no radioactivity was present in the extract (data not shown). Although these findings demonstrate that intracellular levels of farnesol increase after the addition of exogenous mevalonate and decrease after blockage of mevalonate production, they admittedly reveal only a correlation between farnesol levels and reductase degradation rate not a cause and effect relationship. However, we feel they are an important contribution to the accumulating body of evidence suggesting that farnesol is a regulator of reductase degradation. Of further interest is a comparison between intracellular farnesol levels in SSD cells and wild type cells. The initial studies of SSD cells (26.Bradfute D.L. Silva C.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18308-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that these cells secrete a considerable amount of farnesol into the culture medium. Consistent with this observation, we found intracellular farnesol levels to be approximately twice as high in SSD cells compared with wild type cells, with or without mevalonate addition (Fig. 5). We found farnesol to cause an extremely rapid loss of reductase in vitro (data not shown), as was reported by Correll et al.(19.Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this abrupt farnesol-induced loss of reductase protein (t1/2, approximately 1.5 h) was anomalously rapid when compared with farnesol-induced degradation in vivo (1/2, approximately 5 h, see Fig. 1), and therefore led us to question the physiological significance of this result. The finding that Triton X-100, a nonionic detergent, also caused very rapid disappearance of reductase in vitro (data not shown) further suggested that the effect caused by farnesol in this permeabilized cell system might not be physiological. To further examine this matter, we tested another protein as an internal standard to determine whether the effect caused by farnesol in vitro is specific for the loss of reductase. Calnexin, a chaperone protein implicated in protein folding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, is a good control based on the fact that, like reductase, it is an integral membrane-spanning resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum(31.David V. Hochstenbach F. Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9585-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of farnesol on the loss of calnexin was measured both in permeabilized cells and in intact cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, the addition of farnesol to permeabilized cells results in very rapid loss of calnexin protein in a dose-dependent manner. However, following farnesol addition to intact cells, calnexin remains stable, whereas the degradation of reductase is accelerated (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that in vitro, the loss of reductase caused by farnesol is nonspecific and nonphysiological, whereas in vivo the effect is specific for reductase and physiologically meaningful. We also utilized a CHO cell line stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the protein HMGal. HMGal is a chimera comprised of the transmembrane regulatory domain of reductase fused to Escherichia coli β-galactosidase, and it has been shown to exhibit regulated turnover in the same manner as endogenous reductase(12.Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 7A, farnesol caused a rapid loss of HMGal protein in vitro. Surprisingly, however, farnesol did not cause a corresponding loss of β-galactosidase activity in the permeabilized cells, as shown in Fig. 7B. In an attempt to resolve these paradoxical findings, we noted that in the β-galactosidase activity determinations the total cell lysate was assayed, whereas in the pulse-chase procedure the lysates were centrifuged at a low speed to remove unlysed cells, nuclei, and detergent-insoluble material prior to immunoprecipitation of reductase. Therefore, following this centrifugation step we assayed the resulting pellet and the supernatant for HMGal activity and found that a significant amount of HMGal activity was detectable in the pellet (Fig. 7C). The amount of activity in the pellet was found to increase with time and with increasing concentrations of farnesol (data not shown). An immunoblot analysis of the two fractions verified that farnesol caused a significant fraction of reductase protein to appear in the pellet and further revealed that a significant fraction of calnexin protein was rendered insoluble by farnesol (Fig. 8). By comparison, we tested lysates from cells treated with farnesol in vivo, and in these virtually all of the HMGal activity was detected in the supernatant and none was detected in the pellet (data not shown), demonstrating that the in vivo effect of farnesol is distinct from the apparently nonphysiological effect responsible for the in vitro results. Studies aimed toward determining the identity of the regulatory nonsterol, mevalonate-derived metabolite involved in HMG-CoA reductase degradation have been subject to certain limitations when performed in living cells. This is because many of these candidate pathway metabolites, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate, geranyl pyrophosphate, and farnesyl pyrophosphate, are polar molecules and are thus not permeant to cells. This has led to the employment of other strategies, one of which has involved the use of nonpolar artificial isoprenoid analogues, which were added to intact cells to determine whether reductase degradation could be accelerated, presumably by these artificial products mimicking some natural product. This approach showed some success, as farnesylated tocopherol analogs (18.Parker R.A. Pearce B.C. Clark R.W. Gordon D.A. Wright J.J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11230-11238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and farnesyl acetate and farnesyl ethyl ether (17.Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were shown to accelerate reductase degradation in vivo. These results suggested that some farnesyl metabolite(s) in the isoprenoid pathway is the regulatory molecule. Another strategy has involved the use of permeabilized cells, which do not present a permeability barrier. We showed previously (13.Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13547-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that mevalonate-induced accelerated reductase degradation persisted in cells after permeabilization with digitonin, but only if cells were pretreated with mevalonate before permeabilization. Presumably this period was necessary for production/accumulation of adequate levels of the mevalonate-derived regulator(s) so that regulated degradation could be underway at the time of permeabilization. Using a modification of our permeabilized cell system, Correll et al.(19.Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate apparent accelerated degradation of reductase by addition of farnesol, without the pretreatment period required for mevalonate. Farnesol is produced from farnesyl pyrophosphate in cells, in a reaction catalyzed by an allyl pyrophosphatase(28.Christophe J. Popjak G. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 2: 244-257Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 29.Tsai S.-C. Gaylor J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4043-4050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Bansal V.S. Vaidya S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which diverts some farnesyl pyrophosphate from its primary metabolic route toward cholesterol. We had not tested farnesol in our permeabilized cell system(13.Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13547-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the studies of farnesyl acetate in vivo(17.Bradfute D.L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6645-6650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), farnesol had been tested but at a very limited set of concentrations, which in hindsight were either too low to elicit a regulatory response or so high that toxicity resulted. In the current study we have more rigorously tested farnesol in vivo, using concentrations low enough to be nontoxic to cells but higher than those previously found to be ineffectual and have found that farnesol indeed causes accelerated degradation of reductase. This is an important finding, because it is the first evidence of a natural nonsterol mevalonate-derived metabolite causing this effect when added to cells in vivo. Also of importance are our findings that this effect of exogenous farnesol in accelerating reductase degradation can be blocked by ALLN, by thapsigargin, and in a CHO cell line missing the enzyme squalene synthase (see Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Accelerated degradation by exogenous mevalonate has been shown to be sensitive to all three of these conditions, so our hypothesis regarding the role of farnesol is supported by these findings. Although the in vitro results of Correll et al.(19.Correll C.C. Ng L. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17390-17393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were controlled for degradation of total cell protein in their study, for the following reasons we feel that their reported loss of reductase in vitro is not due to physiologically meaningful causes. One, the farnesol-induced degradation of reductase in permeabilized cells is extremely rapid, considerably more so than observed in mevalonate-pretreated permeabilized cells (13.Meigs T.E. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13547-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or even intact cells treated with mevalonate or farnesol. Two, in order to achieve significant acceleration of reductase loss in vitro, farnesol must be used at concentrations of 50 μM and higher, which are levels we have found to be highly toxic when added to intact cells. Three, our studies show that farnesol causes a second resident endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, calnexin, to be rapidly lost in permeabilized cells. This loss of calnexin is not observed in farnesol-treated intact cells. Four, our studies show that farnesol, when added to permeabilized cells, causes a significant fraction of reductase (and calnexin) to become detergent insoluble, and therefore not recoverable in the usual immunoprecipitation from cell lysates. Although the amount of reductase and calnexin protein that is rendered detergent insoluble by farnesol is significant, it does not account for the total amount of each protein that is lost (compare Fig. 8 with Fig. 7A and Fig. 6A). We suggest that a certain degree of nonspecific proteolysis occurs in vitro, perhaps brought about by farnesol disrupting the endoplasmic reticulum. We believe that our findings, which demonstrate physiologically meaningful reductase degradation in vivo by a natural mevalonate product, serve as an important extension of previous in vivo studies utilizing farnesyl analogs and show that farnesol is a nonsterol mevalonate product with a key role in the regulated degradation of reductase. We are grateful to Dr. Christopher Silva for his assistance with HPLC and thin layer chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W2035024455,"The maltose-binding protein (MalE) of Escherichia coli is the periplasmic component of the transport system for malto-oligosaccharides. We have examined the characteristics of a Mal- mutant of malE corresponding to the double substitution Gly32→ Asp/Ile33→ Pro, MalE31, previously obtained by random mutagenesis. In vivo, the MalE31 precursor is efficiently processed, but the mature protein forms inclusion bodies in the periplasm. Furthermore, the accumulation of insoluble MalE31 is independent of its cellular localization; MalE31 lacking its signal sequence forms inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. The native MalE31 protein can be purified by affinity chromatography from inclusion bodies after denaturation by 8 M urea. The renatured protein exhibits full maltose binding affinity (Kd= 9 × 10-7M), suggesting that its folded structure is similar to that of the wild-type protein. Unfolding/refolding experiments show that MalE31 is less stable (−5.5 kcal/mol) than the wild-type protein (−9.5 kcal/mol) and that folding intermediates have a high tendency to form aggregates. In conclusion, the observed phenotype of cells expressing malE31 can be explained by a defective folding pathway of the protein.

In conclusion, the observed phenotype of cells expressing malE31 can be explained by a defective folding pathway of the protein. In Escherichia coli, the export of proteins to the periplasm follows the general secretion pathway ((1.Pugsley A.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Google Scholar)). Considerable genetic and biochemical information about the export machinery has accumulated(2.Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Google Scholar), but little is known about the conformational state of the polypeptide chain, either during its translocation through the membrane or upon its release into the periplasm. Maltose-binding protein (MalE or MBP), the malE gene product, serves as the periplasmic receptor for the high affinity transport of maltose and maltodextrins (reviewed in (3.Shuman H.A. Panagiotidis C.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 613-620Google Scholar)). Because of its key role in maltose transport, correct export of MalE into the periplasm is essential for cells to utilize maltose as a carbon source. This feature facilitated the use of genetic selections for analyzing MalE export. Furthermore, the isolation of strains synthesizing MalE-LacZ hybrid proteins led to a novel genetic approach that identified several genes encoding the secretory machinery, the sec genes(4.Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Google Scholar). As a protein model of translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, MalE has also been extensively studied in the laboratories of the late P. Bassford and of L. Randall(5.Bassford P.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 401-439Google Scholar, 6.Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Thom J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 507-541Google Scholar). The MalE protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor protein, pre-MalE, with an amino-terminal extension, the signal sequence. As the precursor enters the periplasm, the signal sequence is cleaved by signal peptidase. Translocation requires that the precursor exist in an export-competent conformation representing a partially unfolded state (7.Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Google Scholar). Both the signal peptide (8.Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Google Scholar) and the binding of SecB, the molecular chaperone involved in protein export(1.Pugsley A.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Google Scholar), participate in the maintenance of this initial conformation. Although Randall and Hardy (7.Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Google Scholar) showed that MalE folding and export are kinetically competing processes, we do not know the extent of secondary and tertiary structures of precursor proteins. Another important unsolved problem concerns the releasing and folding steps of the polypeptide chain in the periplasm. Do specific proteins or molecular chaperones catalyze or facilitate this step in the periplasm? Two integral membrane proteins, SecD and SecF, are required for efficient protein translocation(9.Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 554-561Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of spheroplasts with anti-SecD antibodies decreased the processing of pre-MalE and increased the protease susceptibility of the mature species(10.Matsuyama S.I Fujita Y. Mizuchima S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 265-270Google Scholar). These results would be consistent with a molecular chaperone function of SecD on the periplasmic face of the inner membrane(11.Wülfing C. Plückthun A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 685-692Google Scholar). Protein aggregates are formed in vivo as a result of: (i) mutations that affect the folding pathway; (ii) expression of heterologous proteins; (iii) exposure of the cell to certain environmental stresses. It is generally accepted that aggregation and folding are competing processes and that aggregation is favored at elevated protein concentrations. A model suggesting that a folding intermediate is responsible for inclusion body formation has been proposed by Mitraki and King(12.Mitraki A. King J. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 690-697Google Scholar). Such a kinetic competition between the folding pathway and an aggregation reaction has previously been recognized as a major determinant for apparent irreversibility in refolding studies in vitro(13.Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Google Scholar). Since aggregation is a second (or higher) order process, it can be much faster than first-order folding and therefore, at high protein concentrations, aggregation dominates over folding and leads to the formation of insoluble protein(14.Kiefhaber T. Rudolph R. Kohlor H.H. Buchner J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 825-829Google Scholar). The observation that temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutations in the tailspike protein of phage P22 increased the fraction of newly synthesized tailspike chains forming aggregates demonstrated the importance of folding intermediates in the mechanism of inclusion body formation(15.Haase-Pettingell C.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4977-4983Google Scholar). The tsf mutations prevent formation of the native protein at the restrictive temperature, but once folded at a lower permissive temperature, the mutant tailspike proteins have stabilities similar to that of the native protein. Intragenic suppressors of these mutations inhibit aggregation of folding intermediates and increase the folding efficiency of tsf mutants(16.Mitraki A. Fane B. Haase-Petingell C. Sturtevant J. King J. Science. 1991; 253: 54-58Google Scholar). Mutations influencing inclusion body formation were also identified for human interleukin-1β, expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli(17.Chrunyk B.A. Evans J. Lillquist J. Young P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18053-18061Google Scholar). The mutated residues were mainly located either in a β strand or in a flexible loop. However, there was no strong correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the mutant interleukin-1β proteins and their tendency to form inclusion bodies. Another example of studies of inclusion body formation in E. coli is provided by the enzyme β-lactamase(18.Georgiou G. Valax P. Ostermeier M. Horowitz P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1953-1960Google Scholar). In the case of such an exported protein, the formation of inclusion bodies depends on the protein synthesis rate and the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide(19.Bowden G.A. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16760-16766Google Scholar). High level of expression of β-lactamase resulted in the accumulation of precursor chains: aggregation occurred both in the cytoplasm from the precursor and in the periplasm from the mature β-lactamase. Despite the widespread reports of inclusion body formation resulting from very high level production of recombinant proteins in E. coli, there is little information on the molecular basis governing this process. In this study, we characterized a Mal- mutant of the maltose binding protein (MalE31), previously isolated by random linker insertion into the malE gene(20.Duplay P. Szmelcman S. Bedouelle H. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 669-673Google Scholar). Our in vivo analysis revealed that the mutant MalE31 polypeptide chain forms inclusion bodies after translocation and signal peptide processing. We further report the in vitro analysis of the stability and aggregation of this mutant protein compared with the wild-type protein. These data confirmed that the observed phenotype of cells expressing malE31 can be explained by a defective folding pathway of the protein. E. coli K12 strain pop6499, which is a derivative of MC4100 (F-araD139 thiA relA ΔlacU169 Δ(srlR-recA)306::Tn10 rpsL malTc1 ΔmalE444) was used as the host strain for plasmids encoding MalE proteins. This strain carries a nonpolar deletion of the chromosomal malE gene (21.Duplay P. Bedouelle H. Fowler A. Zabin I. Saurin W. Hofnung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10606-10613Google Scholar) and harbors the malTc1 allele which confers constitutive expression on the maltose operons(20.Duplay P. Szmelcman S. Bedouelle H. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 669-673Google Scholar). Therefore maltose was not added to the growth medium. The expression of a plon::lacZ fusion was monitored in strain SR1364, which is a derivative of MC4100. ( 1S. Raina, unpublished results.) Plasmids pPD1 and pPD364 carrying the wild-type malE gene (21.Duplay P. Bedouelle H. Fowler A. Zabin I. Saurin W. Hofnung M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1987; 194: 669-673Google Scholar), both under the control of the mal promoter, were designated here as pHCME and pHCME31, respectively. Plasmid pΔ709, which carries a deletion of the ribosome binding site and the first 256 codons of the malE gene(22.Betton J.M. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1226-1234Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. The EcoRI-BstE1107I fragment carrying the malE31 gene was isolated from plasmid pHCME31 and inserted into the EcoRI-HincII sites of M13mp18 RF DNA (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit of Bio-Rad by using the malE31 gene as a single-stranded DNA template. The following oligonucleotides were used to direct the mutagenesis: DG (Asp32→ Gly32), 5′-CTTTCGGTCCCGTATCT-3′; PI (Pro33→ Ile33), 5′-GGTGACTTTGATATCCGTATC-3′; Δ2-26 (deletion 2-26), 5′-TACCTTCTTCGATTTTCATAATC TATGG-3′. The mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The EcoRI-BglII fragments were isolated from mutant M13mp18 RF DNAs and subcloned into plasmid pHCME to construct pHCME-G32D, pHCME-I33P, and pHCME31Δ2-26. Cultures were grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 30°C. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and fractionated by spheroplast preparation. The cell pellets, normalized to the same absorbance reading at 600 nm (5 × 108 cells/ml), were suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.7 M sucrose and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and EDTA (10 mM) were added, and the suspensions were incubated for 20 min at 4°C. Then, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and the supernatants (periplasmic fraction) were removed. The pellets were resuspended, washed, freeze-thawed twice, then centrifuged as described above. Supernatants were kept (cytoplasmic fraction) and the pellets resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer and washed (membrane fraction). The three fractions were mixed with an equal volume of 2% SDS sample buffer (0.1 ml) and heated to 100°C for 3 min before being analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). ( 2The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGdnHClguanidine hydrochloride.) The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned with a MasterScan I interpretive densitometer (Scanalytics). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanidine hydrochloride. Cells were grown at 30°C in M63B1 medium supplemented with 40 mg/ml amino acids minus methionine, containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.4% glycerol. During the mid-exponential phase of growth, cells were labeled with 60 mCi of [35S]methionine/ml for 15 s, then chased with 4 mg/ml nonradioactive methionine for 10, 30, and 60 s. In experiments in which export was blocked, sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, 5 min before labeling. All the samples were precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. MalE-wt and MalE31 were immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-MalE serum as described previously by Ito et al.(24.Ito K. Bassford P.J. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 24: 707-717Google Scholar). Immune precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells were grown in LB at 30°C as described above, harvested, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature, and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate, then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethanol and embedded in Spurr. Thin sections were examined using a Philipps CM12 transmission electron microscope. The wild-type MalE protein was purified by osmotic shock procedure as described previously(20.Duplay P. Szmelcman S. Bedouelle H. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 669-673Google Scholar). The MalE31 protein was purified from inclusion bodies. Cultures were grown to late exponential phase at 30°C in LB broth (2 liters) with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested and suspended in 50 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) (buffer A) containing 0.1 mg/ml DNase I and lysed in a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet (inclusion bodies and membranes) was suspended in 20 ml of buffer A containing 2% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, the pellet was solubilized by 8 M urea in buffer A and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Renaturation was achieved by dilution (20-fold) into buffer A at 4°C. The cloudy renatured mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a cross-linked amylose column at 4°C(25.Ferenci T. Klotz U. FEBS Lett. 1978; 94: 213-217Google Scholar). Preceding all biochemical characterizations, both purified proteins were extensively dialyzed three times against 3 liters of buffer A at 4°C. The first five amino acid residues of purified MalE31 protein were identified by using an Applied Biosystems 473 protein sequencer. The protein concentration of MalE-wt and MalE31 solutions was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of ε = 68,750 M-1. cm-1.( 3J.-M. Betton, unpublished result.) The initial rate of maltose transport was estimated by measuring uptake of [14C]maltose as described by Szmelcman and Hofnung (26.Szmelcman S. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 112-118Google Scholar) with 1.2 μM maltose (final concentration). Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were assessed by fluorescence titration using both purified proteins essentially as described by Miller et al.(27.Miller III, D.M. Olson J.S. Pflugrath J.W. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13665-13672Google Scholar). The tryptophanyl fluorescence quenching was recorded on a Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Spex) with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. 2-μl aliquots of successive 10-fold dilutions of a 1 M maltose solution were added to protein samples (2 ml at 0.5 μM), and the emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Unfolding and refolding experiments were carried out in buffer A at 25°C. The unfolding transitions of MalE-wt and MalE31 by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) at equilibrium were measured by fluorescence emission at 345 nm (excitation was 290 nm). The final concentration was 0.5 μM for both proteins. Concentrations of GdnHCl solutions were determined by refractive index measurements(28.Nosaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 26: 43-50Google Scholar). The experimental data were analyzed by using the model of linear dependence of ΔG upon denaturant concentration x(29.Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar).△GGdnHCI=△GH2O+mx(Eq. 1) In order to take into account the effect of the solvent on the fluorescence signal, the following equation was used, Yx=(Yn+Mnx)+[exp((△GH2O−mx)/RT)/(1+exp((△GH2O−mx)/RT)](Eq. 2) where Yx is the fluorescence signal in the presence of × molar GdnHCl, Yn and Yd are the signal of the native and denatured forms, respectively, at the same denaturant concentration; Mn and Md are the solvent effects on the native and denatured protein signal, respectively. Experimental data were fitted by using a simplex procedure based on the Nelder and Mead algorithm(30.Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.K. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1986Google Scholar). To study the reversibility of the unfolding process, MalE-wt and MalE31 proteins at two concentrations (1 and 10 μM) were incubated with varying concentrations of GdnHCl for 6 h. They were then diluted in the Tris-HCl buffer, incubated for 15 h at 25°C, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Finally, the amount of native protein in the supernatant was determined by using the two-antibody sandwich assay described by Martineau et al.(31.Martineau P. Guillet J.G. Leclerc C. Hofnung M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 35-46Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 56.5, which was used in this assay, bound to a conformational epitope of MalE or MalE31 protein with the same affinity (Kd = 5 × 10-10M)4. ( 4F. Trincard and J.-M. Betton, unpublished results.) We previously described a set of MalE mutant proteins generated by random insertion of an oligonucleotide linker into the malE gene(20.Duplay P. Szmelcman S. Bedouelle H. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 669-673Google Scholar). Among this collection, six mutations prevented both growth on maltose as a carbon source and the periplasmic release of the corresponding proteins by cold osmotic shock(32.Duplay P. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4445-4450Google Scholar). In all cases but one, a deletion of several amino acid residues from the mature region of the protein could explain their defective phenotypes. However, in one case, malE31, the linker insertion did not modify the length of the protein, but changed six nucleotides, resulting in Gly → Asp and Ile → Pro substitutions at position 32 and 33 of the mature sequence, respectively(20.Duplay P. Szmelcman S. Bedouelle H. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 669-673Google Scholar). To identify the particular codon in malE31 responsible for the Mal- phenotype, derivatives carrying either the single mutation at position 32 (MalE-G32D) or at position 33 (MalE-I33P) were constructed. The biological properties of the corresponding mutants are indicated in Table 1. Although bacteria carrying malE31 had altered growth properties, as indicated by their doubling time in maltose minimal medium or their phenotype on MacConkey dextrin plates (Table 1), production of MalE31 did not affect growth in rich medium (data not shown). The single substitution G32D led to a mutant with biological properties similar to those of cell expressing wild-type malE. In contrast, the Ile33→ Pro substitution affected both growth and maltose transport, but the defects were less severe than in malE31. While the level of total expression in cells producing these various proteins was similar, as assessed on SDS-PAGE, the amount of MalE31 and its derivatives in the periplasmic fraction correlated with their ability to grow on maltose minimal medium (Table 1). The cellular localization of the MalE31 protein and its derivatives was determined after spheroplast preparations (Fig. 1). The periplasmic and cytoplasmic localization of wild-type MalE expressed from pHCME or from pHCMEΔ2-26, coding for signal sequence deleted MalE protein, confirmed that the cell fractionation procedure was correct. However, the pHCME31-encoded MalE31 protein was entirely recovered in the subcellular membrane fraction. This result suggested that export of MalE31 protein was blocked somewhere in the membrane or, alternatively, that MalE31 formed inclusion bodies either in the cytoplasm from the precursor, before translocation, or in the periplasm from the mature species, after translocation. Interestingly, a large fraction of pHCME31Δ2-26-encoded MalE31 (73%) was also found in the membrane fraction. Close inspection of the gel revealed the presence of increased amounts of two proteins of about 60 and 70 kDa, in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells carrying pHCME31Δ2-26. These proteins correspond to the major heat-shock proteins GroEL and DnaK (see below). While the MalE-G32D protein was localized entirely in the periplasmic fraction (98%), most of MalE-I33P (63%) was in the membrane fraction. Although, some synergistic effect was observed with the double substitution, these data confirmed that the Ile33→ Pro substitution is mainly responsible for the defective phenotype of cells expressing malE31.Tabled 1Figure 1:Subcellular fractionation of MalE31 and derivatives. Periplasmic (A), cytoplasmic (B), and membrane fractions (C) were separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained bands scanned by densitometry. The bands corresponding to GroEL and DnaK are indicated by arrows (GroEL is the faster migrating of the two bands). D, the proportions were calculated by summing the area of MalE band in the three subcellular fractions and are shown under the corresponding lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the experiment described above, MalE31 sedimented with the membranes, irrespective of whether or not it was made as a signal peptide-bearing precursor. To determine whether these proteins were in fact periplasmic or cytoplasmic, respectively, or were indeed membrane-associated, we performed two kinds of experiments. First, the kinetics of signal sequence processing was determined using a pulse-chase analysis. Processing of the precursor, a late step in export, is a reliable indicator that the protein has, at least partially, crossed the inner membrane(1.Pugsley A.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Google Scholar). Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and then chased with nonradioactive methionine for different times. The labeled MalE proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Fig. 2 shows that the MalE31 precursor is processed very rapidly and that an export defect cannot be observed at the earliest time point (10 s). In conclusion, there were no differences in the processing kinetics observed for pre-MalE31 species compared with those of wild-type pre-MalE. Furthermore, amino-terminal microsequence analysis of purified MalE31 protein (see below) confirmed that pre-MalE31 was processed at the normal cleavage site. Second, transmission electron microscopic studies of cells harboring pHCME31 revealed the presence of electron dense material between the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria (Fig. 3A). Periplasmic inclusion bodies of MalE31 were small and frequently included more than one per cell. In contrast, cells producing the signal sequence deletion MalE31 protein (pHCME31Δ2-26) had rare inclusion bodies that were clearly localized within the cytoplasm and that had blurred boundaries (Fig. 3B). By analogy with other proteins which form inclusion bodies in E. coli(33.Schein C.H. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1991; 2: 746-750Google Scholar), the amount of insoluble MalE31 was temperature-dependent, with higher growth temperatures promoting inclusion body formation (data not shown). These results indicated: (i) that the MalE31 precursor was correctly processed and thus that the mature protein is localized in the periplasm, (ii) that the malE31 mutation causes MalE aggregation whatever its cellular localization, and (iii) that inclusion body formation in the periplasm arose from the association of processed MalE31 protein From Fig. 1 it is evident that cytoplasmic accumulation of MalE31 (pHCME31Δ2-26) increased the synthesis of two proteins which correspond to the GroEL (60 kDa) and DnaK (70 kDa) proteins. In contrast, no such elevated level of heat-shock proteins was visible with periplasmic MalE31 aggregates (pHCME31). To determine quantitatively the extent of heat-shock gene induction caused by MalE31, we used a plon-lacZ promoter fusion construct transcribed by the sigma factor σ32, the rpoH gene product (strain SR1364).1 This strain was transformed with plasmids pHCME31 and its derivatives, grown at 30°C, and β-galactosidase activities were determined according to Miller(34.Miller J.H.

The same level of β-galactosidase induction was observed in all cases, except for pHCME31Δ2-26 (Fig. 4). In this case, the synthesis of β-galactosidase directed from the lon promoter was 2-fold higher than for strains containing the other plasmids. This result confirmed that periplasmic inclusion bodies of MalE31 did not induce the σ32-dependent heat-shock response. The production of misfolded proteins that could form inclusion bodies is one of the main factors responsible for induction of heat-shock response in E. coli(35.Goff S.A. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 587-595Google Scholar, 36.Parsell D.A. Sauer R.T. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1226-1232Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we studied the in vitro folding characteristics of purified MalE31. We purified soluble MalE31 protein to homogeneity from periplasmic inclusion bodies by a simple denaturation-renaturation step and affinity chromatography (Fig. 5). The maltose binding affinity for purified wild-type and MalE31 proteins were assayed by fluorescence quenching experiments. As indicated in Table 2, the two proteins display the same maltose binding affinity (Kd = 9 × 10-7M).Tabled 1 To investigate the folding properties of MalE31, the GdnHCl-induced unfolding transitions of the wild-type and MalE31 proteins were determined using tryptophanyl fluorescence as a probe of the tertiary structure (Fig. 6). At the final protein concentration of 0.2 mM, both transitions were found to be reversible (see below) and symmetrical. The concentration of GdnHCl at the midpoint of the transition (Cm) for MalE-wt was 0.92 ± 0.02 M, whereas the midpoint occurred at 0.62 ± 0.02 M GdnHCl for MalE31 (Table 2). This reflects the lower stability of the mutant MalE31; the ΔGH2O Light scattering and apparent irreversibility were detected when the MalE31 concentration was increased in the unfolding experiments described above. To test the effects of protein concentration on renaturation, we performed a two-step dilution experiment(37.Mitraki A. Betton J.M. Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 29-34Google Scholar). Starting from the native state, MalE31 was incubated in various GdnHCl concentrations for 6 h at 25°C and then diluted into the renaturation buffer (Fig. 7). Two different protein concentrations in the first step were explored, and we used a quantitative immunoassay to monitor the recovery of native MalE31 because of its high sensitivity(31.Martineau P. Guillet J.G. Leclerc C. Hofnung M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 35-46Google Scholar). The renaturation became partially irreversible when the protein had been exposed to concentrations of GdnHCl corresponding to the end of the unfolding transition zone. However, when refolding was initiated from 3 M GdnHCl, this phenomenon was less pronounced. The extent of irreversible denaturation of MalE31 was strongly dependent on the protein concentration, while no such effect of the MalE-wt protein concentration could be detected up to 10 mM. This phenomenon was detected only upon monitoring the native protein with the immunoassay. Indeed, using the same procedure as described for Fig. 7, but with a MalE31 protein concentration of 1 μM, complete reversibility was found by fluorescence measurements (data not shown). These results revealed the occurrence of an aggregation reaction arising mainly from MalE31 equilibrium folding intermediates. It is tempting to speculate that the aggregation of MalE31 folding intermediates is correlated with the formation of inclusion bodies. In vivo and in vitro analyses of MalE31 folding revealed that the variant polypeptide chain had a high tendency to aggregate. The three-dimensional structure of MalE consists of two globular domains separated by a cleft in which maltose and maltodextrins bind(38.Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Google Scholar). Each of the two domains is constructed from secondary structural elements belonging to both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the protein, thereby forming a central β-sheet framed by α-helices. The structural location of amino acid substitution corresponding to the malE31 mutation is shown in Fig. 8. Positions 32 and 33 are located in a turn connecting helix I to strand B forming the first βαβ supersecondary structure of the amino-terminal domain. In other proteins, similar structural locations were also found for amino acid substitutions which promote aggregation(17.Chrunyk B.A. Evans J. Lillquist J. Young P. Wetzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18053-18061Google Scholar, 40.Knappik A. Plückthun A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 81-89Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with the significant role of turns and loops in the folding pathway of α/β proteins(41.Ufer R. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 31-45Google Scholar). The double substitution, Gly32→ Asp/Ile33→ Pro, destabilizes the protein by about 4 kcal/mol, probably as a result of changes to geometrical constraints at the turn region. Furthermore, despite a synergistic effect, the single Ile33→ Pro substitution was the major factor responsible for the aggregation. It is possible that a turn which includes Pro33 could introduce a conformational strain in the folded state because of the limited value of the ϕ angle(42.Schimmel P.R. Flory P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 34: 105-120Google Scholar), even though the turn is in a solvent-accessible region. Moreover, if the introduction of a proline residue in this turn destabilizes the native structure, it does not affect the affinity of maltose binding of MalE (Table 2). By studying the unfolding-refolding transition of MalE variants corresponding to intragenic suppressors of export-defective signal peptides, Randall and co-workers (43.Chun S.Y. Strobel S. Bassford Jr., P. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20855-20862Google Scholar) have suggested that the rate-limiting step in the MalE folding pathway could be the formation of a supersecondary structure localized in the amino-terminal domain. Strikingly, the altered turn which leads to in vivo and in vitro aggregation of MalE31 connects an α-helix and a β-strand belonging to the same substructure of the amino-terminal domain. Intragenic suppression of the export-defective signal peptide is accomplished by slowing the folding of the precursor, thereby increasing the time during which the protein is competent to enter the export pathway(44.Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 14790-14793Google Scholar). cis-trans isomerization of prolyl imide bonds might be expected to introduce slow steps in protein folding, thus increasing the lifetime of intermediates and promoting inclusion body formation. Preliminary results on the kinetics of refolding have shown that, like intragenic suppressors of defective peptide signal, MalE31 refolds more slowly than MalE-wt in vitro. However, this slowest refolding step could not be explained by a slow isomerization step in the unfolded state of MalE31. ( 5V. Laurent and J.-M. Betton, unpublished results.) Inclusion body formation and in vitro aggregation are similar phenomena, originating from the failure of folding intermediates to achieve final folding. The putative cellular pathway for export and folding of precursors is shown in Fig. 9. As the precursor protein elongates, it begins to acquire secondary structure. This newly synthesized precursor may face many competing pathways, including binding molecular chaperones, folding, degradation, aggregation, and export. All of these possible outcomes depend on the intrinsic folding properties of the precursor being synthesized (or its folding rate relative to the rate of other processes). In this schematic drawing, molecular chaperones play an essential role in determining the choice between folding and export, but they may also participate in proteolysis by maintaining proteins in an unfolded state accessible to proteases. MalE belongs to a subset of precursors that interact preferentially with SecB, which seems to be entirely dedicated to export(45.Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Google Scholar). However, heat-shock proteins can substitute for SecB during protein export. Indeed, overproduction of DnaK and DnaJ improved the export of wild-type pre-MalE in a secB::Tn5 mutant(46.Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Google Scholar, 47.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Although periplasmic molecular chaperones involved in general protein folding have not yet been identified, we assume that such molecules could exist in this compartment. Another class of periplasmic proteins is enzymes that can either directly catalyze disulfide bond formation or maintain an appropriate oxidized environment in the periplasm. The lack of Cys residues in MalE eliminates the possible complication of intra- and/or extramolecular disulfide bond formation. Our results suggest that the step at which productive folding of MalE31 is blocked is likely to be a folding intermediate localized in the periplasm. These data do not fit the model of alternative pathways open to protein precursors within the cell, as defined by Randall and Hardy (48.Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Google Scholar). Indeed, they proposed that the kinetic partitioning between folding and aggregation depends strongly on binding to SecB in the cytoplasm. Although direct experiments on the interactions between SecB and MalE31 have not been performed, we have independently confirmed by several approaches that the MalE31 precursor did not accumulate in the cytoplasm. This behavior would indicate that the altered turn of the MalE31 precursor affects neither its export-competent conformation nor its ability to bind SecB. Structurally, a nascent precursor in an export-competent conformation may be similar to misfolded proteins. Indeed, Wild et al.(49.Wild J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Altman E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3992-3997Google Scholar) showed that accumulation of secretory protein precursors in strains lacking the SecB chaperone generates a signal for induction of heat-shock proteins. Obviously, the absence of increased σ32 activity in bacteria producing pre-MalE31 eliminates this possibility. However, the formation of periplasmic inclusion bodies of MalE31 specifically triggers the σ24-dependent stress. ( 6J.-M. Betton and D. Missiakas, unpublished results.) This alternative heat-shock sigma factor is involved in response to stress occurring in extracytoplasmic compartments(50.Mescas J. Rouviere P. Erickson J.W. Donohue T.J. Gross C.A. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2618-2628Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the soluble fraction of MalE31 that is periplasmic (2%) is less than the soluble fraction of MalE31 that is cytoplasmic (27%). This observation suggests that in the latter case, the increased level of GroEL and DnaK, that results from induction of the heat-shock response by MalE31, can partially suppress the cytoplasmic aggregation of MalE31. It appears that under these experimental conditions, there are insufficient molecular chaperones in the periplasm to prevent or reduce aggregation of MalE31 Finally, this work on the aggregation of MalE31 opens the way to the selection of mutants affected in protein folding and/or aggregation in the E. coli periplasm. Indeed, malE31 carried by plasmid pHCME31 was not able to complement the deletion ΔmalE444 of strain pop6499. If general molecular chaperones exist in the periplasm of E. coli, they might modulate the aggregation reaction from the defective folding intermediate of MalE31 as they do in the cytoplasm. Thus, mutations that improve protein folding in the periplasm could be selected by their ability to promote growth on maltose. We are greatly indebted to S. Raina for strain SR1364, F.

INTRODUCTIONProtein kinase C (PKC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)MARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate.) is a family of phospholipid-dependent kinases involved in basic cellular functions, including regulation of growth, differentiation, and gene expression(1.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 2.Pears, C., Goode, N., Parker, P. J. (1992) Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signaling, pp. 231–241Google Scholar). The role of individual PKCs in these processes is not yet known; however, since most cells express more than one type of PKC, it seems likely that individual PKCs have unique rather than overlapping functions. All of the PKCs require phosphatidylserine for maximal activity; however, PKCs can be grouped according to differences in their dependence on other activators. In addition to phosphatidylserine, conventional PKCs require calcium and diacylglycerol, novel PKCs require only diacylglycerol, and atypical PKCs require nothing more. Several other lipid modifiers of PKC activity have also been identified, and there is some evidence that they may selectively influence individual isozyme activities(1.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). Selective isozyme activation in response to physiological agonists has been noted and may be a result of the recognized differences in cofactor requirements among the PKCs(3.Khan W.A. Blobe G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In addition to isozyme selective activation, isozyme-specific functions may depend on selective substrate recognition. However, only minor differences in substrate specificity among the isozymes have been observed in in vitro assays(7.Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Burns, D. J., Basta, P. V., Holmes, W. D., Ballas, L. M., Rankl, N. B., Barbee, J. L., Bell, R. M., Loomis, C. R. (1992) Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signaling, pp. 207–217Google Scholar). Recently, immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated unique subcellular localizations for individual PKCs (9.Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10.Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, targeting of individual PKCs to specific subcellular addresses may be a means of restricting accessibility to substrates and, thereby, provide the mechanism for isozyme-selective phosphorylation events in vivo. To isolate proteins that interact with PKCs with high affinity, we developed an assay for identifying PKC-binding proteins (12.Hyatt S.L. Klauck T. Jaken S. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14.Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this assay was adapted to screen expression libraries and isolate cDNA clones for PKC-binding proteins(15.Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding proteins isolated according to this strategy are also substrates(16.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). In this manuscript, we report the full-length sequence of one of these binding proteins, clone 72. The results indicate that clone 72 is widely expressed and is a major PKC-binding protein in REF52 fibroblasts.MATERIALS AND METHODSLibrary ScreeningA λgt11 REF52 cDNA library was prepared and screened for PKC-binding proteins as described in (15.Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive colonies were plaque-purified and sequenced using an automated sequencer. Two overlapping clones (53 original and 72 original, see Fig. 1) were identified as partial cDNAs and served as the starting point for obtaining the entire open reading frame. Two rounds of 5′-RACE were used to derive the 5′-extended (EXT) sequences 53EXT1 and 53EXT2. This same sequence was independently obtained by screening a rat brain cDNA library with a 32P-labeled clone 53 cDNA probe (brain cDNA). The 3′ extensions (72EXT1-5) were derived from the REF52 library using pairs of primers of gene-specific and λ sequences in PCR reactions. PCR products were cloned into pCRI (Invitrogen) or pSK (Stratagene) vectors for sequencing. Two to three clones of each PCR product were sequenced to identify and correct for PCR-generated sequencing errors. Homology searches were done using the Blast program (17.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69138) Google Scholar) and motif searching was done using Blocks Searcher (18.Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Expression of Recombinant Sequences and Production of Antisera53ORIG and 72ORIG cDNAs were isolated and ligated in frame into the pQE bacterial expression vector (Qiagen) to produce recombinant His-tagged fusion proteins. The expressed sequences were isolated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified antigens were used to raise antisera in rabbits. Antisera were purified by affinity chromatography using the expressed sequences coupled to Sepharose.Northern BlotsBlots containing 2.0 μg of poly(A) mRNA from multiple tissues were purchased from Clontech. Oligo(dT)-selected RNA was prepared from the normal and transformed REF52 cells. Aliquots (2.5 μg) were electrophoresed and blotted to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.). Random labeled cDNA probes of 53ORIG and 72ORIG were prepared with [32P]dCTP. Prehybridization conditions were 3 h at 42°C in 5 × SSPE and 2 × Denhardt's in the presence of 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 2% SDS, and 50% formamide. Blots were hybridized for 48 h at 42°C in the prehybridization solution, washed three times in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and three more times in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50°. Films shown were exposed for 1-2 days.ImmunoblotsGrowth and properties of REF52 cells have been described previously(19.McClure D.B. Dermody M. Topp W.C. Levine A.J. Van de Woude G.F. Topp W.C.

Cell lysates and tissue homogenates were prepared as described(16.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (20-50 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with affinity-purified clone 72 antiserum as described(16.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). The PKC overlay assay is described in (13.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).ImmunofluorescenceREF52 cells were grown on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed in formaldehyde, permeabilized in methanol, and incubated with first and second antibodies as described previously(21.Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of Clones 53 and 72 Expressed SequencesPurified recombinant clone 72ORIG expressed sequence (40 and 80 μg, respectively) were incubated with PKC purified from rabbit brains (22.Jaken S. Kiley S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4418-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (4 and 8 μg, respectively) in the presence of calcium, phosphatidylserine, and radiolabeled ATP as described previously(22.Jaken S. Kiley S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4418-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were digested with V8 protease overnight at 37°C. Peptides were separated on a C8 reversed phase column with an acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. Phosphopeptides were identified by liquid scintillation counting.RESULTSIsolation of Clone 72 Open Reading FrameIn order to identify PKC-binding proteins and substrates that mediate PKC action in cells, a λgt11 cDNA library prepared from REF52 cells was screened for PKC interacting proteins as described previously(15.Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two clones isolated during this screen, clones 53 and 72, were overlapping (Fig. 1). Additional 5′ sequence was obtained by 5′-RACE using primers to the clone 53 sequence and by screening a rat brain library with a clone 53 cDNA probe. Both of these approaches led to identification of the apparent 5′ end of the coding sequence. An open reading frame with a start methionine and a consensus Kozak sequence begins at position 34. Additional 3′ sequence was obtained by PCR screening the REF52 library with clone 72 primers. A summary of the individual clones obtained with these methods is shown in Fig. 1. The nucleic acid and predicted amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 2. Database searches indicated clone 72 had substantial homology to the recently reported clone 322(23.Lin S. Nelson P.J. Frankfort B. Tombler E. Johnson R. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, clone 72 had an additional ~1000 bp of open reading frame in the 5′ region and ~400 bp less in the 3′ region due to the stop codon at position 4821. Several differences in primary sequence were also noted. No overall homologies to other nucleotide or amino acid sequences were detected. However, a search for domain similarities indicated significant homology with two well characterized PKC substrates, neuromodulin and MARCKS. Residues 286-319 have significant homology to the PKC phosphorylation site in neuromodulin (and MARCKS)(24.Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Vandorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Two other peptides (148-178 and 502-532) also have significant homology to the PKC phosphorylation site in MARCKS. In addition to the phosphorylation domain homology, four peptides (residues 221-263, 317-359, 404-446, 614-656) have significant homology to an acidic domain in neuromodulin (residues 120-162 in rat neuromodulin). Repeats of these highly acidic peptides (more than 30% acidic residues) are likely to be important for clone 72 structure.Figure 2:Primary sequence of clone 72.

The recombinant protein had an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa, which is significantly larger than the predicted molecular mass of 44 kDa (Fig. 3). In general, anomolously slow migration on denaturing gels is characteristic of PKC-binding proteins (data not shown), including MARCKS(16.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar), and may reflect an extended, rod-like structure. Antisera raised to the purified recombinant protein recognized the expressed sequence and furthermore recognized a high molecular mass (>200 kDa) protein in REF52 cell extracts (Fig. 3). The antisera immunoprecipitated a >200-kDa protein from REF52 cell extracts which reacted with affinity-purified clone 72 antibody on immunoblots (Fig. 4A). The clone 72 antibody immunoprecipitates also contained a >200-kDa PKC-binding protein detected by PKC overlays (Fig. 4B). Thus, the cDNA isolated according to PKC binding activity in the interaction cloning assay appears to code for a PKC-binding protein expressed in REF52 cells.Figure 3:Production of antisera to clone 72. Clone 72ORIG (see Fig. 1) was expressed as a bacterial His-tagged fusion protein and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified protein was used to raise antisera in rabbits.

The major form of the detectable message was 6 kb and was abundantly expressed in testes, heart, skin, and brain (Fig. 5A). Smaller message sizes were also detected in skin, liver, and heart. Since identical results were obtained with blots probed with clone 72 and clone 53 cDNA probes (data not shown), these bands appear to be specific and most likely represent message species related to clone 72.Figure 5:Tissue distribution of clone 72. A, aliquots of mRNA (2.5 μg) from various tissues were separated by electrophoresis, blotted, and hybridized to a 32P-labeled DNA probe of clone 72ORIG. The blot shown was exposed to film for X days.

Expression levels were highest in testes and brain. Smaller bands that may be related either to the smaller, related messages or to proteolysis were also detected in most tissues. Thus, clone 72 encodes a high molecular weight PKC-binding protein that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues.Clone 72 Is a PKC SubstrateClones 72ORIG and 53ORIG expressed sequences were purified and used in in vitro kinase assays with PKC. After phosphorylation in the presence of radiolabeled ATP, the proteins were digested with V8 protease, peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC, and phosphopeptides were identified by liquid scintillation counting. Only one V8 peptide from clone 72ORIG contained phosphate; this was identified as 494R(35)E529 by automatic Edman degradation (underlined in Fig. 2). A synthetic peptide corresponding to 496V(33)E529 was also phosphorylated by PKC in vitro with a stoichiometry of 0.72. A second V8 peptide in 53ORIG was also phosphorylated. Further digestion with chymotrypsin indicated that the phosphorylation site was within the peptide 296R(13)D308 (underlined in Fig. 2). Both of these sequences were identified in the domain search as regions homologous to the phosphorylation motifs in neuromodulin and/or myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrates (see above). These results are consistent with previous studies that established a strong correlation between PKC-binding proteins and substrates (16.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar).Clone 72 Expression Is Transformation-sensitiveREF52 (REFA) cells are the parental cell line for progressively transformed SV40 derivatives, REFB, REFC, and REFD. REFB cells are morphologically transformed, REFC cells are capable of growth in soft agar, and REFD cells are fully transformed as demonstrated by their ability to produce tumors in nude mice(12.Hyatt S.L.

Northern blots demonstrated the progressive loss of clone 72 message with progressive transformation of REF52 cells (Fig. 6). Immunoblots also indicate decreased expression of clone 72 protein with progressive transformation of REF52 cells (Fig. 7A). Loss of immunoreactive clone 72 correlates with the progressive loss of the major >200-kDa PKC-binding protein with progressive transformation of REF52 cells (Fig. 7A). Decreased expression of clone 72 in transformed cells appears to be general rather than specific for SV40 transformation, since clone 72 protein was not detected in ras-transformed REF52 cells.Figure 6:Transformation-sensitive expression of clone 72 message in REF52 cells. Aliquots of mRNA (2.5 μg) from REFA, REFB, REFC, and REFD cells were separated by electrophoresis, blotted, and hybridized to a 32P-labeled clone 72ORIG cDNA probe.

Clone 72 is a novel sequence isolated from a REF52 cell expression library according to its PKC binding properties. Considerable effort was required to isolate the entire open reading frame of this large protein. Clone 72 may be identical to a recently reported sequence, clone 322, which appears to be missing approximately 1000 bp of coding sequence in the 5′ end(23.Lin S. Nelson P.J. Frankfort B. Tombler E. Johnson R. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other differences between the reported clone 322 and clone 72 sequences may be attributed to differences between manual and automated sequencing. ( 2I. Gelman, personal communication.) The translated sequence does not share significant homology with other proteins in the data bases.Northern analysis with clone 53 and clone 72 cDNA probes indicate that clone 72 has a broad tissue distribution. These data were substantiated by immunoblot analysis of various tissues with affinity-purified antibody to the clone 72 expressed sequence. Previous studies with the related sequence, clone 322, did not detect a similar tissue distribution profile. The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear at this time. Both studies identified abundant expression of the 6-kb transcript in testes and skin, whereas abundant expression in heart was detected only in this study. The presence of additional messages at 3.0 and 1.2 kb may indicate that alternate forms or closely related sequences are expressed in some tissues.Several motifs in clone 72 share homology with phosphorylation domains in the PKC substrates neuromodulin and MARCKS(24.Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Vandorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

In agreement with this, we found that clone 72 was phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Although preliminary studies have demonstrated that PKC activation stimulates phosphate incorporation into clone 72 in REF52 cells (data not shown), further studies are required to establish that the phosphorylation is directly due to PKC. Taken together, these data indicate that clone 72 is an abundant PKC substrate and may be important for mediating PKC signals in a variety of cell types.Immunoblot analysis demonstrated a graded loss of clone 72 protein in SV40- and ras-transformed fibroblasts. These results raise the intriguing possibility that differences not only in the expression of PKCs themselves, but also in the expression of PKC substrates, may contribute to disordered signaling through PKC pathways in transformed cells. Furthermore, since clone 72 can bind PKC with sufficient affinity to be detected in an in vitro overlay assay, it is also feasible that clone 72 functions as a PKC-targeting molecule in vivo. Preliminary immunolocalization studies indicate that clone 72 and certain PKCs both align with fibers in REF52 cells; however, colocalization studies have not yet been done. If clone 72 binds PKC in vivo, loss of clone 72 in transformed cells would also result in loss of PKC targeting. In fact, differential localization of PKCs in normal and transformed cells has been noted (12.Hyatt S.L. Klauck T. Jaken S. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16.Hyatt S.L. Liao L. Aderem A. Nairn A. Jaken S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies are required to determine if the differential localization is due to differential expression of PKC-binding proteins in the normal and transformed cells. In principle, inappropriate localization could lead to promiscuous phosphorylation by PKCs and consequently contribute to disordered signaling and loss of growth control.In summary, our results underscore that understanding the role of PKC signaling in transformation requires analysis not only of the expression of the PKC isozymes and their activation in response to exogenous stimuli, but also analysis of the expression of the downstream targets that mediate the effects of PKC activation on cellular functions, including growth, differentiation, and gene expression. INTRODUCTIONProtein kinase C (PKC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)MARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate.) is a family of phospholipid-dependent kinases involved in basic cellular functions, including regulation of growth, differentiation, and gene expression(1.Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 2.Pears, C., Goode, N., Parker, P. J. (1992) Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signaling, pp. 231–241Google Scholar). The role of individual PKCs in these processes is not yet known; however, since most cells express more than one type of PKC, it seems likely that individual PKCs have unique rather than overlapping functions. All of the PKCs require phosphatidylserine for maximal activity; however, PKCs can be grouped according to differences in their dependence on other activators. In addition to phosphatidylserine, conventional PKCs require calcium and diacylglycerol, novel PKCs require only diacylglycerol, and atypical PKCs require nothing more. Several other lipid modifiers of PKC activity have also been identified, and there is some evidence that they may selectively influence individual isozyme activities(1.Nishizuka Y."

We examined posttranslational regulation of gp63 expression by site-specific mutagenesis of the predicted catalytic/zinc-binding sites in the H264EXXH motif, the potential sites of N-glycosylation and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol addition. Mutant and wild-type genes were cloned into a Leishmania-specific vector for transfecting a deficient variant, which produced gp63 ~20-fold less than wild-type cells. The selective conditions chosen fully restored this deficiency in transfectants with the wild-type gene. Under these conditions, all transfectants were found comparable in both the plasmid copy number per cell and elevation of gp63 transcripts. Mutant and wild-type products in the transfectants were then compared quantitatively and qualitatively by specific immunologic and protease assays. The results indicate the following. 1) Glu-265 in the HEXXH motif is indispensable for the catalytic activity of gp63. The propeptide of the inactive mutant products was cleaved, suggestive of a non-intramolecular event. 2) Substitution of either His residue in HEXXH leads to apparent intracellular degradation of the mutant products, pointing to a role for zinc binding in in vivo stability of gp63. 3) The three potential sites of N-glycosylation at Asn-300, Asn-407, and Asn-534 are all utilized and contribute to intracellular stability of gp63. 4) Substitution of Asn-577 causes release of all mutant products, indicative of its specificity as a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol addition site for membrane anchoring of gp63. It is suggested that expression of gp63 as a functional protease is regulated by these posttranslational modification pathways.

It is suggested that expression of gp63 as a functional protease is regulated by these posttranslational modification pathways. Some metalloproteinase families, e.g. thermolysin, astacin, serratia, matrixin, and snake venom, share the signature sequence of HEXXH as a conserved zinc-binding/catalytic motif(1.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183Google Scholar). Leishmanolysin (EC 3.4.24.36) (2.Webb E.C. Recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on the Nomenclature and Classification of Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1992: 415Google Scholar) is such a zinc protease (gp63) on the surface of the trypanosomatid protozoa, Leishmania(3.Etges R. Bouvier J. Bordier C. J. Biol.

They live extracellularly as promastigotes in the gut of the insect vector and intralysosomally parasitize macrophages as amastigotes in the mammalian host, causing human leishmaniasis. gp63 has been suggested to function in multiple steps of the infection(6.Chang K.-P.

Leishmanolysin thus appears to differ functionally from other HEXXH metalloproteinase families. Different Leishmania gp63 genes are highly sequence-conserved (13.Button L.L. McMaster W.R. J. Exp.

Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Google Scholar). gp63 is abundantly expressed in promastigotes, apparently due to polycistronic transcription of these repetitive genes followed by their trans-splicing into multiple copies of functional mRNAs. In Leishmania chagasi, the growth phase-dependent expression of gp63 appears to result from selective degradation of the off-phase mRNAs rather than new transcription of the in-phase mRNAs(21.Wilson M.E. Paetz K.E. Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15731-15736Google Scholar). Thus, the specific expression of gp63 is apparently regulated posttranscriptionally, like most genes in trypanosomatid protozoa(22.Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Google Scholar). Additional posttranscriptional regulation of gp63 may lie in its posttranslational modifications. The N-terminal modifications of gp63 have been predicted from the gene sequences(13.Button L.L. McMaster W.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 724-729Google Scholar). Aside from the signal peptide, a propeptide is presumably cleaved from the N-terminal end of the nascent gp63 by autocatalytic processing, thereby unblocking the active site via the #x0201C;cysteine switch” mechanism(23.Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Google Scholar, 24.Button L.L. Wilson G. Astell C.R. McMaster W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 75-81Google Scholar). In matrixins(25.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Google Scholar), this processing involves the HEXXH domain wherein the His and Glu residues are essential for the catalytic activity of these metalloprotease families in zinc binding and peptide hydrolysis, respectively(1.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183Google Scholar). Whether these residues of gp63 function analogously and are involved in the autocleavage of propeptide have not been examined in Leishmania cells. The C-terminal modification of gp63 presumably involves cleavage of a signal peptide upon the addition of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) ( 1The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosyl phosphatidylinositolPLCphospholipase CCRDcross-reacting determinantPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRERrough endoplasmic reticulum.) anchor(26.Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Google Scholar), for example, at Asn-577 of the Leishmania major sequence(27.Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. McConville M.J. Mehlert A. Homans S.W. Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16955-16964Google Scholar). Regulation of gp63 at this step has been suggested previously by transfecting Leishmania with Trypanosoma gene encoding GPI-phospholipase C (PLC), which deprives gp63 of the GPI anchor, resulting in its extracellular release(28.Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.-P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Google Scholar). In contrast, when mutated at their GPI addition site, placental alkaline phosphatase (29.Micanovic R. Gerber L.D. Berger J. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10830-10837Google Scholar) both retain their hydrophobic C-terminal extensions, forming homoaggregates susceptible to intracellular degradation.

Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 100-104Google Scholar). The functional significance of N-glycosylation was thought to stabilize gp63 and its enzymatic activity(31.Kink J.A. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 181-190Google Scholar), consistent with the observations of other glycosylated proteases, e.g. tissue plasminogen activator (32.Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A.

Olafson R.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 23-35Google Scholar). In the present study, posttranslational modifications of gp63 were examined by site-directed substitution of residues tentatively identified as important from gene sequences. Here, evidence is provided from transfection studies with the mutant genes for the functional significance of the residues in zinc binding/catalytic activity, N-glycosylation, and GPI addition. Evidence obtained suggests that these posttranslational modification pathways may be regulated to modulate the expression of gp63 as a functional protease at different stages in the life cycle of Leishmania. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of gp63 Genes- Fig. 1 shows the amino acid residues of gp63 substituted by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (35.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar) of the genes using a phagemid mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). Templates used were the gp63 gene from L. major(13.Button L.L. McMaster W.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 724-729Google Scholar) and in two cases from that of Leishmania amazonensis (GenBank accession no. L46798), both being cloned into a Leishmania-specific expression vector (pX-gp63)(36.LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis contain 1-2 mismatched bases within the triplet codon of interest (see legend to Fig. 1 for the oligonucleotide sequences used). Site-specific mutations were verified by sequencing selected clones using oligonucleotide primers prepared from the gene sequence about 100 base pairs downstream of the modified sites (see legend to Fig. 1 for the primers used for sequencing). The resultant plasmids are designated on the basis of the amino acid residue mutated, its residue number, and respective substitution. Thus, E265D is a mutant in which Glu-265 is replaced with Asp in the pX-gp63 construct. Transfection of gp63-deficient Leishmania amazonensis by electroporation and their subsequent selection and cultivation were done exactly as described(12.McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Google Scholar). Transfectants emerged after 2-3 weeks and were selected for resistance to 200 μg of G418/ml. The copy number of the plasmids was assessed under these conditions for all transfectants by dot-blot analysis of total DNA using pBluescript as the probe. Total RNA was isolated from ~1-5 × 109 cells in a lysis solution (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 25 mM sodium citrate, 200 mM sodium acetate, and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol)(37.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). After extractions with acidic phenol/chloroform, RNA was precipitated at 4°C with isopropanol, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and precipitated three times with 4 M LiCl. Denatured samples were dot-blotted in serial dilutions on nylon filters (Cuno) for hybridization with Leishmania gp63 (13.Button L.L. McMaster W.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 724-729Google Scholar) or β-tubulin genes. Northern blot analysis was carried out by standard procedures (37.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by random priming (Amersham Corp.) with [α-32P]dCTP and purified by using the Elutip system (Schleicher & Schuell). Autoradiography was done at −70°C with intensifying screens. SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) for immunoblot analysis(10.Liu X. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4991-4995Google Scholar, 12.McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Google Scholar) using rabbit antiserum raised against denatured and deglycosylated gp63 (5.Chaudhuri G. Chaudhuri M. Pan A. Chang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7483-7489Google Scholar) that was purified from L. amazonensis(8.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 100-104Google Scholar). For loading control, we used rabbit antiserum raised against p36, a NADPH-oxidoreductase constitutively expressed in Leishmania spp.(38.Liu X. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 201-210Google Scholar). The second antibody used was either alkaline phosphatase- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Fc or IgG (Sigma). Immunoblots were developed in the latter case with ECL reagents for chemiluminescence (Amersham), followed by exposure to x-ray films. To assess the release of gp63, promastigotes were labeled for 1 h at a density of 108 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 50-100 μCi of EXPRE35S35S Met/Cys mixture (DuPont NEN) (specific activity = ~1000 Ci/mmol). Cells were washed twice in Medium 199 and resuspended in this medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (3 × 107 cells/ml). At different intervals after incubation for up to 48 h, spent media were collected and cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 × g. Labeled gp63 were immunoprecipitated from these supernatants for 1 h at 4°C with 1/200 dilution of the anti-gp63 antiserum. Immune complexes were collected by Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), followed by washing and autoradiography of these samples were performed as described(10.Liu X. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4991-4995Google Scholar, 12.McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Google Scholar). gp63 was immunoprecipitated from the culture supernatants of transfectants with mutant N577L using anti-gp63 polyclonal antibodies cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose with dimethylpimelimidate. The immunoprecipitates were washed with GPI-PLC digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% Nonidet-P 40) and digested with 200 ng of recombinant GPI-PLC from Trypanosoma brucei. gp63 purified from cells (8.Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 100-104Google Scholar) was processed exactly as described above to serve as positive controls. All samples were incubated with or without GPI-PLC for 3 h at 37°C and subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis with the ECL reagents using a 1/10,000 dilution of either anti-gp63 or anti-CRD antisera. Glutaraldehyde fixed cells were used to assay for surface proteolytic activity at 37°C for 1 h using azocasein as the substrate (5 × 107 fixed cells/5 mg of azocasein/0.5 ml of buffer, pH 7)(10.Liu X. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4991-4995Google Scholar). Proteolytic activity of cell lysates (4 × 108 cells/ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Nonidet P-40) was also assayed five times in acrylamide gels containing 0.2% gelatin as the substrate. After electrophoresis at 2°C, gels were incubated in 40 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, for 3 h at 37°C, followed by Coomassie Blue staining to reveal gelatinolytic activity of gp63 as clear areas(5.Chaudhuri G. Chaudhuri M. Pan A. Chang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7483-7489Google Scholar). Banding intensity of gp63 in five autoradiograms from ECL-developed Western blots was assessed using an LKB laser densitometer (Bromma, Sweden). Values for the glycosylation mutants were normalized against the endogenous gp63, whereas those of the wild-type gene were normalized against gp63 bands in the untransfected control (Table 1, Expression level). From a set of 5 representative data in the gel assays for gelatinolytic activity, the faster migrating overexpressed band (Fig. 3, panel C, open arrows) was scanned versus the endogenous slower migrating band (solid arrows) from the photographic negatives (Table 1, Gelatinolytic activity).Tabled 1Figure 3:Western blot and gel-protease analyses of wild-type and mutant gp63 in Leishmania transfectants. Panel A, Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gel showing comparable loading of all samples; Panel A′, Western blot with rabbit antiserum raised against p36, a constitutively expressed Leishmania NADPH-oxidoreductase; panel B, immunoblot with rabbit polyclonal sera raised against affinity-purified gp63, showing relative level of gp63 expression by wild-type and mutant genes in the transfectants; panel C, gelatin-containing gel for proteolytic activities of the same samples. Lane 1, parental gp63-deficient variant; lanes 2I and 2II, two independent transfectants with the wild-type gene; lanes 3-15, transfectants with the gp63 site-specific mutants loaded in the same order as those in Fig. 1 and Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As a prerequisite to study the effects of mutagenesis on gp63 at the protein level, we first verified that the copy number of the plasmids and transcription of gp63 genes were comparable in all transfectants. DNA dot-blot analysis with a vector-specific sequence (pBluescript) as the probe showed that all transfectants under the selective conditions used contained an equivalent number of plasmids, i.e. ~200-400 copies/cell, as seen previously(12.McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Google Scholar). Structural integrity of the plasmids was also confirmed in all transfectants by restriction mapping (data not shown). In addition, all transfectants with wild-type and the mutant gp63 genes were found to contain an equivalent amount of gp63 mRNA (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1 and 4-12) that was elevated ~8-fold over untransfected cells (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or transfectants with vector alone (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Overexpression of gp63 mRNAs to this level in the transfectants is expected from the copy number of plasmids over that of the endogenous gp63 genes estimated per cell(17.Medina-Acosta E. Karess R.E. Russell D.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 31-46Google Scholar, 20.Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 157-172Google Scholar). Reprobing the blots with the β-tubulin gene provides reference for the comparable quantity of all RNA samples loaded (Fig. 2, panel B). Northern blot analysis further confirms that gp63 transcripts are overexpressed in transfectants with wild-type and representative mutant genes (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-8) when compared to transfectants with the vector alone (lane 1). Significantly, the overexpressed gp63 mRNAs are of comparable patterns, suggestive of their qualitative identity. The ~5.4- and ~8-kilobase pair species are intense and clearly the transcripts from the mutant or wild-type genes electroporated (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-8) because of their absence in the control (lane 1). The remaining faint band of 3 kilobase pairs is present in all samples including the control (Fig. 2C), indicative of its origin from the endogenous gp63 genes. Clearly, site-specific mutations of the gp63 genes introduced affect neither replication of the pX vector nor their transcription, although the interrelationships of the two overexpressed mRNAs observed await further investigation. To assess the effects of site-specific mutations on gp63, mutant and wild-type products of the transfectants were compared quantitatively and qualitatively (Fig. 3; Table 1). For adequate comparison, all samples were loaded using the same cell number (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of a constitutively expressed p36 provided the reference for loading; its intensity was very comparable among all samples (Fig. 3A′). The relative amounts of gp63 proteins were assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). To optimize the capacity of this assay for quantitative evaluation, polyclonal antiserum raised against denatured and deglycosylated gp63 was used(5.Chaudhuri G. Chaudhuri M. Pan A. Chang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7483-7489Google Scholar). Laser densitometry of the gp63 bands developed by ECL reagents on x-ray films provided further quantitative evaluation (Table 1, Expression level). In addition, wild-type and mutant products in the transfectants were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed as a protease by two different assays, i.e. gelatinolysis after electrophoresis of cell lysates in non-denaturing gels and caseinolysis of glutaraldehyde-fixed cells in solution. The gel assay has an added advantage in that it separates the products of electroporated L. major genes from the endogenous L. amazonensis gp63, since the former (Fig. 3C, open arrow) migrates faster than the latter (solid arrow) after electrophoresis under the non-denaturing conditions used. This is presumably due to a slight conformational difference of the gp63 proteins, resulting from minor sequence heterogeneity of the genes from these two Leishmania species. The caseinolysis assay for the products expressed on the cell surface provided quantitative data (Table 1, Caseinolytic activity). As reported previously(10.Liu X. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4991-4995Google Scholar, 12.McGwire B.S. Chang K.-P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 345-347Google Scholar), the deficient variant used for transfection was found to contain a low background of gp63 (Table 1 and Fig. 3, B and C, lane 1). The level of gp63 was substantially increased by transfection of the variant with the wild-type gene (Table 1, Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 2I and 2II). Densitometry of their relative banding intensity shows an average of 18-fold difference (Table 1, Expression level; lanes 1 versus lanes 2I and 2II). Comparison of the transfectants with and without the gp63 gene for their surface caseinolytic activity revealed an even greater difference (Table 1, Caseinolytic activity; lanes 1 and 2I and 2II). It was estimated that ~95% of the gp63 in the transfectants is attributable to the expression of electroporated genes. Coupled with the different electrophoretic mobility of their products in the native gel, this level of the overexpression makes it possible to assess the qualitative and quantitative effects of mutagenesis on gp63. Unless specified, mutants referred to below were produced with the gp63 gene of L. major. Conserved substitutions of catalytically important residues predicted in the H264EXXH motif yielded unexpected results. The mutant, E265D, produced as much gp63 protein (Table 1 and Fig. 3B, lane 5) as those with wild-type genes (lanes 2I and 2II) or as another mutant, Y254D, with substitution of the Tyr residue in the presumed macrophage binding motif of SRY254D (9.Soteriadou K.P. Remoundous M.S. Katsikas M.C. Tzinia A.K. Tsikaris V. Sakarellos C. Tzartos S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13980-13985Google Scholar) (lane 8). However, enzyme activity of the E265D products is drastically reduced (Table 1 and Fig. 3C, lane 5) in contrast to that of the wild-type or Y254D products (Table 1 and Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 8, open arrow). The same results were obtained with a similar mutation in the L. amazonensis gp63 gene (data not shown). The results thus support the prediction, on account of the presence of HEXXH alone, that Glu-265 is catalytically important. This finding is consistent with previous work on other metalloproteases possessing the HEXXH or HXXEH sequence, e.g. neutral endopeptidase(39.Devault A. Sales V. Nault C. Beaumont A. Roques B. Crine P. Boileau G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 54-58Google Scholar), angiotensin converting enzyme(40.Wei L. Alhene-Geles F. Corval P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Google Scholar), and E. coli protease III (41.Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Google Scholar). Although the products of E265D are enzymatically inactive, they appear to have been appropriately processed posttranslationally, judging from their identity in electrophoretic mobility to the wild-type gp63 (Fig. 3B, lane 5 versus lane 2). This suggests that the cleavage of propeptide from the nascent gp63 does not require an #x0201C;intramolecular autocleavage,” as found for the proenzyme activation in the matrixin family(25.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Google Scholar). The proposal that gp63 may undergo a similar process of autocleavage (24.Button L.L. Wilson G. Astell C.R. McMaster W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 75-81Google Scholar) via the #x0201C;cysteine switch” mechanism (23.Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Google Scholar) remains possible, assuming that the propeptide is cleaved by an #x0201C;intermolecular” processing event. In this instance, it may involve the action of either a different protease or the endogenous wild-type enzyme on the mutant. Additional work is needed to elucidate this important step in the regulation of gp63 maturation into a functional protease. Interestingly, substitutions of either His-264 or His-268, the two zinc-binding ligands in the HEXXH motif, resulted in no detectable overexpression of gp63 and hence little enzyme activity above background in the transfectants (Table 1 and Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). There was very little extracellular exit of the mutant proteins into the culture medium of these transfectants (data not shown), as was the case of the wild-type transfectants (Fig. 4A, pX-gp63). Two mutants were prepared for each His residue by conserved substi"

Pep4A21-54 was also an absolute requirement for cleavage of in vitro translated NS4B-NS5A by the purified protease. From these data we conclude that: (i) the purified protease domain shows substrate specificity and cleavage requirements similar to those previously reported on the basis of transfection experiments, (ii) activation of the purified protease by the NS4A co-factor can be mimicked by synthetic peptide analogs, and (iii) a central hydrophobic region of NS4A with a minimum core of 14 amino acids is responsible for the interaction with NS3.

To define the role of Syk in these events, we expressed the BCR in the AtT20 mouse pituitary cell line. These nonlymphoid cells endogenously expressed the Src family kinase Fyn but not Syk. Anti-IgM stimulation of these cells failed to induce most of the signaling events that occur in B cells. BCR-expressing AtT20 transfectants were generated that also expressed Syk. Syk expression reconstituted several signaling events upon anti-IgM stimulation, including Syk phosphorylation and association with the BCR, tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins including Shc, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. In contrast, Syk expression did not reconstitute anti-IgM-induced inositol phosphate production. A catalytically inactive Syk mutant could associate with the BCR and become tyrosine phosphorylated but could not reconstitute downstream signaling events. Expression of the Src family kinase Lck instead of Syk also did not reconstitute signaling. Thus, wild type Syk was required to reconstitute several BCR-induced signaling events but was not sufficient to couple the BCR to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway.

Anti-IgM stimulation of these cells failed to induce most of the signaling events that occur in B cells. BCR-expressing AtT20 transfectants were generated that also expressed Syk. Syk expression reconstituted several signaling events upon anti-IgM stimulation, including Syk phosphorylation and association with the BCR, tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins including Shc, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. In contrast, Syk expression did not reconstitute anti-IgM-induced inositol phosphate production. A catalytically inactive Syk mutant could associate with the BCR and become tyrosine phosphorylated but could not reconstitute downstream signaling events. Expression of the Src family kinase Lck instead of Syk also did not reconstitute signaling. Thus, wild type Syk was required to reconstitute several BCR-induced signaling events but was not sufficient to couple the BCR to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway."

They anchor proteins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and may be associated with other functions, such as signal transduction and protein targeting. The structure, biosynthesis, and function of GPI anchors have been reviewed, most recently by Englund(1993), McConville and Ferguson(1993), Stevens(1995), Udenfriend and Kodukula(1995), and Takeda and Kinoshita(1995).The tsetse fly-transmitted African trypanosomes, which cause human sleeping sickness and a variety of livestock diseases, are able to survive in the mammalian bloodstream by virtue of their dense cell-surface coat. This coat consists of 10 million copies of a 55-kDa GPI-anchored glycoprotein called the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) (Cross, 1990). The relative abundance of the VSG protein in Trypanosoma brucei renders this organism extremely useful for the study of GPI anchor biosynthesis. The structure of the VSG GPI anchor is known (Ferguson et al., 1988), and the principal features of the GPI biosynthetic pathway in trypanosomes were elucidated using a cell-free system based on washed trypanosome membranes (Masterson et al., 1989, 1990; Menon et al., 1990a). The first step in the pathway involves the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI), via a sulfydryl-dependent GlcNAc transferase (Milne et al., 1992) to form GlcNAc-PI, which is rapidly de-N-acetylated (Doering et al., 1989) to give glucosaminyl PI (GlcN-PI). Three α-Man residues are sequentially transferred onto GlcN-PI from dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) (Menon et al., 1990b) to produce the intermediate Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcN-PI (Man3GlcN-PI). All of the mannosylated intermediates can be found in both acylated and nonacylated inositol forms, and a Man3GlcN-(acyl)PI species appears to be the preferred substrate for ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) addition (Güther and Ferguson, 1995), the donor for which is phosphatidylethanolamine (Menon and Stevens, 1992; Menon et al., 1993). The EtNP-Man3GlcN-(acyl)PI (glycolipid C′) species is then deacylated to form glycolipid A′, which undergoes a series of fatty acid remodeling reactions (Masterson et al., 1990) in which the fatty acids of the PI moiety are removed and replaced with myristate to yield the mature GPI precursor glycolipid A. This mature precursor is transferred to the VSG polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum in exchange for a carboxyl-terminal GPI signal peptide, reviewed by Udenfriend and Kodukula(1995).The GPI biosynthetic pathways in mammalian cells (Sugiyama et al., 1991; Lemansky et al., 1991, Hirose et al., 1991, 1992a, 1992b; Kamitani et al., 1992; Puoti et al., 1991; Puoti and Conzelmann, 1992, 1993; Mohney et al., 1994) and yeast (Costello and Orlean, 1992; Sipos et al., 1994), as well as in other protozoa, such as Toxoplasma (Tomavo et al., 1992a, 1992b) and Plasmodium falciparum (Gerold et al., 1994), appear to be broadly similar to that described above for the bloodstream form of T. brucei. Some notable differences among the trypanosomal, mammalian, and yeast GPI pathways include the almost quantitative acylation of all mammalian and yeast GPI intermediates from GlcN-PI onwards and the addition of extra ethanolamine phosphate groups to the mammalian intermediates. The fatty acid remodeling reactions, as described above, appear to be unique to the bloodstream form of African trypanosomes.In this paper, we show that exogenously added GlcN-PI and analogues thereof can prime the GPI pathway in a trypanosome cell-free system, thereby providing a convenient means for probing the substrate specificity of Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase, the first mannosyltransferase of the GPI biosynthetic pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsGDP-[1-3H]mannose (15.0Ci/mmol) and En3Hance(TM) were purchased from DuPont NEN, and jack bean α-mannosidase was from Boehringer Mannheim. Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C was a gift from Dr. M. Low, Columbia University, New York, NY, and whole human serum was used as a source of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D. Ion exchange resins (AG-50X12 and AG-3X4) were obtained from Bio-Rad. Zwittergent 3-16, n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside, and n-octyl 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranoside were obtained from Calbiochem, Nonidet P-40 was obtained from Pierce, and Triton X-100 was from Aldrich. The novel detergent β-D-glucopyranosyl octyl sulfone was prepared by five additions of peracetic acid (10 μl) at 5-min intervals to solid n-octyl 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranoside (25 mg) while on ice. The excess of acid was removed by evaporation, and the product was recovered from the organic phase of a butan-1-ol/water partition. All of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma.Substrates and Substrate AnaloguesGlcN-PI, D-GlcNα1-6-L-myo-inositol-1-PO4-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol (GlcN-P[L]I), D-GlcNα1-6-D-myo-inositol-1-PO4-glycerol (GlcN-Ino-P-glycerol), D-GlcNα1-6-D-myo-inositol-1-PO4 (GlcN-Ino-P), and D-GlcNα1-6-D-myo-inositol (GlcN-Ino) were synthesized according to Cottaz et al. (1993, 1995a, 1995b). D-GlcNα1-6-D-myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate (GlcN-Ino-1,2-P) was a gift from Professor J. van Boom, Leiden University, The Netherlands. These compounds were N-acetylated as described below.D-Glcα1-6-D-myo-inositol-1-PO4-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol (Glc-PI) and D-2-deoxy-Glcα1-6-D-myo-inositol-1-PO4-sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol (2-deoxy-Glc-PI) were synthesized according to Cottaz et al. (1995b). The authenticity and purity of the synthetic compounds was checked by electrospray mass spectrometry prior to use (see Fig. 1for the recorded pseudomolecular ions), and the concentrations of stock solutions were measured by analyzing the myo-inositol content by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, as described below. Isoamyl phosphate (CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-PO4H) and didehydrofarnesol phosphate (CH3-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-PO4H) were synthesized. 2T. K. Smith, S. Cottaz, J. S. Brimacombe, and M. A. J. Ferguson, unpublished results.Briefly, isoamyl alcohol was reacted with 1-naphthalenemethyl phosphonic acid (Katritzky et al., 1990) followed by oxidation with iodine and catalytic hydrogenation. Farnesol was selectively hydrogenated in the α-isoprene unit using NaBH4 and a PtO2 catalyst (Mankowski et al., 1976), and the product was subsequently phosphorylated with POCl3 (Danilov and Chojnacki, 1981).Preparation of TrypanosomesBloodstream forms of T. brucei (variant MITat1.4) were isolated from infected rats and mice. Trypanosome membranes (trypanosome cell-free system) were prepared as described previously by Masterson et al.(1989), except that the cells were not preincubated with tunicamycin prior to lysis.Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4 Mannosyltransferase AssaysThe try panosome cell-free system was used as the source of the enzyme. Trypanosome membranes were washed twice in 0.1 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mMNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and resuspended at 5 × 108 cell equivalents/ml in 2 × concentrated incorporation buffer (0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MnCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin, 0.2 mM TLCK, 2 μg/ml leupeptin (Masterson et al., 1989)). Unless stated otherwise, the 2 × concentrated incorporation buffer was supplemented with freshly prepared 0.2 MN-ethylmalemide and 10 mM (0.3% (w/v)) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside. The resuspended lysate was vortexed, sonicated briefly, and then added to a tube containing dry GDP-[3H]Man (0.3 μCi/107 cell equivalents) and sonicated for 1 min. Aliquots of 20 μl (equivalent to 1 × 107 cells) were added to the reaction tubes containing the various substrates in an equal volume of 10 mMn-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside. The reaction tubes were incubated at 30°C for 1 h. When glycolipid substrates (i.e. containing a dipalmitoylglycerol moiety) were used, the final substrate concentration was 35 μM, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 270 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 (v/v)). The glycolipid products were recovered in the chloroform/methanol/water-soluble fraction, which was evaporated and partitioned between butan-1-ol and water, as described by Güther et al.(1994). Aliquots of the butan-1-ol phase containing the glycolipid products were subjected to HPTLC analysis (before and after enzyme digestions and chemical treatments) and to glycan analysis following delipidation with 300 μl of concentrated NH4OH, 50% propan-1-ol (1:1 (v/v)) at 50°C for 5 h.Water-soluble substrates were used at a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and the assays were terminated as described above. The products were recovered in the aqueous phase of a butan-1-ol/water partition and analyzed for glycan as described below.Competition assays were carried out in the presence of either 35 μM GlcN-PI or 35 μM GlcNAc-PI as substrate and with the substrate analogues at 0.5 mM. The lysate was preincubated with GDP-[3H]Man, and 20-μl aliquots (1 × 107 cell equivalents) were added to the reaction tubes containing a mixture of substrate and substrate analogue and incubated at 30°C for 1 h. Glycolipids were extracted and analyzed by HPTLC. Mannosylation of the competing water-soluble glycans was investigated by glycan analysis of the aqueous phase, as described below.Assays for donor specificity were performed as described above, except that exogenous pig liver dolichol phosphate (25 μM) and didehyrofarnesol phosphate (50 μM) or isoamyl phosphate (50 μM) were added with the GDP-[3H]Man.HPTLCSamples and glycolipid standards were applied to 10-cm aluminium-backed plates of silica gel 60 HPTLC (Merck) and developed in chloroform, methanol, 1 M ammonium acetate, 13 M ammonium hydroxide, water (180:140:9:9:23 (v/v)). Radiolabeled components were detected by fluorography at −70°C, after spraying with En3Hance(TM), using Kodak XAR-5 film and an intensifying screen.Enzyme Treatments of Radiolabeled GlycolipidsWith jack bean α-mannosidase, PI-specific phospholipase C and GPI-specific phospholipase D and HPTLC product analysis were carried out as described previously (Güther et al., 1994).Chemical Treatments of Radiolabeled Glycans and GlycolipidsDeamination of the glycolipids was carried out in 20 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4, containing 0.01% Zwittergent 3-16. Aliquots (10 μl) of freshly prepared 0.5 M NaNO2 were added at hourly intervals with incubation at 60°C for 4 h. Lipidic products were recovered for HPTLC analysis by butan-1-ol extraction.N-Acetylation of glycans was performed at 0°C in 100 μl of saturated NaHCO3 by the addition of three aliquots (2.5 μl) of acetic anhydride at 10-min intervals. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature, and the solution of N-acetylated glycan was desalted by passage through AG50X12(H+) ion-exchange resin and evaporated, and residual acetic acid was removed by coevaporation with toluene (2 × 50 μl).Dephosphorylation was performed with 50 μl of 48% aqueous HF (0°C for 48-60 h). Saturated LiOH was used to neutralize HF, which precipitated as LiF (Ferguson, 1992).Glycan AnalysisRadiolabeled products were mixed with 2,500 cpm of an internal standard, Manα1-2Manα1-6[Galα1-6(Galα1-2)Galα1-3]Manα1-4[1-3H]2,5-anhydromannitol (Gal3Man3[1-3H]AHM) (Ferguson et al., 1988). In the analysis of glycolipid products, the internal standard was added prior to delipidation, and the soluble glycan products were recovered in the aqueous phase of a butan-1-ol/water partition. The samples were treated in two ways.(a)Dephosphorylated/N-acetylated glycans were generated by N-acetylation, passage through AG50X12(H+) ion-exchange resin, aqueous HF dephosphorylation, and re-N-acetylation (Ferguson, 1992).(b)Dephosphorylated/deaminated glycans were generated by deamination and subsequent NaBH4 reduction followed by aqueous HF dephosphorylation and re-N-acetylation (Ferguson, 1992).The neutral glycans from these procedures were dissolved in water and mixed with oligomeric glucose internal standards, filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane, and analyzed by Bio-Gel P4 gel filtration using an Oxford Glycosystems GlycoMap. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and counted for radioactivity. The yields of [3H]Man-containing glycan products for each substrate were normalized using the internal standard Gal3Man3[1-3H]AHM.Inositol AnalysisGas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Hewlett Packard MSD 5970 series) was used to measure the myo-inositol content of synthetic substrates and analogues. Aliquots of samples were mixed with the internal standard myo-[1,2,3,4,5,6-2H]inositol (100 pmoles) and hydrolyzed with 50 μl of 6 M HCl at 110°C for 16-18 h. After evaporation, the products were converted into their trimethylsilyl derivatives and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy, as described by Ferguson(1992).Electrospray Mass SpectrometryA VG Quattro (Fisons Instruments) spectrometer was used to acquire positive and negative-ion electrospray mass spectra over the mass range m/z 150-1150. Samples (5-20 μl at approximately 20 pmol/μl) were introduced in 50% aqueous acetonitrile at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, and several scans were averaged using MassLynx software. The m/z values of the pseudomolecular ions for each of the synthetic compounds are given in Fig. 1.RESULTSOptimization of Assay ConditionsThe standard incubation conditions of the trypanosome cell-free system can be used to monitor all of the enzymes of the GPI biosynthetic pathway using endogenous acceptor substrates present in the membranes (Masterson et al., 1989, 1990; Menon et al., 1990a, 1990b). This system has been adapted to allow the use of exogenous substrates and substrate analogues to probe the substrate specificity of the first mannosyltransferase of the pathway. The formation of GPI intermediates from endogenous PI was suppressed by omitting UDP-GlcNAc and including N-ethylmaleimide, a potent inhibitor of the UDP-GlcNAc:PI α1-6 GlcNAc-transferase (Milne et al., 1992). The addition of N-ethylmaleimide also inhibits the endogenous GPI-specific phospholipiase C (Herold et al., 1986) and prevents the degradation of GPI intermediates when detergents are included. Attempts to solubilize the Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase were unsuccessful because all of the detergents investigated largely destroyed the enzyme activity when employed above the critical micellar concentration (CMC), see Table 1. Significantly, all active preparations primed with exogenous GlcN-PI produced essentially the same spectrum of products (see Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3, and Table 2). In view of this, the activity of Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase was measured by summation of the radioactivity found in all mannosylated GPI intermediates. The incorporation of [3H]Man into these intermediates was linear over 90 min, and an incubation time of 60 min was chosen for the assay.Tabled 1Figure 2:The effects of n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside analogues on the GPI pathway. The trypanosome cell-free system (1 × 107 cell equivalents/sample) was incubated at 30°C for 1 h with GlcN-PI and GDP-[3H]Man in the presence of sub-CMC concentrations of the following detergents: 10 mMn-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside (lane 1), 5 mMn-octyl-1-thio-β-D-glucopyranoside (lane 2), and 3 mM β-D-glucopyranosyl octyl sulfone (lane 3). Radiolabeled glycolipids were extracted and then separated by HPTLC with fluorographic detection. The identities of the radiolabeled glycolipids were based on RF values and sensitivities to jack bean α-mannosidase, PI-specific phospholipase C, and PI-specific phospholipase D (see Table 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tabled 1In the system without added detergent, enzymatic activity was observed between pH 6.0 and 9.0, with a maximum at about pH 7.4 (data not shown). All subsequent assays were performed at pH 7.4.The assay is dependent on endogenous Dol-P-Man synthetase, which converts GDP-[3H]Man to Dol-P-[3H]Man in situ. The enzyme is thermally unstable (Prado-Figueroa et al., 1994) so that the temperature of the assay was limited to 30°C. The loss in GPI pathway activity using detergents above their CMCs was not associated with the loss of Dol-P-Man sythetase activity, since the formation of Dol-P-[3H]Man is usually stimulated under these conditions (data not shown).The data in Table 1show that several detergents can support GPI biosynthesis below their CMCs, but only CHAPS and n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside (and certain derivatives thereof) were able to stimulate the pathway. The significant (3.5-fold) stimulation of the pathway with 10 mM (0.3% (w/v)) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside was exploited in all subsequent assays. Stimulation of the GPI pathway was not due to stimulation of Dol-P-Man synthetase, since Triton X-100 was at least as effective as n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside in stimulating Dol-P-Man synthesis, whereas it did not stimulate GPI biosynthesis (data not shown). The sensitivity of the pathway to the detergent environment is illustrated by the inhibitory effect of n-octyl 1-thio-β-D-glucopyranoside (Fig. 2, lane 2), which can be reversed by oxidation of the sulfur atom to the more polar sulfone (Fig. 2, lane 3, and Table 1).Acceptor Substrate SpecificityThe cell-free system was incubated with GlcN-PI (the natural acceptor substrate) and various GlcN-PI analogues in the presence of 10 mMn-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside and GDP-[3H]Man (Fig. 3). In all cases, the membranes produced labeled Dol-P-[3H]Man and a low level of endogenous GPI intermediates, ranging from Manα1-4GlcN-PI to EtNP-Man3-GlcN-PI (see lane 3). The only substrates producing an increased amount of labeled intermediates were GlcN-PI (lane 1) and GlcNAc-PI (lane 4). Of these, GlcNAc-PI was superior in priming the pathway, resulting in at least a 6-fold increase in product formation compared with GlcN-PI. 3The enhanced acceptor activity of GlcNAc-PI over GlcN-PI was not due to differences in the solubilities of these substrates in the assay buffer, which contains 10 mMn-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside. This was assessed by ultra-centrifugation of solutions of GlcN-PI and GlcNAc-PI, containing respective [3H]myristate-labeled tracers, which showed that both substrates were fully soluble.The identities of the individual bands were assigned on the basis to their RF values and sensitivities to jack bean α-mannosidase, PI-specific phospholipase C, GPI-specific phospholipase D, and nitrous acid deamination (Table 2). The GlcN-PI analogues Glc-PI, 2-deoxy-Glc-PI, and GlcN-P[L]I showed no detectable acceptor activity (lanes 2, 5, and 6).Figure 3:Analysis of the products of various lipid-containing GlcN-PI acceptor analogues. The trypanosome cell-free system (1 × 107 cell equivalents/sample) was incubated at 30°C for 1 h with GDP-[3H]Man and 10 mMn-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of 35 μM GlcN-PI (lane 1), 35 μM GlcN-P[L]I (lane 2), no exogenous acceptor (lane 3), 35 μM GlcNAc-PI (lane 4), 50 μM Glc-PI (lane 5), and 50 μM 2-deoxy-Glc-PI (lane 6). Glycolipids were extracted and analyzed by HPTLC with fluorographic detection. The identities of the radiolabeled glycolipids were based upon RF values and sensitivities to jack bean α-mannosidase, PI-specific phospholipase C, and PI-specific phospholipase D (see Table 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to compare the abilities of glycolipid and water-soluble substrates to prime the GPI pathway (see Fig. 4), they were incubated with the cell-free system in the presence of n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside (10 mM) and GDP-[3H]Man, as described above. The glycan components of the products were recovered following (a) N-acetylation, aqueous HF dephosphorylation and re-N-acetylation or (b) deamination/reduction and aqueous HF dephosphorylation. The radiolabeled neutral glycans so produced were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P4 column. In all cases, a substantial peak of [3H]Man was seen at 1.0 glucose units, which corresponds to the label carried over from GDP-[3H]Man. All of the acceptors were shown by method (a) to produce a labeled glycan at 5.7 glucose units, which corresponds to Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcNAcα1-6-myo-inositol (Ralton et al., 1993). Minor products were detected at 4.7 and 3.8 glucose units, which correspond to Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcNAc α1-6-myo-inositol and Manα1-4GlcNAcα1-6-myoinositol, respectively. The yields of these products were normalized by means of the internal standard Gal3Man3[1-3H]AHM (at 6.8 glucose units). Similar results were obtained using method (b)(data not shown). Since method (b) depends on nitrous acid deamination of a GlcN residue, it showed that all of the N-acetylated substrates had been de-N-acetylated prior to mannosylation.Figure 4:Comparison of the acceptor activities of lipid-containing and water-soluble substrate analogues. The trypanosome cell-free system (1 × 107 cell equivalents/sample) was incubated at 30°C for 1 h with GDP-[3H]Man and 10 mMn-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of various acceptor substrate analogues (50 μM). Analysis of the radiolabeled GPI glycan products was achieved by delipidation (if required), dephosphorylation, N-acetylation and desalting, followed by fractionation on a Bio-Gel P4 column. After normalization, using the internal standard Gal3Man3[1-3H]AHM, the total radioactivity associated with the GPI glycan products was expressed as a percentage relative to that obtained with GlcN-PI (100%). The values shown are mean values of at least three determinations.

However, the presence of either GlcNAc-PI or GlcN-PI in these experiments prevented the mannosylation of GlcNAc-Ino-P-glycerol, GlcN-Ino-P-glycerol, GlcNAc-Ino-P, GlcN-Ino-P, GlcNAc-Ino-1,2-P, GlcN-Ino-1,2-P, GlcNAc-Ino, and GlcN-Ino, as judged by glycan analysis of the water-soluble products (data not shown).Donor Substrate SpecificityA direct donor for all three of the α-mannosyltransferases of the GPI pathway is Dol-P-Man (Menon et al., 1992). In the normal cell-free system assay, GDP-[3H]Man is converted into Dol-P-[3H]Man by the action of endogenous Dol-P-Man synthetase on endogenous (C50 and C55) dolichol phosphate (Fig. 5, lane 1). The addition of exogenous (C40-C65) dolichol phosphate to the cell-free system stimulated the production of additional Dol-P-[3H]Man (lane 2) but did not result in a significant increase in the labeling of the GPI intermediates. The addition of the dolichol phosphate analogues didehydrofarnesol phosphate and isoamyl phosphate to the cell-free system inhibited the formation of endogenous Dol-P-[3H]Man (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), and both analogues were mannosylated by Dol-P-Man synthetase to form didehydrofarnesol and isoamyl phospho-[3H]mannose, respectively. Neither of the latter compounds was able to donate [3H]mannose, via Dol-P-Man:GlcN α1-4-mannosyltransferase, to the awaiting exogenous GlcN-PI acceptor. Didehydrofarnesol phospho-[3H]mannose was recovered in the butan-1-ol phase, and the HPTLC profile revealed two bands, corresponding to the cis - and trans- isomers (lane 3). Isoamyl phospho-[3H]mannose was recovered in the aqueous phase of a water/butan-1-ol partition, whereas there was no endogenous Dol-P-[3H]Man present in the butan-1-ol phase (lane 4). The identities of the [3H]mannosylated analogues were established by their sensitivities to mild acid hydrolysis.Figure 5:Analysis of donor substrate specificity of dolichol-P-Man:GlcN α1-4-mannosyltransferase.

All of these molecules, several of which are essential for parasite infectivity, share the structural motif Manα1-4GlcNα1-6-myo-inositol-1-PO4-lipid. Thus the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of this conserved unit represent attractive targets for the development of anti-parasite agents. In this paper we disclose the substrate specificity of one of these enzymes, the trypanosomal Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferaseA previous report by DeLuca et al.(1994) describes an assay for a comparable mammalian Dol-P-Man:GlcN-(acyl)PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase, based on the microsomes of mutant CHO-K1 cells that were unable to synthesize or utilize endogenous Dol-P-Man and which therefore accumulated endogenous GlcN-(acyl)PI. Using this assay, they were able to study the donor substrate specificity of the enzyme, which exhibited strict specificity for the β-anomer of Dol-P-Man, although the dolichol moiety could be replaced by a similar polyisoprenyl moiety without abolishing enzymatic activity. The assay described here for the trypanosomal Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase differs from that of DeLuca et al.(1994) in that it relies on the addition of exogenous (synthetic) acceptors and can be used to determine both donor and acceptor specificities.The trypanosomal dolichols are unusually short α-unsaturated polyisoprenes (C50-55) (Low et al., 1991). We have investigated the possibility that the dolichol phosphate moiety of the Dol-P-Man donor might be replaced by even shorter analogues, namely didehydrofarnesol phosphate (an α-unsaturated C15 tri-isoprene) or isoamyl phosphate (a saturated C5 isoprene). Both of these analogues were mannosylated by the trypanosomal Dol-P-Man synthetase, but the products (didehydrofarnesol-P-[3H]Man and isoamyl-P-[3H]Man) were unable to act as donors for the trypanosomal Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase. Although the addition of exogenous dolichol phosphate increased the amount of Dol-P-[3H]Man, the synthesis of [3H]Man-labeled GPI intermediates was not affected. Thus, under the conditions of the assay, the levels of Dol-P-[3H]Man generated in the cell-free system appear to exceed the requirements of the GPI biosynthetic pathway, and the addition of exogenous dolichol phosphate is not required.Several synthetic compounds were tested for their ability to act as acceptors for the Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase. As expected, synthetic GlcN-PI (i.e. the natural acceptor) was a good acceptor, and the enzyme showed selectivity for the D-myo-inositol component (Fig. 3and Fig. 4). The selectivity of the Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase toward the D-myo-inositol component suggests that the orientation of one or more hydroxyl groups and/or the spatial orientation of the phosphatidyl moiety (relative to α-D-GlcN) are crucial for acceptor substrate recognition. Such substrate specificity suggests that the Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase activity is truly specific for the GPI pathway.The 6-fold increase in acceptor activity of GlcNAc-PI over GlcN-PI was unexpected, since GlcNAc-PI is thought to require prior de-N-acetylation to GlcN-PI in order to function as a substrate for the first mannosyltransferase (Englund, 1993; Stevens, 1995; Takeda and Kinoshita, 1995). The fact that all of the GPI products from Man-GlcN-PI were sensitive to nitrous acid deamination (a reaction that requires a free NH2 group on the GlcN residue) indicates that GlcNAc-PI was either de-N-acetylated before mannosylation or quantitatively de-N-acetylated immediately afterwards. The latter course seems unlikely since exogenous GlcNAc-PI does not require prior mannosylation to be a substrate for the de-N-acetylase (Doering et al., 1989), and the in situ generation of Dol-P-Man does not stimulate the de-N-acetylation of exogenous GlcNAc-PI (Sharma and Ferguson, unpublished data). Assuming that de-N-acetylation of GlcNAc-PI normally precedes mannosylation, the enhanced acceptor activity of GlcNAc-PI over GlcN-PI suggests that the GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase and the Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase are associated in a complex that allows a degree of substrate channelling from the de-N-acetylase to the acceptor site of the mannosyltransferase. The fact that the product (Manα1-4GlcN-PI) of Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase activity is always further processed to later GPI intermediates (see Fig. 3and Table 2) suggests that other enzymes of the pathway are also physically associated in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with these enzymes. The existence of such a complex could explain the lability of the pathway to detergents above their CMC values. The possibility that the first step of the GPI pathway (i.e. the transfer of GlcNAc to PI) in mammalian (Takeda and Kinoshita, 1995) and yeast (Leidich et al., 1995) cells also involves a complex is supported by the fact that at least three separate gene products are required for this step.The inability of Glc-PI and 2-deoxy-Glc-PI to act as acceptors suggests that the NH2 group of the GlcN residue is necessary for acceptor activity. Neither of these compounds inhibited the mannosylation of GlcN-PI, suggesting that they do not bind significantly to the active site of Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase. It is possible that the NH2 group of GlcN-PI is required to form either a salt bridge to a negatively charged residue on the enzyme or a hydrogen bond to a residue in or near the active site. Such a model would explain the requirement for de-N-acetylation prior to mannosylation and also suggests that de-N-acetylation of GlcNAc-PI may be an important control point in GPI biosynthesis. Such control might be exercised in the mammalian GPI pathway, where stimulation of a comparable enzyme by GTP has been demonstrated (Stevens, 1993). We find no such GTP effect for the trypanosomal de-N-acetylase (Milne et al., 1994). 4D. Sharma, T. K. Smith, and M. A. J. Ferguson, unpublished results.However, these parasites synthesize a significant excess of GPI precursors over that required for protein anchorage (Masterson and Ferguson, 1991; Ralton et al., 1993) and may regulate the GPI pathway via catabolism (Güther et al., 1994).GlcN-Ino-P-glycerol, which lacks the two fatty-acid components of the natural substrate, was a much less efficient acceptor than GlcN-PI (Fig. 4). This suggests that the lipid moiety has a role either in substrate recognition or, more likely, in presenting the substrate to the membrane-bound enzyme. The removal of the glycerol component (as in GlcN-Ino-P) or the glycerol-phosphate component (as in GlcN-Ino) further reduced the acceptor activity, whereas GlcN-Ino-1,2-P had hardly any detectable acceptor activity. Thus, a phospho group at C-1 of the D-myo-inositol appears to play a role in substrate recognition, unless it involves the C-2 hydroxyl group in the formation of a cyclic phosphate, as is the case with GlcN-Ino-1,2-P. The notion that the C-2 hydroxyl group of myo-inositol is involved in substrate recognition is supported by the observation that trypanosomes do not acylate this position until after the first Man residue has been added (Güther and Feguson, 1995). This contrasts with observations made with mammalian and yeast cells where acylation of the C-2 hydroxyl group of myo-inositol appears to precede all mannosylations (Stevens, 1995). Thus, the parasite Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase may have a different, and potentially exploitable, acceptor substrate specificity to those of the comparable mammalian and yeast enzymes.The ability of GlcN-Ino and GlcNAc-Ino (but not GlcN or GlcNAc) to act as weak acceptors for the Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase suggests that the minimum structural features for acceptor substrate recognition are present within the structure GlcN-Ino. Furthermore, the products generated from these acceptors by the cell-free system included substantial quantities of Man3-GlcN-Ino, suggesting that Man-GlcN-Ino and Man2-GlcN-Ino contain sufficient structural information for recognition by the second and third α-mannosyltransferases, respectively, of the GPI pathway. The salient features recognized within GlcN-Ino will be investigated using synthetic analogues having hydroxyl group deletions or substitutions on the D-GlcN and D-myo-inositol residues. The 5-fold decrease in acceptor activity of GlcN-Ino-P-glycerol, compared with GlcN-PI, suggests that the presence of a hydrophobic group in a similar location to the diacylglycerol group of GlcN-PI might usefully increase the presentation of potential inhibitors to the enzyme. The inclusion of a phosphodiester group at C-1 of the myo-inositol ring might also be advantageous with regard to binding potential inhibitors to the enzyme, although it might be difficult for such compounds to cross the cell membrane.

They anchor proteins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and may be associated with other functions, such as signal transduction and protein targeting. The structure, biosynthesis, and function of GPI anchors have been reviewed, most recently by Englund(1993), McConville and Ferguson(1993), Stevens(1995), Udenfriend and Kodukula(1995), and Takeda and Kinoshita(1995).The tsetse fly-transmitted African trypanosomes, which cause human sleeping sickness and a variety of livestock diseases, are able to survive in the mammalian bloodstream by virtue of their dense cell-surface coat. This coat consists of 10 million copies of a 55-kDa GPI-anchored glycoprotein called the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) (Cross, 1990). The relative abundance of the VSG protein in Trypanosoma brucei renders this organism extremely useful for the study of GPI anchor biosynthesis. The structure of the VSG GPI anchor is known (Ferguson et al., 1988), and the principal features of the GPI biosynthetic pathway in trypanosomes were elucidated using a cell-free system based on washed trypanosome membranes (Masterson et al., 1989, 1990; Menon et al., 1990a). The first step in the pathway involves the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to endogenous phosphatidylinositol (PI), via a sulfydryl-dependent GlcNAc transferase (Milne et al., 1992) to form GlcNAc-PI, which is rapidly de-N-acetylated (Doering et al., 1989) to give glucosaminyl PI (GlcN-PI). Three α-Man residues are sequentially transferred onto GlcN-PI from dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) (Menon et al., 1990b) to produce the intermediate Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1-4GlcN-PI (Man3GlcN-PI). All of the mannosylated intermediates can be found in both acylated and nonacylated inositol forms, and a Man3GlcN-(acyl)PI species appears to be the preferred substrate for ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) addition (Güther and Ferguson, 1995), the donor for which is phosphatidylethanolamine (Menon and Stevens, 1992; Menon et al., 1993). The EtNP-Man3GlcN-(acyl)PI (glycolipid C′) species is then deacylated to form glycolipid A′, which undergoes a series of fatty acid remodeling reactions (Masterson et al., 1990) in which the fatty acids of the PI moiety are removed and replaced with myristate to yield the mature GPI precursor glycolipid A. This mature precursor is transferred to the VSG polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum in exchange for a carboxyl-terminal GPI signal peptide, reviewed by Udenfriend and Kodukula(1995).The GPI biosynthetic pathways in mammalian cells (Sugiyama et al., 1991; Lemansky et al., 1991, Hirose et al., 1991, 1992a, 1992b; Kamitani et al., 1992; Puoti et al., 1991; Puoti and Conzelmann, 1992, 1993; Mohney et al., 1994) and yeast (Costello and Orlean, 1992; Sipos et al., 1994), as well as in other protozoa, such as Toxoplasma (Tomavo et al., 1992a, 1992b) and Plasmodium falciparum (Gerold et al., 1994), appear to be broadly similar to that described above for the bloodstream form of T. brucei. Some notable differences among the trypanosomal, mammalian, and yeast GPI pathways include the almost quantitative acylation of all mammalian and yeast GPI intermediates from GlcN-PI onwards and the addition of extra ethanolamine phosphate groups to the mammalian intermediates. The fatty acid remodeling reactions, as described above, appear to be unique to the bloodstream form of African trypanosomes.In this paper, we show that exogenously added GlcN-PI and analogues thereof can prime the GPI pathway in a trypanosome cell-free system, thereby providing a convenient means for probing the substrate specificity of Dol-P-Man:GlcN-PI α1-4-mannosyltransferase, the first mannosyltransferase of the GPI biosynthetic pathway."

In the adrenal gland essential steroid hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens are produced. Cortisol, the major glucocorticoid in humans, is synthesized in the zona fasciculata/reticularis under control of pituitary derived adrenocorticotropic hormone, whereas the most potent mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is secreted from zona glomerulosa cells primarily in response to angiotensin II and potassium(1.Parker K.L.

Keeping this in mind, we carried out a computer-based sequence and structure alignment with three of the four by now crystallized P450 proteins, namely P450cam from Pseudomonas putida(16.Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 697-700Crossref Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), P450BM3 from Bacillus megaterium(17.Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A.

We performed site-directed mutagenesis on a region supposedly analogous to the P450cam I-helix and subsequent analyses of the mutants by transient transfection experiments using COS-1 cells. This led to the identification of mutant P450aldo proteins having dramatically increased 11β-hydroxylase activity, which in the P450aldo wild type protein is considerably lower than in the P45011β wild type protein(19.Curnow K.M.

COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Culture media and antibiotics were from Seromed (Berlin), and fetal bovine serum was from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer at BioTez (Berlin). Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, T4 polynucleotide kinase, bovine alkaline phosphatase, T4 DNA ligase, and DH5α cells were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. or Boehringer Mannheim. Taq polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer. pALTER-1 plasmid, helper phage R408, JM109, and ES1301 mutS cells were obtained as part of the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega Co., Madison, WI). pRc/CMV was from Invitrogen, and pBS SK(+) was from Stratagene.

A common 5′-oligonucleotide, 5′-GGGGTCTAGAATGGCACTCAGGGCAAAGGC, harboring an XbaI site and the translation initiation site was used. BamHI-linked 3′-oligonucleotides were 5′-GGGCCGGATCCCTACAGGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGTTAATCGCTCTGAAAGTGAG for CYP11B2 and 5′-GGGCCGGATCCTTACAGGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGTTGATGGCTCTGAAGGTGAG for CYP11B1.

The 1548-base pair fragments were subcloned into pBS SK(+) to yield pBS-B1-ha and pBS-B2-ha. pRc/CMV was digested with Bsp120I, blunted with Klenow fragment from DNA-polymerase I and further cut with XbaI to be subsequently ligated with a XbaI/EcoRV fragment from pBS-B1WT and pBS-B2WT, respectively. The sequences were verified by nucleotide sequencing using the chain termination method (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51947) Google Scholar) and the Δ Taq cycle sequencing kit. The XbaI/BamHI fragment from pBS-B2-ha was inserted into the pALTER-1 phagemid and transformed into JM109. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Kunkel et al. (21.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar) following instructions by the supplier (Promega). For the generation of multiple mutants several cycles of the mutagenesis procedure were performed by amp knock-out and tet repair or vice versa using the same vector molecule. The base substitutions were confirmed by sequencing first in pALTER-1 and a second time in pRc/CMV, into which they were inserted. All standard procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al.(22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were maintained at 37°C and 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were done as described by Zuber et al. (23.Zuber M.X. Mason J.I. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) except for some minor modifications. One day prior to transfection cells were plated at a density of 350,000/6-cm dish. For transfection cells were starved for 1 h in medium containing 20 mM HEPES and lacking fetal bovine serum, which then was aspired and substituted for the transfection mixture consisting of 10 μg of P450 expression plasmid, 5 μg of pBAdx4 (a kind gift from M. Waterman, Nashville, TN), and 0.5 mg of DEAE-dextran (Mr 500,000) in starvation medium. After another incubation of 1 h, chloroquine was added in 2 ml of complete medium to a final concentration of 52 μM, and cells were kept under these conditions for 4 h. Finally, a 2-min treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was carried out; cells were washed twice in Hank's balanced salt solution and grown for 24 h before substrate addition. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h with either [1,2-3H]cortisol or [3H]deoxycorticosterone. For extraction of steroids the medium was combined with 4 volumes of an ethanol/acetone mixture (1:1) and incubated at room temperature(24.Khalil M.W. Walton J.S. J. Endocrinol. 1985; 107: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After pelleting the debris, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and evaporated to the original volume. Steroids were extracted with 2 volumes of methylene chloride, and the organic phase was evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of hexane and centrifuged at maximal speed, giving a small pellet. Then the supernatant was rotated under vacuum to dryness, and the extraction products were redissolved in 150 μl of 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol in hexane. After the addition of a combination of internal steroid standards the samples were subjected to normal phase HPLC using a LichrosorbR Diol column (Merck, Darmstadt, FRG). A gradient solvent system was run starting with 15% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol in n-hexane at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The standards were monitored by UV detection at 254 nm, while the radioactivity was assayed with a Betascan Sc radiation detector fitted to the HPLC. Alternatively, steroids were measured using an ActiveTM aldosterone or ActiveTM cortisol radioimmunoassay. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis was done in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 0.04 units of aprotinin/ml (Sigma) and 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma) for 10 min on ice followed by 6 s of sonication, and lysates were boiled for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204238) Google Scholar), blotted to a nitrocellulose filter, and detected by hybridization with anti-HA or anti-bovine Adx antibodies using the ECL system from Amersham. An initial alignment of the P450aldo and P45011β sequences was performed using HOMOL, a data base created by D. Nelson in which he related 155 different P450 proteins to P450cam. ( 2D. Nelson, personal communication.) The mode of alignment takes the identity and resemblance of single amino acid residues as well as secondary structure predictions into consideration. We added the structural alignments of P450BM3 and P450trep to our assignation in order to increase possible predictions for structural entities in P450aldo and P45011β. Updating of the sequences and further optimization was carried out by hand. In addition, we included the sequences of P450scc, P450arom, and P450aldo/11β from other species by using CLUSTAL. The first amino acid of the different steroidogenic proteins to be considered was the first residue of the mature sequences. Secondary structure is much better conserved in cytochrome P450 proteins than would be expected from an often rather low sequence homology, which in the case of P450aldo and P45011β compared with P450cam ranks around 20%. This observation seems to hold especially true for the characteristic helices A to L. Comparison of the P450aldo and P45011β sequences with each other reveals 29 amino acid deviations in the mature and 32 amino acid deviations in the unprocessed proteins, respectively. Considering the distribution of these mismatches, the alignment (Fig. 1) shows that five of them cluster to a region that could be analogous to the P450cam I-helix. P450BM3 and P450trep also possess the same helical structure as was found in crystallographic investigations and structural alignment to P450cam(17.Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 18.Hasemann C.A. Ravichandran K.G. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1169-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This putative domain in P450aldo and P45011β would be encoded by the second half of exon 5 and the first half of exon 6 of the genes, a region 3′ of amino acid 256, which was reported to be a critical breaking point in the study of hybrid P450aldo and P45011β proteins. The P450aldo portion C-terminal of this residue seems to be important for aldosterone synthase activity(15.Pascoe L. Curnow K.M. Slutsker L. Connell J.M.C. Speiser P.W. New M.I. White P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8327-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Since the I-helix in P450cam, apart from the heme binding site and a region between the B- and C-helices containing Tyr-96(26.Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18842-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contributes to the active site, it also may be, in P450aldo and P45011β, a determinant of substrate binding and specificity. Furthermore, Thr-252 of P450cam is highly conserved in P450 proteins (27.Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 127: 137-221Crossref Google Scholar) and in P450cam was reported to play a critical role in oxygen activation(28.Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibaya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 29.Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30.Raag R. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11420-11429Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Taking all these observations into account, positions 301, 302, 320, and 335 of P450aldo and P45011β could be candidate amino acids for determination of the different regioselectivities in hydroxylation reactions performed by these proteins. Positions 296 and 339 in our analyses did not map to the very 'putative’ I-helix region but should be flanking it (Fig. 1) and thus may have an influence on the positioning of the helix. To obtain full-length fragments of P450aldo and P45011β encoding cDNAs we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on total RNA from a human adrenal gland as described elsewhere(31.Denner K. Vogel R. Schmalix W. Doehmer J. Bernhardt R. Pharmacogenetics. 1995; 5: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The P45011β cDNA sequence corresponded to the one published by Mornet et al.(4.Mornet E. Dupont J. Vitek A. White P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20961-20967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in the P450aldo sequence amino acid 173 was substituted from Arg to Lys, which was also found by Kawamoto et al.(3.Kawamoto T. Mitsuuchi Y. Toda K. Yokoyama Y. Miyahara K. Miura S. Ohnishi T. Ichikawa Y. Nakao K. Imura H. Ulick S. Shizuta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1458-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). After verifying the functionality of both cDNAs by expression studies we further engineered them by adding an HA epitope tag (32.Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) to both C termini in order to enable protein detection in subsequent expression experiments. To investigate the role of the putative I-helix in the regioselectivity of P450aldo- and P45011β-specific hydroxylation reactions, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the P450aldo cDNA. Derived from the alignment studies, the region corresponding to the I-helix in P450cam extends from amino acid 299 to 338 (Fig. 2). This part of the total sequence includes four diverging amino acids at positions 301, 302, 320, and 335, but we also analyzed the role of Lys-296 in our investigations, since also a flanking amino acid could exert an influence on the positioning of the putative I-helix and thereby the regiospecificity of hydroxylation. Mutants were generated using the mutagenic oligonucleotides listed in Table 1. Thus, P450aldo-specific amino acid residues were substituted for P45011β-specific ones, and single, double, and triple replacement mutants of P450aldo were created. To analyze the mutant versus the wild type proteins with respect to their hydroxylation specificities we cotransfected the resultant plasmids together with pBAdx4 into COS-1 cells. Expression of bovine adrenodoxin stimulates the activity of mitochondrial steroidogenic P450 enzymes, since the intrinsic amount of adrenodoxin in COS-1 cells seems inadequate for maximum electron transfer between the reductase and the P450 component of the system(23.Zuber M.X. Mason J.I. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since the level in 11β-hydroxylase activity toward 11-deoxycortisol is the most distinguishing feature of P450aldo and P45011β, transfected cells were first assayed for their ability to convert 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, and subsequently their aldosterone-synthesizing potential was estimated. Incubation with low substrate concentrations (0.25 μM 11-deoxycortisol) did not reveal significant differences among P450aldo and P45011β wild type proteins under the conditions tested. The prior enzyme, although 11β-hydroxylating at a much lower rate than the latter one, was able to convert more than 90% of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol within a 48-h interval. However, using higher substrate concentrations (2.5 to 5 μM), clear differences were observed among P450aldo and P45011β so that intermediate activity mutants could be arranged between a maximal and a minimal limit. These flanking values are indicated in representative HPLC profiles in Fig. 3. In addition, at higher substrate concentrations the endogeneous ability of COS-1 cells to dehydrogenate cortisol to cortisone by the action of an 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase became negligible, and the addition of glycyrrhetinic acid, an inhibitor of this activity, was unnecessary. Each mutant was assayed in cell culture by incubation with [3H]deoxycortisol, and metabolites were either separated on HPLC or quantitated by radioimmune assay. The results are summarized in Fig. 4A. The small cortisol values detected in mock-transfected COS-1 cells were due to the antibody used in radioimmune assays, which exerted a slight cross-reactivity to 11-deoxycortisol. Relative to P450aldo wild type, the activities of the single replacement P450aldo mutants substituted at positions 296 and 335 were only slightly increased, whereas inserting a P45011β residue at position 301, 302, or 320 did enhance the 11β-hydroxylation potential 1.5-2-fold, suggesting that the latter amino acids could be of relative importance for 11β-hydroxylase activity. Combination of single substitutions resulting in double and triple replacement mutants, however, did lead to much stronger effects. Triple mutant L301P/E302D/A320V, showing the most pronounced increase in 11β-hydroxylation, accounted for about 85% of the P45011β wild type activity. Also the combined substitutions L301P and A320V did result in an activity enhanced to 60% as compared with P45011β wild type. Because of the dual ability of the P450aldo wild type enzyme to produce both cortisol and aldosterone in vitro we investigated aldosterone synthase activity in this set of P450aldo mutants. The primary question was whether one of the two activities (cortisol synthesis) could be increased without affecting the other activity (aldosterone synthesis) or whether there is a reciprocal behavior to be found, meaning no increase in one activity without loss in the other. Examination of the aldosterone-synthesizing abilities of the mutants showed that triple mutant L301P/E302D/A320V only retained about 10% and double mutant L301P/A320V about 13% of the P450aldo wild type activity (Fig. 4B). Mutants L301P/E302D and A320V were only slightly compromised in their activities, but the combination of both resulting in the triple mutant synergize drastically to a severe loss in 18-hydroxylation or 18-oxidation activity. Paradoxically, double mutant L301P/E302D was less severely affected in its aldosterone-synthesizing capacity (87% retained as compared with P450aldo wild type) than the respective single mutants. Introducing P45011β residues at positions 296 and 335 decreased activity to about 40% in the single mutants. The combined double mutant is reduced to about 15% in its aldosterone-synthesizing capacity as compared with P450aldo wild type, and additionally substituting Asp at position 335 for Asn totally destroys aldosterone synthase activity. These data show that every alteration made in this region did negatively affect the aldosterone synthase activity of the recombinant enzyme although to a varying degree. To examine protein synthesis in transfected COS-1 cells we performed Western blotting of whole cell extracts. P45011β and P450aldo wild type proteins and the mutants created were detectable to a very similar amount, indicating that the amino acid substitution did not notably impair protein translation and stability (Fig. 5). This, of course, is not a means to distinguish between an apo- and a holoprotein, but one would expect that an apoprotein tends to be malfolded and thus readily would become a target of the mitochondrial degradation machinery. Due to the 11 amino acids comprising the HA tag fused to the C termini of the proteins the molecular masses of the proteins were increased to about 56 kDa as compared with the wild type proteins having molecular masses of 50 and 48.5 kDa, respectively(8.Ogishima T. Shibata H. Shimada H. Mitani F. Suzuki H. Saruta T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10731-10734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences added to the C termini of the two P450 enzymes did not decrease their hydroxylation abilities (data not shown). We also detected the cotransfected bovine adrenodoxin molecule (molecular weight 14 kDa) in the cells, since this also is a critical parameter determining the electron transport of the system and thus hydroxylation efficiency, and we found it to be present in equal amounts (Fig. 5). In pursuing structure to function relationships in mammalian P450 proteins, alignment to the bacterial P450cam and recently also to P450BM3 and P450trep has proved to be a useful approach. However, a relatively low amino acid sequence homology often hampers accurate alignment of specific residues(33.Poulos T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 11-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We therefore benefited from the HOMOL data base developed by D. Nelson, which combines amino acid identities and secondary structure predictions. By including in our alignment also the P450BM3 and P450trep sequences, which (due to the revealed secondary structures) could be structurally aligned"

https://openalex.org/W1498224103,"The regulation of nuclear protein transport by phosphorylation plays a central role in gene expression in eukaryotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2092755401,"We have identified previously two amino acids, one in each of the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of both the α1b-adrenergic receptor and the α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR), that account almost entirely for the selectivity of agonist binding by these receptor subtypes (Hwa, J., Graham, R. M., and Perez, D. M.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23189-23195). Thus reversal of these two residues, from those found in the native receptor of one subtype to those in the other subtype, produces complementary changes in subtype selectivity of agonist binding. Here we show that mutating only one of these residues in either the α1b-AR or the α1b-AR to the corresponding residue in the other subtype (Ala204→ Val for the α1b; Met292→ Leu for the α1b-AR) results in chimeras that are constitutively active for signaling by both the phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 pathways. This is evident by an increased affinity for agonists, increased basal phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 activation, and increased agonist potency. Although mutation of the other residue involved in agonist binding selectivity, to the corresponding residue in the other subtype (Leu314→ Met for the α1b-AR; Val185→ Ala for the α1b-AR) does not alter receptor binding or signaling, per se, when combined with the corresponding constitutively activating mutations, the resulting chimeras, Ala204→ Val/Leu314→ Met (α1b-AR) and Val185→ Ala/Met292→ Leu (α1b-AR), display wild type ligand binding and signaling. A simple interpretation of these results is that the α1b- and α1b-ARs possess residues that critically modulate isomerization from the basal state, R, to the active state R*, and that the native receptor structures have evolved to select residues that repress active state isomerization. It is likely that the residues identified here modulate important interhelical interactions between the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments that inhibit or promote receptor signaling. We have identified previously two amino acids, one in each of the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments of both the α1b-adrenergic receptor and the α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR), that account almost entirely for the selectivity of agonist binding by these receptor subtypes (Hwa, J., Graham, R. M., and Perez, D. M.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23189-23195).

Here we show that mutating only one of these residues in either the α1b-AR or the α1b-AR to the corresponding residue in the other subtype (Ala204→ Val for the α1b; Met292→ Leu for the α1b-AR) results in chimeras that are constitutively active for signaling by both the phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 pathways. This is evident by an increased affinity for agonists, increased basal phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 activation, and increased agonist potency. Although mutation of the other residue involved in agonist binding selectivity, to the corresponding residue in the other subtype (Leu314→ Met for the α1b-AR; Val185→ Ala for the α1b-AR) does not alter receptor binding or signaling, per se, when combined with the corresponding constitutively activating mutations, the resulting chimeras, Ala204→ Val/Leu314→ Met (α1b-AR) and Val185→ Ala/Met292→ Leu (α1b-AR), display wild type ligand binding and signaling. A simple interpretation of these results is that the α1b- and α1b-ARs possess residues that critically modulate isomerization from the basal state, R, to the active state R*, and that the native receptor structures have evolved to select residues that repress active state isomerization. It is likely that the residues identified here modulate important interhelical interactions between the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments that inhibit or promote receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2050425899,"Several lines of evidence indicate that calreticulin has lectin-like properties. As a molecular chaperone, calreticulin binds preferentially to nascent glycoproteins via their immature carbohydrates; this property closely resembles that seen for calnexin, a chaperone with extensive molecular identity to calreticulin. A cell surface form of calreticulin also exhibits lectin-like properties, binding specific oligomannosides including those covalently linked to laminin. In the present study we examined the interaction between calreticulin and laminin by means of surface plasmon resonance. The results show that calreticulin specifically binds to glycosylated laminin but fails to specifically bind tunicamycin-derived unglycosylated laminin or bovine serum albumin. Calreticulin binding to glycosylated laminin requires calcium and is abolished in the presence of EDTA. Scatchard analysis of binding yields an apparent association constant, Ka, of 2.1 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) m-1 while kinetic analysis yields an estimate of the association on rate, (Kassoc), as 2 x 10(5) m-1 s-1. The composite results support calreticulin's lectin-like properties as well as its proposed role in laminin recognition, both in the cell interior and on the cell surface."

The elucidation of the mechanism by which ionizing radiation induces G2 arrest in BCP leukemia cells could lead to a rational design of radiation sensitizers that impair the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage by leukemia cells and improve the outcome after total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. The molecular mechanism by which ionizing radiation induces G2 arrest in the human cell cycle and prevents entry into mitosis has not yet been deciphered, but preliminary evidence suggested that it may involve the inactivation of p34cdc2 kinase by inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation on tyrosine 15(23.Lock R.B.

Recent studies demonstrated that exposure of BCP leukemia cells to γ-rays results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates including p34cdc2 kinase(25.Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Jun, X., Waddick, K.

Furthermore, the protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor herbimycin A was able to prevent radiation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation of p34cdc2-linked histone H1 kinase activity as well as mitotic arrest(25.Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Jun, X., Waddick, K. G., Jin, J., Bolen, J., Uckun, F. M. (1996) Leukemia & Lymphoma, in pressGoogle Scholar), supporting the notion that radiation-induced cell cycle arrest of BCP leukemia cells at G2-M transition is likely triggered by inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 kinase. Several mitotic control genes encoding for protein-tyrosine kinases or protein-tyrosine phosphatases have been shown to coordinately regulate MPF function by altering tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2kinase(30.Lee M.S.

Genetic experiments in fission yeast have shown that the WEE1 kinase negatively regulates mitosis by phosphorylating p34cdc2 on Tyr15, thereby inactivating p34cdc2-cyclin B complex(32.Parker L.

Cell. 1987; 49: 559-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Preliminary genetic studies in fission yeast initially suggested an important role for WEE1 kinase in radiation-induced mitotic arrest at G2-M transition (34.Rowley R. Hudson J. Young P.G. Nature. 1992; 356: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study using Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells lacking functional wee1 gene product provided convincing evidence that fission yeast WEE1 kinase is not required for radiation-induced mitotic arrest(35.Barbet N.C. Carr A.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we detected no increase of human WEE1 kinase activity after radiation of BCP leukemia cells, as measured by autophosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation of (a) recombinant human p34cdc2-cyclin B complex isolated from lysates of insect cells coinfected with recombinant viruses encoding GST-cyclin B and [Arg33]p34cdc2, an inactive mutant of p34cdc2, (b) p34cdc2-cyclin B complex biochemically purified from starfish oocytes, or (c) a synthetic peptide derived from the p34cdc2 amino-terminal region, [Lys19]Cdc2(6-20)NH2(25.Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Jun, X., Waddick, K. G., Jin, J., Bolen, J., Uckun, F. M. (1996) Leukemia & Lymphoma, in pressGoogle Scholar). Human WEE1 kinase isolated from unirradiated or irradiated BCP leukemia cells had minimal PTK activity toward the aforementioned substrates(25.Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Jun, X., Waddick, K. G., Jin, J., Bolen, J., Uckun, F. M. (1996) Leukemia & Lymphoma, in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, the identity of radiation-responsive kinases which inactivate MPF in human BCP leukemia cells remains unknown. Lyn kinase is the predominant PTK in human BCP leukemia cells(36.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Uckun F.M.

The enzymatic activity of Lyn in human BCP leukemia cells is rapidly stimulated by ionizing radiation(38.Jun, X., Biaglow, J. E., Chae-Park, H. J., Jin, J., Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Myers, D. E., Burkhardt, A. L., Bolen, J. B., Uckun, F. M. (1996) Leukemia & Lymphoma, in pressGoogle Scholar). Similarly, exposure of myeloid leukemia cells to ionizing radiation has been reported to cause Lyn kinase activation(39.Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyn kinase was shown to physically associate with p34cdc2 kinase in lysates of irradiated myeloid leukemia cells, however the significance of Lyn kinase activation or its association with p34cdc2 kinase in myeloid cells has not been examined(39.Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.-M. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20739-20743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These recent observations prompted the hypothesis that p34cdc2 kinase may associate with and serve as a substrate for Lyn in BCP leukemia cells. Here, we show that the Lyn kinase associates physically and functionally with p34cdc2 in the cytoplasm of BCP. Immunoblotting of Lyn immune complexes with an anti-p34cdc2-Cter antibody (where Cter indicates COOH terminus) and immunoblotting of p34cdc2 immune complexes with an anti-Lyn antibody provided evidence for an association between Lyn and p34cdc2 kinases in lysates of BCP even before radiation exposure. Irradiation of BCP stimulated the Lyn kinase, and concomitant with Lyn kinase activation following radiation exposure, p34cdc2 became detectable in the Lyn immune complexes as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein substrate. The abundance of the Lyn protein, as estimated by anti-Lyn Western blot analysis, did not change during the course of the experiment, suggesting increased enzymatic activity of Lyn. However, the abundance of the p34cdc2 protein in the same Lyn immune complexes, as determined by anti-Cdc2-Cter Western blot analysis, was significantly increased after radiation exposure, suggesting that enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 which parallels the Lyn activation is at least in part due to radiation-induced promotion of the physical association between Lyn and p34cdc2 in NALM-6 cells. Binding experiments with truncated GST-Lyn fusion proteins suggested a functional role for the SH3 rather than the SH2 domain of Lyn in Lyn-p34cdc2interactions in BCP. The first 27 residues of the unique amino-terminal domain of Lyn were also essential for the ability of GST-Lyn fusion proteins to bind to p34cdc2 from BCP lysates. Lyn kinase immunoprecipitated from lysates of irradiated BCP as well as a full-length GST-Lyn fusion protein-phosphorylated recombinant human p34cdc2 on tyrosine 15. The ability of the Lyn kinase to phosphorylate recombinant human p34cdc2 on Tyr15 was amplified following radiation exposure. Lyn kinase interacts with and tyrosine-phosphorylates p34cdc2in vivo when these kinases are coexpressed in COS-7 cells. Ionizing radiation failed to induce p34cdc2 tyrosine phosphorylation or G2 arrest in Lyn kinase-deficient BCP leukemia cells expressing Fyn, Blk, and Lck kinases. These convergent observations constitute a strong argument for an important role of a cytoplasmic signal transduction pathway intimately linked to the Lyn kinase in radiation-induced G2 phase-specific cell cycle arrest of human BCP leukemia cells. Since the duration of the G2 arrest is a major determinant of radiation resistance in BCP leukemias, this knowledge may lead to the design of a leukemia-specific radiosensitization method. Our findings implicate Lyn as an important cytoplasmic suppressor of p34cdc2 function. Lyn kinase may serve as an integral component of a physiologically important surveillance and repair mechanism for DNA damage by delaying the G2-M transition in cells exposed to mutagenic oxygen free radicals, thereby allowing them to repair their DNA damage prior to mitosis. Lyn kinase may also protect the cell from the potentially catastrophic consequences of premature cytoplasmic p34cdc2 activation by maintaining the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex in its inactive, tyrosine phoshorylated state. NALM-6 pre-B leukemia cells and Lyn kinase-deficient leukemic BCP from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Childrens Cancer Group ALL Biology Reference Laboratory in Minneapolis, MN.

In brief, cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, plus 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM sodium molybdate as phosphatase inhibitors, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors on ice for 30 min. Lysates were spun twice at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C prior to immunoprecipitation. Indicated amounts of the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc2-Cter (10 μg of antibody/200 μg of lysate) or anti-Lyn (2 μl of antibody/200 μg of lysate) overnight at 4°C. The immune complexes were collected with 50 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corp., Cambridge, MA) in Nonidet P-40 buffer. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, resuspended in 2 × SDS reducing sample buffer, and boiled. Samples were run on 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and subsequently immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine (5 μg/ml) or anti-Cdc2-Cter (2 μg/ml) antibodies. 125I-Labeled protein A was used to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins or p34cdc2 kinase. In some experiments, we used immunoblotting with anti-Lyn antibody to detect Lyn kinase in p34cdc2 immune complexes and immunoblotting with anti-Cdc2-Cter antibody to detect p34cdc2 kinase in Lyn immune complexes. Blots were incubated with 1 μCi/ml 125I-labeled protein A (specific activity = 30 μCi/μg; ICN Biomedicals) in blocking solution. After a 30-min incubation in 125I-protein A, blots were washed, as indicated above, dried, and autoradiographed using a XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Molecular masses (in kDa) of the phosphotyrosyl protein substrates were calculated from prestained molecular size markers (Amersham Corp.) that were run as standards. To evaluate the effects of ionizing radiation on the kinase activity of Lyn, exponentially growing cells (5 × 106/ml in α-minimal essential medium) were irradiated and lysed at the indicated time points in a Nonidet P-40 buffer. 200 μg of cell lysates/sample were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-Lyn antibody, as described previously(25.Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Jun, X., Waddick, K.

In initial experiments, kinase reactions consisted of 10 μl of Lyn immunoprecipitate, 5 μl of assay buffer (0.25 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.125 M MgCl2, 0.025 M MnCl2, and 0.25 mM Na3VO4) and 5 μl of 1.5 mM substrate peptide [Lys19]Cdc2(6-20)-NH2 (sequence: KVRKIGEGTYGVVKK) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), a synthetic peptide derived from p34cdc2 kinase. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity = 105 cpm/pmol) and incubation for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of glacial acetic acid, and then 25 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a P-81 phosphocellulose disc. The discs were washed four times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. [Val12,Ser14,Lys19]Cdc2(6-20)-NH2 and [Phe15,Lys19]Cdc2(6-20)-NH2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were included as control peptides. The PTK activity of Lyn toward the Cdc2 peptides was measured by incorporation of 32P into the peptide substrates and expressed as the background-subtracted counts/min or pmol of PO4- incorporated/min. For subsequent experiments, human p34cdc2-cyclin B complex was isolated from lysates (100 μg/sample) of insect cells coinfected with recombinant viruses encoding GST-cyclin B and [Arg33]p34cdc2 using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The in vitro phosphorylation of p34cdc2 by immunoprecipitated Lyn was assayed after a 20-min kinase reaction at 30°C in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 50 μM ATP). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of p34cdc2 (50 μl of the GST-cyclin B-[Arg33]p34cdc2 precipitate/sample) and [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi). Following the kinase reaction, these samples were fractionated on 9.5% polyacrylamide gels, detected by autoradiography and incorporation of 32P was quantitated by a 4-min liquid scintillation counting of excised bands. For phosphoamino acid analysis, protein bands were excised and hydrolyzed, as described previously(25.Tuel-Ahlgren, L., Jun, X., Waddick, K. G., Jin, J., Bolen, J., Uckun, F. M.

For two-dimensional phosphotryptic peptide mapping, 32P-labeled protein bands were excised and subjected to enzymatic digestion with 100 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma) overnight in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Supernatants were dried by centrifugal evaporation, and dried samples were resuspended in 4 μl of a buffer containing 7.8% glacial acetic acid and 2.5% formic acid. Labeled peptides were separated on thin layer phosphocellulose plates (Kodak) by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 for 30 min at 1,000 V, followed by ascending chromatography in a buffer containing 37.5% n-butanol, 7.5% glacial acetic acid, and 25% pyridine. Subsequently, air-dried plates were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Prior to phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic peptide mapping, protein bands of interest were excised and Cerenkov-counted for 32P content. Truncated GST-Lyn fusion proteins corresponding to various domains of Lyn (44.Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Timson-Gauen L.K. Winitz S. Coggeshall K.M. Johnson G.L. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Mol. Cell.

GST-Lyn fusion proteins were non-covalently bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) under conditions of saturating protein. In brief, 25 μg of each fusion protein was incubated with 50 μl of beads for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. Nonidet P-40 lysates of NALM-6 cells were prepared as described above, and 250 μg of the lysate was incubated with 50 μl of fusion protein-coupled beads for 2 h on ice. The fusion protein adsorbates were washed with ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer and resuspended in reducing SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and then fractionated on SDS-PAGE, as described previously(36.Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J.

A highly purified preparation of Lyn was prepared for these experiments by cloning a lyn cDNA (45.Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H.

The ability of GST-Lyn (1:100 dilution) and GST-p49WEE1Hu (1:10 dilution, kindly provided by Dr. Laura Parker) to phosphorylate [Arg33]p34cdc2 was measured in a 20-min kinase reaction at 30°C in kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of p34cdc2 (50 μl/sample) and [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi). Following the kinase reactions, samples were boiled in 2 × SDS reducing sample buffer, and proteins were fractionated on 15% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphotryptic peptide mapping of p34cdc2 kinase were performed as described above. lyn and cdc2 cDNAs were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells by Lipofectamine lipid encapsulation(47.Rowley R.B.

Steady state levels of FN transcripts did not change after treatment of the cells with RA for various times or concentrations, suggesting that RA acts at the translational level. Similar effects were observed in other fibroblasts.In NIH-3T3 cells, RA had distinct effects on different receptors; it down-modulated retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α protein and transcript levels, it up-regulated RARβ transcripts, and it had no effect on RARγ. Transformation of NIH-3T3 cells with an activated Ha-ras oncogene down-modulated RAR expression and abolished responsiveness to RA. We identified the retinoid signal transduction pathways responsible for the effects of RA on FN and RARα proteins by the use of the retinoid X receptor-selective compound, SR11237, by stable overexpression of a truncated form of the RARα gene, RARα403, with strong RAR dominant negative activity, and by overexpression of RARα. We conclude that: 1) RA-dependent FN down-modulation is mediated by RARs, 2) retinoid X receptors mediate the observed reduction of RARα by RA, and 3) the block of RA responsiveness in Ha-ras cells cannot be overcome by overexpression of RARα.These studies have defined fibronectin and RARα as targets of RA in fibroblast cells and have shown that oncogenic transformation renders the cells resistant to RA action.

Distinct RAR- and RXR-dependent gene pathways exist, and individual receptor subtypes may control distinct gene expression patterns by interacting with RAREs, or RXREs, in the promoter region of different responsive genes(3.Pemrick S.M.

RA has proven effective in differentiation therapy of acute promyelocitic leukemia, a disease characterized by a t(15;17) translocation with breakpoint in the RARα gene(5.Bollag W. Holdener E.E. Ann. Oncol. 1992; 3: 513-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In vitro, overexpression of RARα has been shown to suppress transformation by v-myb in monoblasts (6.Smarda J. Sugarman J. Glass C. Lipsick J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2474-2481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by polyoma virus in rat fibroblasts(7.Talmage D.A. Lackey R.S.

FN is a large transformation-sensitive glycoprotein composed of two non identical subunits of 220 kDa. It exists in the extracellular matrix and in soluble form in the plasma. Cellular FN is produced in large amounts by fibroblasts and is implicated in a wide range of cellular processes including cell adhesion, migration, morphology, differentiation, and transformation(14.Hynes R.O. Fibronectin. Springer Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 15.Hynes R.O. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). It is modulated by a variety of effectors including cytokines like transforming growth factor β and hormones like glucorticoids and RA. Loss of cell surface FN is a hallmark of transformation, and it has been correlated with acquisition of tumorigenic and metastatic potential. This effect has been observed with many oncogenic stimuli, among which are the ras oncogenes(14.Hynes R.O. Fibronectin. Springer Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 16.Chandler L.A. Bourgeois S. Cell Growth & Diff. 1991; 2: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Chandler L.A. Ehretsmann C.P. Bourgeois S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3085-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ras genes encodes a 21-kDa plasma membrane protein that binds guanine nucleotides and is involved in signal transduction, cell growth, and differentiation(18.Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Many types of tumors express mutated forms of the ras protein, resulting in constitutive activation of this protein and altered gene expression(18.Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified fibronectin as target of RA action in NIH-3T3 cells but not in ras-transformed fibroblasts. We also identified retinoid receptors involved in this process. NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum, 400 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. Cells were grown to subconfluence and treated with retinoids. Activated Ha-ras-transfected cells were generated and cultured as described(10.Kosa K. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All comparative studies were done with matched pair clones, i.e. all the cells were always transfected with vector plus/minus the activated ras construct. Furthermore identical results were obtained in four NIH-3T3 clones compared to their ras-transformed counterparts. C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured as described(19.Scita G. Wolf G. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Primary mouse skin fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as described(20.Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). RA was obtained from Sigma. The RXR-selective compound, SR11237(21.Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. A. Levin (Hoffman La Roche). RA and SR11237 were dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mM and in ethanol at 1 mM, respectively. The maximum concentration of the solvent used was 0.03% for Me2SO and 0.1% for ethanol. Subconfluent fibroblasts were incubated in presence of the media containing the required retinoids, and these media were replaced daily. For the last 16 h the cells were serum-starved by adding serum-free media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, with or without the effectors. RA- and Me2SO-treated cells were washed with PBS and serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10% of the normal level of methionine and cysteine was added. Cells were preincubated for 1 h before adding 80 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine protein labeling mixture (DuPont NEN). After 20 min of incubation, the cell monolayers were washed with cold PBS and lysed with buffer A (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μM leupeptin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g × 5 min at 4°C, and the insoluble pellets were discarded. Volumes containing equal amounts of radioactivity (precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid) were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Polyclonal rabbit mouse FN antibodies (5 μl) were added. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, 25 μl of prewashed Pansorbin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added and the samples were incubated overnight at 4°C on a rotary shaker. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), solubilized in SDS loading buffer, and loaded onto 4-15% polyacrylamide gels(22.Scita G. Wolf G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The reduced level of newly synthesized FN in RA-treated cells may be due to either a reduced rate of biosynthesis or an increased turnover rate. To explore these possibilities we performed pulse/chase experiments. Fibroblasts were pulsed for 20 min with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and chased with unlabeled amino acids. At the indicated time points, the cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin for 5 min to remove extracellular and cell surface FN. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor. The cells were washed with cold PBS containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, lysed in buffer B, and analyzed for labeled FN by immunoprecipitation. To determine intracellular Fn levels, retinoid- and Me2SO-treated cells were washed and trypsinized as described in the pulse/chase section. Cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer without reducing agent and bromphenol blue. Lysates were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged to get rid of insoluble cell debris. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (23.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C.

Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18134) Google Scholar) (Pierce). β-Mercapthanol and saturated solution bromphenol blue were added to the samples at 1% and 3% final concentrations, respectively. Equal amounts of protein were then loaded onto 4-15% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) on a Bio-Rad electroblot apparatus. The membranes were stained with Ponceau stain. The blots were incubated overnight at 4°C in 5% milk in TTBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Rabbit polyclonal mouse FN antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used at 1:1250 dilution in TTBS, and blots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. They were rinsed four times with TTBS, and incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Corp.) at 1:5000 dilution in TTBS. The blots were washed five times before determining immunoreactivity by a chemiluminescent method using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham). Rabbit polyclonal mouse collagen type IV and laminin antibodies were from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). For the detection of RARα and γ proteins, total SDS lysates were prepared from cells washed twice with ice-cold PBS, as described above, except for the trypsin treatment. Proteins were boiled and run immediately on 10% polyacrylamide gels. They were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were then blocked overnight in 5% milk in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl). Polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl termini of RARs from Dr. Chambon's laboratory (24.Gaub M.P. Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Ali S. Matthes H. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Exp.

The blots were rinsed and washed five times in buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing a 1:3000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG. The final wash sequence was three washes with buffer C and two washes with buffer D (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20)(26.Ali M. Torian B.E. Vedeckis W.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Blots were developed with ECL. For stable transfection of RARα cDNA, the fibroblasts were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish 24 h before transfection in regular DMEM medium. Ten μg of the expression plasmid pSG5-RARαf (27.Brand N.J. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6799-6806Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of the dominant selective vector pSVneo (28.Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) were cotransfected using the Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) methods according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control cells were transfected with 10 μg of pSG5 empty vector and 1 μg of pSVneo vector. G418-resistant colonies were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418, and positive clones (overexpressing RARα protein) were isolated and expanded. Isolation of total RNA was performed by using a Total RNA isolation kit (Tel-Test “b” Inc., Friendswood, TX). The full-length fragments of the mouse RARs were excised from the expression plasmid pSG5-RAR(29.Zelent A. Krust A. Petkovich M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 339: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 30.Petkovich M. Brand N.J. Krust A. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 330: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). The 1.4-kilobase human Fn fragment was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using random primer labeling methods. Total RNA (40 μg) was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted overnight onto Schleicher & Schuell nitrocellulose. The membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 65°C in a buffer of 5 × SSC, pH 7.0, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.05 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 20 μg/ml poly(A)n, 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured torula yeast RNA. The probes (2 × 106 cpm/ml) were boiled and added to the hybridization buffer (5 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.02 M sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 20 μg/ml poly(A)n, 0.2 mg/ml denatured sperm DNA, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured yeast RNA. The membranes were hybridized for 18 h at 65°C, followed by two washes with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and two with 0.1 × SSC, 0.15% SDS at 65°C. Autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat AR film used double intensifying screens. In order to reprobe the membranes with labeled GAPDH, the blots were first stripped in 1% glycerol at 85°C for 5 min. Densitometric evaluation of Northern blots was performed with NIH Image 1.52 software (created by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health) running on a Macintosh Centris 650 using an XC-77/77CE CCD video camera module. The retroviral vector LRARα403SN, in which a truncated RARα gene is inserted into the retroviral vector LXSN, was a gift from Dr. S. J. Collins(31.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R.

The next day, they were infected with the LXSN and LXRARαSN retroviral vector in presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene(31.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced and cells were grown for 36-48 h before G418 (1 mg/ml) was added. G418-resistant cells were isolated. β-RARE-tk-LUC was a gift from Dr. S. Minucci (National Institutes of Health)(33.Minucci S. Zand D.J. Dey A. Marks M.S. Nagata T. Grippo J.F. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts (1.5 × 105/dish) were seeded in 35-mm dishes. After 24 h, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of the β-RARE-tk-LUC and 1 μg of the cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase reporter (34.MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine reagent. Six hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% serum for 16 h. The cells were treated with 2 μM RA or solvent (Me2SO) for 24 h. Cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was determined in 1 μg of protein from each sample using the luciferase assay system from Promega in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). β-Galactosidase activity was quantified by the FluoReporter LacZ/Galactosidase kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). FN levels were markedly reduced by RA in pSVneo, but not in Ha-ras-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). The effect was specific for FN, since neither collagen type IV nor laminin B1 and B2 chains (the only ones to be detected in NIH-3T3 cells) were affected. RA inhibition of FN was time-dependent (Fig. 1B) and concentration-dependent (Fig. 1C). A 3-fold reduction of intracellular FN was already observed after 12 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). RA caused a 90% down-regulation at 2 × 10−6M. RA-treated cells were metabolically labeled with a mixture of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with specific anti-FN antibodies. The choice of the labeling time was crucial because FN takes about 30 min to reach the cell surface from the cytosolic site of synthesis (data not shown and (35.Olden K. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1977; 11: 957-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). RA inhibited the newly synthesized FN in a time-dependent fashion. An 80% reduction was observed after 4 h of RA treatment (Fig. 2A). In pulse/chase experiments, the rate of disappearance of labeled FN was not altered by RA treatment of the cells (Fig. 2B). The time required to reduce the amount of 35S-FN by 50% was 28 ± 2 and 31 ± 3 min in RA- and Me2SO-treated cells, respectively. Therefore, a reduction of FN biosynthetic rate likely accounts for the effects of RA. Northern blots of total cellular RNA from RA-treated and control cells were hybridized to FN and GAPDH probes. The FN mRNA band intensities, which represent relative steady-state level, were normalized to GAPDH mRNA band intensities. The results (Fig. 3) reveal that the accumulated levels of FN mRNA were not altered either by different RA concentration or by times of RA treatment. RA failed to alter FN mRNA in Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cells. In pSVneo NIH-3T3 cells, RARα transcripts were constitutively expressed and slightly (30%) down-regulated by RA (data not shown). RARγ mRNAs were expressed to a lower extent than RARα mRNAs and were not substantially altered by RA. RARβ transcripts were induced in pSVneo cells to a similar extent (data not shown) as in primary mouse skin fibroblasts(36.Tsou H.C. Lee X. Si S.P. Peacocke M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cells, the levels of RARs mRNA were generally lower than in control cells and were not responsive to RA treatment. RARα protein levels were strongly down-regulated by RA in NIH-3T3 cells, but not in Ha-ras cells (Fig. 4A). RARγ proteins were not altered by RA in either type of cells and could be detected only after overexposing the blots (data not shown). We were unable to detect RARβ proteins. The effect of RA on the levels of RARα protein was time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 4B). A concentration of 0.1 nM RA was sufficient to bring about a 80% inhibition of RARα protein, and a 40% inhibition could be already observed after 2 h of RA treatment. We investigated the effects of RA on FN and RARα proteins in C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts and in primary mouse skin fibroblasts. RA markedly reduced the level of FN and RARα in these two cells (Fig. 5). SR11237, an RXR-selective compound, specifically activates reporter genes fused to the RXR-responsive element of the CRBPII promoter, to which only RXR-RXR homodimers bind, and is unable to induce genes driven by an RAR-responsive element, like the RARE of RARβ and CRBPI(21.Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The RAR-mediated signaling pathways can be blocked by overexpressing a mutated form of the RARα gene, RARα403, which shows strong dominant negative activity(31.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32.Damm K. Heyman R.A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2989-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The truncated form of the RARα gene, RARα403, inserted into the retroviral vector LXRARαSN and the corresponding control retrovirus LXSN were used. We infected NIH-3T3 cells with these amphotrophic retroviruses containing the neomycin resistance gene. Neomycin-resistant cells were isolated and expanded. Northern blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of the typical 4.7-kilobase retroviral transcripts containing the RARα403 mRNA (Fig. 6). The dominant negative activity of such mutated receptor was confirmed in RARα403 NIH-3T3 cells by transient reporter assays. LXSN control and LXRARα403SN NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected with a vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene fused to two copies of the RARE of RARβ2 gene(33.Minucci S. Zand D.J. Dey A. Marks M.S. Nagata T. Grippo J.F. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RA-dependent transactivation of luciferase was then evaluated. Cells overexpressing RARa403 transcripts showed an almost negligible 1.2-fold induction of luciferase activity in comparison to a 5-fold induction in control LXSN cells (Fig. 6B). Similar data were obtained by others in tk-NIH-3T3 cells infected with the very same retroviral vectors(31.Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Heyman R. Damm K. Evans R. Collins S.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RA failed to down-regulate the intracellular FN levels in the LXRARα403SN cells (Fig. 7B, left panel). Furthermore, the RXR-selective compound, SR11237, also failed to reduce FN protein (Fig. 7B, right panel). These results indicate that an RAR-mediated signaling pathway likely accounts for the RA-dependent FN down-regulation. Similar experiments were performed, looking at the RA modulation of RARα (Fig. 7A). In LXRARαSN NIH-3T3, treatment with RA caused a marked reduction of the levels of RARα, ruling out the involvement of RAR signal transduction pathways. This finding was strengthened by the inhibition of RARα in cells treated with SR11237 to a similar extent as that achieved by RA treatment (Fig. 7A, right panel). This suggests the involvement of RXR in this effect. To further investigate the role of RARs, we generated cell lines overexpressing the RARα gene. Cotransfections of NIH-3T3 cells with the plasmid pSVneo, harboring the neomycin resistance gene, and the pSG5RARaf vector, containing the full-length RARα gene, were performed. G418-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and tested for RARα protein overexpression. Two representative clones are shown in Fig. 8. Both express very high levels of RARα protein, however, the levels of RARα were down-modulated by RA only in clone 3A. Along the same trend, when FN sensitivity to RA was determined, RA failed to reduce the level of FN in the resistant clone. A similar series of experiments was performed in Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cells. Since the levels of RARs were generally lower than in control cells, we generated Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cell lines, which overexpressed RARα. The RA effects on FN biosynthesis were evaluated. Overexpression of RARα protein was not sufficient to overcome the block on RA responsiveness (Fig. 9A). Similarly, disruption of the RAR signaling pathways by the introduction of the dominant negative RAR construct, RARα403, into Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cells, was ineffective in altering the responsiveness of FN protein to RA. We have identified FN as a molecule whose biosynthesis is down-regulated by RA in normal, but not in Ha-ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells. The inhibition of FN biosynthesis by RA is specific, as neither collagen type IV nor laminin were affected by RA, and is RA dose- and time-dependent. Two lines of evidence suggest that RA acts on FN at a post-transcriptional level. First, the rate of newly synthesized intracellular FN is reduced by RA treatment, an event not due to an increased FN turnover rate. Second, RA did not alter the levels of FN transcripts, consistent with the absence of RARE or RXRE in the promoter region of the FN gene(37.Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38.Nakajima T. Nakamura T. Tsunoda S. Nakada S. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2837-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Effects of RA in other cell systems have been reported. FN mRNA and protein levels were increased in primary hepatocytes from vitamin A-deficient rats, while RA treatment caused a reduction of FN mRNA and protein levels(39.Kim H.Y. Wolf G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 365-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells, a complex RA-dependent regulation of FN was observed as the cell surface levels increased, while intracellular FN and FN mRNA decreased after RA(19.Scita G. Wolf G. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RA generally controls gene expression at the transcriptional level. However, lipoprotein lipase enzyme expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was down-regulated, but mRNA levels were not affected by RA treatment (40.Kamei Y. Kawada T. Fujita A. Etinne J. Noe L. Sugimoto E. Biochem. Int. 1992; 26: 923-934PubMed Google Scholar). RA induction of differentiation of F9 cells is achieved by controlling the expression of various genes. Early responsive genes are thought to be transcriptionally regulated, while late responsive genes may be controlled both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels(41.Gudas L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Laminin biosynthesis is switched on, while synthesis and secretion of FN is switched off by RA treatment of F9 cells (42.Cooper A.R. Taylor A. Hogan B.L. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43.Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R.

Biol. 1987; 122: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transformation of NIH-3T3 cells with an activated ras caused RARα and γ to be expressed to lower levels than in normal cells, while RA induction of RARβ was absent. In addition to specific mutations in the RARα gene(5.Bollag W. Holdener E.E. Ann. Oncol. 1992; 3: 513-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), alteration of the expression of RARs by transformation or in tumor derived cells has been reported. In lung cancer cells, RARα and γ and RXRs were well expressed; however, RA induction of RARβ was not observed(45.Zhang X.K. Liu Y. Lee M.O. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells were insensitive to RA inhibition of cell growth, probably due to a low level of RARα expression(46.van de Leede B.M. Folkers G.E. van den Brink C.E. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes infected by v-rasHa showed lower levels of RARα and γ proteins, which is accompanied by a reduction in RA- induction of reporter genes fused to a RARE. ( 2G. Scita, N. Darwiche, E. Greenwald, M. Rosenberg, K. Politi, and L. M. De Luca, manuscript in preparation.) The molecular mechanism of this down-regulation is not known yet, but it could have important implications in explaining the variability in RA responsiveness of different tumor cells. RARα protein is down-modulated by RA in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in NIH-3T3 cells. The modest inhibition (30%) of RARα mRNA is in agreement with various reports in different cell lines and tissues, which, however, had exclusively focused on the effect of RA at the level of transcripts (36.Tsou H.C. Lee X. Si S.P. Peacocke M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 47.Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.The H.D. Marchio A. Tiollais P. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1995; 8: 429-433Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). More recently, RA-dependent down-modulation of RARα proteins was reported in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells(46.van de Leede B.M. Folkers G.E. van den Brink C.E. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of retinoid receptors by RA has long been known, and one of the first RARE was found in the promoter region of the RARβ gene(49.de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). This work also shows that the RA-dependent down-modulation of intracellular FN appears to be RAR-mediated. The introduction of a mutated RARα gene, which has strong dominant negative activity and blocks the RAR-mediated signaling pathways, abolished the RA inhibition of FN. Furthermore the RXR-selective compound, SR11237, was unable to mimic the action of RA on the intracellular FN. We conclude that RARα down-modulation by RA is likely mediated by RXRs, since RA reduces RARα levels, even when we blocked RAR-mediated signaling pathways by the overexpression of the RAR dominant negative gene, RARα403. In addition the RXR-selective retinoid, SR11237, is as powerful as RA in down-regulating RARα protein. In our RARα overexpression studies we isolated a clone, 13A, which appeared to be insensitive to RA in that the two gene products, FN and RARα, were not responsive to RA. The mechanism of the observed RA resistance is not clear. We showed that action of RA on FN is mediated by RAR and is dependent on RXR/RAR heterodimer, while RARα inhibition by RA is likely mediated by RXR/RXR homodimer. The fact that RA resistance is observed for both gene products argues against a defect localized entirely on the RAR signaling pathway. If this were the case, RARα protein expression should have remained sensitive to RA effects. Introduction of an activated ras alters the responsiveness to RA and the level of expression of RARs. Manipulation of RAR protein levels was utilized in an attempt to correlate these two observations. Overexpression of the RARα gene in Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cells was not sufficient to overcome the block in FN and RARα (data not shown) responsiveness. Failure to regain RA sensitivity after constitutively expressing RARβ in lung cancer cells has been reported (45.Zhang X.K. Liu Y. Lee M.O. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar). RA-dependent induction of a luciferase reporter gene fused to the RARE of the RARβ promoter was equally or more efficient in Ha-ras NIH-3T3 than in normal cells (data not shown). Caution should be used in evaluating the physiological relevance of reporter gene assays, because the RARE is taken out of the context of its natural promoter. Swisshelm et al.(50.Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Lee X. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Sagar R. Cell Growth & Diff. 1995; 5: 133-143Google Scholar) showed that when a 1.5-kilobase region of the RARβ2 promoter was used in reporter gene constructs, instead of the RARE, suppression of RA-induced activation was detected in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The observation that β-RARE-tk-LUC can be activated in Ha-ras NIH-3T3 cells suggests that necessary factors for activating βRARE are functional. The level of retinoid receptor expression often does not correlate with RA-responsiveness. RARα was expressed in most leukemia cells whether or not they were responsive to RA(51.Gallagher R.E. Said F. Pua I. Papenhausen P.R. Paietta E. Wiernik P.H. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 789-795PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Largment C. Detmer K. Corral J.C. Hack F.M. Lawrence H.J.

In melanomas, the level of RARβ and RARγ were similar in RA-sensitive and -resistant cells (54.Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings and the observed failure of RARα overexpression to confer RA responsiveness to Ha-ras cells suggests that other factors are required to mediate RA action. These factors may be missing or not functional after ras transformation. We thank Dr. Steven J. Collins for the retroviral construct LRARα403SN and for reviewing the manuscript prior to submission.

Steady-state lysyl oxidase mRNA levels decreased to 30% of control after 24 h of treatment with 1 and 10 nM bFGF. This regulation was time-dependent. COL1A1 mRNA levels declined to less than 10% of control after 24 h of bFGF treatment.

Treating nickel-deficient CODH with NiCl2 produces an activated form of the enzyme that contains 1 mol of nickel/mol of enzyme and exhibits the same level of CO-oxidation activity as CODH purified from cells grown on nickel-supplemented medium (holo-CODH)(9.Ensign S.A. Campbell M.J. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2162-2168Google Scholar). carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid watt(s). Holo-CODH contains only two metal centers, which have been designated as the B-center and C-center. Similar metal centers are also found in CODHs from methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria, including the well studied CODH from Clostridium thermoaceticum(10.Ragsdale S.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Annual Reviews Inc., Palo Alto, CA1995: 305-333Google Scholar). The C-center, which serves as the CO-oxidation site(16.Anderson M.E. DeRose V.J. Hoffman B.M. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12204-12205Google Scholar, 17.Anderson M.E. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1702-8711Google Scholar, 18.Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Liu L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Google Scholar), is composed of an [Fe4S4]2+ cluster (22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar) that is linked to nickel by an unidentified bridging ligand, X (Ni-X-[Fe4S4]2+) (19.Seravalli J. Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7879-7888Google Scholar, 20.Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Google Scholar, 21.Qiu D. Kumar M. Ragsdale S.W. Spiro T.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2653-2654Google Scholar). The B-center consists solely of a standard [Fe4S4]2+ cluster (22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar) which mediates electron flow between the C-center and external electron acceptors(8.Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Google Scholar, 17.Anderson M.E. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1702-8711Google Scholar, 18.Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Liu L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11646-11647Google Scholar). Nickel-deficient CODH, which can only be obtained in R. rubrum, has the B-center and a [Fe4S4]2+ cluster (referred to as the C*-center) that is a precursor to the C-center of holo-CODH. The Fe4S4 clusters of nickel-deficient CODH cannot be reduced by CO(20.Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Google Scholar). Four states of the C-center of holo-CODH have been characterized (Table 1, Fig. 1) ((8.Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Google Scholar) and references within). Cred2 and Cs=3/2 have electronic spins S = and S =, respectively, and result from the reduction of holo-CODH with CO or dithionite. Cred2 and Cs=3/2 are replaced by a second S = form, Cred1, and a diamagnetic form, Cox, by the oxidation of CO- or dithionite-reduced holo-CODH with the redox dye indigo carmine (E′o = −125 mV). Oxidation with thionin (E′o = 56 mV) fully converts the C-center to the Cox form which is EPR silent. If all states of the C-center contain Ni(II)(20.Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Google Scholar), then Cred1, Cs=3/2 and Cred2 appear to be one-electron reduced forms of Cox(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar). Cred2, however, has been proposed to be three electrons more reduced than Cox, therefore Cred2 may contain a more reduced form of nickel(11.Lindahl P.A. Münck E. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3873-3879Google Scholar).Tabled 1Figure 1:Model for the redox states of the B- and C-centers of R. rubrum CODH. Approximate midpoint potentials of the redox couples are centered between their vertical positions in the figure. The Cox/Cred1 couple undergoes a reversible one-electron redox reaction with a midpoint potential of −110 mV. Cox/Cs=3/2 appear to be separated by one electron with a midpoint potential below −400 mV. Cred2 may be one or three electrons more reduced than Cox. All forms of the C-center are thought to contain Ni(II), with the exception of Cred2 which may contain a more reduced form of nickel in the event that Cred2 is three electrons more reduced than Cox.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The C*-center of nickel-deficient CODH is stable in two forms (Table 1, Fig. 1)(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar). The C*red state, with electronic spin S =, is a one-electron reduced form of the C*-center observed following reduction of nickel-deficient CODH with dithionite. The EPR signal originating from C*red has broad resonances in the g = 4-6 region. This signal is very similar to the Cs=3/2 EPR signal of holo-CODH. Following oxidation of reduced, nickel-deficient CODH with indigo carmine or thionin, the C*red state is completely converted by a one-electron oxidation to the diamagnetic C*ox form. The properties of the B-center in holo-CODH and nickel-deficient CODH are very similar(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar). The B-center is stable in only two forms (Table 1, Fig. 1)(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar). The Bred state develops following the reduction of nickel-deficient CODH with dithionite or the reduction of holo-CODH with CO or dithionite. By oxidizing either form of reduced CODH with indigo carmine or thionin, Bred is completely converted to Box. The reversible oxidation of Bred to Box in holo-CODH was previously shown to be a one-electron process with a midpoint potential of −418 mV(23.Smith E.T. Ensign S.A. Ludden P.W. Feinberg B.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 181-185Google Scholar, 24.Tan G.O. Ensign S.A. Ciurli S. Scott M.J. Hedman B. Holm R.H. Ludden P.W. Korszun Z.R. Stephens P.J. Hodgson K.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4427-4431Google Scholar). A significant problem in studying the nickel-containing CODHs has been that the spin concentrations of the Cred1 (gav = 1.87) and Cred2 (gav = 1.86) EPR-signals vary from one sample preparation to another (e.g. 0.05-0.5 mol of spin/mol of C-center), and are much lower than expected for isolated S = systems. Hu et al.(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar) concluded that this observation derives from heterogeneity in the C-center population resulting from a mixture of spin and oxidation states; EPR and Mössbauer studies demonstrate a combination of Cred2 and Cs=3/2 states in CO- or dithionite- reduced holo-CODH and a combination of Cred1 and Cox states in indigo carmine-oxidized holo-CODH. Interestingly, the ability to observe the Cred1 or Cred2 EPR signal does not correlate with enzyme activity; all preparations of purified CODH have similar specific activities. The factors affecting the states of the C-center are incompletely understood; therefore, this report investigates the effect of redox potential on the states of the C-center. In this report, we have combined potentiometric redox titrations with UV-visible and EPR spectroscopies to study the redox characteristics of the metal centers in holo- and nickel-deficient CODH. The midpoint potential of the Cox/Cred1 redox couple has been determined and correlated with the reduction of an [Fe4S4]2+ cluster in holo-CODH. Finally, this work demonstrates nickel-deficient CODH, which does not exhibit a Cred1 state, does not contain an [Fe4S4]2+ cluster that can be reduced over the range of potentials that afford the Cred1 state in holo-CODH. Cell cultures of R. rubrum were grown on medium that afforded either holo- or nickel-deficient CODH as needed, and enzyme purification was performed according to published methods(1.Bonam D. Murrell S.A. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 693-699Google Scholar, 8.Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Google Scholar, 20.Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid colorometric method using bovine serum albumin (grade A, Sigma) as standard(25.Smith M.R. Lequerica J.L. Hart M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 67-71Google Scholar). CO-oxidation activity was determined by the CO-dependent methyl viologen reduction assay as described previously(20.Bonam D. McKenna M.C. Stephens P.J. Ludden P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 31-35Google Scholar). One unit of activity equals 1 μm CO-oxidized per minute. The redox potentials of CODH samples were poised in an anaerobic electrochemical cell (26.Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Google Scholar) with a three-electrode system consisting of a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a gold working electrode. The following mediators were used in electrochemical experiments: methyl viologen (E′o = −440 mV), benzyl viologen (E′o = −358 mV), indigo carmine (E′o = −125 mV), indigo tetrasulfonate (E′o = −46 mV), and thionin (E′o = 56 mV)(13.Lu W.-P. Jablonski P.E. Rasche M. Ferry J.G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9736-9742Google Scholar). Methyl and benzyl viologens were purchased from Sigma; indigo carmine, indigo tetrasulfonate, and thionin were purchased from Aldrich. All mediators were used without further purification. The electrochemical cell and redox solutions were prepared in an anaerobic glove box (Vacuum/Atmospheres Dri-Lab glovebox model HE-493) with an N2 atmosphere containing less than 1 ppm O2. The buffer used in all experiments was 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.2. Buffer solutions and the electrochemical cell were stored in the glove box prior to use. In a typical experiment, approximately 15-30 mg of CODH (with a specific activity of 4,200 units/mg) in a buffer solution containing 400 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithionite was chromatographed through a Sephadex G-25 gel-filtration column to remove dithionite. The dithionite-free CODH eluent was diluted to 3 ml with anaerobic buffer containing mediators (approximately 0.04 mM final concentration each) and KCl (0.1 M final concentration). This solution was added to the electrochemical cell, which was assembled and removed from the glove box in order to perform the potentiometric titrations. Once outside the glovebox, a continuous flow of scrubbed argon was passed through the electrochemical cell to maintain oxygen-free conditions. The redox potential was established with an Electrosynthesis model 410 Potentiostatic Controller, and once equilibrated (i.e. drift < 2 mV/min), the redox-poised solution was anaerobically transferred into an EPR tube, and frozen in liquid N2. Fully reduced samples of holo-CODH and nickel-deficient CODH were prepared by exposure to CO, or by adding an excess of dithionite. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 or a Varian E-15 spectrometer using an Oxford Instruments ER910A cryostat. Relative signal intensities were fitted to a linearized form of the Nernst equation (), and the midpoint potential (Eo) and the number of electrons (n) involved in a redox reaction were determined according to published methods(13.Lu W.-P. Jablonski P.E. Rasche M. Ferry J.G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9736-9742Google Scholar).Eh=Eo+(59/n)log(ox)/(red)(Eq. 1) The data were plotted as signal intensity versus the measured potential (Eh), and a theoretical curve was generated with n and Eh values determined by Nernst analysis. Redox potentials are reported in reference to the normal hydrogen electrode. CODH samples were electrochemically titrated, as described above, in an electrochemical cell fused to a 1-cm path length quartz UV-visible cell. CODH activities were: 3,700 units/mg for holo-CODH; 23 units/mg for nickel-deficient CODH. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer. Mediator contributions to the combined CODH-mediator spectrum were accounted for according to published procedures(27.Stankovich M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 295-308Google Scholar). Potentials more negative than −350 mV were stabilized by adding CO (5%) to the headspace of the redox vessel followed by flushing with argon. Reduction of Fe-S clusters in CODH was measured by the change in absorption at 420 nm. Measured A420 values were converted to percent oxidation by and plotted versus measured redox potential (28.Shin W. Stafford P.R. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6003-6011Google Scholar).Oxidationpercent=100×(A420meas−A420min)/(A420max−A420min)(Eq. 2) CO- or dithionite-reduced CODH exhibited a minimum absorbance at 420 nm (A420 (minimum), є420 = 20.1 mM-1 cm-1), and thionin-oxidized CODH exhibited a maximum absorbance at 420 nm (A420 (maximum), є420 = 35.6 mM-1 cm-1)(8.Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Google Scholar). CODH samples were prepared in the anaerobic glove box. Dithionite was removed by G-25 chromatography, and dithionite-free CODH was diluted with anaerobic buffer (100 mM MOPS, pH 7.2) to a final concentration of 0.043 mM and divided into 0.2-ml aliquots. CODH activity was 4,000 units/mg. Several aliquots were added directly to EPR tubes (as-isolated CODH), and the remainder were treated with small amounts of either dithionite or thionin before transferring into EPR tubes. Fully oxidized CODH was prepared by adding a slight excess of thionin, which was detected by the presence of a light blue color. Fully reduced CODH was prepared (outside the glovebox) by flushing a sealed EPR tube containing as-isolated CODH with CO. After sealing and removing the EPR tubes containing CODH samples from the glove box, the visible spectra of these samples were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1601PC spectrophotometer fitted with an adapter for holding an EPR tube in the sample cell. Immediately after recording an optical spectrum, the EPR tube was removed and immersed in liquid nitrogen to freeze the CODH sample for subsequent EPR spectroscopy. Percent oxidation of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters was determined, and EPR spectroscopy was performed as described above. EPR-redox titration experiments were performed to determine the optimum redox potential for observation of the Cred1 (gav = 1.87) EPR signal. Additionally, the redox dependence of EPR-active states of the C*-center in nickel-deficient CODH as well as those of the B-center in holo-CODH and nickel-deficient CODH were investigated. At a potential of −33 mV, no significant EPR signals were observed for holo-CODH (Fig. 2, A). The Cred1 (gav = 1.87) signal developed as potentials decreased (Fig. 2, B), and Nernst analysis indicated that the C-center undergoes a reversible, one-electron redox reaction with a midpoint potential of −110 mV (Fig. 2, lower panel). At potentials below −350 mV, the Bred (gav = 1.94) state was observed with the loss of Cred1 (Fig. 2, C). The EPR-redox titration data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that Cred1 (gav = 1.87) results from a one-electron reduction of the Cox with a midpoint potential of −110 mV. The maximum spin concentration measured in this experiment for the gav = 1.87 EPR signal is ~0.2 mol of spin/mol of CODH; therefore, the formation of the Cred1 state appears to be influenced by factors other than redox potential alone. This observation is consistent with the findings of Hu et al., who report a mixture of Cox and Cred1 states in Mössbauer spectra of holo-CODH poised at potentials as low as −300 mV. Hu et al. concluded that, due to sample heterogeneity, a fraction of holo-CODH molecules may contain C-centers that are unable to form Cred1. This fraction, therefore, is proposed to remain in the Cox state until potentials low enough to result in the formation of Cs=3/2 and Cred2 are achieved. Nickel-deficient CODH did not exhibit EPR-active states in the g = 2 region (Fig. 3A) or g = 4-6 region (data not shown) at potentials more positive than −350 mV. Initial development of the Bred signal (gav = 1.94) was observed at −400 mV (Fig. 3B). At −510 mV, however, nickel-deficient CODH exhibited a two-component spectrum consisting of Bred and a similar and overlapping signal with g values at 2.07, 1.93, and 1.86 (Fig. 3C). The nature of the second signal is unknown and is currently under investigation. The C*-center does not appear to be redox active over the range of potentials that afford the Cred1 state. This observation is consistent with the proposal that an interaction between the nickel and [Fe4S4]2+ components in the C-center strongly influences the redox behavior of the Fe4S4 cluster. In the absence of nickel, therefore, reduction of the [Fe4S4]2+ cluster of C*ox can only occur at potentials significantly lower than the Eo = −110 mV of the Cox/Cred1 redox transition. The B-centers in holo- and nickel-deficient CODH exhibited similar redox behavior. The reduced form of the B-center, Bred, is not observed at potentials more positive than −350 mV in EPR-redox titrations of either form of CODH (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). The redox properties of the B-center, therefore, appear to be unaffected by nickel in holo-CODH. The absence of Bred at potentials above −350 mV is also consistent with the finding of Smith et al.(23.Smith E.T. Ensign S.A. Ludden P.W. Feinberg B.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 181-185Google Scholar) that the B-center in holo-CODH undergoes reduction with a midpoint potential of −418 mV. UV-visible spectroscopy was utilized in the following experiments to observe changes in the redox state of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters in CODH by monitoring changes in absorbance at 420 nm (a wavelength sensitive to the redox state of Fe4S4 clusters). The Fe4S4 component of Cred1 was proposed to be in the one-electron reduced [Fe4S4]+ form(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar), and the Cred1 (gav = 1.87) state was shown in this work to result from a one-electron reduction (Eo = −110 mV) of Cox (Fig. 2). To demonstrate that reduction of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters accompanies the development of the Cred1 EPR signal (gav = 1.87), combined EPR and UV-visible spectroscopy experiments were performed. The corresponding EPR and UV-visible spectra of fully oxidized holo-CODH had no significant EPR signals (Fig. 4A, upper panel) and a maximum absorbance at 420 nm (Fig. 4A, lower panel). This shows that all C-centers were in the Cox form and all [Fe4S4]2+ clusters were oxidized. Reduction of 33% of the Fe4S4 clusters in holo-CODH, as determined by A420 measurement (Fig. 4B, lower panel), was accompanied by the appearance of the Cred1 state (gav = 1.87) in the corresponding EPR spectrum (Fig. 4B, upper panel). (The [Fe4S4]2+ clusters of the B- and C-centers are assumed to contribute equally to the optical spectrum at 420 nm). As the percentage of reduced Fe4S4 clusters increased beyond 33%, the EPR signal intensity of Cred1 (gav = 1.87) did not increase. With 56% of the Fe4S4 clusters reduced in holo-CODH, partial development of the Bred state (gav = 1.94) was evident (Fig. 4C, upper and lower panels). Fully reduced holo-CODH exhibited EPR signals originating from the Bred and Cred2 (gav = 1.86) states (Fig. 4D, upper panel) and a minimum absorbance at 420 nm (Fig. 4D, lower panel). The data in Fig. 4 correlates the development of the Cred1 EPR signal (gav = 1.87) with a decrease in A420, which is consistent with the proposal that Cred1 results from the one-electron reduction of the [Fe4S4]2+ component of Cox. The development of the lower-potential Bred state was accompanied by additional loss of absorbance at 420 nm, and Cred2 was not observed until all [Fe4S4]2+ clusters became reduced. Although present in holo-CODH, nickel does not contribute to the optical spectrum at 420 nm(8.Ensign S.A. Bonam D. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4968-4973Google Scholar). The midpoint potentials for the reduction of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters in holo-CODH and nickel-deficient CODH were determined by optical-redox titration experiments. The results (Fig. 5) show that ~30% of the Fe4S4 clusters in holo-CODH (i.e. 60% of the C-centers) undergoes a one-electron reduction with a midpoint potential of approximately −125 mV, similar to that measured for the Cox/Cred1 redox transition. This is consistent with the observation of Hu et al. that only a fraction of the C-center population (no greater than 60% under any known condition) is capable of forming Cred1(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar). Beginning at approximately −350 mV, decreases in A420 were observed for holo-CODH and nickel-deficient CODH, and the minimum A420 absorption value for each sample was achieved at −500 mV, indicating full reduction of all [Fe4S4]2+ clusters (Fig. 5). Notably, significant reduction of Fe4S4 clusters in nickel-deficient CODH was not observed at potentials greater than −350 mV. This observation, coupled with the absence of the C*red EPR signal at similar potentials, shows that the fully oxidized form of the C*-center (C*ox) is not redox active at potentials greater than −350 mV. Although this work focuses primarily on the redox properties of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters that in part define the various states of the B- and C-centers, the role of nickel in the C-center should not be overlooked. The presence of nickel dramatically increases the midpoint potential of the C-center [Fe4S4]2+ cluster by over 200 mV. Moreover, Hu et al.(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar) found evidence in Mössbauer studies that the [Fe4S4]+ component of the Cred1 state contains a unique pentacoordinate iron subsite, called ferrous component II(29.Lindahl P.A. Ragsdale S.W. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3880-3888Google Scholar), which was not observed in the C*-center; the spectroscopic properties of the C*-center Fe4S4 cluster were consistent with all iron atoms having tetracoordination(22.Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Google Scholar). Treating nickel-deficient CODH with nickel converts the C*-center to the C-center coincident with the development of the unique ferrous component II subsite; therefore, the incorporation of nickel appears to substantially alter the coordination environment of one iron atom in the C-center. The reduced [Fe4S4]+ cluster in the Cred1 state, therefore, may be stabilized by electrostatic interactions from the nickel cation or from an alteration of the ligands and protein environment of the C-center Fe4S4 cluster when nickel is bound to CODH. It is interesting to note that the activation of nickel-deficient CODH by NiCl2 occurs only at potentials lower than −350 mV(9.Ensign S.A. Campbell M.J. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2162-2168Google Scholar). From the results presented here, this suggests that the C*-center must be in the C*red state (and perhaps the B-center in the Bred state) before the appropriate ligand environment is accessible to the nickel cation. The nickel ion appears to remain as Ni(II) in the various states of the C-center studied here. Evidence of a Ni(III) EPR signal was not observed at any potential. Furthermore, the correlation established between the optical changes monitored at 420 nm and the development of the Cred1 (gav = 1.87) EPR signal demonstrates that the one-electron reduction of Cox that affords Cred1 is localized on the [Fe4S4]2+ component of the C-center. The redox behavior of the C-center at potentials more negative than −350 mV is unclear, as is the relationship between CO-oxidation activity and the appearance of the Cred1, Cred2 and Cs=3/2 states. Both the Cox and Cred1 forms of the C-center must be competent to bind and be reduced by CO as holo-CODH containing either form of the C-center can be fully reduced by CO. It is possible that multiple #x0201C;routes” of reduction exist among the four states of the C-center, but data presented here do not allow us to distinguish such possibilities. Finally, the number of electrons (i.e. one or three) separating Cred2 from Cox is unknown. In summary, the Cox/Cred1 redox couple has a midpoint potential of −110 mV. The formation of Cred1 from Cox is concomitant with the one-electron reduction of a [Fe4S4]2+ cluster in holo-CODH. The nickel cation, proposed to be Ni(II) in the Cox and Cred1 states, appears to strongly affect the redox behavior of the [Fe4S4]2+ component of the C-center; reduction of the C*-center [Fe4S4]2+ cluster in nickel-deficient CODH is not observed at potentials more positive than −350 mV.

We investigated the requirements for the reinitiation process using model proteins in which systematically designed sequences were inserted after two preceding topogenic sequences, namely the N-terminal signal sequence (S) and stop transfer sequence (St). The model proteins were translated in vitro in the presence of rough microsomes, and the final topology of the proteins in the microsomal membrane was examined by proteolytic digestion. The structural requirements for S and the reinitiation sequence (R) overlapped to some extent, but substantial differences were noticed. When St and R were separated by a short cytoplasmic segment (58 amino acids), the efficiency of the reinitiation was not affected by the concentration of the signal recognition particle (SRP) in the translation system, even though the sequence inserted as R was an SRP-dependent signal sequence. However, when the cytoplasmic segment was longer (100 amino acids), the reinitiation efficiency was reduced, and the SRP improved the overall efficiency as well as impaired the accessibility of the processing site after the R to the signal peptidase.

In eucaryotic cells, membrane proteins on the endocytotic and exocytotic pathway are co-translationally integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and their final membrane topologies are defined during their integration. They are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the signal recognition particle (SRP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SRPsinal recognition particleSsignal sequenceRreinitiation sequence: SA, signal-anchor sequenceStstop transfer sequenceIL2interleukin 2RMrough microsomal membranes from dog pancreasPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) and SRP-receptor system(1.Walter P.

Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), and then they are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane depending on the hydrophilic protein translocation channel, which consists of several protein subunits(2.Crowley K.S.

The topology of membrane proteins is determined by several functionally defined topogenic sequences(4.Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 5.Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), the signal sequence (S), the stop-transfer sequence (St), and the signal-anchor sequence (SA). S initiates the protein translocation by functioning at two steps; it is recognized and targeted to the membrane by the SRP system and then initiates the translocation of the following portion of growing peptide by looping into the membrane. St interrupts the ongoing translocation of the nascent peptide chain either by dissociating the protein subunits of the translocation channel or by interacting with the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer(6.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7.Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 527-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SA initiates the protein translocation in the same manner as S, but it is not cleaved by the signal peptidase, so that it ends up as the membrane-anchoring sequence. SAs are categorized into Type I (Nin/Cout) and Type II (Nout/Cin) according to their orientation in the membrane(8.High S. Dobberstein B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both types of SAs are recognized and targeted to the membrane by SRP(9.High S. Flint N. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The functions of these topogenic sequences are mainly determined by the hydrophobic segment and are modulated by adjacent charged, and mainly positive, amino acid residues. The hydrophobic segments of S are usually 8-12 amino acid residues long, while those of the other topogenic sequences are longer than 20 amino acid residues(10.von Heijne G. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 24: 151-179Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). S prefers the leucine residues as the components of the hydrophobic segment in comparison with the other topogenic sequences(10.von Heijne G. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 24: 151-179Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The orientation of SA in the membrane depends on the balance between its N-terminal charge and the length of the hydrophobic segment(11.Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The primary determinant of St is the hydrophobicity of the sequence, and the positively charged amino acid residues after the hydrophobic segment promote the interruption of the protein translocation(13.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the topogenesis of multispanning integral membrane proteins, the membrane translocation must be reinitiated after the stop-translocation by St. The amino acid sequence responsible for this process is designated here as the reinitiation sequence (R). It has been proposed that multispanning membrane proteins are integrated into the membrane by a series of alternating signal and stop-transfer sequences(14.Audigier Y. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5783-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15.Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16.Lipp J. Flint N. Haeuptle M.T. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that the membrane integration of proteins is a sequential event of the insertion of the alternative hydrophobic sequences starting from the N-terminal transmembrane segment and that the hydrophobic segment, which is not recognizable by the SRP, can mediate the second translocation(17.Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is, however, not clear whether the structural requirements for R are similar to those of S and whether some proteinaceous factors, such as the SRP and/or others, participate in the process. In this study, we systematically and quantitatively examined the reinitiation process using various model sequences whose functions as S or SA had been evaluated in previous studies, and demonstrated that the reinitiation is primarily determined by the hydrophobicity of the sequences as is the case of S, while the structural requirements for R are not identical with those for S. We also demonstrated that the concentration of the SRP could affect, not only the overall reinitiation efficiency but also the accessibility of the authentic cleavage site for the signal peptidase behind the reinitiation sequence. Plasmids, pSL1 to pSL18 coding for the proteins in which the model sequences were fused at the N terminus of mature IL2 were described(12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). pL15(+) coding for the type I membrane protein in which 15 leucine and two lysine residues (L15(+) sequence) were introduced into the middle portion of IL2 molecule were described(13.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the synthetic peptide of the N-terminal sequence of Ysy6p, MAVQTPRQRLANAKP, have also been described previously (18.Sakaguchi M. Ueguchi C. Ito K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar The proteins constructed in this study are summarized (see Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:A). EcoRI and EcoT22I sites were created at the termination codon of the L15(+) protein on the pL15(+) by site-directed mutagenesis to obtain pGTP. The DNA fragments coding the model sequences and the mature portion of IL2 were excised with EcoRI and PstI from the pSL series plasmids and subcloned between the EcoRI and EcoT22I site of pGTP. The obtained plasmid were designated sequentially as indicated in the table of Fig. 1A. The four synthetic oligonucleotides designed for the tag sequence were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated with the plasmids pKL7, pKL9, pKL10, and pKL11, which had been digested with BglII and XhoI as described previously(6.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The XhoI site had been created in the middle potion of the second IL2 sequence(12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The resulted plasmids were designated as pKL7′, pKL9′, pKL10′, pKL11′, respectively. Each set of appropriate templates and primers was used to obtain DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction, coding for R+L3, L1+St+L2+R, L3, L1+St, and L1+St+L2 sequences. The obtained DNA fragments were isolated, digested by NcoI and PstI, and then subcloned into the transcription plasmid, pSP2 M, digested by NcoI and PstI. The DNA fragments coding N-terminal 40 and 140 amino acids of mature IL2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The obtained DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and ligated with EcoRI-digested pKL9. The mRNAs transcribed from the plasmids were translated at 26°C for 40 min in a wheat germ cell-free system in the presence of RM (2 eq/25 μl) and 35S-labeled amino acids. In some cases, salt-washed RM (KRM, 2 eq/25 μl) was used, and various amounts of SRP were included in the translation system. After the translation, 1 μl of proteinase K (2 mg/ml) was added to the 10-μl translation mixture and incubated at 20°C for 30 min. The protein precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid was solubilized with the sample buffer and analyzed with SDS-PAGE followed by quantification with an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (19.Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RM and KRM(20.Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), SRP(21.Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and wheat germ extract (22.Erickson A.H. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. In vitro transcription-translation (23.Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), DNA manipulations(24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis (25.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) were all performed according to the described methods. The first objective of this study was to systematically examine structural requirements of the reinitiation sequence (R) and to compare them with those of the N-terminal signal sequence (S). For this purpose, we utilized the 18 model sequences that had been constructed in a previous study(12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The model sequences, in which number of N-terminal net charges (−1, +1, +3) and lengths of the hydrophobic stretch (5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15 amino acid residues) had been systematically changed, were designated according to the net charges and the lengths of the hydrophobic stretch (Fig. 1A). To examine R function of the model sequences, they were placed between two mature interleukin 2 (IL2) sequences in the protein constructs shown in Fig. 1A. S of IL2 was placed at the N terminus of the constructs, and then the middle portion of the first IL2 sequence was replaced by an St consisting of 15 leucine residues followed by two lysine residues, which completely stops the ongoing translocation(13.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . When the model sequence following the St reinitiated the translocation across the membrane, the L3 portion would be translocated across the membrane as shown in Fig. 1B, in cases 2 and 3. If the model sequence failed to reinitiate translocation, then the L3 portion would be left exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (case 1). The constructed proteins were expressed in the in vitro transcription-translation system in the presence of the RM, and the final membrane topology of the translated proteins was examined by the protease protection assay. To identify the protected peptide segments, an epitope tag sequence was inserted into the L3 portion of the four constructs (pKL7, pKL9, pKL10, and pKL11), which gave typical protease protection patterns, to obtain pKL7′, pKL9′, pKL10′, and pKL11′. Supposed topologies of the tag sequence on the membrane were indicated by open circles in Fig. 1B. It is reasonable to assume that the tag sequence did not affect final topology of the proteins in the membrane, since it is short and not hydrophobic. The constructed cDNAs were transcribed in vitro, and the obtained mRNAs were translated with wheat germ cell-free translation system. Typical results with the tagged constructs are shown in Fig. 2A. Each of the translates from pKL7′, pKL9′, pKL10′, and pKL11′ gave the major precursor protein bands of 40 kDa (lanes 1, 6, 11, and 16). Upon the translation in the presence of RM, the KL7′ protein showed no additional bands, whereas KL9′ and KL10′ proteins gave two major additional bands of 20 and 21 kDa (lanes 7 and 12), and KL11′ protein also gave the similar additional bands of weak intensity (lane 17). By immunoprecipitation with the anti-tag antibodies, the precursor protein and the 20-kDa protein were precipitated but not the 21-kDa protein (lanes 9, 14, and 19), thus indicating that the 20-kDa peptide was the second IL2 segment (L3), which was split at the junction with the model sequence by signal peptidase, and the 21-kDa peptide consisted of the first IL2 segment and the introduced model sequence, L1-St-L2-R (Fig. 1B). When the translation products with RM were treated with proteinase K, several membrane-protected bands were detected. KL7′ protein gave one major protected band of 18 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Because the 18-kDa peptide was not precipitated with the anti-tag sequence antibodies, the peptide was identified as the L1-St or the S-L1-St portion (see below) (lane 5). KL9′, KL10′, and KL11′ proteins gave two or three protected bands of 18, 20, and 24 kDa (lanes 8, 13, and 18). Both the 20- and 24-kDa peptides were precipitated with anti-tag antibodies (lanes 10, 15, and 20), which thus indicated that the two protected peptides contained the L3-portion. Judging from the apparent molecular weights, the 20-kDa protein was the L3 portion processed by the signal peptidase after the translocation, and 24-kDa peptide was the unprocessed, membrane protected-form with R (R-L3). To compare the mobility of the protein fragments described above with those of marker proteins, we constructed five marker proteins consisting of each set of the segments of pKL10′ protein and translated them in the absence of RM (Fig. 2B). The 24-kDa protected band (lanes 5 and 6) showed a little bit higher mobility than that of R-L3 protein. This is likely because some of the N-terminal charged residues of R sequence of pKL10′ protein were accessible to the proteinase K on RM membrane. The 21 and 20 kDa processed bands of pKL10′ protein (lane 2) showed the same mobility of L1-St-L2-R and L3, respectively, confirming the identity. The 21-kDa processed band of pKL9′ protein showed slightly higher mobility because of its reduced number of leucine residues. The 18 kDa protected bands showed unexpected lower mobility than that of the L1-St marker protein. This observation coincides with our previous observation that when IL2 constructs, having the 15 leucine residues in its middle portion as a stop-transfer sequence, was translated with RM and then subjected to proteinase K treatment, the same high molecular mass (18 kDa) membrane-protected band was detected(6.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This unexpected mobility of the protected band might be because S of these constructs could not be processed by signal peptidase. Anyway, the facts that the 18 kDa band was detected for all of the protein constructs examined here and that the mobility was same as that observed in the constructs lacking R and L3 portions (6.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indicate that 18 kDa bands correspond to the first translocated segments. The 18 kDa band can be used as an estimate of the total protein translocated as it is generated independent of reinitiation. This first translocated segment provided an internal control for the quantitation of the efficiency of the translocation reinitiation. The two membrane-protected bands of 20 and 24 kDa, which could be precipitated with the anti-tag antibodies indicated the translocation reinitiation. Both the L1 and L3 portions contain three methionine residues, and the L2 portion contains no methionine. We thus estimated the reinitiation efficiency (Fig. 3A, %) by calculating the ratio of the 24 kDa (R-L3) band plus the 20 kDa (L3) band to the 18 kDa band. To confirm that the proteinase K resistant bands of 24, 20, and 18 kDa were integrated depending on the N-terminal signal sequences, we examined the membrane topology of N-terminal S deleted constructs derived from pKL9′, pKL10, and pKL11 and found that those proteins gave no or, if any, only faint proteinase K-resistant bands (data not shown). Thus, it is demonstrated that protein integration into RM observed here was started with the amino-terminal S sequence. All constructed proteins were synthesized in the presence of RM, and their membrane topologies were assessed. The efficiencies of the inserted model sequences as R are summarized in Fig. 3A. In the figure, contributions of the 24 kDa band and the 20 kDa band were indicated separately (hatched and solid bars, respectively). The reinitiation efficiencies were tightly dependent on the numbers of hydrophobic amino acid residues. The accessibility of the processing site in the second IL2 sequence to the signal peptidase varied depending on the inserted model sequences. To compare the R activities of the model sequences with their S activity, we also estimated their S activity by using the previously constructed proteins in which the same model sequences were placed at the N terminus of the mature IL2 like the SL9 protein in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 3B, the amino-terminal positive charges mitigate the effect of long hydrophobic sequences. In these cases, all of the translocated IL2 portions were completely processed by the signal peptidase, indicating that none of the hydrophobic sequences act as type II SA. It should be mentioned that (−1)L13 and(−1)L15 sequences did not act as S but functioned as type I SA whose final orientation in the membrane (Nin/Cout) was reverse to that of S (12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Short hydrophobic segments of(−1)L5, (+1)L5, and (+3)L5 did not function as R.(−1)L7,(−1)L10, and (+3)L15 showed a relatively low R activity, although these sequences efficiently functioned as S. It should be pointed out that the functional S sequences,(−1)L7 and (−1)L10, which were recognized by the SRP, could not function as R. (−1)L12,(−1)L13,(−1)L15, and (+1)L13 showed an efficient R activity. In most cases, the reinitiation efficiency (R function) of a model sequence was higher than the translocation efficiency (S function). This is likely because the nascent protein is already associated with the membrane when R acts (see “Discussion”). These results indicate that the structural requirements of S and R largely overlap, but some sequences with efficient S function do not function as R and vice versa. Spiess et al.(26.Spiess M. Handschin C. Baker K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19117-19124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that stop-transfer efficiency depended on translation systems used, which thus suggested the possibility that different results could be obtained by using reticulocyte lysate translation system instead of the wheat germ extract system. We therefore examined the R efficiency of the constructed proteins with the reticulocyte lysate system and found that the efficiencies of R in the reticulocyte lysate system on the whole were higher than those estimated in the wheat germ extract system, but the results obtained with the two cell-free translation systems were essentially the same (data not shown). We next investigated whether SRP-concentration would affect the R function of (+1)L10 sequence of KL9 protein. It was assumed that under the condition of limited amount of SRP, the externally added SRP should affect the function of S and R. The RM was washed twice with 0.5 M potassium acetate to remove SRP (KRM). The translocation activity of KRM was about one-eighth of the original RM. In vitro translation was performed in the presence of KRM and various concentrations of added SRP. The concentration of SRP did not affect the R activity of (+1)L10 sequence in KL9 protein (Fig. 4B). When the (+1)L10 sequence was attached to the N terminus of mature IL2 (Fig. 4A, SL9 protein), the translocation efficiency was clearly dependent on the concentration of SRP (Fig. 4C), which indicated that the (+1)L10 sequence was recognizable by the SRP. The translocation reinitiation of KL9 protein thus seemed to be SRP-independent. To test the effect of context, the distance between the St and the R of KL9 protein, 58 amino acids, was elongated to 100 amino acids (KL9-100 protein) and 200 amino acids (KL9-200 protein) (Fig. 4A). The elongation of the L2 portion of KL9 protein resulted in a significant reduction of R efficiency depending on the distance between St and R (Fig. 4B). In the case of KL9-100 protein, total R efficiency was increased by the addition of SRP, whereas SRP did not increase the R efficiency of KL-200 protein. The processing by signal peptidase after the reinitiation was also affected by the length of the L2 portion. Furthermore, the processing percentage of the KL9-100 protein was affected by the concentration of SRP; the proportion of the processed product decreased as the concentration increased. These observations suggested that SRP might affect the reinitiation process of KL9-100 protein, whereas SRP was apparently not required for the reinitiation process of KL9 protein. Systematically constructed model sequences were fused to the N terminus of mature IL2 and examined for their ability as S (S context) in the previous study(12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this study, the same sequences were positioned in the R context, where the S of IL2, a St, and the model sequences were sequentially arranged from the N terminus, and the cotranslational incorporation of the constructed proteins into RM was examined with an in vitro system. The model proteins showed the expected topology in the membrane and the topogenic activities of the sequences inserted in the R context were dependent on their structures. The structural requirements of S and R overlapped to some extent, whereas substantial differences could also be demonstrated as follows. First, in the case of the model sequences containing 13- and 15-leucine segments, the function of the sequences in S context was significantly affected by the number of the preceding positive charges (Fig. 3B and (12.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)), whereas their function as R was not substantially affected by the charges. Most importantly,(−1)L13 functioned as type I SA in the S context in which the N terminus was translocated to the lumen and the C-terminal portion was left on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Nin/Cout), while (+3)L13 showed the inverted orientation (Nout/Cin). In the R context, both(−1)L13 and (+3)L13 functioned as R in which the N-terminal portion was left on the cytoplasmic side (Nout/Cin). It is likely that the N terminus of the long hydrophobic segment in the S context should be fixed by the positive charges at the entrance of the translocation channel for the S function, whereas the cytoplasmic segment between St and R could efficiently retain the N terminus of the R on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane even when the hydrophobic segment was long (Fig. 5). Second, in the case of the model sequences containing 7- and 10-leucine segments, the positive charges preceding the segments were required for the R function;(−1)L7 and(−1)L10 showed no R activity and low R activity, respectively. These two short sequences, however, functioned as efficient S in the S context irrespective of the charges. These differences suggested that a unique mechanism is operative in the reinitiation of protein translocation. It is likely that the translocation initiation by S and the reinitiation by R differ in the membrane recognition at the targeting step or in the interaction with the translocation machinery during the looping of the peptides into the membrane. Naturally occurring transmembrane segments of multispanning membrane proteins are usually longer than 18-20 residues. However, we found longer hydrophobic segments of 15 leucines are less efficient reinitiation activity. This finding indicated that too much hydrophobic segment does not mediate translocation reinitiation. It is worthy to speculate that such overhydrophobic segments have been eliminated during the evolution of membrane proteins. It was reported that the internal transmembrane segments of opsin could initiate translocation in an SRP-dependent manner in the S context(14.Audigier Y. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5783-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15.Friedlander M. Blobel G. Nature. 1985; 318: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The second reinitiation sequence of the multispanning precursor of the structural proteins of Semliki Forest virus mediated the translocation of the following portion depending on SRP when the sequence was exhibited at the N terminus by the deletion of the preceding portion(27.Melancon P. Garoff H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations seem to indicate that the hydrophobic segments of the multispanning membrane proteins possess the potential to initiate peptide translocation in an SRP-dependent manner, which also suggests the possibility that SRP also mediates the reinitiation of the peptide translocation. However, it was also reported that a mutated transmembrane segment, which was no longer recognized by SRP and lost the S function, functioned as R(17.Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A truncated mutant of the Semliki Forest virus polyprotein, which had only 28 amino acids after the reinitiation sequence, formed the expected multispanning topology. Since the recognition of the signal sequence by the SRP requires more than 40 amino acid residues after the signal sequence to allow the signal to emerge from the ribosome, it was suggested that the reinitiation process can proceed without SRP recognition(28.Cutler D.F. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29.Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These facts therefore seem to indicate that the reinitiation step does not require SRP. We found in this study that a model sequence, (+1)L10, which can be recognized by the SRP, functioned as R, and the reinitiation efficiency was not affected by the SRP concentration in the translation mixture as shown for KL9 protein. Thus, it is suggested that the reinitiation process of KL9 protein is not dependent on the SRP. On the other hand, the reinitiation of the KL9-100 protein was clearly affected by the SRP concentration, and the overall reinitiation efficiency was restored to a level as high as that of KL9 protein at the saturation concentration of SRP. Furthermore the processing efficiency of the retranslocated portion was also affected by the SRP concentration. It is likely that the R after the long cytoplasmic loop (100 amino acids) can be recognized by SRP, and the reinitiation function is influenced by the SRP concentration. There are two possibilities to explain the relationship between the lengths of the cytoplasmic loops and the effect of SRP. In the case of the short cytoplasmic loop (58 amino acid residues), ribosomes may still be in contact with the membrane when R emerges from the ribosomes, and the SRP cannot interact with the R due to steric hindrance. Alternatively, it may be speculated that the R is directly targeted to the nearby translocation channel, which is still open even after the translocation is stopped by St. The processing of the protein constructs occurred during the translocation of L3 loop possibly at the original processing site of the second IL2 sequence after the model sequences. The processing at the beginning of L3 loop indicates that the signal peptidase in the protein translocation channel complex is also in the proximity of the translocating L3 portion. The accessibility of the processing site to the signal peptidase was significantly affected by the structure of the preceding hydrophobic segments and the L2 portion before the hydrophobic segment. This observation is consistent with the previous reports; the deletion of the cytoplasmic portions of asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 and HLD-DR histocompatibility antigen, both of which are single spanning transmembrane proteins anchoring to the membrane by type II SA (SAII), converted their SAII into the cleavable S(30.Lipp J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31.Schmid S.R. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16886-16891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); a point mutation introduced into the hydrophobic segment of the SAII of the rat sucrase-isomaltase also resulted in the conversion of the SAII to the S(32.Hegner M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Falchetto R. James P. Semenza G. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The accessibility of internal signal sequences to the signal peptidase was dependent on the lengths of their hydrophobic segments(33.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the cleavage of the model sequence placed in S context was complete irrespective of the sequences, the R consisting of more than 10 leucine residues were inefficiently cleaved. This fact is in contrast with the previous observations that model hydrophobic segments (up to 17 leucine residues) in the R context were efficiently cleaved (33.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and that an internal signal sequence was also efficiently cleaved(31.Schmid S.R. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16886-16891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the reason of the inefficient cleavage of our model proteins is not clear, it is possibly due to differences in the constructs. The functions of the topogenic sequences so far characterized, S, St, SA, and R, are mainly dependent on the segment of hydrophobic amino acids in the sequences. Therefore, one of those topogenic sequences can function as another type of the topogenic sequence according to their position in a protein sequence. The SAII of asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 could function as St or R, depending on the disposition in the protein molecule and also the preceding amino acid sequences(17.Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Some of the seven transmembrane segments of bovine opsin could function as a targeting signal to the membrane(14.Audigier Y. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5783-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In our study, (+1)L10 was able to function as either R or S, and also as St(13.Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the structural differences among the topogenic sequences, their disposition in the protein molecule is also an important determinant for their topogenic functions.

The L231R mutant was able to adopt at least two conformations: (i) a higher affinity state than the corresponding state of the wild-type receptor (WT), dependent on G protein coupling, and (ii) a low affinity state, higher than the one for the uncoupled WT receptor. The Ala230→ Glu230 substitution also resulted in two major modifications: 1) unresponsiveness in terms of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in response to PAF and 2) a marked decrease in affinity of the receptor for binding the agonist but not the antagonist.

https://openalex.org/W2019765211,"For facilitating crystallization and structural studies of the testicular isozyme of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE,), we attempted the production of enzymatically active ACET proteins which are unglycosylated or underglycosylated. Expression in Escherichia coli of the rabbit ACET cDNA resulted in the synthesis of an unglycosylated but inactive protein. Similarly, unglycosylated ACET synthesized in HeLa cells, by using a cDNA in which all five potential N-glycosylation sites had been mutated, was inactive and rapidly degraded. Several ACET variants carrying mutations in one or more of the potential N-glycosylation sites were used to examine the role of glycosylation at specific sites on ACET synthesis, transport to the cell surface, cleavage processing, and enzyme activity. These experiments demonstrated that allowing glycosylation only at the first or the second site, as counted from the NH2 terminus, was sufficient for normal synthesis and processing of active ACET. In contrast, ACETg3, which had only the third glycosylation site available, was unglycosylated, enzymatically inactive and rapidly degraded. N-Glycosylated ACET could also be produced in yeast. Surprisingly, the mutant ACETg3 was synthesized, N-glycosylated, and properly transported in yeast. Wild type and mutant ACE proteins were cleavage-secreted from yeast and enzymatically active."

Distamycin A, an antibiotic that binds to the minor groove, inhibited 2C10 binding of double-stranded DNA, suggesting that this antibody interacts with dA-dT base pairs in the minor groove. Antibody H241 binding was previously shown to have a dG-dC preference and to involve both major and minor grooves.

Zon G. Pastor R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4469-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This selectivity was also reflected in the very marked preference of this antibody for poly(dG-dC) over poly(dA-dT). A second IgG antibody, 2C10, isolated from a different MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mouse, had a very different selectivity, markedly favoring poly(dA-dT) over poly(dG-dC)(22.Kubota T. Akatsuka T. Kanai Y. Immunol. Lett. 1986; 14: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Competitive assays of antibody 2C10 with synthetic oligonucleotides indicated that it could bind well to alternating dA-dT, to stretches of (dA)n•(dT)n, or to (dA-dG)•(dC-dT) sequences, ( 2T. Kubota, Y. Kanai, and B. D. Stollar, unpublished data.) so it was more difficult to assign a single kind of epitope to it. Recently, we tried to apply a DNA footprinting assay to observe the DNA sites recognized by these two monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibodies more directly. Unexpectedly, we found that these two anti-dsDNA antibodies enhanced rather than protected against the cleavage of DNA by hydroxyl radical-generating systems. The two antibodies differed in the conditions under which they were effective and in the sites of DNA cleavage they supported. Monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibodies 2C10 and H241 (both IgG2b,κ) are hybridoma products derived from two lupus-prone MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice (21.Stollar B.D. Zon G. Pastor R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4469-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22.Kubota T. Akatsuka T. Kanai Y. Immunol. Lett. 1986; 14: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hybridoma cells were cultured in serum-free medium (Hymedium 606, Kohjin Bio, Sakato, Japan), and the culture supernatants were loaded on a matrix bearing immobilized staphylococcal protein A (Chromatotop Super Protein A, Nihon Gaishi, Handa, Japan). The matrix was washed with 25 mM Tris-HCl, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by 1.5 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in order to remove DNA and DNA-binding proteins that may have attached to antibodies during culture and isolation; the antibodies remained bound to the protein A. Then the antibodies were recovered with elution buffer (250 mM glycine HCl, pH 3.5) and dialyzed immediately against PBS (8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.3). Purity of the eluates was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and electron microscopy, which demonstrated that washing the column with a solution of high ionic strength did remove bound antigens; no contamination of DNA or DNA-binding proteins was detectable. ( 3Y. Kanai, E. Katayama, and T. Kubota, unpublished data.) A mouse myeloma protein, MPC11 (IgG2b,κ), which does not bind to DNA, was similarly purified with the protein A matrix and served as an isotype-matched control IgG. UV-irradiated polystyrene microtiter plates (Immulon 1, Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) (23.Zouali M. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 90: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were coated with calf thymus native DNA, and competitive assays using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides were performed as described previously (21.Stollar B.D. Zon G. Pastor R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4469-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A self-complementary oligonucleotide that contains alternating dA-dT and dG-dC segments (5′-CGCGCGATATATATATCGCGCGATATATATATCGCGCG-3′) was inserted into the BamHI site of a pUC19 plasmid vector (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). After amplification in Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), the plasmid was recovered by an alkaline lysis miniprep procedure using a QIAGEN plamid kit and cleaved with EcoRI (Takara). The 5′-end of the EcoRI digestion product was dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Tokyo) following a standard protocol(24.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 3.10.1-3.10.5Google Scholar), and the oligonucleotide was purified with a spin column (QIAquick spin polymerase chain reaction purification kit, QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. This product was treated with PvuII (Takara), and a 274-bp fragment containing a 4-base protruding end was purified by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. This procedure allowed subsequent 32P labeling by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (24.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 3.10.1-3.10.5Google Scholar) at the end of just one strand. Mixtures of 7.2 ng of the 274-bp DNA probe and various quantities of antibodies in PBS were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel as described previously (25.Jang Y.J. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3353-3359PubMed Google Scholar). In an experiment to test involvement of the DNA minor groove in binding of anti-DNA antibodies, 7.2 ng of the DNA probe was preincubated with 310 ng of distamycin A (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature before the reaction with anti-DNA antibodies. All buffers were prepared with deionized, distilled, and autoclaved water. The 5′-end-labeled 274-bp DNA probe, described above, was mixed with one of the monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibodies or a control IgG in 8 μl of PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4(A and B), 1 μl of freshly prepared aqueous solution of ferrous ammonium sulfate, zinc sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, or copper sulfate (100 μM final concentration) was added to the DNA/antibody mixture and allowed to react for 4 min at 25°C. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4(C and D) and in Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:, one of the metal ions indicated in the legends was mixed with Na4EDTA; then the metal ion-EDTA complex was mixed with sodium ascorbate and H2O2 and added immediately to the DNA/antibody mixture according to the protocol of Tullius et al.(26.Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with modifications. Final concentrations of metal ion, EDTA, ascorbate, and H2O2 in the standard reaction mixture were 10 μM, 20 μM, 1 mM, and 9 mM, respectively. Concentrations were changed as indicated for some experiments. The reaction time was 4 min at 25°C unless otherwise indicated. In all cases, the reactions were quenched by addition of thiourea (to 0.1 M) and Na4EDTA (to 0.2 M). After addition of 0.3 M sodium acetate and 2.75 μg/μl yeast tRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with cold ethanol. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in loading buffer containing 85% formamide and 1 mM Na4EDTA, heated at 98°C for 3 min, chilled on ice, and applied to an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Autoradiographs were analyzed with a densitometer (CS-900, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). In the experiment shown in Fig. 9, DNA was cleaved by hydroxyl radical produced by a 4-min incubation in a mixture of 1 μM copper sulfate, 0.1 mM sodium ascorbate, and 0.9 mM H2O2.Figure 9:Pattern of DNA cleavage by hydroxyl radical produced along with oxidation of Cu(I) in the presence of 2C10. The ordinate represents the relative sensitivity to the cleavage calculated as described for Fig. 8. DNA was incubated for 4 min in a mixture of 1 μM copper sulfate, 0.1 mM sodium ascorbate, and 0.9 mM H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We studied two monoclonal anti-dsDNA antibodies, 2C10 and H241, both derived from MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice. In a competitive ELISA with a series of synthetic oligonucleotides, antibody 2C10 bound to double-stranded oligonucleotides, but did not react with single-stranded ligands in the tested concentration range (Fig. 1A). These competitive assays with various double-stranded polynucleotides revealed a striking preference of 2C10 for poly(dA-dT) sequences over poly(dG-dC) or poly(dG-dmC) sequences (Fig. 1B). In separate experiments with other base-paired oligonucleotides, substitutions of thymine with uracil or fluorouracil did not significantly affect the affinity of binding to 2C10 (data not shown). Previous competitive radioimmunoassay studies had indicated that H241 recognized a dG-dC core in the center of a base-paired octadecanucleotide, 5′-ATATAGCGCGCGCTATAT-3′(21.Stollar B.D. Zon G. Pastor R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4469-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For further experiments, we used a 274-bp dsDNA probe purified from a modified plasmid as described under “Materials and Methods.” First we confirmed the binding of the antibodies to this DNA probe with an assay for retardation of migration in gel electrophoresis. Antibody 2C10 shifted the mobility of the 32P-labeled DNA almost completely at a DNA/antibody molar ratio of 1:40 (Fig. 2A). Radioactive oligonucleotide hardly entered the gel when the ratio was 1:80, presumably because of the formation of larger immune complexes. H241 caused partial retardation at a ratio of 1:20 or 1:40 and complete retardation at 1:80 (Fig. 2B). (A ratio of 1:40 with H241 caused nearly complete retardation in some experiments (Fig. 3, lane 7).) Based on these observations, we carried out the following experiments at a DNA/antibody ratio of 1:80 unless otherwise indicated.Figure 3:Effect of distamycin A on the binding of 2C10 and H241 to dsDNA. Antibodies 2C10 (lanes 2-5) and H241 (lanes 7-10) were incubated with the 274-bp dsDNA probe alone at DNA/antibody ratios of 1:40 (lanes 2 and 7) and 1:80 (lanes 4 and 9) or with a DNA/distamycin A mixture at DNA/antibody ratios of 1:40 (lanes 3 and 8) and 1:80 (lanes 5 and 10). The mixtures were then loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel with a 4% stacking gel. Lanes 1 and 6 are the DNA without antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Preincubation of the 274-bp DNA probe with distamycin A, an antibiotic that binds in the minor groove with preference for dA-dT-rich sequences (27.Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5723-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), caused marked inhibition of antibody 2C10 binding, but did not affect H241 binding (Fig. 3). Together with ELISA data described above, this result suggests that 2C10 recognizes double helical structure of DNA and makes contacts preferentially with regions of dA-dT base pairs in or over the minor groove. When we began to apply chemical footprinting assay to identification of DNA regions covered by anti-DNA antibodies, we found, unexpectedly, a significant enhancement of DNA cleavage by hydroxyl radical in the presence of 2C10 or H241. In these experiments, the DNA probe in aerobic solution was preincubated with 2C10 or with the control IgG MPC11 for 30 min in PBS. Then 100 μM divalent metal ion was added, and 4 min later, the reaction was terminated with an excess of Na4EDTA and thiourea. In the presence of antibody 2C10 and Fe(II), the DNA probe was cleaved, while no comparable cleavage was observed with MPC11 (Fig. 4A). This cleavage resulted selectively from hydroxyl radical production associated with oxidation of Fe(II), as other divalent metal ions (Zn(II), Mg(II), Ca(II), or Cu(II)) did not cleave DNA. Unlike 2C10, antibody H241 did not have a significant effect on DNA cleavage in PBS containing 100 μM Fe(II) or other metal ions (Fig. 4B). A mixture of Fe(II) chelated with Na4EDTA, H2O2, and ascorbate, known as Udenfriend's system(28.Udenfriend S. Clark C.T. Axelrod J. Brodie B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 208: 731-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a convenient reagent for continuous production of hydroxyl radical. Thus, we tested the effect of anti-DNA antibodies in the mixture of H2O2 and ascorbate with or without divalent metal ions and Na4EDTA (Fig. 4, C and D). Antibody H241 markedly enhanced the cleavage of DNA by H2O2 and ascorbate, and this effect was not dependent on the presence of any metal ions (Fig. 4C). In fact, the presence of Fe(II) partially inhibited the enhancement by H241 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, enhanced DNA cleavage by 2C10 was observed in the presence of Fe(II), ascorbate, and H2O2, but not with ascorbate and H2O2 alone (Fig. 4D) or ascorbate, H2O2, and other metals (data not shown). The control antibody MPC11 did not enhance cleavage under any of these conditions (Fig. 4D). The standard reaction mixture for the following experiments was 10 μM Fe(II), 20 μM Na4EDTA, 9 mM H2O2, and 1 mM ascorbate. To investigate the dependence of DNA cleavage enhancement on extent of hydroxyl radical production, the concentrations of these four components were changed simultaneously to give mixtures with 0.25-4.0 × the standard concentrations (Fig. 5). Antibody H241 strikingly enhanced the DNA cleavage with the standard reagent concentration, reproducibly yielding ~90% cleavage of the DNA in 4 min, as estimated from densitometric measurement of the starting material. Antibody 2C10 also enhanced DNA degradation, but it required higher concentrations of the reaction mixture. At 4 × the standard concentrations, most of the starting material was degraded in 4 min even without anti-DNA antibodies. The next experiment measured the time dependence of this effect of anti-DNA antibodies in the standard reaction mixture (Fig. 6). The reaction was rapid in the presence of H241; >50% of the starting DNA was degraded within 15 s. The reaction with 2C10 was slower under this assay condition, but there was still significant enhancement of cleavage over a 2-8-min period. To test whether the enhanced cleavage was caused by specific binding of the anti-DNA antibodies, self-complementary 13-mer oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture to determine whether they could inhibit the effects of 2C10 and H241. This experiment was done at 15°C to ensure that the complementary oligonucleotides remained base-paired. With antibody 2C10, 0.2 and 2.0 μg of 5′-AAAATATATATTT-3′ (K5) inhibited the enhancement effect of 2C10 by 49 and 83%, respectively (Fig. 7), whereas 0.2 μg of 5′-GGGGCGCGCGCCC-3′ (K6) did not show significant inhibitory effect, and 2.0 μg caused 33% inhibition. In contrast, the GC oligonucleotide K6 was a more effective inhibitor than K5 for the effect of H241; 0.2 and 2.0 μg of K6 caused 52 and 100% inhibition, respectively, whereas the same concentrations of K5 caused only 6 and 32% inhibition. These results are consistent with the specificity of 2C10 and H241 described above. Thus, it is likely that the enhancement of hydroxyl radical DNA cleavage by anti-DNA antibodies did involve the DNA-binding sites of the two antibodies. As a further test of this interpretation, the extents of cleavage at specific sites in the DNA sequence were compared in the analytical sequencing gels (Fig. 8). The susceptibility for hydroxyl radical cleavage in the presence of 2C10 and H241 showed a reciprocal pattern. The enhancement with antibody 2C10, relative to the reaction in the absence of antibody, was greatest in dA-dT-rich sequences, whereas the enhancement with antibody H241 was greatest in dG-dC-rich sequences, again indicating that increased susceptibility for cleavage is related to the specific binding sites of each antibody. In this experiment, >95% of the DNA was uncut following the hydroxyl radical reaction with a control antibody, MPC11. This condition is consistent with single-hit kinetics(29.Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), supporting the conclusion that the result truly reflects substrate specificity. To test whether any DNA-binding protein would enhance cleavage under the conditions we used, we incubated the Cro repressor protein (provided by J. Bakja, Tufts University) with a plasmid containing its recognition sequence. The sequence was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM-3, the same site used for the 274-bp probe described above. The standard hydroxyl radical-generating concentration was used. The Cro protein protected its specific binding site from cleavage, as expected in a footprinting assay (data not shown), consistent with previously reported studies(30.Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of other sources of hydroxyl radical on our assay system, we tested oxidative reactions of Cu(I) and UV irradiation. For the former reaction, Cu(II) was used in place of the very unstable Cu(I) and was combined with H2O2 and ascorbate. Antibody 2C10 did not enhance cleavage by this reagent; relative cleavage sensitivities of individual sequence sites in the presence of 2C10, in comparison with cleavage with MPC11, ranged from 0.8 and 2.2 (Fig. 9). Indeed, in the reaction with copper, the dA-dT sequences were relatively protected by 2C10, giving a pattern opposite to that seen in the reaction with iron. Under this experimental condition, the uncut fraction of DNA with MPC11 was >95%. The copper system was not tested with H241 because H2O2 and ascorbate alone caused marked degradation of DNA (Fig. 4C). To test the effect of UV irradiation, we added 9 mM H2O2 to the DNA-antibody complex and exposed the solution to 254 nm UV light for 10 min. H241 enhanced the DNA cleavage in this reaction, but 2C10 did not (data not shown). Thus, enhancement of DNA cleavage by 2C10 was observed only in association with the oxidation reaction of Fe(II), whereas H241 enhanced cleavage irrespective of metal ions, and it also exhibited the effect on UV irradiation. These experiments indicate that two anti-DNA autoantibodies from lupus mice enhance the degradation of DNA by hydroxyl radical-generating systems. Steps were taken to test whether the effect was truly due to the antibody rather than a contaminant that might have been present in an immune complex. The antibodies were highly purified, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Their purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which detected no contamination by other DNA-binding proteins. Further verification was obtained by counting the number of IgG-nucleosome complexes or free nucleosomal particles among IgG particles in a fixed area in an electron micrograph of a preparation that included mica flakes for quick-freezing and deep-etching. In the case of monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies obtained after a wash with a high salt concentration, neither IgG-nucleosome complexes nor free nucleosomes were found among 80 or more IgG particles, whereas 42 out of 80 IgG particles were associated with nucleosomes in the case of monoclonal antibodies obtained by the conventional affinity chromatography without a high salt wash. ( 4Y. Kanai, E. Katayama, and T. Kubota, manuscript in preparation.) The effectiveness of this washing is consistent with the previous demonstration of salt sensitivity of DNA binding by antibody 2C10 (31.Kanai Y. Kubota T. Immunol. Lett. 1989; 22: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and other anti-DNA autoantibodies(32.Braun R.P. Lee J.S. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the DNA also removes proteins that may be associated with it in DNA-antibody complexes. Specificity of the effects provided more direct evidence for the role of the antibody-binding sites in this phenomenon. The relative effectiveness of oligonucleotides as inhibitors of the enhancement corresponded with their effectiveness as inhibitors of DNA binding. Both the cleavage enhancement and DNA binding by antibody 2C10 were inhibited preferentially by the AT oligonucleotide, and both activities of H241 were inhibited preferentially by the GC oligonucleotide. Furthermore, enhancement occurred preferentially at dA-dT segments of the test DNA with antibody 2C10, but at dG-dC segments with H241. The sequence specificity was not absolute, and neither were the binding differences(21.Stollar B.D. Zon G. Pastor R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4469-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The effect was not due to uncontrolled conditions of the hydroxyl-generating system; unlike the antibodies, the Cro protein protected its specific target under the same conditions, just as expected in a footprinting assay. Extensive studies have demonstrated that hydroxyl radical generated by the Fenton reaction modifies bases and cleaves DNA(33.Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar, 34.Luo Y. Han Z. Chin S.M. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12438-12442Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 35.Mello-Filho A.C. Meneghini R. Mutat. Res. 1991; 251: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36.Halliwell B. Aruoma O. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). The ability of bound protein to protect against this cleavage is the basis of high resolution footprinting assays in vitro(19.Swanson P.C. Cooper B.C. Glick G.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and protection against oxidative species is afforded within cells by histones in condensed chromatin(37.Chiu S. Xue L. Friedman L.R. Oleinick N.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DNA-nuclear matrix protein association presents hypersensitive sites for oxidative damage, possibly related to the binding of copper ions(37.Chiu S. Xue L. Friedman L.R. Oleinick N.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38.Oleinick N.L. Balasubramaniam U. Xue L. Chiu S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Metal-binding proteins such as ferritin (39.Sakurai K. Ogiso T. Biol. Pharmaceut. Bull. 1995; 18: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also mediate increased DNA cleavage, as can lactoferrin with copper bound to its surface(40.Zhao X.Y. Hutchens T.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 357: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), an inorganic polymer that binds both iron and DNA (41.Hardy J.A. Aust A.E. Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1995; 16: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or small DNA-binding molecules such as adriamycin(42.Feinstein E. Canaani E. Weiner L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13156-13161Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These proteins, polymers, and small molecules may focus the Fenton reaction on simultaneously bound DNA. In addition, binding of iron to DNA may determine cleavage sites(34.Luo Y. Han Z. Chin S.M. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12438-12442Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is not known how antibodies 2C10 and H241 enhanced DNA cleavage, but there were differences in the mechanisms operating with the two antibodies. Because the enhancement with antibody 2C10 occurred either with simple addition of Fe(II) to the DNA-antibody complexes or with Fe(II) and the H2O2/ascorbate mixture, but not with the copper/peroxide/ascorbate reagent or peroxide/ascorbate alone, it is possible that antibody 2C10 selectively bound both DNA and Fe(II), concentrating hydroxyl radical generation near the target sites. In analogy, deliberate incorporation of a metal-binding site into an antibody Fv domain has been proposed as a means of generating a designed metalloenzyme(43.Roberts V.A. Getzoff E.D. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Antibody H241 acted differently, as it was effective with H2O2 and ascorbate without added metal ion. The presence of iron actually reduced the antibody-mediated enhancement, whereas other ions had no effect. Antibody H241 (and perhaps 2C10 as well) may have facilitated cleavage by distorting the DNA structure, making target sites more accessible. X-ray crystallographic analysis of an autoantibody to single-stranded DNA, for example, revealed antibody stabilization of an unpredicted conformation of oligo(dT) in the immune complex(16.Herron J.N. He X.M. Ballard D.W. Blier P.R. Pace P.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Edmundson A.B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Comparable structural data are not available for antibodies 2C10 and H241 and their complexes with DNA. The effect is not a property of all anti-DNA antibodies because hydroxyl radical generation has been used effectively for protection-based footprinting of anti-single-stranded DNA autoantibody epitopes(19.Swanson P.C. Cooper B.C. Glick G.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar). Because an excess of antibody was present in the solution and the precise number of cleavage events was not known, it is not clear whether the rate enhancement involved turnover, as in enzyme catalysis, or whether it was stoichiometric. The antibodies alone did not hydrolyze DNA in the time course of these reactions, up to 30 min. Hydrolysis of DNA by purified IgG and Fab fragments from systemic lupus erythematosus patients' sera has been detected by sensitive assays (11.Shuster A.M. Gololobov G.V. Kvashuk O.A. Bogomolova A.E. Smirnov I.V. Gabibov A.G. Science. 1992; 256: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 12.Gololobov G.V. Chernova E.A. Schourov D.V. Smirnov I.V. Kudelina I.A. Gabibov A.G. Proc. Natl.

In addition, Paul and co-workers have reported hydrolysis of vasointestinal peptide by IgG autoantibodies and their Fab fragments (44.Paul S. Volle D.J. Beach C.M. Johnson D.R. Powell M.J.

Antibody that increases the sensitivity of DNA to cleavage by hydroxyl radical or other reactive oxygen species could have an effect in vivo in sites of inflammation, where such species are generated. For example, higher than normal oxygen radical production has been detected in both bronchial alveolar cells and polymorphonuclear cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus(51.Groen H. Aslander M. Bootsma H. van der Mark T.W. Kallenberg C.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Increased numbers of chromosomal breaks and increased sensitivity to UV light, with involvement of reactive species, have also been detected and suggested as a basis for the well known sensitivity of these patients to UV irradiation(52.Emerit I. Michelson A.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2537-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 53.Golan T.D. Sigal D. Hacham H. Gotffried V. Kimmel S. Lupus. 1994; 3: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protection by superoxide dismutase provided evidence that reactive oxygen species were involved in the damage by UV radiation(52.Emerit I. Michelson A.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of anti-DNA antibodies such as 2C10 or H241 could enhance the sensitivity of DNA to such damage. In turn, hydroxyl radical-mediated damage to DNA may increase the binding by anti-DNA antibodies (55.Blount S. Griffiths H. Emery P. Lunec J. Clin. Exp.

INTRODUCTIONKey features of the developing neuronal phenotype include process extension and ion channel expression, whereby cells establish the synaptic contacts and the electrophysiological repertoire necessary for intercellular signaling. Coordination of morphological and physiological development essential to the proper wiring of the nervous system is controlled in part by growth factors such as NGF ( 1The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorΩ-CoTXΩ-conotoxin GVIABAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidDHPdihydropyridinepFpicofarads.) and bFGF. An excellent model system for studying NGF- and bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation is the well characterized PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line. In response to NGF or bFGF, PC12 cells carry out a developmental program representative of a maturing neuron, in which they cease cell division, extend neurites, and become electrically excitable(1.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar, 2.Dichter M.A. Tischler A.S. Greene L.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 501-504Google Scholar, 3.Togari A. Dickens G. Kuzuya H.

The acquisition of electrical excitability is due to an increase in the number of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels(5.Mandel G. Cooperman S.S. Maue R.A. Goodman R.H. Brehm P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 924-928Google Scholar, 6.Garber S.S. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3976-3987Google Scholar, 7.Pollock J.D. Krempin M. Rudy B. J.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 607-611Google Scholar). Although the bFGF- and NGF-activated signaling pathways responsible for morphological differentiation are beginning to be understood, little is known about the growth factor-activated pathways that govern physiological differentiation. Indeed, a key question remains as to whether or not the pathways identified with morphological changes are necessary and sufficient for physiological differentiation, particularly ion channel expression.The signal cascade responsible for growth factor-induced morphological differentiation in PC12 cells is the same ubiquitous pathway activated by a number of mitogenic and differentiating growth factors. Thus, NGF and bFGF bind to and activate receptor tyrosine kinases, which in turn cause the sequential activation of the membrane-associated GTP-binding protein p21ras, followed by B-Raf kinase, Mek-1 kinase, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2(14.Barbacid M.

In PC12 cells, sustained activation of the p21ras/ERK pathway by NGF and bFGF is suggested to be necessary for cessation of cell division and commitment to morphological differentiation(21.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 22.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar, 23.Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar); however, the sufficiency of this pathway in driving morphological differentiation is now in question(25.Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Google Scholar). In contrast, EGF stimulation of proliferation, rather than differentiation, is thought to result from more transient activation of the same p21ras/ERK pathway by the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase(22.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar, 26.Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Google Scholar, 27.Nakafuka M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19448-19454Google Scholar). Only when the EGF receptor is overexpressed in PC12 cells does EGF stimulation result in morphological differentiation that is accompanied by the sustained activation of the p21ras/ERK pathway(23.Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Google Scholar). Even though p21ras/ERK stimulation is required in both proliferative and differentiating scenarios, it seems inadequate to explain all aspects of the mature neuronal phenotype. For instance, NGF- and bFGF-induced expression of sodium channels, essential for action potential initiation, is independent of p21ras(28.D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Google Scholar, 29.Fanger G.R. Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. Maue R.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1977-1980Google Scholar). And although NGF- and bFGF-induced calcium channel expression shifts PC12 cells to a more Ω-CoTX-sensitive (i.e. mature neuron-like) secretory phenotype(12.Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Google Scholar, 30.Kongsamut S. Miller R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2243-2247Google Scholar), the necessity or sufficiency of p21ras/ERK in this process remains unresolved.Growth factor-induced PC12 differentiation is an applicable model for synaptic maturation in the developing nervous system, and therefore, it is important to specify the signals responsible for driving both the morphological and physiological aspects of this process. To understand the coordination and divergence of these processes, we are examining the relationships between the growth factor-activated pathways governing neurite outgrowth as well as expression of calcium and sodium channels. We report here that NGF or bFGF induction of calcium channels, particularly those sensitive to Ω-CoTX, requires p21ras as a signal transducer. However, activation of p21ras (and by implication, ERKs) alone is not sufficient to explain growth factor-induced functional expression of calcium channels. Thus, in the context of neuronal differentiation, there appears to be a continuum of signaling requirements for growth factor-induced morphological and physiological responses. On one hand, p21ras/ERK signaling is required and may or may not be sufficient for morphological differentiation, while sodium channel expression is independent of p21ras. Between these two different requirements for p21ras is calcium channel induction, which we show to be dependent on p21ras, but for which p21ras is not sufficient. Therefore, although activation of the p21ras/ERK pathway is critical to morphological neuronal differentiation, it is clear that other signals are required for complete development of the mature physiological phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CulturePC12 cells constitutively expressing the neomycin resistance gene (Z-1) or the resistance gene and the dominant negative N17ras mutant (17-2 and 17-26) were a generous gift of Dr. Geoff Cooper (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). v-Crk PC12 and GSRas1 cells were generous gifts of Dr. Raymond Birge (Rockefeller University, New York) and Dr. Simon Halegoua (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY), respectively. PC12 cells were cultured as described previously(12.Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto rat tail collagen-coated plastic Petri dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin and G418 (400 μg/ml) where needed. Cells were passaged weekly, and medium was replenished every other day. NGF (100 ng/ml), bFGF (40 ng/ml), or EGF (25 ng/ml) was applied for a period of 5-8 days to cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% horse serum. Fresh medium and growth factor were applied every other day. 1 μM dexamethasone in 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration) or 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle alone was added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin.ElectrophysiologyWhole cell patch clamp recordings were obtained with either an EPC-7 (List Electronics, Greenville, NY) or an Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) patch clamp amplifier, and patch pipettes pulled from Corning 7740 glass (Corning Inc., Corning, NY; resistances of 1-4 megaohms). Current signals from the patch clamp amplifier were filtered at 5 kHz (8-pole Bessel at −3 db) and saved directly to a disk. All current records were leak-subtracted with a standard P/N leak subtraction procedure. Data acquisition and analysis were done with Macintosh Centris 650 computers running Pulse and PulseFit software (Instrutech Corp., Great Neck, NY). To record voltage-gated calcium channel currents, the bath solution consisted of 135 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM BaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 μM tetrodotoxin, pH 7.2. To record sodium currents, the bath solution consisted of 138 mM NaCl, 9 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 200 μM CdCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. The patch pipette solution contained 150 mM CsCl, 2 mM MgATP, 0.5 mM GTP, 2 mM BAPTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. Whole cell capacitative transients, elicited by 20-mV depolarizing steps, were compensated with the analog compensation circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier. The whole cell capacitance, a measure of membrane area, was read directly from the compensation control dial of the amplifier. Whole cell current amplitudes were normalized to this indirect measure of membrane area and are expressed as picoamperes/picofarad.Nimodipine (Research Biochemicals Inc., Natick, MA) was prepared fresh daily as a 5 mM stock solution in ethanol and diluted in bath solution immediately prior to use. Ω-CoTX (Bachem Bioscience, Philadelphia) was prepared as a 0.5 mM stock solution in distilled water, and aliquots were stored at −30°C. A fresh aliquot was diluted in the bath solution for each experiment. Drugs were pressure-applied from blunt-tipped, fire-polished micropipettes positioned ~5-10 mm from the cell.RESULTSExpression of N17ras Inhibits Increased Functional Expression of Calcium Channels Induced by NGF and bFGFTo determine whether or not p21ras is necessary for induction of calcium channels by growth factors, we have looked at the effects of NGF and bFGF on calcium channel current density in a PC12 cell line (17-2) coexpressing the dominant negative p21ras mutant, N17ras, along with the neomycin resistance marker. We first determined that untreated 17-2 cells, as well as the PC12 cell line (Z-1) expressing only the neomycin resistance marker, express calcium channel currents identical to those in untreated wild-type cells. This was done by examining the biophysical and pharmacological properties of both the composite whole cell current and its component currents. The current-voltage relationships show that for cells held at −90 mV, the voltage threshold for activation of the composite calcium channel current is approximately −25 mV, maximal current is observed at 10-20 mV, and the apparent reversal potential for the currents is ~90 mV (Fig. 1).In addition, each of the cell lines exhibits the same three pharmacologically distinct currents, a Ω-CoTX-sensitive component, a DHP-sensitive component, and a component that is resistant to these compounds. Serial application of the calcium channel antagonists Ω-CoTX and DHP (nimodipine) (Fig. 2) was used to measure the relative amount of each current component(12.Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Google Scholar). As an indirect measure of channel density for each current, whole cell current amplitudes for each component have been normalized to membrane capacitance and are expressed as current densities. Again, all of the cell lines are remarkably similar in the relative densities of each of the three component currents in the absence of growth factor treatment (Fig. 3; see Fig. 3 of (12.Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Google Scholar) for wild-type data). Inactivation time constants for the individual current components are also similar (see below). Therefore, in terms of the densities and types or properties of calcium channels expressed in the absence of growth factors, there are no differences between wild-type PC12 cells and PC12 cells expressing the neomycin resistance marker gene or the marker gene and the dominant negative N17ras mutant.Figure 2:Wild-type, Z-1, and 17-2 PC12 cells similarly express at least three pharmacologically distinct calcium channel currents. Pharmacologically distinct calcium channel currents were distinguished by sequential application of 5 μM Ω-CoTX and 5 μM nimodipine. The remaining current was defined as Ω-CoTX/nimodipine-resistant current. To facilitate comparison of records, all currents are scaled to similar size (note scale bar). Single exponential fits to current decays (Simplex optimization algorithm with user defined start parameters) were used to obtain inactivation time constants (τ). Growth factor treatment did not affect current kinetics in any of these three cell lines, although there were increases in the relative densities of all current components in wild-type and Z-1 cells (see Fig. 3). Recording procedures were identical to those described for Fig. 1, except that current records were refiltered at 2 kHz for display.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:Increases in calcium channel current densities due to chronic growth factor treatment of PC12 cells are inhibited in cells(17-2) expressing the dominant negative N17ras mutant. Cumulative data are shown for calcium channel current densities in PC12 cells constitutively expressing either the neomycin resistance marker (Z-1) or the neomycin resistance marker and the dominant negative N17ras mutant(17-2). Cells were grown with (NGF or bFGF) or without (untreated) growth factors for 5-8 days. Whole cell calcium channel current recordings and pharmacological dissection of the component currents with Ω-CoTX and nimodipine were performed as described for Figure 1:, Figure 2:. Individual component currents were normalized to cell membrane capacitance as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” Each column represents the mean ± S.E. of current densities taken from 6 to 33 cells. *, significant difference from the untreated condition assessed by Student's t test at p < 0.05. Because not every cell was tested with both Ω-CoTX and nimodipine, total current density may not exactly equal the sum of the three pharmacologically distinct current components.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Unlike wild-type PC12 cells, however, 17-2 PC12 cells fail to respond to growth factors with increased calcium channel current densities (Fig. 3). Total current density in untreated 17-2 cells (23.4 ± 2.3 pA/pF, mean ± S.E., n = 30) does not significantly increase after 5-8 days of treatment with NGF or bFGF (18.9 ± 1.2 pA/pF, n = 30; and 28.1 ± 3.8 pA/pF, n = 15, respectively). Moreover, bFGF or NGF treatment does not change the densities of any of the three component calcium channel currents in 17-2 PC12 cells. The densities of the Ω-CoTX-sensitive, DHP-sensitive, and Ω-CoTX/DHP-resistant components in untreated 17-2 cells are 8.1 ± 1.2 pA/pF (n = 14), 9.2 ± 1.6 pA/pF (n = 9), and 7.8 ± 1.9 pA/pF (n = 9), respectively, compared with 8.2 ± 1.0 pA/pF (n = 13), 4.9 ± 0.6 pA/pF (n = 13), and 10.0 ± 1.7 pA/pF (n = 7) with NGF and 10.2 ± 1.7 pA/pF (n = 12), 7.5 ± 1.9 pA/pF (n = 6), and 12.4 ± 4 pA/pF (n = 6) with bFGF. At this point, we do not know the reason for the small but statistically significant decrease in DHP-sensitive current in 17-2 cells treated with NGF. NGF also fails to increase total and Ω-CoTX-sensitive calcium channel current densities in a second PC12 line(17-26) expressing N17ras (data not shown). As has been reported previously(18.Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Google Scholar, 31.Szeberényi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Google Scholar), we observed that expression of N17ras blocks stimulation of neurite outgrowth by both bFGF and NGF.We found that Z-1 cells, the 17-2 counterpart cell line expressing only the neomycin resistance marker, respond to application of NGF or bFGF in the same manner as wild-type PC12 cells, with increased functional calcium channel expression (Fig. 3). After 5-8 days of treatment with NGF or bFGF, the total calcium channel current density in Z-1 cells increases >3-fold, from 20.3 ± 2.2 pA/pF (mean ± S.E., n = 33) to 62.8 ± 3.3 pA/pF (n = 21) and 70.3 ± 7.7 pA/pF (n = 33), respectively. The Ω-CoTX-sensitive current component increases from 6.1 ± 1.1 pA/pF (n = 16) to 32.8 ± 2.8 pA/pF (n = 11) and 28.8 ± 4.7 pA/pF (n = 6) for NGF- and bFGF-treated Z-1 cells, respectively. Compared with wild-type PC12 cells, Z-1 cells respond to growth factors with relatively larger increases in the Ω-CoTX/nimodipine-resistant current component. NGF and bFGF increase this component from 9.1 ± 0.1 pA/pF (n = 8) to 30.4 ± 3.2 pA/pF (n = 7) and 38.8 ± 7.3 pA/pF (n = 6), respectively. Like wild-type cells, Z-1 cells also show a small but statistically significant increase in the nimodipine-sensitive current component. Thus, the growth factor-induced increases for both total and Ω-CoTX-sensitive calcium channel current densities in Z-1 PC12 cells are similar to those reported for wild-type PC12 cells(10.Plummer M.R. Logothetis D.E. Hess P. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1453-1463Google Scholar, 11.Usowicz M.M. Porzig H. Becker C. Reuter H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 426: 95-116Google Scholar, 12.Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Google Scholar, 32.Reuter H. Bouron A. Neuhaus R. Becker C. Reber B.F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 249: 211-216Google Scholar). Z-1 cells also extend neurites in response to NGF or bFGF. These results and those from the two cell lines expressing the dominant negative N17ras mutant and the neomycin resistance marker suggest that expression of N17ras specifically inhibits growth factor-induced increases in calcium channel functional expression in PC12 cells.It seems unlikely that the failure of growth factors to increase calcium current densities in cells expressing N17ras could be due to clonal selection of cells lacking the appropriate growth factor-sensitive calcium channel types. As shown above, based on threshold voltage for activation, voltage for maximal current, and pharmacological sensitivities, composite whole cell calcium channel currents are identical among untreated wild-type, 17-2, and Z-1 PC12 cells. Also, untreated cells from each of the lines express, in roughly equal amounts, currents sensitive to either Ω-CoTX or nimodipine and a current resistant to both drugs.To kinetically describe individual calcium channel current components, we have applied Ω-CoTX and then digitally subtracted the remainder current from the initial current to obtain #x0201C;pure”Ω-CoTX-resistant and Ω-CoTX-sensitive component currents. Inactivation time constants were then determined for each component (Fig. 2). In wild-type cells, inactivation kinetics of the Ω-CoTX-sensitive and Ω-CoTX-resistant currents observed for untreated cells (mean τ = 122 and 913 ms, n = four cells) are essentially unchanged by growth factor treatment (τ= 153 and 950 ms, n = four cells), suggesting that there is an increase in channel numbers, but no change in channel types(12.Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Google Scholar). This result was confirmed for Z-1 and 17-2 cells, and among all three lines, inactivation time constants for these two current types are comparable both with and without growth factor treatment. The inactivation time constants in untreated Z-1 and 17-2 cells for Ω-CoTX-sensitive (τ= 125 and 135 ms, n = three to eight cells throughout) and Ω-CoTX-resistant (τ= 890 and 879 ms) currents are unaffected by either NGF (τ= 150 and 167 ms for Z-1 and 17-2 Ω-CoTX-sensitive currents; τ= 914 and 811 ms for Ω-CoTX-resistant currents) or bFGF (τ= 156 and 139 ms and τ= 799 and 907 ms). Thus, each cell type under all treatment conditions has similar current components, and in each, the Ω-CoTX-sensitive component inactivates much faster than the Ω-CoTX-insensitive components. In this regard, our results are consistent with other studies on wild-type PC12 cells (6.Garber S.S. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3976-3987Google Scholar, 10.Plummer M.R.

However, it is possible that N17ras may inhibit growth factor induction of calcium channels (and neurite outgrowth) by down-regulating NGF and bFGF receptors. If this is the case, then there should also be inhibition of other key features of bFGF- and NGF-induced differentiation, such as expression of Type I and II sodium channels(5.Mandel G. Cooperman S.S. Maue R.A. Goodman R.H. Brehm P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 924-928Google Scholar, 7.Pollock J.D. Krempin M. Rudy B. J.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 607-611Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we assayed sodium channel current density in 17-2 (and Z-1) cells after 5-8 days of treatment with NGF or bFGF. In agreement with Fanger et al.(29.Fanger G.R. Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. Maue R.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1977-1980Google Scholar), we found that constitutive N17ras expression does not inhibit growth factor-induced increases in sodium channel expression (Fig. 4). Although the absolute amount of sodium current induction differs between Z-1 and 17-2 cells, the 5-fold relative increase in response to NGF is the same for both lines and is comparable to the increase that we observed for wild-type PC12 cells (increase in mean current density from 3.1 ± 1.0 pA/pF (n = 25) to 26.1 ± 2.7 pA/pF (n = 22)). These results indicate that in cells expressing N17ras, NGF and bFGF receptors are present and competent to drive p21ras-independent processes such as sodium channel expression. Also, these results support the interpretation that the failure to observe calcium channel induction in these cells is not due to a deficit in growth factor receptor function, but is instead due to inhibition of a specific p21ras-dependent signaling pathway downstream of the receptors.Figure 4:Increases in sodium channel current densities due to chronic growth factor treatment of PC12 cells are not inhibited by the dominant negative N17ras mutant.

We took two approaches to activating p21ras to assess its sufficiency for calcium channel induction.First, cells transfected with a constitutively active form of p21ras, under the control of the inducible murine mammary tumor virus promoter (GSRas1)(28.D'Arcangelo G.

Early activation stages involve the release of the intramolecular repression caused by the signal reception N-terminal (A domain) of XylR on the central module of the protein. A genetic approach has been followed to locate the specific segment within A domain of XylR that is directly responsible for its down-regulation in the absence of inducer, as compared to that involved in effector (m-xylene) binding. For this, a reporter Escherichia coli strain carrying a monocopy transcriptional fusion of Pu to lacZ was transformed with a collection of plasmids encoding equivalent truncated varieties of XylR, consisting of nested and internal deletions throughout the entire A domain. Examination of the resulting phenotypes allowed the assignment of the A domain region near the central activation domain, as the portion of the protein responsible for the specific repression of XylR activity in the absence of m-xylene. In the presence of m-xylene, the protein XylR encoded by the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida, activates the σ54-dependent promoter Pu.

Examination of the resulting phenotypes allowed the assignment of the A domain region near the central activation domain, as the portion of the protein responsible for the specific repression of XylR activity in the absence of m-xylene. Strains of the genus Pseudomonas harboring the TOL plasmid pWW0 can grow on toluene, m-xylene, and p-xylene as the only carbon source owing to the activity of a complex catabolic pathway (summarized in Fig. 1) that proceeds in two major biochemical steps (Nakazawa et al., 1990). These are determined by two independent operons that become coordinately transcribed when bacteria face pathway substrates such as m-xylene (see Marqués and Ramos(1993) for a review). The main regulator of the system is the so-called XylR protein, a member of the family of prokaryotic enhancer-binding regulators that act in concert with the alternative σ factor σ54 (Morett and Segovia, 1993; North et al., 1993). In the presence of xylenes, XylR bound to upstream sequences activates the Pu promoter of the upper-TOL operon, thus triggering expression of the corresponding catabolic genes (de Lorenzo et al., 1991; Abril et al., 1991). The very early chain of events that translates the presence of xylenes into activation of Pu, involve effector-mediated conversion of XylR into a transcriptionally competent form. For this, the inducer binds directly to the N-terminal, signal reception module of XylR termed the A domain (Delgado and Ramos, 1994; Fernández et al., 1995; see Fig. 1) and triggers the release of the repression caused by this domain on the central portion of the protein that is involved in the contact and activation of the σ54-containing RNA polymerase (Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1995). This notion is based on the observation that deleting the entire A domain of XylR gives rise to a truncated protein that activates constitutively Pu in the absence of aromatic effectors, both in vivo (Fernández et al., 1995) and in vitro (Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1996). It seems, therefore, that the A domain of XylR has at least two functions: (a) recognition of the aromatic inducers and (b) intramolecular repression. Since these two are obviously connected, the question arises as whether discrete subdomains within the N-terminal module can be assigned to each of them. To explore the presence and the location of specific portions within the A module of XylR that are accountable for the central domain repression, we chose a reporter system in which the effect of changes in the regulator could be related immediately to a distinct phenotype in activation of Pu. Since all transcriptional control elements can be faithfully reproduced in Escherichia coli, this reporter system employs a derivative of E. coli YMC10 that had been lysogenized with an specialized λ phage containing a transcriptional Pu-lacZ fusion (Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1995). This strain (E. coli λRSPu) was transformed independently with each one of a collection of plasmids bearing truncated xylR alleles that differed only in A domain sequences (Fig. 1). These were generated with a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy (PCR) ( 1The abbreviation used is: PCRpolymerase chain reaction.) 1The abbreviation used is: PCRpolymerase chain reaction.described in the legends of Figure 2:, Figure 3:. The activity of the truncated products expressed in trans was measured as the accumulation in vivo of β-galactosidase in the presence or absence of the XylR effector m-xylene. Simultaneously to each activity assay, we examined the level of expression of each XylR-derived protein through Western blot assays (Fernández et al., 1995) to ensure that the proteins were produced at similar levels (not shown). polymerase chain reaction. polymerase chain reaction. To have a preliminary indication on the portion of the A domain of XylR involved in intramolecular repression, we sought to divide the A domain (211 amino acids, Inouye et al.(1988) and Shingler et al.(1993); see Fig. 2) in 6 large segments, that were progressively deleted from the N terminus (Fig. 2). These deletions were generated by amplifying with PCR the sequences of interest with an adequate collection of primers, so that the resulting products were flanked by EcoRI and BamHI sites as specified in the legend to Fig. 1. Transfer of the resulting DNA fragments to the specialized expression vector pPr (Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo(1995); see legend to Fig. 2) provided a translation initiation sequence and a leading ATG for expression of the six xylR deletion alleles shown in Fig. 2. These were named, respectively, Δ30, Δ120, Δ150, Δ180, Δ210, and Δ226. The corresponding proteins were produced in vivo at levels comparable to those of the wild-type XylR with the same expression system, as assessed by Western blot, and they were equally able to shut down expression of the Pr promoter of the xylR gene in an in vivo autorepression assay (Fernández et al. (1995); not shown). These experiments verified that the proteins were expressed at similar levels and that they were efficiently able to bind DNA. Intermediate deletions between positions 30 and 120 neither produced any detectable protein nor gave positive in an autorepression assay, and, thus, they were not further considered (not shown). The six productive deletions displayed very distinct phenotypes when the corresponding plasmids were transformed in the Pu-lacZ E. coli reporter strain (Fig. 2). While truncation of the 30 leading amino acids (XylRΔ30) gave rise to a protein with only a residual responsiveness to the XylR inducer, m-xylene (Fig. 2), subsequent removal of the protein segment up to position 120 (XylRΔ120) and beyond (XylRΔ150) gave rise to proteins unable to activate the Pu promoter to any significant extent. However, deletion of 30 additional amino acids (XylRΔ180) partially restored the ability of the protein to promote transcription (Fig. 2), although responsiveness to m-xylene was lost and the activity became constitutive. Deletion of 30 additional amino acids (XylRΔ210), which removed the A domain entirely, increased β-galactosidase accumulation to its highest level. Further deletions entering the Q-linker (XylRΔ226) did not result in an additional increase of promoter activity, while deletions beyond position 233, entering into the central C domain (Fig. 1), abolished any transcriptional activity of the resulting truncated proteins (not shown).Figure 2:Effect of sequential N-terminal deletions through the A domain in the transcriptional activity of XylR. The activity of the N-terminal truncated derivatives of the A module of XylR (211 amino acids, Fig. 1) indicated in the figure was monitored as accumulation of β-galactosidase in the E. coli strain λRSPu, that carried a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion. For construction and expression of each of the truncated proteins, the following strategy was pursued. A DNA fragment containing the wild-type xylR sequence was subjected to a PCR reaction using as direct primers (Fig. 1) various oligonucleotides (33-mers) that attached an EcoRI site to the left of the site of deletion desired. For the reverse priming of the reaction, the same oligonucleotide was used in all cases, that generated a BamHI site following the STOP codon of the xylR sequence, TAG. The amplified products were cloned as EcoRI-BamHI fragments of different sizes at the same sites of vector pPr. This is a derivative of pCG1 (Myers et al., 1987) in which the native Pr promoter of xylR within the TOL plasmid (Fig. 1) has been engineered in front of the same polylinker as pTrc99A (Amman et al., 1988), that is led by an NcoI site overlapping a first structural ATG. This allowed all truncated proteins to be expressed through the very same native promoter and translation initiation regions as the wild-type xylR. The use of the direct EcoRI primers in the PCR reaction introduced in all cases amino acid residues EF (corresponding to 5′-GAA TTC-3′), next to the leading methionine of the truncated products. Replacement of the second (Ser) and third (Leu) amino acid residue of the wild-type XylR protein by EF had no effect on protein activity (not shown). For the experiment of the figure, each of the E. coli λRSPu transformants were grown in LB medium (Miller, 1972) at 30°C up to an A600 = 0.5, after which they were exposed, as indicated, to saturating vapors of m-xylene. Accumulation of β-galactosidase (Miller, 1972) was then measured after 5 h of induction. The figures for the reporter product are indicated with respect to the site of the deletions corresponding to each truncated regulator. The values shown are the average of 3 independent experiments carried out with duplicate samples. The approximate location of the repression subdomain suggested by the results is indicated on top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results above confirmed the existence of a specific region within the A domain of XylR directly involved in intramolecular repression located between amino acid positions 150 and 210. To narrow down the location of the boundary, we made two additional deletions in 10-amino acid increments called XylRΔ160 and XylRΔ170. As shown in Fig. 2, while Δ160 remained inactive, Δ170 gave a substantial, but not full, constitutive activation of Pu, as compared to the maximum promoter activation caused by the deletion of the entire A domain (XylRΔ210, XylRΔ226). These results located the leftward limit of the repressor subdomain at around amino acid position 170, and, therefore, the whole functional module may span no more than 40 residues (or 60, if we also include some amino acids present at the hinge B domain, Fig. 1). To verify the location of the repressor segment of the A domain suggested by the phenotypes caused by the N-terminal deletions, we constructed additional xylR alleles bearing sequential truncations of the A domain starting in position 210 (i.e. at the C-terminal end of the module) and spanning increasingly larger segments toward the N-terminal end (see legend of Fig. 3 for the procedure employed for their construction). As before, production in vivo of the predicted mutant proteins was verified through autorepression assays and Western blot of the corresponding cell extracts (not shown). The phenotypes endowed by each of the constructions listed in Fig. 3 were examined as before with the results summarized in Fig. 3. As expected, deletions spanning large portions of the A domain (Δ60/210, Δ120/210, and Δ150/210) originated truncated proteins that were fully constitutive. It was most remarkable, however, that deletions Δ160/210, Δ180/210, and Δ190/210 (that are totally or partially deleted of the repressor subdomain), although capable of activating transcription in the absence of inducer, maintained a significant degree of responsiveness to m-xylene. Such responsiveness was lost when the leading N terminus was deleted also (truncation Δ30-Δ190/210). This suggested that such a leading region is involved in effector recognition, lifting of intramolecular repression, or both. Since deletions Δ160/210, Δ180/210, and Δ190/210 are predicted to offset considerably the relative positioning of the remaining A sequence with respect to the central domain of the protein, the regulation by m-xylene retained by these proteins indicated that effector binding and associated changes in protein structure do not involve per se specific interdomain interactions. In addition, simultaneous deletion of the segment 190-210 and the leading 30 amino acids gave rise to a constitutive low activity regulator (Fig. 3), that may reflect the need of an intact N terminus for any responsiveness to the effector. Specific repression seems, therefore, to be due exclusively to the portion of the A domain encompassing positions 160 to 226. Furthermore, the fact that the internal deletion Δ160/185 (that lacks the leftmost boundary of the repressor subdomain with the rest of the protein) is virtually inactive (Fig. 3) suggested that the protein segments determining the response to effector recognition may be connected to each other close to positions 160-170. In fact, deletion of the zone around 170 seems to originate a protein that is inhibited unspecifically by the remainder of the A domain (see below). Interestingly, Delgado and Ramos(1994) found that a mutation in residue 172 made the protein to respond to a new effector (m-nitrotoluene), thus indicating that some direct or indirect determinants of ligand specificity may lie also around position 170. The semiconstitutive phenotype of deletions Δ160/210, Δ180/210, and Δ190/210 (Fig. 3) indicated also that elimination of the repressor subdomain still affords a degree of down-regulation of XylR by the remainder of the A module. This phenomenon can be easily understood in light of the observations reported elsewhere (Fernández et al., 1995) on the inactivation of XylR through substitution of its A domain by a bulky heterologous protein module. On this basis, it is very likely that although deletions Δ160/210, Δ180/210, and Δ190/210 have lost the specific region involved in intramolecular repression, they still retain a portion of the protein that inhibits its full activity in the absence of inducer by a mere physical hindrance of an activation surface and not because of an specific interdomain interaction. The same argument explains the phenotype of the deletion Δ160/185 (Fig. 3), that is virtually inactive in vivo in spite of having lost a protein segment that enters a region involved in specific intramolecular repression (see above). In this case, the lower activity of Δ160/185 (Fig. 3) as compared to Δ180 (Fig. 2) is the likely result of the steric hindrance caused by the remainder of the A domain present in the truncated protein. Taken together, these results led to the conclusion that a protein segment as short at 40-50 amino acids fully accounts for the repression caused by the whole A domain on XylR in the absence of m-xylene. Our data are consistent also with the notion that only that portion of the A module maintains specific interactions with the central domain of the protein. In addition, the phenotypes originated by the internally truncated proteins (Fig. 3) suggest that the XylR portion involved in effector recognition may exist as a separate subdomain within the N-terminal module. Prediction of secondary structure within the region carried out with the PHD profile network method (Burkhard and Sander, 1993) indicated that amino acids 219 to 221 could be organized as a somewhat long (21 residues) α-helix. Interestingly, when compared to the library of protein crystal coordinates of the Brookhaven data bank, part of that α-helix and a few preceding residues (portion 204-222 of the A domain) bear significant resemblance to the region of the eukaryotic protein c-Fos (residues 168 to 186) that is involved in protein-protein interactions within a c-Fos/c-Jun/DNA co-crystal (Brookhaven ID code: 1FOS). This structural resemblance might be related to the specific interactions between the A domain and the central domain of XylR proposed to control the activity of the regulator (Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1995). On the contrary, no portion of the 160-220 region of XylR showed any structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of DctD, another member of the family of σ54-dependent regulators whose activity is regulated through intramolecular repression as well (Gu et al., 1994). The A domain of XylR is the key component of this activator that endows specificity in the response to m-xylene (Delgado and Ramos, 1994; Shingler and Moore, 1994), so that direct effector binding is translated into release of intramolecular repression (Delgado et al., 1995; Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1995). Although the precise mechanism by which this happens remains unsolved, the data presented in this work suggest that different portions of the A domain have specific roles in the process. It is possible that, similarly to what may happen to NtrC (Fiedler and Weiss, 1995), derepression could involve the dimerization of the N-terminal module in response to the reception of the activating signal. The different predictions raised by this hypothesis and other alternatives are currently under study in our laboratory."

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In vivo, peripherin expression is limited to sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory ganglia of the peripheral nervous system as well as a small subset of neurons in the central nervous system(7.Brody B.A. Ley C.A. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2391-2401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Leonard D.G.B. Gorham J.D. Cole P. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J.

Peripherin is first expressed at day 11.5 of rat embryogenesis in the newly formed sympathetic ganglia(8.Gorham J.D. Baker H. Kegler D. Ziff E.B. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Belecky-Adams et al.(18.Belecky-Adams T. Wight D.C. Kopchick J.J. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5056-5065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that a transgene containing 5.8 kilobases of peripherin 5′-flanking sequence achieved correct temporal and nervous system-specific expression in transgenic mice, although intragenic sequences contribute to correct expression in certain neuronal subtypes.

In order to identify the regulatory factors necessary for the cell-specific expression of peripherin, we have previously dissected its 5′-flanking sequence and localized a negative regulatory element (NRE) centered at −173 whose deletion results in elevated basal expression of the gene(1.Thompson M. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, there are two positive regulatory regions required for full induction in PC12 cells treated with NGF: a distal positive region approximately 2450 bp upstream of the transcription start site and a proximal constitutive region within 111 bp of the transcription start site(1.Thompson M. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We proposed a two-step model of transcriptional activation of peripherin by NGF in which dissociation of a repressor from the protein complex at the NRE, coupled with a positive signal from the distal positive element, results in complete activation of the gene. We also showed that a multiprotein complex containing a member of the CTF/NF-1 family as the DNA-binding core protein interacts with the NRE(19.Adams A.D. Choate D.M. Thompson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6975-6983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The composition of this complex changes after NGF treatment, coincident with derepression of the peripherin gene. We have now finely mapped the distal positive element (DPE) necessary for the full expression of peripherin in NGF-treated PC12 cells. The isolated DPE is constitutively active in PC12 cells and retains significant activity in non-neuronal cells as well. We show that a distal negative element 5′ to the DPE (between −3710 and −2660) may restrict the activity of the DPE in non-neuronal cells. Here we present a detailed analysis of the minimal cis-acting sequences within the DPE that are necessary for its activity. Methylation interference footprinting of the DPE demonstrates two protein binding sites, a unique inverted repeat sequence as well as a sequence 38 bp upstream that resembles an Ets protein binding site. The ets protooncogene family is a novel class of eukaryotic sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins ((20.Le Prince D. Gegonne A. Coll J. DeTaisne C. Schneeberger A. Lagrou C. Stehelin D.

The Ets proteins are related to each other based on sequence similarity in the ETS domain, which is the DNA binding domain. The Ets family proteins recognize purine-rich sequences characterized by an invariant GGA core sequence(23.Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 24.Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J.

Several members of the Ets family function as transcriptional activators, and a subset of these Ets family proteins are thought to require cooperation with other DNA-binding proteins for their activity ((26.Wasylyk C. Kerckaert J-P. Wasylyk B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), reviewed in (21.Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys.

In this report we present evidence that an Ets-related protein interacts with a novel inverted repeat binding protein to form a transcriptionally active complex at the DPE. Stock cultures of PC12 cells were maintained as described previously(27.Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PC12 cells grown for nuclear extract preparation were plated on plastic culture dishes coated with collagen (Celtrix Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) at a density of 3 × 106 cells/150-mm dish. NGF was added 24 h after plating (50 ng/ml; 2.5 S, Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% defined and supplemented calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Nuclear extracts were prepared from PC12 cells and NIH 3T3 cells according to the method of Dignam et al.(28.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 14: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9155) Google Scholar). Differentiated PC12 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 5 days prior to harvesting, unless otherwise indicated. The conditions for the DNA-protein binding reactions were essentially as described previously (1.Thompson M. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Competition experiments included 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides unless otherwise indicated. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5 or 4% polyacrylamide gels (30:0.8, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) under conditions described previously(29.Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Supershift assays were performed by preincubating nuclear extract with 2 μl of polyclonal antibodies for 1.5 h at 4°C prior to the addition of the DNA probe. The anti-ets-1 antibody was raised against a peptide representing a portion of the DNA binding domain that is highly conserved among Ets family members (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HMGI(Y) and pre-immune serum were generous gifts from Dimitris Thanos (Columbia University). The anti-human interleukin-8 was obtained from Endogen (Boston, MA). The −3710-CAT, −2660-CAT, and −2308-CAT reporter constructs were constructed as described previously (1.Thompson M. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A series of reporter constructs containing 5′ and 3′ deletions within the distal positive region were generated by PCR technology. Successively smaller segments of the distal positive region (−2660 to −2308) were synthesized by PCR using primers with HindIII tails. Reactions were run with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) for 25 amplification cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) as described by Saiki et al.(30.Saiki R.D. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf J.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13489) Google Scholar). Reaction products were cut with HindIII, gel-purified, and subcloned into the HindIII site at the 5′ boundary of the −2308-CAT construct. This introduces 10 bp of polylinker sequence between the PCR fragment and the peripherin sequence in the −2308-CAT plasmid. Comparison of the activity of the −2660-CAT plasmid produced using a −2660 to −2308 PCR fragment with the activity of the uninterrupted −2660-CAT plasmid demonstrated no significant effect of this insertion (data not shown). The orientation and sequence of the inserted fragment were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing(31.Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J. Roe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). Plasmids with mutations in the Ets-like site, the inverted repeat site, or both sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel et al.(32.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 138-bp HindIII DNA fragment containing the peripherin sequence (−2446 to −2308) was subcloned into M13MP19 and used as a template for mutagenesis. In vitro mutagenesis was then performed with the following oligonucleotides: oligonucleotide I, 5′-CAATGGAGAAGGTCATGAATACTCAGTCACCTTCC-3′ (mutant inverted repeat site); and oligonucleotide II, 5′-CCCTTTAACACAGACAGTAATACTTTGCTG-3′ (mutant Ets-like site). The underlined nucleotides are the mutated ones. Clones containing a single mutation (I or II) or both mutations (I and II) were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing, and the −2445 to −2308 HindIII insert was subcloned back into −2308-CAT to generate the mutant −2445-CAT constructs. Orientation of the mutant insert was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing. Wild type −2445-CAT and the mutant −2445-CAT mutant constructs were used as templates for PCR to generate wild type and mutant 109-bp fragments (−2445 to −2337) with HindIII ends for use as probes and competitors in EMSAs. The wild type 109-bp fragment (−2445 to −2337) with HindIII ends was subcloned into the pBLCAT2 vector (33.Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) to generate a hybrid peripherin-TK-CAT reporter construct. PBLCAT2 contains nucleotides −105 to +51 of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The orientation and sequence of the inserted fragment was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing before use. Transient transfection of equimolar amounts of supercoiled peripherin-CAT plasmids into PC12 cells by electroporation was performed as described previously(34.Flug F. Copp R.P. Casanova J. Horowitz Z.D. Janocko L. Plotnick M. Samuels H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6373-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electroporation, cells in each electroporation cuvette were distributed to two collagen-coated 10-cm dishes. Cells in one plate of each pair were stimulated with NGF for a total of 44-46 h of exposure. Cells were harvested 44-48 h after the time of transfection, and CAT enzymatic assays were performed as described by Gorman et al.(35.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity expressed by an internal standard plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter linked to the β-galactosidase gene. B-galactosidase activity was determined as described by An et al.(36.An G. Hidaka K. Siminovitch L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1628-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays using 3T3 cells were performed by the calcium phosphate method as described by Velcich and Ziff(37.Velcich A. Ziff E.B. Cell. 1985; 40: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The wild type 109-bp PCR fragment with HindIII ends spanning −2445 to −2337 (see above) was cloned into pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cloned plasmid was linearized with either HindIII or BamHI, treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), end-labeled with [32P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA), and recut with the second restriction enzyme (BamHI or HindIII) to generate labeled coding or noncoding DNA strands. The labeled fragments were purified by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and partially methylated by dimethyl sulfate as described by Baldwin et al.(38.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, Brooklyn, NY1987Google Scholar). Binding reaction mixtures contained 30 μg of nuclear extract protein and 5 × 105 cpm of partially methylated probe. After EMSA, DNA was eluted in 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA from gel pieces containing bound or free DNA, as described by Thompson et al.(1.Thompson M. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rest of the procedure was performed as described by Baldwin et al.(38.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, Brooklyn, NY1987Google Scholar). Maxam and Gilbert G-specific and purine-specific reactions were run for orientation (39.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in DNA mobility shift assays were flanked by HindIII restriction sites, synthesized on a Milligen Biosearch Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer, and gelpurified. Previously, a region between −2660 and −2308 of the peripherin 5′-flanking DNA was shown to be necessary for significant activity of the peripherin gene in response to NGF(1.Thompson M. Lee E. Lawe D. Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2501-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to define the minimal sequence necessary for activity, we used PCR technology to construct a series of peripherin-CAT reporter constructs with progressive deletions from −2660 to −2308 (Fig. 1B). The peripherin-CAT reporter constructs were transiently transfected into PC12 cells, which were subsequently treated with or without NGF. Fig. 1A summarizes their activities in PC12 cells in response to NGF. The −2660-CAT construct responds 5-fold to NGF and has 10-fold more activity than the −2308-CAT construct. There is a 7-fold drop in the activity of the −2370-CAT construct relative to the −2396-CAT construct in NGF-treated cells, defining a 26-bp sequence necessary for positive activity in response to NGF. The observation that a construct missing −2397 to −2308 (−2397 3′-CAT) responds less than 2-fold to NGF treatment confirms the importance of the region 3′ of −2396 containing the 26-bp element. The increase in activity upon deletion from −2660 to −2445 suggests the presence of an additional negative element in this regulatory region. Upon inspection, we noted that the sequence of the 26-bp region (−2396 to −2370) necessary for activity of the peripherin promoter in response to NGF contains an inverted repeat sequence, AACCACTGGTT (Fig. 2B). This is suggestive of a protein recognition element, since DNA-binding proteins are often dimers that recognize a site with dyad symmetry(40.Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar, 41.Ziff E.B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) . We attempted to perform DNA mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to this 26-bp sequence and nuclear extracts from differentiated PC12 cells. No specific DNA-protein complex was observed (data not shown). However, when nuclear extracts from differentiated PC12 cells (treated for either 12 h or 5 days with NGF) were incubated with a 109-bp fragment (-2445 to -2337) containing the 26-bp sequence and flanking DNA, a strong and specific retarded DNA-protein complex was observed (Fig. 2A, lane 1). This 109-bp sequence (-2445 to -2337) is referred to as the DPE. In EMSAs, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor fragments containing either the 26-bp sequence or the region upstream of the 26-bp sequence (-2445 to -2397) successfully competes for binding of proteins to the radiolabeled probe (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 4, and 5). However, competitor fragments containing either the region 3′ to the 26-bp sequence or an extraneous oligonucleotide (E-box) were significantly less effective as competitors (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). This indicates that binding is dependent on both the 26-bp element and a sequence immediately upstream. Inspection of this 5′ sequence reveals two regions with GGA motifs that form the invariant core of DNA binding sites recognized by Ets family proteins(23.Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 24.Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25.Woods D.B. Ghysdael J. Owen M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) . One site is centered around nucleotide -2430, and the second site is immediately upstream from the 26-bp element, around -2402. To determine where DNA-protein contacts occur within the DPE, we performed methylation interference footprinting with the 109-bp DPE probe. Fig. 3 demonstrates that two sites are contacted by proteins. First, probe molecules methylated at two Gs in the inverted repeat site and one G residue immediately 5′ are underrepresented in the retarded DNA-protein complex. A second region of protein-DNA contacts involves the GGA motif around nucleotide −2430. It is noteworthy that at this site footprinting implicates contact nucleotides in and adjacent to the GGA motif rather than the immediately 3′ GGAA, which is actually a more complete Ets protein core motif (see Fig. 3 and (23.Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 24.Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25.Woods D.B. Ghysdael J. Owen M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). In order to confirm that formation of the specific DNA-protein complex depends just upon the inverted repeat site and the Ets-like site, EMSAs were performed using the same radiolabeled probe as in Fig. 2B (DPE; −2445 to −2337) and nuclear extracts from PC12 cells treated with NGF for 5 days. Competitor fragments identical in length to the DPE probe but containing mutated nucleotides in the Ets-like site, the inverted repeat site, or both sites were generated by PCR using mutant templates created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations introduced into the Ets-like site or the inverted repeat site were as listed for the mutant oligonucleotides (E-, I-) in Table 1. Each nucleotide shown by methylation interference footprinting to contact protein was mutated; in addition, the 3′ GGAA was mutated in the E- oligonucleotide and additional palindromic nucleotides were mutated in the I- oligonucleotide. As expected, the unlabeled DPE competitor efficiently competed away proteins binding to the radiolabeled DPE probe; however, the 109-bp fragment with mutations in both footprinted sites (E-I-) is an ineffective competitor (Fig. 3B). Both fragments mutated in only one site were able to compete for the protein complex. However, the 109-bp fragment mutated in the Ets-like site (E-I+) alone was a much more effective competitor than the 109-bp fragment mutated in the inverted repeat site alone (E+I-). This competition data confirms the dependence of specific complex formation on the two sites identified by methylation interference footprinting.Tabled 1 The sequence surrounding the footprinted GGA motif at nucleotide −2430 is similar to the consensus sites for Ets-1 and Ets-2 (22.Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23.Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in 6 out of 10 bp, five of which are contiguous and include the GGA core. To test the hypothesis that an Ets family member participates in the formation of the specific DNA-protein complex at the DPE, antibody competition assays were performed using a polyclonal anti-ETS domain antibody. This antibody was raised against a peptide in the highly conserved DNA binding domain (ETS domain) of Ets-1 and cross-reacts with most Ets proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The −2445 to −2337 radiolabeled DPE probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from differentiated PC12 cells in the presence or absence of antibodies. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows that formation of the DNA-protein complex is disrupted by incubation of extract with anti-ETS domain antibodies prior to addition of the DNA probe (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Two antibodies of unrelated specificity (anti-HMG and anti-interleukin 8), as well as preimmune serum, have no effect on DNA-protein complex formation (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-4). A further control experiment in the right panel of Fig. 4 shows that the anti-ETS domain antibody has no effect on DNA-protein complex formation with an Sp1 probe, as expected. These results support the hypothesis that an Ets family protein binds to the DPE at a novel Ets-binding site.
