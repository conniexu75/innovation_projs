https://openalex.org/W2005723624,"Unlike other shell-enclosed marine invertebrates, articulate brachiopods are repellent to predators. Fish, sea stars, snails, and crabs all prefer bivalve molluscs such as mussels to articulates. The mussels tested are mobile and out-compete immobile articulates when space is limited. In subtidal field experiments, mussels alone and predators alone each reduced the survivorship of articulates. However, adding mussels to articulates in the presence of ambient predation increased brachiopod survivorship by diverting predation from the brachiopods to the mussels. Competition from mussels (or mussel-like bivalves) is a plausible cause of the post-Paleozoic decline of articulates."

In the anoxic pore waters, the low zinc concentrations can be explained as due to the formation of relatively insoluble zinc sulfide minerals. Downward diffusive fluxes of dissolved zinc account for at least 50 to 75 percent of the recent zinc deposition to the sediments of these lakes. This downward diffusion occurs to a depth of 2 to 3 centimeters below the sediment water interface, where pronounced maxima in total zinc are observed. These subsurface peaks in total zinc have been interpreted as an indication of recent lake acidification. The present observations indicate that such subsurface peaks may also result from a diagenetic activity unrelated to recent changes in lake acidity."
https://openalex.org/W2053200498,"The shallow-water limestones and dolostones of the Conococheague Limestone (Upper Cambrian) of western Maryland contain large amounts of authigenic potassium feldspar. The presence of halite daughter crystals in breached fluid inclusions, low whole-rock ratios of chlorine to bromine, and thermochemical data suggest that the potassium feldspar formed at low temperature by the reaction of connate brines with intercalated siliciclastic debris. Analyses of argon age spectra indicate that the authigenic feldspar probably formed during Late Pennsylvanian to Early Permian time. These results may indicate mobilization and migration of connate brines brought about by Alleghanian folding. The widespread occurrence of authigenic potassium feldspar in Cambrian and Ordovician carbonate rocks throughout the Appalachians suggests that this may have occurred throughout the entire basin."

https://openalex.org/W2988881899,"In analyzing data on the chemical composition of rainwater, Gorham et al, claim that hydrogen ions are correlated much more closely with sulfate than with nitrate and also that the H/sup +/ correlation with the sum of SO/sub 4//sup 2 -/ and NO/sub 3//sup -/ is slightly less than that between H/sup +/ and SO/sub 4//sup 2 -/ alone. Here, the authors point out several shortcomings in this analysis, and suggest that less sweeping conclusions are appropriate. A reply by the original authors is included. 3 references."
