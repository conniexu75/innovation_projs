https://openalex.org/W3208795162,"Replisome disassembly is the final step of eukaryotic DNA replication and is triggered by ubiquitylation of the CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) replicative helicase1-3. Despite being driven by evolutionarily diverse E3 ubiquitin ligases in different eukaryotes (SCFDia2 in budding yeast1, CUL2LRR1 in metazoa4-7), replisome disassembly is governed by a common regulatory principle, in which ubiquitylation of CMG is suppressed before replication termination, to prevent replication fork collapse. Recent evidence suggests that this suppression is mediated by replication fork DNA8-10. However, it is unknown how SCFDia2 and CUL2LRR1 discriminate terminated from elongating replisomes, to selectively ubiquitylate CMG only after termination. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to solve high-resolution structures of budding yeast and human replisome-E3 ligase assemblies. Our structures show that the leucine-rich repeat domains of Dia2 and LRR1 are structurally distinct, but bind to a common site on CMG, including the MCM3 and MCM5 zinc-finger domains. The LRR-MCM interaction is essential for replisome disassembly and, crucially, is occluded by the excluded DNA strand at replication forks, establishing the structural basis for the suppression of CMG ubiquitylation before termination. Our results elucidate a conserved mechanism for the regulation of replisome disassembly in eukaryotes, and reveal a previously unanticipated role for DNA in preserving replisome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W3210397188,"Capirona (Calycophyllum spruceanum (Benth.) K. Schum.) and Bolaina (Guazuma crinita Lam.) are fast-growing Amazonian trees with increasing demand in timber industry. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the content of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin in juvenile trees to accelerate forest breeding programs. The aim of this study was to identify chemical differences between apical and basal stem of Capirona and Bolaina to develop models for estimating the chemical composition using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. FTIR-ATR spectra were obtained from 150 samples for each species that were 1.8 year-old. The results showed significant differences between the apical and basal stem for each species in terms of cellulose, hemicellulose, holocellulose and lignin content. This variability was useful to build partial least squares (PLS) models from the FTIR spectra and they were evaluated by root mean squared error of predictions (RMSEP) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Lignin content was efficiently predicted in Capirona (RMSEP = 0.48, RPD > 2) and Bolaina (RMSEP = 0.81, RPD > 2). In Capirona, the predictive power of cellulose, hemicellulose and holocellulose models (0.68 < RMSEP < 2.06, 1.60 < RPD < 1.96) were high enough to predict wood chemical composition. In Bolaina, model for cellulose attained an excellent predictive power (RMSEP = 1.82, RPD = 6.14) while models for hemicellulose and holocellulose attained a good predictive power (RPD > 2.0). This study showed that FTIR-ATR together with PLS is a reliable method to determine the wood chemical composition in juvenile trees of Capirona and Bolaina."
https://openalex.org/W3210833014,"Retraction of published research can reduce the dissemination of incorrect or misleading information, but concerns have been raised about the clarity and rigor of the retraction process. Failure to clearly and consistently retract research has several risks, for example discredited or erroneous research may inform health research studies (e.g. clinical trials), policies and practices, potentially rendering these unreliable.To investigate consistency and clarity of research retraction, based on a case study of retracted Covid-19 research.A cross-sectional study of retracted Covid-19 articles reporting empirical research findings, based on searches of Medline, Embase and Scopus on 10th July and 19th December 2020.We included 46 retracted Covid-19 articles. The number eligible for inclusion nearly doubled, from 26 to 46, in five months. Most articles (67%) were retracted from scientific journals and the remainder from preprint servers. Key findings: (1) reasons for retraction were not reported in 33% (15/46) of cases; (2) time from publication to retraction could not be determined in 43% (20/46) of cases; (3) More than half (59%) of retracted Covid-19 articles (27/46) remained available as original unmarked electronic documents after retraction (33% as full text and 26% as an abstract only). Sources of articles post-retraction were preprint servers, ResearchGate and, less commonly, websites including PubMed Central and the World Health Organization. A retracted journal article which controversially claimed a link between 5G technology and Covid-19 remains available in its original full text from at least 60 different websites.The retraction process is inconsistent and often ambiguous, with more than half of retracted Covid-19 research articles remaining available, unmarked, from a wide range of online sources. There is an urgent need to improve guidance on the retraction process and to extend this to cover preprint servers. We provide structured recommendations to address these concerns and to reduce the risks that arise when retracted research is inappropriately cited."
https://openalex.org/W3209047196,"Mammalian cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are nonselective cation channels activated by cGMP or cAMP and play essential roles in the signal transduction of the visual and olfactory sensory systems. CNGA1, the principal component of the CNG channel from rod photoreceptors, can by itself form a functional homotetrameric channel and has been used as the model system in the majority of rod CNG studies. However, the native rod CNG functions as a heterotetramer consisting of three A1 and one B1 subunits and exhibits different functional properties than the CNGA1 homomer. Here we present the functional analysis of human rod CNGA1/B1 heterotetramer and its cryo-EM structures in apo, cGMP-bound, cAMP-bound, and L-cis-Diltiazem-blocked states. These structures, with resolution ranging from 2.6 to 3.3 Ã…, elucidate the structural mechanisms underlying the 3:1 subunit stoichiometry, the asymmetrical gating upon cGMP activation, and the unique pharmacological property of the native rod CNG channel."
https://openalex.org/W3209567576,"Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) is an economically important and valuable spice crop around the world. It is used as food, spice, condiment, and medicine. A considerable extent of genetic diversity in ginger occurs in the Western Ghats and North-Eastern India. However, genetic diversity studies at the molecular level in ginger is limited due to limited availability of genetic and genomic information. In the present study, for the first time, we have identified and validated expressed sequence tag (EST)-simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from ginger. We obtained 16,790 EST-SSR loci from 78987 unigenes, and 4597 SSR loci in the predicted 76929 coding sequences from RNA-Seq assembled contigs of ginger through Illumina paired-end sequencing. Gene ontology results indicate that the unigenes with SSR loci participate in various biological processes such as metabolism, growth, and development in ginger. One hundred and twenty-five primer pairs were designed from unigenes and coding sequences. These primers were tested for PCR optimization, characterization, and amplification and identified 12 novel EST-SSR markers. Twelve flanking polymorphic EST-SSR primers were validated using 48 ginger genotypes representing North-Eastern India and different eco-geographical adaptations by PCR amplification and allele sizing through capillary electrophoresis. Twelve EST-SSR primers generated a total of 111 alleles with an average of 9.25 alleles per locus and allele sizes ranging between 115-189bp. This study implies that the SSR markers designed from transcriptome sequences provides ample EST-SSR resources, which are helpful for genetic diversity analysis of Zingiberaceae species and molecular verification of ginger genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3210658368,"Implicit racial bias affects many human interactions including patient-physician encounters. Its impact, however, varies between studies. We assessed the effects of physician implicit, racial bias on their management of cancer-related pain using a randomized field experiment.We conducted an analysis of a randomized field experiment between 2012 and 2016 with 96 primary care physicians and oncologists using unannounced, Black and White standardized patients (SPs)who reported uncontrolled bone pain from metastatic lung cancer. We assessed implicit bias using a pain-adaptation of the race Implicit Association Test. We assessed clinical care by reviewing medical records and prescriptions, and we assessed communication from coded transcripts and covert audiotapes of the unannounced standardized patient office visits. We assessed effects of interactions of physicians' implicit bias and SP race with clinical care and communication outcomes. We conducted a slopes analysis to examine the nature of significant interactions.As hypothesized, physicians with greater implicit bias provided lower quality care to Black SPs, including fewer renewals for an indicated opioid prescription and less patient-centered pain communication, but similar routine pain assessment. In contrast to our other hypotheses, physician implicit bias did not interact with SP race for prognostic communication or verbal dominance. Analysis of the slopes for the cross-over interactions showed that greater physician bias was manifested by more frequent opioid prescribing and greater discussion of pain for White SPs and slightly less frequent prescribing and pain talk for Black SPs with the opposite effect among physicians with lower implicit bias. Findings are limited by use of an unvalidated, pain-adapted IAT.Using SP methodology, physicians' implicit bias was associated with clinically meaningful, racial differences in management of uncontrolled pain related to metastatic lung cancer. There is favorable treatment of White or Black SPs, depending on the level of implicit bias."
https://openalex.org/W3211007033,"The damselfishes (family Pomacentridae) inhabit near-shore communities in tropical and temperature oceans as one of the major lineages in coral reef fish assemblages. Our understanding of their evolutionary ecology, morphology and function has often been advanced by increasingly detailed and accurate molecular phylogenies. Here we present the next stage of multi-locus, molecular phylogenetics for the group based on analysis of 12 nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences from 345 of the 422 damselfishes. The resulting well-resolved phylogeny helps to address several important questions about higher-level damselfish relationships, their evolutionary history and patterns of divergence. A time-calibrated phylogenetic tree yields a root age for the family of 55.5 mya, refines the age of origin for a number of diverse genera, and shows that ecological changes during the Eocene-Oligocene transition provided opportunities for damselfish diversification. We explored the idea that body size extremes have evolved repeatedly among the Pomacentridae, and demonstrate that large and small body sizes have evolved independently at least 40 times and with asymmetric rates of transition among size classes. We tested the hypothesis that transitions among dietary ecotypes (benthic herbivory, pelagic planktivory and intermediate omnivory) are asymmetric, with higher transition rates from intermediate omnivory to either planktivory or herbivory. Using multistate hidden-state speciation and extinction models, we found that both body size and dietary ecotype are significantly associated with patterns of diversification across the damselfishes, and that the highest rates of net diversification are associated with medium body size and pelagic planktivory. We also conclude that the pattern of evolutionary diversification in feeding ecology, with frequent and asymmetrical transitions between feeding ecotypes, is largely restricted to the subfamily Pomacentrinae in the Indo-West Pacific. Trait diversification patterns for damselfishes across a fully resolved phylogeny challenge many recent general conclusions about the evolution of reef fishes."
https://openalex.org/W3209637792,"This study aimed to generate a linguistic equivalent of the COVID Stress Scales (CSS) in the Serbian language and examine its psychometric characteristics. Data were collected from September to December 2020 among the general population of three cities in Republic of Serbia and Republic of Srpska, countries where the Serbian language is spoken. Participants completed a socio-demographic questionnaire, followed by the CSS and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The CSS was validated using the standard methodology (i.e., forward and backward translations, pilot testing). The reliability of the Serbian CSS was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients and convergent validity was evaluated by correlating the CSS with PSS. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine the construct validity of the Serbian CSS. This study included 961 persons (52.8% males and 47.2% females). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the Serbian CSS was 0.964 and McDonald's omega was 0.964. The Serbian CSS with 36 items and a six-factorial structure showed a measurement model with a satisfactory fit for our population (CMIN/DF = 4.391; GFI = 0.991; RMSEA = 0.025). The CSS total and all domain scores significantly positively correlated with PSS total score. The Serbian version of the CSS is a valid and reliable questionnaire that can be used in assessing COVID-19-related distress experienced by Serbian speaking people during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future epidemics and pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3208993923,"Due to the problems related to the numerous factors affecting the spontaneous combustion of goaf coal, such as sudden, uncertain, and dynamic changes, and the fact that the weight of the indexes in the prediction model of the spontaneous combustion risk is difficult to determine, an improved Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) modified Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution G2-(TOPSIS) dynamic prediction model of goaf spontaneous combustion was developed. An optimal decision-making model was established by introducing the Euclidean distance function, and the function-driven type G2 weighting method was modified using the differential-driven type weighting method of the CRITIC. In addition, the comprehensive weights of each index were obtained. An update factor was introduced to obtain the dynamic weight, and the primary-secondary relationship of the risk factors affecting the spontaneous combustion of goaf was evaluated. Based on the G2 weighting method, which approximates the driving function principle of the ideal solution ranking method (TOPSIS), a G2-TOPSIS goaf spontaneous combustion risk assessment model was established. The degree of closeness was analyzed and the risk grade of the goaf spontaneous combustion was finally predicted. The sub-model was applied to the goaf of working face 1303 in the Jinniu Coal Mine. It was concluded that the air leakage duration was the dominant factor inducing the risk of the spontaneous combustion of the goaf. The risk grade of spontaneous combustion of the goaf is Class III, and the predicted results are consistent with the actual situation. The improved CRITIC-G2-TOPSIS dynamic model was demonstrated to be scientific in predicting the goaf spontaneous combustion risk, and these research results have important popularization and application value."
https://openalex.org/W3209670998,"Some people feel they are invincible to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). They believe that being infected with COVID-19 would not be a serious threat to their health. While these people may or may not be correct in their personal risk assessment, we find that such perceived invincibility may undermine community efforts to achieve herd immunity. Multi-level analysis of survey respondents across 51 countries finds that perceived invincibility from COVID-19 is negatively associated with believing there is a need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in one's community (n = 218,956) and one's willingness to inoculate against the disease (n = 71,148). These effects are most pronounced among individuals from countries lower in cultural collectivism (e.g., USA, UK, Canada) and highlight the need to consider the interplay of individual and cultural factors in our efforts to understand, predict, and promote preventative health behavior during a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3210664044,"Selective attention modulates neuronal activity in multiple brain regions, but the origins of attention signals remain unclear. We show that, during a visual task requiring spatial attention directed by an auditory cue, an inferior-superior colliculus circuit provides the key attention signal. In mice performing a task based on a visual stimulus in the cued hemifield while ignoring a conflicting stimulus on the uncued side, the visual cortex (V1) and superior colliculus (SC) showed strong attentional modulation, with a shorter latency in the SC. The nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus (nBIC), which provides auditory inputs to the SC, was activated not only at auditory cue onset but also during the delay period before the visual stimulus. The delay activity, but not cue onset activity, was crucial for task performance and attentional modulation in the SC and V1. These results establish a new behavioral paradigm for studying visual attention in mice and identify a midbrain signal controlling auditory cue-directed spatial attention."
https://openalex.org/W3211328646,"Studies relating obesity to cognition in older people show conflicting results, which may be explained by the choice of obesity indicators.This study aimed to investigate the relationship between obesity-related indicators and cognitive impairment, especially between different age or gender subgroups, and explore whether obesity-related indicators were related to specific cognitive domains.This was a cross-sectional study on 1753 participants aged â‰¥ 60 years (41.0% men; aged 71.36 Â± 5.96 years). Obesity-related indicators included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), calf circumference (CC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist to calf circumstance ratio (WCR), fat to fat-free mass ratio (FM/FFM). The Mini-Mental State Examination scale (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score â‰¤ 17 for illiterates, â‰¤ 20 for participants with primary school education, and â‰¤ 24 for those with junior high school degrees or above. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines were used to analyze and visualize the linear relationships.The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 18.77%. In the fully adjusted model, CC was negatively associated with cognitive impairment (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.98). Further analysis showed that CC correlated positively with recall and place orientation. A higher FM/FFM was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (OR: 1.44, 95%CI: 0.88-2.35, P for trend = 0.029); this association was notable in women (P for trend = 0.002) and the oldest (P for trend = 0.009), and so did the potential effect of BMI on cognitive impairment (70-80 years: P for trend = 0.011; â‰¥ 80 years: P for trend = 0.013). No statistically significant association was found between cognitive impairment and WC, WHR, or WCR.CC and FM/FFM were associated with cognitive impairment in older people. Future research needs to distinguish the effects of fat and muscle mass on cognitive function, with special attention to different ages and genders."
https://openalex.org/W3209280494,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are highly-conserved pattern recognition receptors that mediate innate immune responses to invading pathogens and endogenous danger signals released from damaged and dying cells. Activation of TLRs trigger downstream signaling cascades, that culminate in the activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which subsequently leads to type I interferon (IFN) response. In the current study, we sought to expand the scope of gene expression changes in THP1-derived macrophages upon TLR4 activation and to identify interferon-stimulated genes. RNA-seq analysis led to the identification of several known and novel differentially expressed genes, including CMPK2, particularly in association with type I IFN signaling. We performed an in-depth characterization of CMPK2 expression, a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that supplies intracellular UTP/CTP for nucleic acid synthesis in response to type I IFN signaling in macrophages. CMPK2 was significantly induced at both RNA and protein levels upon stimulation with TLR4 ligand-LPS and TLR3 ligand-Poly (I:C). Confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation indicated CMPK2 localization in both cytoplasm and mitochondria of THP-1 macrophages. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody-based inhibition of IFNAR receptor in THP-1 cells and BMDMs derived from IFNAR KO and IRF3 KO knockout mice further revealed that CMPK2 expression is dependent on LPS/Poly (I:C) mediated IRF3- type I interferon signaling. In summary, our findings suggest that CMPK2 is a potential interferon-stimulated gene in THP-1 macrophages and that CMPK2 may facilitate IRF3- type I IFN-dependent anti-bacterial and anti-viral roles."
https://openalex.org/W3209459379,"Healthcare spending in the emergency department (ED) setting has received intense focus from policymakers in the United States (U.S.). Relatively few studies have systematically evaluated ED spending over time or disaggregated ED spending by policy-relevant groups, including health condition, age, sex, and payer to inform these discussions. This study's objective is to estimate ED spending trends in the U.S. from 2006 to 2016, by age, sex, payer, and across 154 health conditions and assess ED spending per visit over time.This observational study utilized the National Emergency Department Sample, a nationally representative sample of hospital-based ED visits in the U.S. to measure healthcare spending for ED care. All spending estimates were adjusted for inflation and presented in 2016 U.S. Dollars. Overall ED spending was $79.2 billion (CI, $79.2 billion-$79.2 billion) in 2006 and grew to $136.6 billion (CI, $136.6 billion-$136.6 billion) in 2016, representing a population-adjusted annualized rate of change of 4.4% (CI, 4.4%-4.5%) as compared to total healthcare spending (1.4% [CI, 1.4%-1.4%]) during that same ten-year period. The percentage of U.S. health spending attributable to the ED has increased from 3.9% (CI, 3.9%-3.9%) in 2006 to 5.0% (CI, 5.0%-5.0%) in 2016. Nearly equal parts of ED spending in 2016 was paid by private payers (49.3% [CI, 49.3%-49.3%]) and public payers (46.9% [CI, 46.9%-46.9%]), with the remainder attributable to out-of-pocket spending (3.9% [CI, 3.9%-3.9%]). In terms of key groups, the majority of ED spending was allocated among females (versus males) and treat-and-release patients (versus those hospitalized); those between age 20-44 accounted for a plurality of ED spending. Road injuries, falls, and urinary diseases witnessed the highest levels of ED spending, accounting for 14.1% (CI, 13.1%-15.1%) of total ED spending in 2016. ED spending per visit also increased over time from $660.0 (CI, $655.1-$665.2) in 2006 to $943.2 (CI, $934.3-$951.6) in 2016, or at an annualized rate of 3.4% (CI, 3.3%-3.4%).Though ED spending accounts for a relatively small portion of total health system spending in the U.S., ED spending is sizable and growing. Understanding which diseases are driving this spending is helpful for informing value-based reforms that can impact overall health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W3210303992,"A well designed Health management information system is necessary for improving health service effectiveness and efficiency. It also helps to produce quality information and conduct evidence based monitoring, adjusting policy implementation and resource use. However, evidences show that data quality is poor and is not utilized for program decisions in Ethiopia especially at lower levels of the health care and it remains as a major challenge.Facility based cross sectional study design was employed. A total of 18 health centers and 302 health professionals were selected by simple random sampling using lottery method from each selected health center. Data was collected by health professionals who were experienced and had training on HMIS tasks after the tools were pretested. Data quality was assessed using accuracy, completeness and timeliness dimensions. Seven indicators from national priority area were selected to assess data accuracy and monthly reports were used to assess completeness and timeliness. Statistical software SPSS version 20 for descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression was used for quantitative data analysis to identify candidate variable.A total of 291 respondents were participated in the study with response rate of 96%. Overall average data quality was 82.5%. Accuracy, completeness and timeliness dimensions were 76%, 83.3 and 88.4 respectively which was lower than the national target. About 52.2% respondents were trained on HMIS, 62.5% had supervisory visits as per standard and only 55.3% got written feedback. Only 11% of facilities assigned health information technicians. Level of confidence [AOR = 1.75, 95% CI (0.99, 3.11)], filling registration or tally completely [AOR = 3.4, 95% CI (1.3, 8.7)], data quality check, supervision AOR = 1.7 95% CI (0.92, 2.63) and training [AOR = 1.89 95% CI (1.03, 3.45)] were significantly associated with data quality.This study found that the overall data quality was lower than the national target. Over reporting of all indicators were observed in all facilities. It needs major improvement on supervision quality, training status to increase confidence of individuals to do HMIS activities."
https://openalex.org/W3208360510,"There is little information on the impacts of climate change on resource partitioning for mixotrophic phytoplankton. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that light interacts with temperature and CO2 to affect changes in growth and cellular carbon and nitrogen content of the mixotrophic dinoflagellate, Karlodinium veneficum, with increasing cellular carbon and nitrogen content under low light conditions and increased growth under high light conditions. Using a multifactorial design, the interactive effects of light, temperature and CO2 were investigated on K. veneficum at ambient temperature and CO2 levels (25Â°C, 375 ppm), high temperature (30Â°C, 375 ppm CO2), high CO2 (30Â°C, 750 ppm CO2), or a combination of both high temperature and CO2 (30Â°C, 750 ppm CO2) at low light intensities (LL: 70 Î¼mol photons m-2 s-2) and light-saturated conditions (HL: 140 Î¼mol photons m-2 s-2). Results revealed significant interactions between light and temperature for all parameters. Growth rates were not significantly different among LL treatments, but increased significantly with temperature or a combination of elevated temperature and CO2 under HL compared to ambient conditions. Particulate carbon and nitrogen content increased in response to temperature or a combination of elevated temperature and CO2 under LL conditions, but significantly decreased in HL cultures exposed to elevated temperature and/or CO2 compared to ambient conditions at HL. Significant increases in C:N ratios were observed only in the combined treatment under LL, suggesting a synergistic effect of temperature and CO2 on carbon assimilation, while increases in C:N under HL were driven only by an increase in CO2. Results indicate light-driven variations in growth and nutrient acquisition strategies for K. veneficum that may benefit this species under anticipated climate change conditions (elevated light, temperature and pCO2) while also affecting trophic transfer efficiency during blooms of this species."
https://openalex.org/W3208404586,"The color of particular parts of a flower is often employed as one of the features to differentiate between flower types. Thus, color is also used in flower-image classification. Color labels, such as 'green', 'red', and 'yellow', are used by taxonomists and lay people alike to describe the color of plants. Flower image datasets usually only consist of images and do not contain flower descriptions. In this research, we have built a flower-image dataset, especially regarding orchid species, which consists of human-friendly textual descriptions of features of specific flowers, on the one hand, and digital photographs indicating how a flower looks like, on the other hand. Using this dataset, a new automated color detection model was developed. It is the first research of its kind using color labels and deep learning for color detection in flower recognition. As deep learning often excels in pattern recognition in digital images, we applied transfer learning with various amounts of unfreezing of layers with five different neural network architectures (VGG16, Inception, Resnet50, Xception, Nasnet) to determine which architecture and which scheme of transfer learning performs best. In addition, various color scheme scenarios were tested, including the use of primary and secondary color together, and, in addition, the effectiveness of dealing with multi-class classification using multi-class, combined binary, and, finally, ensemble classifiers were studied. The best overall performance was achieved by the ensemble classifier. The results show that the proposed method can detect the color of flower and labellum very well without having to perform image segmentation. The result of this study can act as a foundation for the development of an image-based plant recognition system that is able to offer an explanation of a provided classification."
https://openalex.org/W3208415630,"Research on cerebral palsy (CP) has lacked emphasis on knowledge and treatment practices among caregivers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where socio-cultural contexts encourage a variety of treatment alternatives. In this study, we explored the beliefs and experiences that motivate care-seeking practices among caregivers of children with CP in Ghana.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 caregivers, 10 medical providers, and 5 alternative providers in the Greater Accra Region. Participant interviews were analyzed using principles adapted from grounded theory. A conceptual model was constructed to illustrate salient patterns and motivational factors influencing care-seeking practices.Participants' experiences showed that caregivers initially sought physiotherapy and prescription medications from medical providers. Many of them then transitioned to alternative methods to search for a cure or address specific CP symptoms. Over time, most caregivers discontinued both medical and alternative care in favor of at-home treatment. A few withdrew completely from all forms of care. Cost of treatment, caregiver burden, and stigma strongly inhibited care-seeking outside the home.Although caregivers were open to exploring a variety of treatment options, at-home treatment was preferred by long-time caregivers for its convenience, low cost, and adaptability to patient and caregiver needs."
https://openalex.org/W3209786763,"Distance learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic presented tremendous challenges for many families. Parents were expected to support children's learning, often while also working from home. Students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are at particularly high risk for setbacks due to difficulties with organization and increased risk of not participating in scheduled online learning. This paper explores how smartwatch technology, including timing notifications, can support children with ADHD during distance learning due to COVID-19. We implemented a 6-week pilot study of a Digital Health Intervention (DHI) with ten families. The DHI included a smartwatch and a smartphone. Google calendars were synchronized across devices to guide children through daily schedules. After the sixth week, we conducted parent interviews to understand the use of smartwatches and the impact on children's functioning, and we collected physiological data directly from the smartwatch. Our results demonstrated that children successfully adopted the use of the smartwatch, and parents believed the intervention was helpful, especially in supporting the development of organizational skills in their children. Overall, we illustrate how even simple DHIs, such as using smartwatches to promote daily organization and task completion, have the potential to support children and families, particularly during periods of distance learning. We include practical suggestions to help professionals teach children with ADHD to use smartwatches to improve organization and task completion, especially as it applies to supporting remote instruction."
https://openalex.org/W3210962961,"The Sustainable Development Goals include a target on eliminating child marriage, a human rights abuse. Yet, the indicator used in the SDG framework is a summary statistic and does not provide a full picture of the incidence of marriage at different ages. This paper aims to address this limitation by providing an alternative method of measuring child marriage. The paper reviews recent data on nuptiality and captures evidence of changes in the proportion married and in the age at marriage, in 98 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using data collected from nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, survival analysis is applied to estimate (a) age-specific marriage hazard rates among girls before age 18; and (b) the number of girls that were married before age 18 in 2020. Results show that the vast majority of girls remain unmarried until age 10. Child marriage rates increase gradually until age 14 and accelerate significantly thereafter at ages 15-17. By accounting for both single-year-age-specific child marriage hazard rates and the age structure of the population with a survival analysis approach, lower estimates in countries with a rapid decrease in child marriage and higher estimates in countries with constant or slightly rising child marriage rates relative to the direct approach are obtained."
https://openalex.org/W3210982405,"Intratumoral heterogeneity has been described for various tumor types and models of human cancer, and can have profound effects on tumor progression and drug resistance. This study describes an in-depth analysis of molecular and functional heterogeneity among subclonal populations (SCPs) derived from a single triple-negative breast cancer cell line, including copy number analysis, whole-exome and RNA sequencing, proteome analysis, and barcode analysis of clonal dynamics, as well as functional assays. The SCPs were found to have multiple unique genetic alterations and displayed significant variation in anchorage independent growth and tumor forming ability. Analyses of clonal dynamics in SCP mixtures using DNA barcode technology revealed selection for distinct clonal populations in different in vitro and in vivo environmental contexts, demonstrating that in vitro propagation of cancer cell lines using different culture conditions can contribute to the establishment of unique strains. These analyses also revealed strong enrichment of a single SCP during the development of xenograft tumors in immune-compromised mice. This SCP displayed attenuated interferon signaling in vivo and reduced sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of type I interferons. Reduction in interferon signaling was found to provide a selective advantage within the xenograft microenvironment specifically. In concordance with the previously described role of interferon signaling as tumor suppressor, these findings suggest that similar selective pressures may be operative in human cancer and patient-derived xenograft models."
https://openalex.org/W3211310419,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is an infectious virus that has been linked to adult T cell leukemia /lymphoma, aggressive CD4-T cell malignancy and many other immune-related medical illnesses. So far, no effective vaccine is known to combat HTLV-1, hence, the current research work was performed to design a potential multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine (MEBV) by adopting the latest methodology of reverse vaccinology. Briefly, three highly antigenic proteins (Glycoprotein, Accessory protein, and Tax protein) with no or minimal (&lt;37%) similarity with human proteome were sorted out and potential B- and T-cell epitopes were forecasted from them. Highly antigenic, immunogenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic and overlapping epitopes were short-listed for vaccine development. The chosen T-cell epitopes displayed a strong binding affinity with their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen alleles and demonstrated 95.8% coverage of the worldâ€™s population. Finally, nine Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, six Helper T Lymphocytes and five Linear B Lymphocytes epitopes, joint through linkers and adjuvant, were exploited to design the final MEBV construct, comprising of 382 amino acids. The developed MEBV structure showed highly antigenic properties while being non-toxic, soluble, non-allergenic, and stable in nature. Moreover, disulphide engineering further enhanced the stability of the final vaccine protein. Additionally, Molecular docking analysis and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the strong association between MEBV construct and human pathogenic immune receptor TLR-3. Repeated-exposure simulations and Immune simulations ensured the rapid antigen clearance and higher levels of cell-mediated immunity, respectively. Furthermore, MEBV codon optimization and in-silico cloning was carried out to confirm its augmented expression. Results of our experiments suggested that the proposed MEBV could be a potential immunogenic against HTLV-1; nevertheless, additional wet lab experiments are needed to elucidate our conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W3209392727,"The vertebral endplate forms a structural boundary between intervertebral disc and the trabecular bone of the vertebral body. As a mechanical interface between the stiff bone and resilient disc, the endplate is the weakest portion of the vertebral-disc complex and is predisposed to mechanical failure. However, the literature concerning the bone mineral density (BMD) distribution within the spinal endplate is comparatively sparse. The objective of this study is to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of computed tomography (CT) attenuation across the lumbosacral endplate measured in Hounsfield Units (HU). A total of 308 endplates from 28 cadaveric fresh-frozen lumbosacral spines were used in this study. Each spine was CT-scanned and the resulting DICOM data was used to obtain HU values of the bone endplate. Each individual endplate surface was subdivided into five clinically-relevant topographic zones. Attenuation was analyzed by spinal levels, sites (superior or inferior endplate) and endplate region. The highest HU values were found at the S1 endplate. Comparisons between the superior and inferior endplates showed the HU values in inferior endplates were significantly higher than those in the superior endplates within the same vertebra and the HU values in endplates cranial to the disc were significantly higher than those in the endplates caudal to the disc within the same disc. Attenuation in the peripheral region was significantly higher than in the central region by 32.5%. Regional comparison within the peripheral region showed the HU values in the posterior region were significantly higher than those in the anterior region and the HU values in the left region were significantly higher than those in the right region. This study provided detailed data on the regional HU distribution across the lumbosacral endplate, which can be useful to understand causes of some endplate lesions, such as fracture, and also to design interbody instrumentation."
https://openalex.org/W3209851676,"Cellular interactions between endothelial cells and macrophages regulate macrophage localization and phenotype, but the mechanisms underlying these interactions are poorly understood. Here we explored the role of sialoglycans on lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) in interactions with macrophage-expressed Siglec-1 (CD169). Lectin-binding assays and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that LEC from human skin express more sialylated glycans than the corresponding blood endothelial cells. Higher amounts of sialylated and/or sulfated glycans on LEC than BEC were consistently observed in murine skin, lung and lymph nodes. The floor LEC of the subcapsular sinus (SCS) in murine lymph nodes (LN) displayed sialylated glycans at particularly high densities. The sialoglycans of LN LEC were strongly bound by Siglec-1. Such binding plays an important role in the localization of Siglec-1+ LN-SCS macrophages, as their numbers are strongly reduced in mice expressing a Siglec-1 mutant that is defective in sialoglycan binding. The residual Siglec-1+ macrophages are less proliferative and have a more anti-inflammatory phenotype. We propose that the densely clustered, sialylated glycans on the SCS floor LEC are a key component of the macrophage niche, providing anchorage for the Siglec-1+ LN-SCS macrophages."

Medicaid nationwide covered 66 percent of sickle cell disease hospitalizations in 2004 and 58 percent of emergency department visits for the disease between 1999 and 2007. Using Medicaid data from four states with large populations that account for more than one-third of Medicaid program enrollment, we examined the characteristics of those with sickle cell disease. We found instances of mortality rates more than nine times the age-adjusted population average (in Texas, a mortality rate for Medicaid enrollees with SCD of 1.11 percent compared to 0.12 percent overall); rates of disability-related eligibilityâ€“which is associated with long-term Medicaid enrollmentâ€“of up to 69 percent; and half or more of affected enrollees having (all-cause) hospital stays, emergency department visits, and opioid prescription fills. With gene therapies on the horizon that will spur discussions of treatment coverage, costs, and outcomes for people with sickle cell disease, it is important for relevant stakeholders to understand the affected populations."
https://openalex.org/W3210949442,"The Italian antimicrobial prescription rate is one of the highest in Europe, and antibiotic resistance has become a serious problem with high costs and severe consequences, including prolonged illnesses, the increased period of hospitalization and mortality. Inadequate antibiotic prescriptions have been frequently reported, especially for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI); many patients receive antibiotics for viral pneumonia or bronchiolitis or broad-spectrum antibiotics for not complicated community-acquired pneumonia. For this reason, healthcare organizations need to implement strategies to raise physicians' awareness about this kind of drug and their overall effect on the population. The implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs and the use of Clinical Pathways (CPs) are excellent solutions because they have proven to be effective tools at diagnostic and therapeutic levels.This study evaluates the impact of CPs implementation in a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED), analyzing antibiotic prescriptions before and after the publication in 2015 and 2019. The CP developed in 2019 represents an update of the previous one with the introduction of serum procalcitonin. The study aims to evaluate the antibiotic prescriptions in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) before and after both CPs (2015 and 2019).The periods analyzed are seven semesters (one before CP-2015 called PRE period, five post CP-2015 called POST 1-5 and 1 post CP-2019 called POST6). The patients have been split into two groups: (i) children admitted to the Pediatric Acute Care Unit (INPATIENTS), and (ii) patients evaluated in the PED and sent back home (OUTPATIENTS). We have analyzed all descriptive diagnosis of CAP (the assessment of episodes with a descriptive diagnosis were conducted independently by two pediatricians) and CAP with ICD9 classification. All antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients with CAP were analyzed.A drastic reduction of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescription for inpatients has been noticed; from 100.0% in the PRE-period to 66.7% in POST1, and up to 38.5% in POST6. Simultaneously, an increase in amoxicillin use from 33.3% in the PRE-period to 76.1% in POST1 (p-value 0.078 and 0.018) has been seen. The outpatients' group's broad-spectrum antibiotics prescriptions decreased from 54.6% PRE to 17.4% in POST6. Both for outpatients and inpatients, there was a decrease of macrolides. The inpatient group's antibiotic therapy duration decreased from 13.5 days (PRE-period) to 7.0 days in the POST6. Antibiotic therapy duration in the outpatient group decreased from 9.0 days (PRE) to 7.0 days (POST1), maintaining the same value in subsequent periods. Overlapping results were seen in the ICD9 group for both inpatients and outpatients.This study shows that CPs are effective tools for an antibiotic stewardship program. Indeed, broad-spectrum antibiotics usage has dropped and amoxicillin prescriptions have increased after implementing the CAP CP-2015 and the 2019 update."
https://openalex.org/W3208463933,"Malaria prevalence in the highlands of Northern Tanzania is currently below 1% making this an elimination prone setting. As climate changes may facilitate increasing distribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in such settings, there is a need to monitor changes in risks of exposure to ensure that established control tools meet the required needs. This study explored the use of human antibodies against gambiae salivary gland protein 6 peptide 1 (gSG6-P1) as a biomarker of Anopheles exposure and assessed temporal exposure to mosquito bites in populations living in Lower Moshi, Northern Tanzania.Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2019: during the dry season in March, at the end of the rainy season in June and during the dry season in September. Blood samples were collected from enrolled participants and analysed for the presence of anti-gSG6-P1 IgG. Mosquitoes were sampled from 10% of the participants' households, quantified and identified to species level. Possible associations between gSG6-P1 seroprevalence and participants' characteristics were determined.The total number of Anopheles mosquitoes collected was highest during the rainy season (n = 1364) when compared to the two dry seasons (n = 360 and n = 1075, respectively). The gSG6-P1 seroprevalence increased from 18.8% during the dry season to 25.0% during the rainy season (Ï‡2 = 2.66; p = 0.103) followed by a significant decline to 11.0% during the next dry season (Ï‡2 = 12.56; p = 0.001). The largest number of mosquitoes were collected in one village (Oria), but the seroprevalence was significantly lower among the residents as compared to the rest of the villages (p = 0.039), explained by Oria having the highest number of participants owning and using bed nets. Both individual and household gSG6-P1 IgG levels had no correlation with numbers of Anopheles mosquitoes collected.Anti-gSG6-P1 IgG is a potential tool in detecting and distinguishing temporal and spatial variations in exposure to Anopheles mosquito bites in settings of extremely low malaria transmission where entomological tools may be obsolete. However studies with larger sample size and extensive mosquito sampling are warranted to further explore the association between this serological marker and abundance of Anopheles mosquito."
https://openalex.org/W3208687633,"The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of new mycotoxin adsorbents based on purified and activated bentonites combined with yeast and phytogenic compounds in fattening pigs. The experiment involved 96 pigs (31.2Â±2.4 kg). Control (C) group was fed a diet naturally contaminated with mycotoxins (5 mg/kg deoxynivalenol, DON) without an adsorbent. Treated groups received the feed with mycotoxin adsorbents: purified and activated bentonite (T1), purified and activated bentonite, yeast derivatives, phytogenic substances (T2), and purified, activated, and sulphurated bentonite with phytogenic substances (T3). Evaluated parameters involved growth performance, organ weight, small intestine and liver histopathology, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, antioxidant status of the organism and total and free DON content in urine. In all treated groups, an significant increase in intestinal GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio was observed when compared to C. No significant effects on liver and kidney weight, complete blood count, serum or intestinal malondialdehyde concentration, or total/free DON content in urine were observed. All adsorbents improved histopathological findings in the liver when compared to C. Moreover, T1, and T2 groups showed no presence of inflammatory reaction or necrotic changes in the livers. Although, mycotoxin adsorbents investigated in this study had no significant impact on pig growth performance, they reduced the oxidative stress, and on the tissue level they protected the jejunal tissue and liver parenchyma under deoxynivalenol challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3209845014,"Ethnographers frequently allude to alcoholism and related harms in Indigenous hunter-gatherer communities, but very few studies have quantified patterns of alcohol consumption or its health and social impacts. We present a case study of the Mbendjele BaYaka, a Congolese population undergoing socioeconomic transition. 83 adults answered questions about their frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption, underwent biometric measurements and reported whether they were currently experiencing a cough or diarrhoea; 56 participated in structured interviews about their experiences with alcohol. Based on WHO standards, we found 44.3% of the full sample, and 51.5% of drinkers (excluding abstainers), had a hazardous volume of alcohol consumption; and 35.1% of the full sample, and 40.9% of drinkers, engaged in heavy episodic drinking; consumption habits varied with sex and age. Total weekly consumption was a positive predictor of blood pressure and the likelihood of experiencing diarrhoea; associations with other biometric variables were not statistically significant. Interview responses indicated numerous other economic, mental and physical health harms of alcohol use, the prevalence of which demonstrate some variability between forest camps and permanent village settlements. These include high rates of drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding (~40%); frequent alcohol-induced violence; and considerable exchange of foraged foods and engagement in exploitative labour activities to acquire alcohol or repay associated debts. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of hazardous alcohol consumption among transitioning hunter-gatherers is higher than other segments of the Congolese population and indicate negative impacts on health and wellbeing, highlighting an urgent need for targeted public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3209938510,"Conservation concerns are increasing for numerous freshwater turtle species, including Pseudemys gorzugi , which has led to a call for more research. However, traditional sampling methodologies are often time consuming, labor intensive, and invasive, restricting the amount of data that can be collected. Biases of traditional sampling methods can further impair the quality of the data collected, and these shortfalls may discourage their use. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, drones) for conducting wildlife surveys has recently demonstrated the potential to bridge gaps in data collection by offering a less labor intensive, minimally invasive, and more efficient process. Photographs and video can be obtained by camera attachments during a drone flight and analyzed to determine population counts, abundance, and other types of data. In this study we developed a detailed protocol to survey for large, freshwater turtle species in an arid, riverine landscape. This protocol was implemented with a DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone and a SONY ILCE Î±6000 digital camera to determine P . gorzugi and sympatric turtle species occurrence across 42 sites in southwestern Texas, USA. The use of a large drone and high-resolution camera resulted in high identification percentages, demonstrating the potential of drones to survey for large, freshwater turtle species. Numerous advantages to drone-based surveys were identified as well as some challenges, which were addressed with additional refinement of the protocol. Our data highlight the utility of drones for conducting freshwater turtle surveys and provide a guideline to those considering implementing drone-mounted high-resolution cameras as a survey tool."

Cox proportional regression was performed to analyze the cumulative incidence of CAD and stroke. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of CAD and stroke were determined after sex, age, and comorbidities, as well as the use of inhaler corticosteroids (ICSs), oral steroids (OSs), and statins, were controlled for.Compared with those of patients without statin use, the aHRs (95% CIs) of patients with statin use for CAD and ischemic stroke were 0.72 (0.65-0.79) and 0.52 (0.38-0.72), respectively. For patients taking single-use statins but not ICSs/OSs, the aHRs (95% CIs) for CAD and ischemic stroke were 0.72 (0.65-0.79)/0.69 (0.61-0.79) and 0.54 (0.39-0.74)/0.50 (0.32-0.79), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3209585215,"Periodontitis-mediated alveolar bone loss is caused by dysbiotic shifts in the commensal oral microbiota that upregulate proinflammatory osteoimmune responses. The study purpose was to determine whether antimicrobial-induced disruption of the commensal microbiota has deleterious effects on alveolar bone. We administered an antibiotic cocktail, minocycline, or vehicle-control to sex-matched C57BL/6T mice from age 6- to 12 weeks. Antibiotic cocktail and minocycline had catabolic effects on alveolar bone in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice. We then administered minocycline or vehicle-control to male mice reared under SPF and germ-free conditions, and we subjected minocycline-treated SPF mice to chlorhexidine oral antiseptic rinses. Alveolar bone loss was greater in vehicle-treated SPF versus germ-free mice, demonstrating that the commensal microbiota drives naturally occurring alveolar bone loss. Minocycline- versus vehicle-treated germ-free mice had similar alveolar bone loss outcomes, implying that antimicrobial-driven alveolar bone loss is microbiota dependent. Minocycline induced phylum-level shifts in the oral bacteriome and exacerbated naturally occurring alveolar bone loss in SPF mice. Chlorhexidine further disrupted the oral bacteriome and worsened alveolar bone loss in minocycline-treated SPF mice, validating that antimicrobial-induced oral dysbiosis has deleterious effects on alveolar bone. Minocycline enhanced osteoclast size and interface with alveolar bone in SPF mice. Neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were upregulated in cervical lymph nodes of minocycline-treated SPF mice. Paralleling the upregulated proinflammatory innate immune cells, minocycline therapy increased TH 1 and TH 17 cells that have known pro-osteoclastic actions in the alveolar bone. This report reveals that antimicrobial perturbation of the commensal microbiota induces a proinflammatory oral dysbiotic state that exacerbates naturally occurring alveolar bone loss."

Lupus was induced by 0.5 mL of pristane via intraperitoneal in BALB/c female mice. Immunoprecipitation with K562 cells was metabolically labeled with 35S and ELISA to detect serum antibodies or mice IgG1, IgG2a isotypes. ELISA determined IL-10 and IFN-Î³ from splenocytes supernatants. Proteinuria was assessed monthly, and lupus nephritis was evaluated by immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy.The prophylactic co-vaccination with D2/IL-10 reduced the expression of kidney damage observed by electron microscopy, direct immunofluorescence, and H & E, along with reduced level of anti-nRNP/Sm antibodies (P = 0.048).The prophylactic co-vaccination of IL-10 with D2 in pristane-induced lupus ameliorates the renal damage maybe by acting as prophylactic DNA tolerizing therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3208210768,"Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a critical problem in liver transplantation that can lead to life-threatening complications and substantially limit the utilization of livers for transplantation. However, because there are no early diagnostics available, fulminant injury may only become evident post-transplant. Mitochondria play a central role in IRI and are an ideal diagnostic target. During ischemia, changes in the mitochondrial redox state form the first link in the chain of events that lead to IRI. In this study we used resonance Raman spectroscopy to provide a rapid, non-invasive, and label-free diagnostic for quantification of the hepatic mitochondrial redox status. We show this diagnostic can be used to significantly distinguish transplantable versus non-transplantable ischemically injured rat livers during oxygenated machine perfusion and demonstrate spatial differences in the response of mitochondrial redox to ischemia reperfusion. This novel diagnostic may be used in the future to predict the viability of human livers for transplantation and as a tool to better understand the mechanisms of hepatic IRI."

The islets from marijuana-users displayed reduced insulin secretion as compared to islets from non-users upon stimulation with high glucose (AUC, 3.41 Â± 0.62 versus 5.14 Â±0.47, p<0.05) and high glucose plus KCl (AUC, 4.48 Â± 0.41 versus 7.69 Â± 0.58, p<0.001). When human islets from chronic marijuana-users were transplanted into diabetic mice, the mean reversal rate of diabetes was 35% versus 77% in animals receiving islets from non-users (p<0.01). Immunofluorescent staining for cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) was shown to be colocalized with insulin and enhanced significantly in beta cells from marijuana-users vs. non-users (CB1R intensity/islet area, 14.95 Â± 2.71 vs. 3.23 Â± 0.87, p<0.001). In contrast, CB1R expression was not co-localized with glucagon or somatostatin. Furthermore, isolated islets from chronic marijuana-users appeared hypertrophic.

However, there is little evidence on whether its growing presence nearby vulnerable populations produce social harm beyond its known adverse individual effects. This study provides new evidence on the negative societal effects of betting houses. Our research design takes advantage of a new wave of openings in Madrid (Spain), which created a sudden increase in the supply of on-site gambling. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that new betting houses decline nearby high schools' educational performance, especially in public schools in less advantaged areas. This effect is neither trivial nor diminishing with time. This evidence suggests that betting houses increase inequality of educational opportunities. The ubiquity of betting houses around vulnerable populations in multiple regions drives us to think that these findings have relevant policy implications for many countries currently designing policies tackling the increase of problem gambling."

Both polyurethane and silicone are biocompatible materials which are utilized for catheter manufacturing, but their correlation to complications remains controversial. The aim of this study was to try to analyze the relationship between catheter materials and complications. Materials and methods A total of 3144 patients who underwent intravenous port implantation between March 2012 and December 2018 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan were recruited. Of these, 1226 patients received silicone catheter port implantation and 1679 received polyurethane catheter ports. Case matching was done prior to analysis and catheter related complications and cumulative complication incidence for each group were compared. Results Intergroup differences were identified in entry vessel (p = 0.0441), operation year (p &lt; 0.0001), operation method (p = 0.0095), functional period (p &lt; 0.0001), patient follow up status (p &lt; 0.0001), operating time for vessel cutdown (p &lt; 0.0001) and wire assisted approach (p = 0.0008). Stratified by specific entry vessel, no statistical difference was found in complication rate or incidence between the silicone and polyurethane groups. We further compared the cumulative complication incidence of the silicone and polyurethane groups, and also found no statistical difference (p = 0.4451). Conclusion As long as external stress forces generated by surrounding structures and focused on potential weak points are avoided, both silicone and polyurethane materials provide sufficient structural stability to serve as reliable vascular access for patients."

https://openalex.org/W3211112905,"Previous efforts at increasing spatial resolution have relied on decreasing focal spot and or detector element size. Many ""super resolution"" methods require physical movement of a component of the imaging system. This work describes a method for achieving spatial resolution on a scale smaller than the detector pixel without motion of the object or detector.We introduce a weighting of the photon energy spectrum on a length scale smaller than a single pixel using a physical filter that can be placed between the focal spot and the object, between the object and the detector, or integrated into the x-ray source or detector. We refer to the method as sub pixel encoding (SPE). We show that if one acquires multiple measurements (i.e. x-ray projections), information can be synthesized at a spatial scale defined by the spectrum modulation, not the detector element size. Specifically, if one divides a detector pixel into n sub regions, and m photon-matter interactions are present, the number of x-ray measurements needed to solve for the detector response of each sub region is mxn. We discuss realizations of SPE using multiple x-ray spectra with an energy integrating detector, a single spectra with a photon counting detector, and the single photon-matter interaction case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using a simulated energy integrating detector with a detector pitch of 2 mm for 80-140 kV medical and 200-600 kV industrial applications. Phantoms used for both example SPE realization had some features only a 1 mm detector could resolve. We calculate the covariance matrix of SPE output to characterize the and noise propagation and correlation of our test examples.The mathematical foundation of SPE is provided, with details worked out for several detector types and energy ranges. Two numerical simulations were provided to demonstrate feasibility. In both the medical and industrial simulations, some phantom features were only observable with the 1 mm and SPE synthesized 2 mm detector, while the 2 mm detector was not able to visualize them. Covariance matrix analysis demonstrated negative diagonal terms for both example cases.The concept of encoding object information at a length scale smaller than a single pixel element, and then retrieving that information was introduced. SPE simultaneously allows for an increase in spatial resolution and provides ""dual energy"" like information about the underlying photon-matter interactions."

One major source of these difficulties is the high rate of metastasis and increased genomic instability leading to a high mutation rate and the development of resistance against therapeutic approaches. Here we investigate as one source of genomic instability the contribution of activation of transposable elements (TEs) within the tumor. We used the well-established medaka melanoma model and RNA-sequencing to investigate the differential expression of TEs in wildtype and transgenic fish carrying melanoma. We constructed a medaka-specific TE sequence library and identified TE sequences that were specifically upregulated in tumors. Validation by qRT- PCR confirmed a specific upregulation of a LINE and an LTR element in malignant melanomas of transgenic fish."

Unfortunately, investigations of exercise-specific demands and strategies to deal with them are insufficiently researched, leading to a gap in knowledge about athletic requirements and strategies used to deal with them. Here, we investigated which obstacles exercisers experience during an anaerobic (Wingate test) and an aerobic cycling test (incremental exercise test), as well as the strategies they considered helpful for dealing with these obstacles (qualitative analysis). In addition, we examined whether thinking of these obstacles and strategies in terms of if-then plans (or implementation intentions; i.e., ""If I encounter obstacle O, then I will apply strategy S!"") improves performance over merely setting performance goals (i.e., goal intentions; quantitative analysis). N = 59 participants (age: M = 23.9 Â± 6.5 years) performed both tests twice in a 2-within (Experimental session: 1 vs. 2) Ã— 2-between (Condition: goal vs. implementation intention) design. Exercisers' obstacles and strategies were assessed using structured interviews in Session 1 and subjected to thematic analysis. In both tests, feelings of exertion were the most frequently stated obstacle. Motivation to do well, self-encouragement, and focus on the body and on cycling were frequently stated strategies in both tests. There were also test-specific obstacles, such as boredom reported in the aerobic test. For session 2, the obstacles and strategies elicited in Session 1 were used to specify if-then plans. Bayesian mixed-factor ANOVA suggests, however, that if-then plans did not help exercisers to improve their performance.

A major aspect of such analysis involves identifying the nodes that are crucial to the overall processing structure of the network. More recently, the approach of hourglass analysis has been developed for the purpose of quantitatively analyzing whether only a few intermediate nodes mediate the information processing between a large number of inputs and outputs of a network. We develop a new framework for hourglass analysis that takes network weights into account while identifying the core nodes and the extent of hourglass effect in a given weighted network. We use this framework to study the structural connectome of the C. elegans and identify intermediate neurons that form the core of sensori-motor pathways in the organism. Our results show that the neurons forming the core of the connectome show significant differences across the male and hermaphrodite sexes, with most core nodes in the male concentrated in sex-organs while they are located in the head for the hermaphrodite. Our work demonstrates that taking weights into account for network analysis framework leads to emergence of different network patterns in terms of identification of core nodes and hourglass structure in the network, which otherwise would be missed by unweighted approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3208632642,"The Ancestral Puebloans occupied Chaco Canyon, in what is now the southwestern USA, for more than a millennium and harvested useful timber and fuel from the trees of distant forests as well as local woodlands, especially juniper and pinyon pine. These pinyon juniper woodland products were an essential part of the resource base from Late Archaic times (3000-100 BC) to the Bonito phase (AD 800-1140) during the great florescence of Chacoan culture. During this vast expanse of time, the availability of portions of the woodland declined. We posit, based on pollen and macrobotanical remains, that the Chaco Canyon woodlands were substantially impacted during Late Archaic to Basketmaker II times (100 BC-AD 500) when agriculture became a major means of food production and the manufacture of pottery was introduced into the canyon. By the time of the Bonito phase, the local woodlands, especially the juniper component, had been decimated by centuries of continuous extraction of a slow-growing resource. The destabilizing impact resulting from recurrent woodland harvesting likely contributed to the environmental unpredictability and difficulty in procuring essential resources suffered by the Ancestral Puebloans prior to their ultimate departure from Chaco Canyon."
https://openalex.org/W3209661964,"We consider a simple theoretical model to investigate the impact of inheritances on the wealth distribution. Wealth is described as a finite resource, which remains constant over different generations and is divided equally among offspring. All other sources of wealth are neglected. We consider different societies characterized by a different offspring probability distribution. We find that, if the population remains constant, the society reaches a stationary wealth distribution. We show that inequality emerges every time the number of children per family is not always the same. For realistic offspring distributions from developed countries, the model predicts a Gini coefficient of G â‰ˆ 0.3. If we divide the society into wealth classes and set the probability of getting married to depend on the distance between classes, the stationary wealth distribution crosses over from an exponential to a power-law regime as the number of wealth classes and the level of class distinction increase."
https://openalex.org/W3209921570,"The paper examines the interest of the commercial banks' stakeholders in Pillar 3 disclosures and their behaviour during the timing of serious market turbulence. The aim is to discover to which extent current banking regulation supports stakeholders' interest in the information required by regulators to be disclosed. The examined data consists of log files that were pre-processed using web mining techniques and from which were extracted frequent item sets by quarters and evaluated in terms of quantity. The authors have proposed a methodology to evaluate frequent item sets of web parts over a dedicated time. Based on the verification of applied methodology on two commercial banks, the results show that stakeholders' interest in disclosures is highest in the first quarter at each year and after turbulent times in 2009 their interests decreased. Moreover, the results suggest that stakeholders expressed higher interest than in regulatory required Pillar 3 information in the following group of information: Pillar3 related information, Annual reports, Information on Group. Following our results, the paper contributes to cover the gap in the research by analysing Pillar 3 disclosures and their compliance with regulatory requirements, which also increase the interest of the relevant stakeholders to conduce them as an effective market discipline tool."
https://openalex.org/W3210522060,"Predictive models have become an integral part of archaeological research, particularly in the discovery of new archaeological sites. In this paper, we apply predictive modeling to map high potential Pleistocene archaeological locales on the island of Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean. The model delineates landscape characteristics that denote areas with high potential to unearth Pleistocene archaeology while at the same time highlighting localities that should be excluded. The predictive model was employed in surface surveys to systematically access high probability locales on Cyprus. A number of newly identified localities suggests that the true density of mobile hunter-gatherer sites on Cyprus is seriously underestimated in current narratives. By adding new data to this modest corpus of early insular sites, we are able to contribute to debates regarding island colonisation and the role of coastal environments in human dispersals to new territories."
https://openalex.org/W3210772777,"The Japanese healthcare system currently faces numerous challenges, including a super-aging society and an excessive burden on medical workers; therefore, the need for innovative solutions from healthcare ventures to tackle these issues has increased. Meanwhile, as physicians play important roles in healthcare ventures, the need for Japanese physician entrepreneurs is more important than ever. Given the lack of research examining barriers to physicians starting ventures and what skills, knowledge, and surrounding environments act as facilitators, this study aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers faced by physicians to start ventures.Between September and November 2019 and in May 2021, qualitative interviews were conducted with 33 participants, which included eight physician entrepreneurs; two administrative officers at the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; three faculty members at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (in-depth interviews); and 20 medical students (focus group discussions). The interviews were deductively coded based on the social ecological model. The inductive approach was applied to coding any knowledge necessary to start a business. We conducted member checking with three physician entrepreneurs and seven medical students to improve our results' credibility.The factors influencing a physician's decision to launch a new business include their willingness to contribute to society, the unique environment in which an individual is placed while in medical school and afterward, negative aspects of the lack of diversity in physicians' careers, the financial stability provided by a medical license, and self-efficacy.Our study revealed facilitators and barriers to physicians' entrepreneurial ventures. Knowledge about these factors might be useful in supporting physicians to launch or become involved in healthcare ventures."
https://openalex.org/W3211335942,"Although neutrophil elastase (NE) may play a role in lung fibrosis and liver fibrosis, NE involvement in the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been unclear. We investigated the involvement of NE in the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis-like skin lesions post-injections of linear gadolinium-based contrast agents in renal failure mouse models. Renal failure mouse models were randomly divided into three groups: control group (saline), gadodiamide group, and gadopentetate group. Each solution was intravenously administered three times per week for three weeks. The mice were observed daily for skin lesions. Quantification of skin lesions, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and profibrotic cytokines in the affected skin was performed by immunostaining and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Blood samples were collected from the facial vein to quantify NE enzymatic activity. The 158 Gd concentrations in each sample were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the gadodiamide group, the mRNA expression of fibrotic markers was increased in the skin lesions compared to the control group. In the gadopentetate group, only collagen 1Î± and TGF-Î² mRNA expression were higher than in the control group. The expression of CD3+, CD68+, NE cells and the NE activity in the blood serum were significantly higher in the gadodiamide and gadopentetate groups compared to the control group. Gadolinium concentration in the skin of the gadodiamide group was significantly higher than the gadopentetate group, while almost no traces of gadolinium were found in the control group. Although gadopentetate and gadodiamide affected the fibrotic markers in the skin differently, NE may be involved in the development of fibrosis linked to the GBCAs injections in renal failure mouse models."
