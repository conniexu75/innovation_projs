https://openalex.org/W1500786177,"A method is described for isolation, from chicken pancreas, of an avian pancreatic polypeptide which may be a new hormone. This method involves acid-alcohol extraction, gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and droplet countercurrent distribution. The peptide contains 36 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 4240 and the isoelectric point if pH 6 to 7. The average amount of avian pancreatic polypeptide extractable from chicken pancreas was 4 mg/100 g of pancreas. The amino acid sequence of the peptide is Gly-Pro-Ser-Gln-Pro-Thr-Tyr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Pro-Val-Glu-Asp-Leu-Ile-Arg-Phe-Tyr-Asp-Asn-Leu-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Val-Val-Thr-Arg-His-Arg-Tyr-NH2."
https://openalex.org/W1895187084,"A purified enzyme system isolated from vaccinia virus cores has been shown to modify the 5' termini of viral mRNA and synthetic poly(A) and poly(G) to form the structures m7G(5')pppA- and m7G(5')pppG-. The enzyme system has both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities. The GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase activity incorporates GMP into the 5' terminus via a 5'-5' triphosphate bond. The properties of this reaction are: (a) of the four nucleoside triphosphates only GTP is a donor, (b) mRNA with two phosphates at the 5' terminus is an acceptor while RNA with a single 5'-terminal phosphate is not, (c) Mg2+ is required, (d) the pH optimum is 7.8, (e) PP1 is a strong inhibitor, and (f) the reverse reaction, namely the formation of GTP from PP1 and RNA containing the 5'-terminal structure G(5')pppN-, readily occurs. The S-adenosylmethionine:mRNA(guanine-7-)methyltransferase activity catalyzes the methylation of the 5'-terminal guanosine. This reaction exhibits the following characteristics: (a) mRNA with the 5'-terminal sequences G(5')pppA- and G(5')pppG- are acceptors, (b) only position 7 of the terminal guanosine is methylated; internal or conventional 5'-terminal guanosine residues are not methylated, (c) the reaction is not dependent upon GTP or divalent cations, (d) optimal activity is observed in a broad pH range around neutrality, (e) the reaction is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine. Both the guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase reactions exhibit bisubstrate kinetics and proceed via a sequential mechanism. The reactions may be summarized: (see article)."
https://openalex.org/W1552494303,"A detailed kinetic scheme is proposed for the action of phospholipase A2 on mixed micelles of phospholipid and surfactant: see article. where E is the enzyme, A is the mixed micelle, and B is the phospholipid substrate in the mixed micelle. This scheme takes into account quantitatively the involvement of the lipid-water interface in the action of this enzyme toward substrate in macromolecular lipid complexes. The kinetic equation for this scheme is derived and four simplifying assumptions which are necessary for its practical application are described. Kinetic data are reported for the action of cobra venom phospholipase A2 (Naja naja naja) on 1,2-dipalmitosyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine in mixed micelles with the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100, and these data are analyzed in terms of the kinetic equation presented. At 40 degrees, pH 8.0, and in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+, V was found to be about 4 X 10(3) mumol min(-1) mg of protein(-1). KsA, which is the dissociation constant for the enzyme-mixed micelle complex, is about 5 X 10(-4) M. KmB, the Michaelis constant for the catalytic step, which is (k-2 + k3)/k2, is 1 to 2 X 10(-10) mol cm-2. This kinetic treatment, together with the fact that the mixed micelle system allows the concentration of the substrate in the lipid-water interface to be varied, has made possible the quantitative separation of the association of a lipolytic enzyme with the lipid-water interface (expressed as KsA) and the binding to the substrate in the interface (reflected in the KmB term). The implications of this kinetic scheme for the analysis of phospholipase A2 from other sources acting on other aggregated forms of phospholipid and for the study of other phospholipases and lipases is considered."

https://openalex.org/W1558501566,"Band 3 is the predominant approximately 90,000-dalton polypeptide component of the human erythrocyte membrane. It was solubilized selectively, along with the other major glycoproteins, by extracting membrane ghosts with Triton X-100 under nondenaturing conditions. Two major polypeptides remained associated with Band 3 under these conditions; however one (Band 6) could be dissociated at an ionic strength of 0.15 and the other (Band 4.2) by treatment with p-chloromercuribenzoate. Band 3 was then purified (greater than or equal to 97%) by aminoethyl cellulose ion exchange chromatography. The isolated protein was free of phospholipid and was moderately enriched in apolar amino acid residues; it contained galactose and glucosamine but very little sialic acid and galactosamine. When Band 3 was labeled by treatment of ghosts with galactose oxidase plus KB3H4 and then purified, the electrophoretic mobility of its radioactivity lagged slightly behing that of its Coomassie blue staining profile. Variation in glycosylation could therefore cause the diffuse trailing zone characteristically observed for Band 3 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The ultraviolet circular dichroism of Band 3 was stable in nonionic detergent and suggested an alpha helix content of 43%, a value close to that estimated for this polypeptide in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1567924553,"The contribution of nyoglobin to the oxygen uptake of red skeletal muscle was estimated from the difference in oxygen uptake with and without functional myoglobin. The oxygen uptake of bundles (25 mm long, 0.5 mm mean diameter) of muscle fibers teased from pigeon breast muscle was measured in families of steady states of oxygen pressure from 0 to 250 mm Hg. The oxygen-binding function of myoglobin, in situ in muscle fiber bundles, was abolished by treatment with nitrite of hydroxylamine, which convert oxymyoglobin in situ to high spin ferric myoglobin, or with phenylhydrazine, which converts oxymyoglobin to denatured products, or with 2-hydroxyethylhydrazine, which appears to remove myoglobin from the muslce. The oxygen uptake was again measured. At higher oxygen pressure, where oxygen availability does not limit the respiration of the fiber bundles, oxygen uptake is not affected by any of the four reagents, which is evidence that mitochondrial oxygen uptake is not impaired. At lower oxygen pressure, where oxygen uptake is one-half maximal, the steady state oxygen consumption is roughly halved by abolishing functional myoglobin. Under the steady state conditions studied, the storage function of myoglobin, being static, vanishes and the transport function stands revealed. We conclude from these experiments that myoglobin may transport a significant fraction of the oxygen consumed by muscle mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1568194294,"A procedure is presented for the purification of Factor IX from human plasma. The final product is homogeneous as judged by disc gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, it is completely free of other coagulation component activities. Factor IX is converted to its enzymatically active form by the addition of small quantities of Factor IXa in the presence of calcium ions. This activated species is added to purified antithrombin-heparin cofactor and the interaction is studied in the presence and absence of heparin. Antithrombin-heparin cofactor is found to be a progressive, time-dependent inhibitor of Factor IXa and neutralizes approximately 57% of this enzyme's proteolytic activity within 30 min. The addition of heparin dramatically accelerates the rate of this interaction with virtually complete inhibition of Factor IXa occurring within 15 s. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of reduced and nonreduced proteins indicates that antithrombin-heparin cofactor functions as a potent inhibitor of Factor IXa by forming an undissociable complex with the enzyme which is stable in the presence of denaturing or reducing agents (or both). This complex represents a 1:1 stoichiometric combination of enzyme and inhibitor. Heparin increases the rate of formation of this complex without affecting its dissociability or stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W1491180863,"[Alpha 1(III)]3 collagen was solubilized by pepsin digestion of normal human placental membranes and was purified by differential salt precipitation and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. This collagen was digested with CNBr, and the resultant nine peptides were isolated and characterized. The chains are cross-linked by cysteinyl residues in the COOH-terminal peptide. Isolation of peptides derived from CNBr digestion of insoluble tissues was used as an assay for the presence of [alpha 1(I)]2alpha 2 and [alpha 1(III)]3 collagens. Both types are present in human skin, intestine, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, aorta, umbilical cord, placental membranes, and myocardium. Bone and tendon contain [alpha 1(I)]2alpha 2 collagen but, unlike the other tissues, lack [alpha 1(III)]3 collagen. Both [alpha 1(I)]2alpha 2 and[alpha 1(III)]3 collagens are present in scars of human skin, myocardium, tendon, and liver and of rabbit skin. The degree of hydroxylation of proline was 4 to 5% lower in the same peptides in skin, bone, and tendon than in the other tissues. The degree of hydroxylation of lysine in the same peptides derived from different tissues varied more widely."
https://openalex.org/W1563586280,"With the glutathione system that leads to rapid regeneration of reduced lysozyme (Saxena, V. P., and Wetlaufer, D. B. (1971) Biochemistry 9, 5015), reduced pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) regenerated activity in high yield (greater than 90%) but at a considerably lower rate (t1/2 approximately 75 min). Systematic examination of the effects upon regeneration of the concentrations and ratios of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) showed the same broad optima for RNase as were earlier found for lysozyme: [GSSG] = 5 X 10(-4) M, [GSH] = 5 X 10(-3) M. Regeneration of reduced RNase by air oxidation was shown to be inhibitable by 10(-4) M EDTA, whereas the glutathione regeneration was unaffected by EDTA. In addition the air-oxidative regeneration showed a strong temperature dependence, in contrast with the glutathione system. The mechanisms of these two kinds of regenerations are therefore different. Six potentially catalytic metal ions were tested in the air-oxidative regeneration of RNase: Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, and Ni2+. Of these, only Cu2+ enhanced the rate of regeneration of RNase activity, although both Cu2+ and Co2+ catalyzed thioloxidation of reduced RNase. The rates and yields of RNase regenerations were independent of protein concentration from 3 X 10(-7) M to 1.2 X 10(-5) M in the glutathione system. Preincubation of freshly dissolved reduced RNase under nonoxidizing conditions before adding glutathione did not change the rate or extent of regeneration. Studies of its pH dependence showed that the glutathione regeneration depends on the deprotonation of prototropic groups with 7.5 less than pK less than 8.0. The major ion exchange chromatographic peaks from glutathione and air-oxidative regenerations appeared to be identical with native RNase, by the criteria of specific activity, chromatographic mobility, and circular dichroic spectra. The glutathione system permits regeneration at much higher RNase concentration than the air regeneration, with rates and yields comparable to the greatest reported for air regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W1506370454,"Initiation factor MP was purified 1570-fold with 67% recovery of total activity present in 0.5 M KCl extracts of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes. Initiation factor MP forms a ternary complex with Met-tRNAf and GTP or a binary complex with Met-tRNAf alone, the details of which are presented in the accompanying paper (Safer, B., Adams, S. L., Anderson. W. F., and Merrick, W. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 9076-9082). Initiation factor MP was homogeneous by the following criteria: (a) electrophoresis as a single band in gels of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10% acrylamide; (b) equilibration as a single band during isoelectric focusing; (c) sedimentation as a single symmetrical boundary during sedimentation velocity experiments; (d) linear plots of sedimentation equilibrium data; (e) symmetrical absorbance (at 280 nm) and activity profiles during DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and (f) symmetrical distribution of initiation factor MP during sucrose density gradient band sedimentation. The molecular weight of the initiation factor MP monomer (0.2 mg/ml) by low speed sedimentation equilibrium was 90,800. Calculations based on the Stokes radius and sedimentation velocity show the existence of relatively stable 90,000-dalton monomers or 180,000-dalton dimers at low (0.1 mg/ml) and high (9.75 mg/ml) concentrations of initiation factor MP, respectively. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels indicates that initiation factor MP monomer is composed of two noncovalently linked subunits with molecular weights of 52,000 and 34,000. Despite a relatively normal amino acid composition and an isoelectric point of 6.4, initiation factor MP behaves as a basic protein, eluting from phosphocellulose at 650 mM KCl (pH 7.9). Both ternary complex formation and methionyl-puromycin synthesis co-purify, indicating that a single protein is required for both activities."
https://openalex.org/W1608381236,"Metal (Me) and MeATP interactions with adenylate cyclases associated with rabbit ventricular particles and with a detergent-dispersed preparation from rat cerebellum have been studied. data were simulated to fit kinetic models in which an inhibitor (HATP or ATP) is added in constant proportion to the variable substrate (MeATP). The specific models considered were that the enzyme binds (a) MeATP as the substrate; (b) MeATP as the substrate and HATP or ATP as an inhibitor; (c) MeATP as the substrate and free Me as an activator; and (d) MeATP as the substrate, free Me as an activator, and HATP or ATP as an inhibitor. Both equilibrium-ordered and random (rapid equilibrium assumption) types of sequential kinetic models were considered. The various models were tested using cardiac particulate adenylate cyclase in the presence of either a phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase or a creatine phosphate-creatine kinase ATP-regeneration system. Although the enzyme with either system appeared to bind Mg2+ as an activator, one or both ATP-regeneration systems also seemed to interact directly with adenylate cyclase, making clear interpretations difficult. With the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase system, kinetic patterns on double reciprocal plots were linear as a function of MgATP, but with creatine phosphate-creatine kinase, kinetic patterns were concave downward. The kinetic models were further tested using the detergent-dispersed cerebellar enzyme, a preparation with low adenosine triphosphatase activity and not requiring the addition of an ATP-regeneration system. Reciprocal plots were linear and intersecting as a function of either MeATP or Me (Me = Mg2+ or Mn2+), and secondary replots of slopes and intersecting as function of either MeATP or Me (Me = Mg2+ or Mn2+), and secondary replots of slopes and intercepts also were linear. These data indicate that the brain detergent-dispersed enzyme conforms to a bireactant, sequential mechanism where free cation is a required activator and free ATP is not a potent inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W181618426,"The interaction of vinblastine with calf brain tubulin has been studied by velocity sedimentation, gel filtration, and fluorescence. It has been established that vinblastine induces the stable tubulin dimers to dimerize further to tetramers. The sedimentation patterns at low vinblastine concentration were analyzed by the ligand-induced dimerization theory of Cann and Goad ((1972) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 153, 603-609). The association constant and stoichiometry for the binding of vinblastine to tubulin, determined by gel filtration and spectrofluorometry, were (2.3 +/- 0.1) X 10(4) liters/mol at 25 degrees and two vinblastine binding sites per tubulin dimer of molecular weight 110,000. The binding of vinblastine to tubulin is characterized by an enthalpy change of 5.8 kcal/mol and a positive unitary entropy change. Binding of vinblastine did not induce any significant conformational changes in tubulin as monitored by circular dichroism. However, the vinblastine-tubulin complex displayed an ultraviolet difference spectrum, which appears to reflect mostly the transfer of vinblastine to a less polar environment. Besides binding vinblastine, tubulin was shown to bind vincristine with identical free energy and stoichiometry and to have a single binding site for 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid per tubulin dimer, which is independent of those for vinblastine."

https://openalex.org/W2130068692,"Two distinct pathways have been elucidated which lead to the formation of an AUG-dependent initiation complex. One pathway involves the use of initiation factor M1 (IF-M1) to promote AUG-dependent binding of the initiator tRNA to the 40 S subunit, followed by joining of the 60 S subunit in the presence of IF-M2A, IF-M2B, and GTP. The second pathway involves the IF-MP-directed binding of initiator tRNA to the 40 S subunit via a ternary complex of IF-MP-GTP-Met-tRNAf. This reaction does not require AUG codon. However, subsequent formation of an 80 S initiation complex (as determined by methionyl-puromycin synthesis) required AUG as well as IF-M2A, IF-M2B, and GTP. Since both pathways require the same complementary initiation factors (at the same level), it would appear that the only difference is the manner in which the initiator tRNA is bound to the 40 S subunit, either by IF-M1 or IF-MP. Examination of the requirements for endogenous mRNA-directed methionyl-puromycin synthesis indicates a greater difference between IF-MP and IF-M1 in that only IF-MP was capable of forming an 80 S initiation complex which was sensitive to puromycin."
https://openalex.org/W1539783650,"Mammalian cells contain two DNA ligase activities with different chromatographic properties, referred to as DNA ligase I and II. The major ligase activity present in calf thymus cell extracts, DNA ligase I, has been purified 1000-fold. After repeated injections of this enzyme with complete Freund's adjuvant into a rabbit, antibodies were induced that inhibit DNA ligase I from calf, human, mouse, and rabbit tissues. This antiserum did not affect DNA ligase II from the same sources to a detectable extent, even at a concentration 10-fold higher than that required for 98% inhibition of DNA ligase I. These data strongly indicate that the two mammalian DNA ligase activities are due to two separate enzymes, and not to two forms of the same enzyme. Both enzymes are present in the nuclear fraction, but are also found in the cytoplasmic fraction. Rapidly dividing cells (mouse ascites tumor cells and calf thymus) contain higher amounts of DNA ligase I than other cells (calf liver and spleen, human placenta, and rabbit spleen), while no such correlation was observed for DNA ligase II."
https://openalex.org/W1918912649,The function of 5'-nucleotidase in nucleoside uptake from AMP was investigated in human lymphocytes by comparing the transport in cells containing this enzyme (5'N+) with that in cells deficient in the activity (5'N-). The rate of adenosine and Pi uptake from AMP was 3.9-fold greater in the 5'N+ then in the 5'N- lymphocytes. There was no difference in transport between these cells when incubated with adenosine or Pi. These results indicate that phosphorylytic cleavage of AMP by 5'-nucleotidase is necessary for the uptake of the nucleotide and Pi moieties by the human lymphocyte.

https://openalex.org/W1539566748,"Insoluble collagen was prepared from bovine periodontal ligament. Isolation and characterization of CNBr peptides originating from the alpha1(I), alpha2, and alpha1(III) chains showed that the tissue contained both type I and type III collagens. Further evidence for the presence of type III collagen was obtained by the isolation of alpha1(III) chains from pepsin-treated ligament collagen, with properties similar to those of human alpha1(III) chains. Estimates based on the amounts of certain CNBr peptides indicated that about one-fifth of the collagen of periodontal ligament is type III, the remainder being type I collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1523733478,"Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that particulate preparations from maturing cotton fibers catalyze the transfer of mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose into mannosylphosphorylpolyisoprenol (Forsee, W. T., and Elbein,A. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2858-2867). In this report, we show that these particulate preparations also catalyze the inocoporation of mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides and into glycoprotein. The oligosaccharide-lipids were treated with dilute acid to liberate the water-soluble oligosaccharides and these oligosaccharides could then be separated into seven or eight distinct radioactive peaks by paper chromatography in isobutyric acid/NH4OH/H2betaO (57/4/39). The smallest of the oligosaccharides appears to be a trisaccharide with the structure Man leads to GlcNAc-GlcNAc. Thus the oligosaccharides attached to the lipids apparently range in size from those having 3 glycose units to those having approximately 8 to 10 glycose units. The radioactivity in the smaller-sized oligosaccharide-lipids could be chased into the larger oligosaccharide-lipids by a second incubation in the presence of unlabeled GDP-mannose. The sugar at the reducing ends of the oligosaccharides was identified as GlcNAc while some mannose (20 to 30%) was present in alpha linkages at the nonreducing ends..."

Purified enzyme was homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of sodium dodetcyl sulfate. The microsomal forms of beta-glucuronidase were spontaneously converted to the L form. The purified L form is a tetramer of molecular weight of 280,000 to 300,000, composedd of four identical subunits of 75,000 molecular weight. The enzyme contains a high content of arginine and glutamic acid and a very low content of sulfur-containing amino acids. Approximately 7% of the enzyme molecule is compose of carbohydrate. Sugars in the L form are glucosamine, mannose, galactose, and glucose. Sialic acid and fucose are absent in the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1567935433,"Glucocorticoids inhibit glucose utilization by fat cells. The possibility that this effect results from altered glucose transport was investigated using an oil-centrifugation technique which allows a rapid (within 45 s) estimation of glucose or 3-O-methylglucose uptake by isolated fat cells. At high concentration (greater than 25 muM), dexamethasone inhibited glucose uptake within 1 min of its addition to fat cells. Efflux of 3-O-methylglucose was also impaired by 0.1 mM dexamethasone. However, diminished glucose uptake was not a specific effect of glucocorticoids; high concentrations (0.1 mM) of 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and deoxycorticosterone produced a similar response in adipocytes. At a more physiologic steroid concentration (0.1 muM), glucocorticoids inhibited glucose uptake in a time-dependent manner (maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours). This effect was specific for glucocorticoids since, under these conditions, glucose uptake was not changed by the non-glucocorticoid steroids. Lineweaver-Burk analysis showed that 0.1 muM dexamethasone treatment produced a decrease in Vmax for glucose uptake but did not change the Ku. Hexokinase activity and ATP levels were not altered by this treatment, suggesting that processes involved in glucose phosphorylation were not affected. Dexamethasone treatment also caused a reduction in uptake of 3-O-methylglucose when assayed using a low sugar concentration (0.1 mM). At a high concentration (10 mM), uptake of the methyl sugar was only slightly less than normal in treated cells. Stimulation by insulin markedly enhanced uptake of glucose and 3-O-methylglucose by both treated and untreated cells. At a low hexose concentration (0.1 mM) and in the presence of insulin, sugar uptake by dexamethasone-treated cells was slightly less than control cells. Stimulation by insulin did however completely overcome the alteration in hexose uptake when larger concentrations of sugars (greater than 5 mM) were used. There was no detectable change in total protein synthesis during incubation of fat cells with dexamethasone. However, actinomycin C blocked the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on glucose uptake. Cycloheximide, which caused a small inhibition in glucose uptake, prevented the full expression of the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on glucose transport. These results indicate that dexamethasone alters the facilitated transport of glucose and, secondly, suggest that synthesis of RNA and protein is needed for glucocorticoid action."
https://openalex.org/W2085318506,"Projections from medial preoptic area (mPOA) and medial anterior hypothalamic area (mAHA) neurons were investigated in albino rats with the use of tritiated amino acid autoradiography. Both the mPOA and the mAHA gave long-axon projections to structures in limbic forebrain and midbrain as well as short-axon projections to other hypothalamic regions. Differences between mPOA and mAHA neurons were observed in projections to the mid-septal region, ventromedial hypothalamus, premammillary region, and central gray. Further, while axons from the mPOA traveled within the medial forebrain bundle, those from the mAHA remained in a band ventromedial to the fornix. These anatomical differences may underlie functional differences between the mPOA and mAHA which have been demonstrated with other experimental techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1566413889,"The steady state mitochondrial content of coenzyme A-SH (CoA), acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and long chain acyl-CoA has been determined during the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine by rabbit heart mitochondria. Variation of the substrate concentration during ADP-stimulated (state 3) respiration varies the mitochondrial content of long chain acyl-CoA and the rate of O2 uptake, and permits the conclusion that the Km of beta oxidation for intramitochondrial long chain acyl-CoA is approximately 1 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. At near saturating concentrations of palmitoylcarnitine, plus L-malate, the addition of ADP causes a decrease in acetyl-CoA, an increase in CoA and succinyl-CoA, and no clear change in long chain acyl-CoA content. These changes reverse upon the depletion of ADP (state 3 leads to 4 transition). Similar changes in CoA, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA are seen during state 4 leads to 3 leads to 4 transitions with pyruvate plus L-malate and octanoate plus L-malate as substrates. These results suggest a limitation of flux by citrate synthase during the controlled oxidation of these three substrates. The ratio acetyl-CoA/succinyl-CoA was determined not only during state 3 and state 4 oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine plus L-malate and pyruvate plus L-malate, but also during intermediate respiratory states (state 3 1/2) generated by adding glucose and varying amounts of hexokinase. These intermediate states are characterized by a high succinyl-CoA content, relative to either state 3 or state 4, and a suboptimal flux through citrate synthase, estimated either by pyruvate disappearance or by O2 uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1597227895,"Gene V protein exists principally as a dimer in neutral buffers which are 0.15 M in NaCl, NaF, or NaClO4. Higher concentrations of NaClO4 or NaCl disrupt the dimers, but higher concentrations of NaF do not. There is a single sulfhydryl group per gene V protein monomer in native monomers, dimers, and DNA-protein complexes. Disulfide formation leads to loss of protein solubility and DNA binding capacity. The fluorescence of tyrosyl groups is the same for monomers and dimers in NaCl and NaClO4 solutions, but it is extensively quenched on binding to poly(dT) and fd-DNA. Complexes of gene V protein and fd-DNA isolated from lysates of infected cells were found to contain 4.70- +/- 0.13 nucleotides per monomer of gene V protein whereas complexes formed in vitro contain 4.05 +/- 0.17 nucleotides/monomer. It is postulated that tyrosyl groups are not involved in the protein-protein interactions of the monomer-dimer equilibrium, that tyrosyl groups stack with DNA bases in the complexes, and that each subunit of gene V protein in the intracellular complexes with fd-DNA is replaced by exactly two subunits of major coat protein during final assembly of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1568348020,"The major form of phospholipase A2 from cobra venom (Naja naja naja) was prepared in 30% yield and was homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with and without sodium dodecyl sulfate and on Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The monomer molecular weight is about 11,000 according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ultracentrifugation and molecular sieve techniques were employed to confirm the molecular weight and to demonstrate a concentration-dependent aggregation of the enzyme. It was found that at concentrations below about 0.05 mg ml(-1), the enzyme exists predominantly in the monomeric form; kinetic studies are usually conducted in much more dilute solutions (0.2 mug ml(-1)). The amino acid composition of the enzyme is reported. Of special interest is the presence of five to six disulfide bonds, 1 tryptophan residue, and 1 histidine residue. It is stable at high temperatures and is unusually resistant to denaturing agents. The isoelectric point was found to be 4.95. The findings that the protein is unusually resistant to denaturing agents and that it undergoes a concentration-dependent aggregation help to explain some of the previous reports in the literature on the apparent multiple forms of the cobra enzyme and their separation."

https://openalex.org/W1504746604,"Transport of 3-O-methylglucose by rat thymocytes occurs by facilitated diffusion and follows a biphasic time course. The half-times of the two phases of uptake are 0.8 min and 20 to 30 min; the rapid phase contributes 10 to 20% of the total 3-O-methylglucose taken up at equilibrium. Cells incubated under anaerobic conditions for 1 hour undergo a 3- to 4-fold increase in the initial rate of 3-O-methylglucose uptake. The relative contribution of the rapid phase of uptake increases nearly 4-fold in anaerobically incubated cells, although the half-time of the rapid phase remains the same. Anaerobiosis also reduces the half-time of the slow phase of uptake by a factor of three. In the absence of exogenous glucose, anaerobiosis reduces cellular ATP by 97% after 1 hour at 37 degrees. However, full stimulation of transport activity does not occur in cells with such low levels of ATP. When anaerobically incubated cells are re-exposed to oxygen, ATP synthesis proceeds and transport activity increases by 100% within 5 to 10 min. Adding 1 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol at the time the anaerobic cells are reexposed to oxygen completely blocks the subsequent ATP synthesis and the associated increase in transport activity. Cells incubated aerobically in the presence of 1 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol show a 90% reduction in ATP levels and a 2-fold increase in the rate of 3-O-methylglucose uptake. An additional 70% increase in transport activity is observed when the cells are washed free of uncoupler and incubated an additional 10 min. The results suggest that transport activity is stimulated when cellular ATP levels decline but that the stimulation process requires some minimal level of ATP for full expression."
https://openalex.org/W1571692030,"We have previously reported the isolation of old yellow enzyme complexed with a ligand of low molecular weight which imparts a distinctive charge-transfer absorption to the enzyme, making it green in color (Matthews, R. G., and Massey, V. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 1779-1789). This ligand has now been identified as p-hydroxybenzaldehyde by removal from the enzyme and characterization of its optical spectrum and subsequent mass spectral analysis. Similar compounds which are also bound to old yellow enzyme have been isolated from yeast extract and identified. These compounds give rise to complexes with old yellow enzyme which are characterized by broad long wavelength absorption bands, and they lead to inhibition of the NADPH-O2 oxidoreductase activity catalyzed by old yellow enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1559532986,"The tetramer-dimer equilibria of various forms of methemoglobin have been measured by sedimentation equilibrium to test the hypothesis of Perutz that high spin derivatives can be switched by inositol hexaphosphate (Inos-P6) from the R state to the T state more readily than low spin derivatives. Since transitions from the R state to the T state are accompanied by a decrease in the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant (K4,2), this parameter is a quantitative indicator of the conformational state. Measurements of K4,2 were performed using an analytical ultracentrifuge with absorption optics and a scanner-computer system. Statistical analysis of the sedimentation data indicated that the stoichiometry if Inos-P6 binding is 1 molecule/hemoglobin tetramer and 2 molecules/hemoglobin dimer. The apparent affinity of the dimer sites for Inos-P6 is much lower than the corresponding value for the tetramer site. As a result of the stoichiometries, at low concentrations Inos-P6 shifts the tetramer-dimer equilibrium in favor of the tetramer, but at high concentrations Inos-P6 shifts the equilibrium in favor of the dimer. Te tetramer binding site for Inos-P6 of various liganded forms of hemoglobin appears to be the same as has been established for deoxyhemoglobin, since the effect of Inos-P6 on subunit dissociation is reduced in pyridoxylated derivatives. Values of K4,2 for aquo-, azido- and cyanomethemoglobin in 0.01 M 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2''-nitroethanol buffer, pH 6.0/0.1 M NaCl, are all near 2 X 10(-5) M. Upon addition of 50 muM Inos-P6 the values of K4,2 for all three forms are shifted to near 10(-9) M. Since the aquo derivative is high spin, while the azido and cyano derivatives are low spin, the similarity of values for the derivatives in the presence and absence of Inos-P6 indicate that the changes in K4,2 are not spin-spin state dependent. For another high spin derivative, fluoromethemoglobin, such high concentrations of NaF are required that ionic strength effects are encountered. When data at several NaF concentrations are extrapolated to 0.1 M NaF to correct for the ionic strength effects, values of K4,2 of 7 X 10(-6) M and 10(-8) M are obtained for solutions in the absence and in the presence of 50 muM Inos-P6, respectively. Therefore the results with the fluoro derivative, in conjunction with the other forms of methemoglobin, support the view that high spin derivatives do not exhibit a greater response to Inos-P6 than low spin derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1580095812,"Experiments with chloroplasts and purified spinach plastocyanin suggest a mechanism for KCN inhibition of Photosystem I. KCN inhibition can be bypassed by a detergent or reversed by replacement of the inactive plastocyanin. KCN bleaches and inactivates purified plastocyanin. KCN releases copper from chloroplast membranes and from purified plastocyanin. Cyanide does not bind to the apoprotein produced when plastocyanin is treated with KCN, and KCN-produced apoplastocyanin has a N-ethylmaleimide-reactive sulfhydryl group not found in holoplastocyanin. Apoplastocyanin is not active in restoring Photosystem I activity to plastocyanin-depleted membranes. Holoplastocyanin restores Photosystem I activities to plastocyanin-depleted membranes prepared from either control or KCN-treated chloroplasts to about the same extent. KCN-treated chloroplast membranes are found to have higher amounts of apoplastocyanin than do control chloroplast membranes. These results offer evidence that KCN removes the copper from plastocyanin in the chloroplast membrane, leaving the inactive apoplastocyanin which is unable to transfer electrons to Photosystem I."
https://openalex.org/W1590427190,"A non-histone protein has been isolated from Ehrlich ascites tumor chromatin. The minimum molecular weight of this non-histone protein, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis, is approximately 10 to 11,000. This non-histone protein is acidic, contains 2.7% alkalilabile phosphorus, binds to DNA, and inhibits transcription of DNA in vitro by the homologous RNA polymerase. The per cent inhibition of RNA synthesis is not affected by increasing amounts of RNA polymerase, but is reduced by addition of excess DNA. In the presence of the non-histone protein, incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP into RNA in the in vitro RNA synthesizing system is inhibited, with no apparent change in the average chain length of the RNA product. Inhibition of RNA synthesis is completely eliminated if the DNA template is allowed to interact with ATP prior to the addition of the non-histone protein. These results indicate that the observed repression of in vitro RNA synthesis is due to the effect of the non-histone protein on the DNA, inhibiting the initiation of RNA chain formation."
https://openalex.org/W1524712638,"Glucagon was isolated from a side fraction generated during the preparation of insulin and the new pancreatic peptide, avian pancreatic polypeptide from chicken pancreas. The immunological and biological properties are similar to those of beef-pork glucagon. The amino acid composition of chicken glucagon indicates that it contains 1 more serine residue than the porcine hormone and 1 less aspartic acid (asparagine) residue. Thus, chicken glucagon appears to be identical with turkey glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1582166450,"Octanoate and L-palmitylcarnitine inhibited the synthesis of P-enolpyruvate from alpha-ketoglutarate and malate by isolated guinea pig liver mitochondria. A 50% reduction in P-enolpyruvate formation was obtained with 0.1 to 0.2 mM octanoate or with 0.06 to 0.10 mM L-palmitylcarnitine. At these concentrations, oxidative phosphorylation remained intact and only much higher concentrations of fatty acids altered this process. The addition of NH4Cl in the presence of malate and increasing concentrations of alpha-ketoglutarate (or vice versa) enhanced the formation of glutamate, aspartate, and P-enolpyruvate. The addition of increasing concentrations of NH4Cl in the presence of fixed amounts of malate and alpha-ketoglutarate had a similar effect. Furthermore, the inhibition of P-enolpyruvate synthesis by fatty acids and the reduction of the acetoacetate to beta-hydroxybutyrate ratio were reversed by the addition of NH4Cl. Cycloheximide, which blocks energy transfer at site 1 of the respiratory chain, decreased P-enolpyruvate formation. When cycloheximide and either octanoate or L-palmitylcarnitine were added together, there was an even greater reduction in P-enolpyruvate synthesis from either malate or alpha-ketoglutarate than was noted with either fatty acid alone. Since cycloheximide lowers the rate of ATP synthesis this may in turn reduce P-enolpyruvate formation by a mechanism independent of changes in the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio caused by fatty acids. In the isolated perfused liver metabolizing lactate, the inhibitory effect of octanoate on gluconeogenesis was partially relieved by the addition of 1 mM NH4Cl, but remained unchanged in the presence of 2 mM NH4Cl, despite a highly oxidized NAD+/NADH ratio in the mitochondria. In contrast to glucose synthesis, urea formation was markedly increased during the infusion of 1 mM as well as 2 mM NH4Cl. After cessation of NH4Cl infusion, there was an increase in glucose production, to a rate as high as that observed in the absence of octanoate. This increase was accompanied by the disappearance of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate which had been stored in the liver during NH4Cl infusion. Urea synthesis also decreased progressively. These results indicate that gluconeogenesis in guinea pig liver is regulated, in part, by alterations in the mitochondrial oxidation-reduction state. However, the modulation of this effect by changing the concentrations of intermediates of the aspartate aminotransferase reaction indicates competition for oxalacetate between the aminotransferase reaction and P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase."
https://openalex.org/W1635211519,"Cytochrome b5, isolated from rabbit liver by a procedure using detergent, was incubated with phosphatidylcholine bilayer vesicles at 37 degrees for 30 min. A comparison of a number of physical properties was made between the cytochrome b5-phosphatidylcholine complex (at a molar ratio of 1:1000) and the phosphatidylcholine vesicles. The binding of the protein to the vesicle caused no aggregation and no detectable change in Stokes radius of the vesicle as monitored by gel filtration. Only small increases in s20 (from 2.67 up to 3.82 X 10(-13) s) and density (from 1.025 up to 1.042 g ml(-1)) were observed upon binding of the cytochrome b5 to phosphatidylcholine vesicles. At molar ratios of 5:1000, and above, two types of complexes could be detected by sucrose density gradient centrifugation: one had a molar ratio of approximately 1.066 g ml(-1)) the other, a more constant ratio of 20:1000 (density greater than 1.107 g ml(-1)). Cytochrome b5 was also incubated with phosphatidylcholine vesicles prepared with ferricyanide trapped inside. The leakage of the ferricyanide from inside the vesicles was increased when cytochrome b5 was present, but the vesicles, although leaking, were not completely depleted of their ferricyande, and so must still be intact. It is suggested that at molar ratios of cytochrome b5 to phosphatidylcholine below 5:1000, the binding of the protein causes minimal change in vesicle structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545105743,"The interaction of D-xylose isomerase purified from two sources with Mn2+ and D-xylose or the competitive inhibitor xylitol has been examined by nuclear magnetic resonance. A greater paramagnetic effect of enzyme-bound Mn2+ on the alpha anomer of D-xylose than on the beta anomer was observed, providing independent evidence for the specificity of D-xylose isomerase for the alpha anomeric form of D-xylose. The exchange rate of alpha-D-xylose into the ternary complex, determined from the normalized paramagnetic contribution to the transverse relaxation rate (1/fT2p) of the carbon 1 proton of alpha-D-xylose, exceeds Vmax for the enzymatic reaction by 3 orders of magnitude. The amount of xylitol necessary to displace alpha-D-xylose from the substrate-enzyme-Mn2+ complex is consistent with the Km value for alpha-D-xylose and the inhibitor constant Ki for xylitol previously determined by the methods of enzyme kinetics. These results suggest that the NMR experiments observe complexes of D-xylose isomerase which are kinetically and thermodynamically competent to participate in catalysis. From the frequency dependence of the paramagnetic contribution to the longitudinal relaxation rate (1/T1p) of the carbon 1 proton of alpha-D-xylose, the correlation time (tauc) which modulates the dipolar interaction between enzyme-bound Mn2+ and alpha-D-xylose has been determined (5.1 x 1o(-10) s). From these observations a range of calculated distances between enzyme-bound Mn2+ and the carbon 1 proton of alpha-D-xylose (9.1 +/- 0.7 A) has been found. The enzyme-bound Mn2+ has comparable effects on the carbon 1, carbon 2, and carbon 5 protons of alpha-D-xylose, suggesting that these protons of the enzyme-bound substrate are equidistant from the bound Mn2+. A similar distance (9.4 +/- 0.7 A) between the enzyme-bound Mn2+ and the terminal methylene protons of xylitol, an analog of the open chain intermediate in the reaction, has been determined. The results of the present substrate relaxation and previous water relaxation studies suggest that two small ligands such as water molecules or a large portion of the protein intervene between the bound metal ion and the bound substrate in the active ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1566115004,"Intact detergent-washed HeLa nuclei contain a population of polyribisomes that were released by exposure to polyanions such as RNA or poly(U). The released material appeared by electron microscopic examination to be particles averaging about 200 to 300 angstroms in diameter. Sedimentation velocity analysis of the released particles indicated that the particles had S20,w values of 75 and 110. The particles stimulated amino acid incorporation in an ascites S-30 or S-100 extract at 2.5 mM Mg2+. Studies with a variety of antibiotics indicated that these polyribosomes were capable of elongating but not initiating protein synthesis. Although these polyribosomes may be of cytoplasmic origin, they appear unique in that agents thought to disperse chromatin are required for their release from the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1561497983,"Newborn rats received 5 muCi each of [3H]lysine and [methyl-14C]methionine/g body weight. They were killed 10 days later and the nuclei prepared from the kidneys, liver, cerebrum, cerebellum, and thymus. The five major histones were extracted from these nuclei by the method of Johns and further purified on Bio-Gel P-10. The histones were hydrolyzed and the basic amino acids fractionated on Beckman PA-35 resin. Only the F3 and Fia1 histones contained any significant amounts of methylated amino acid residues as measured by chemical or radiological assay. The product of methylation of F2a1 was predominantly dimethyllysine with trace quantities of monomethyllysine detectable in rapidly proliferating tissue. The products of methylation of F3 were mono-, di-, and trimethyllysine in an approximate molar ratio of 0.55:1.0:0.35. This ratio did not vary significantly in the F3 histones prepared from the different organs. No methylarginine or methylhistidine was detected in any of the histones prepared from the five organs. The total amount of dimethyllysine in F2a1 from the different organs of adult rats was approximately 2.0 mol/mol of polypeptide. It appears that the distribution of methyl groups on the lysyl residues in the F3 and F2a1 histones from the different organs is similar and does not contribute to tissue heterogeneity."

The fraction of the 3H conserved in I and II was calculated from both parallel feeding and 3H:14C double labeling experiments. The results for II were the reverse of I. Both hydroxylations of III, which give rise to the enantiomeric products (S)- and (R)-p-hydroxymandelonitrile, occurred with retention of configuration. The retention mode is characteristic of hydroxylations at aliphatic carbons catalyzed by mixed function oxidases."

Ultracentrifugation and fluorescence depolarization confirm this result. Kinetic analysis of the fluorescence depolarization experiments favors a biphasic phenomenon: a few minutes for the faster one and several hours for the slower one. The apparent dissociation constant is 0.8 muM for the apoenzyme and 0.18 muM for the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate form of the holoenzyme. In the presence of sucrose or 0.1 M L-aspartate or a mixture of 70 mM L-glutamate and 2 mM alpha-ketoglutarate, the holoenzyme is dimeric at concentrations higher than 5 nM. The addition of a mixture of the substrates L-glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate to a monomeric holoenzyme leads to dimerization. The stability of the dimeric form is in the order: holoenzyme + substrates greater than apoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1568420199,"In many enzymic reactions one or the other hydrogen is released from a prochiral center abCH2. To determine the stereospecificity with respect to such centers under nonreversal conditions a substrate with a chiral center abC1HH is employed (H = 3H or 2H). Assuming the simplest possible model, the R specificity of an enzyme or enzyme system (eR) may be defined in terms of the configurational R purity of the substrate with respect to the labeled center (pR), and the fraction of H released (r) or conserved (l - r) during the reaction by the equation eR = [(l - r) -pR]/[1 - 2pR]. Where r is constant, this is a rectangular hyperbola. The apparent stereospecificity calculated with this equation serves as a characteristic of the experimental system irrespective of the assumed model. The problems arising from direct isotope effects are discussed and the theoretical advantages of using product 3H:14C ratios under low conversion conditions noted. Applications of the equation to the determination of configurational purity at labeled centers, to the study of stereospecificity in enzymes and enzyme systems, and to the study of the biosynthesis of natural products are discussed."
