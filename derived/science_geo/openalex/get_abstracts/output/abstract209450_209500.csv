https://openalex.org/W2084899755,Subjects who were immobilized for a week but otherwise were exposed to a normal and varied sensory environment showed intellectual and perceptual deficits similar in many respects to those occurring after prolonged visual and auditory deprivation. A significant change in the electroencephalogram was also observed.

https://openalex.org/W1558115883,"Heavy meromyosin (H-meromyosin) in the presence of Mg/sup ++/ catalyzes the incorporation of O/sup 18/ from solvent water into the P/sub i/ released from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), dATP, and cytidine, inosine, uridine, and guanosine triphosphates. Tripolyphosphate under the same conditions does not undergo the O/ sup 18/ exchange reaction with either myosin or H-meromyosin. The H-meromyosin catalyzed O/sup 18/ exchange with Mg/sup ++/ ATP is independent of hydrogen ion concentration between pH 5.5 and pH 9.3. The ATPasedependence of H-meromyosin on divalent metal ion radius and on pH has been found to correspond to that of myosin systems. A rough correlation was found between the divalent metal ions required for contraction, for optimal O/sup 18/ exchange, and for strong complexing with ATP/sup -4/. A parallelism exists between the substrates giving the maximal amount of tension and those giving the maximal amount of exchange. It is suggested that some amino acids at the active site of myosin are common to the exchange reaction and the contractile process. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W1986997043,Seven days' exposure to unpatterned light and white noise produced a significantly greater decrease in occipital lobe frequencies than did the same period of darkness and silence. This differential effect may be related to the greater behavioral impairments which seem to occur after prolonged exposure to diffuse light and noise.

Rabbit anti-hog gastrin serum which was reacted with hog, dog, and human gastrins in vitro caused reduction of their gastric stimulatory effect, indicating a biological cross reaction among these species."

This polysaccharide, when extracted from the membranes, did not give a precipitin reaction with group A antisera, but could be coprecipitated with added group A polysaccharide by acetone. It is presumed to be a precursor to group specific polysaccharide of the streptococcal cell wall."

https://openalex.org/W2049443922,"EVIDENCE for the neutralization of pituitary gonadotrophic hormone activity in mammals by immunological procedures has been reviewed in several articles. The specificity of the hormone neutralizing (antihormone) effect of the antiserum has been suggested by many of the investigations reviewed, but there has been some question as to the specificity of this effect, because of the possible role of impurities or trace antigenic contaminants in the hormone preparations used1–4. A recent report5 describes the successful inactivation of a purified pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); the marked follicular stimulation obtained by the injection of sheep FSH into immature hypophysectomized female rats could be completely inhibited with rabbit antiserum to the homologous FSH. This inhibitory effect was found to be dependent on the dosage of antiserum used. Other recent studies have reported the neutralization of endogenously secreted pituitary interstitial-cell stimulating hormone (ICSH) in the normal immature6–8 and mature8 male rat and in the immature female rat9, with the use of antiserum prepared against purified sheep ICSH."
https://openalex.org/W2051155692,"Morphological changes in the cutaneous microcirculation during wound healing have been studied by capillaroscopy in man. In experimental and accidental burns, abrasions, and lacerations, in addition to the anticipated revascularization by the deeper dermal vessels, a distinctive pattern of response by the surrounding papillary capillaries was consistently observed. This appears to be a general phenomenon in healing of skin lesions and suggests the possibility that a potent capillary-attracting factor may be produced within the injured tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2082179006,"Chronically epileptic cats and monkeys showed marked activation of paroxysmal electrographic abnormalities both in the original focus and in a number of structures with secondarily altered functional states after intraperitoneal injection of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (10 to 25 mg/kg) plus vitamin B6. Much less 5-hydroxytryptophan was required to produce such epileptogenic activation if the animals had previously been treated with Marsilid, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Marked paroxysmal activity in epileptic animals was also produced by injection of Marsilid alone or of Marsilid in combination with reserpine. Since all of the activating agents used have been shown by others to elevate brain serotonin levels, the epileptogenic activation may be correlated with such high levels. Since the effects were at least partially blocked by atropine, such ""serotonin-induced"" activation may possibly involve some cholinergic mechanism."

Unilateral temporal lobectomy in two animals had no effect upon lengths of menstrual cycles. Bilateral lesions in two animals affected menstrual function, producing significantly lengthened menstrual cycles with unfamiliar vaginal exfoliation patterns."
