https://openalex.org/W2160981405,"Clinical tests that rely on next-generation sequencing to evaluate large numbers of cancer genes can be validated using pooled cell lines with known mutations. As more clinically relevant cancer genes are identified, comprehensive diagnostic approaches are needed to match patients to therapies, raising the challenge of optimization and analytical validation of assays that interrogate millions of bases of cancer genomes altered by multiple mechanisms. Here we describe a test based on massively parallel DNA sequencing to characterize base substitutions, short insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations and selected fusions across 287 cancer-related genes from routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens. We implemented a practical validation strategy with reference samples of pooled cell lines that model key determinants of accuracy, including mutant allele frequency, indel length and amplitude of copy change. Test sensitivity achieved was 95–99% across alteration types, with high specificity (positive predictive value >99%). We confirmed accuracy using 249 FFPE cancer specimens characterized by established assays. Application of the test to 2,221 clinical cases revealed clinically actionable alterations in 76% of tumors, three times the number of actionable alterations detected by current diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W2065006553,"A novel approach to analyse high-depth Hi-C data provides a comprehensive chromatin interaction map at approximately 5–10 kb resolution in human fibroblasts; this reveals that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with target promoters before signalling and that this chromatin looping is a strong predictor of gene induction. Hi-C is a genomic technology based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) that can identify long-range looping interactions of chromatin throughout the genome in an unbiased fashion. Bing Ren and colleagues have developed a novel analysis pipeline for Hi-C data sets that offers much improved resolution so that interactions between cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters can be defined. Applying it to study dynamic chromatin interactions during NF-κB signalling in human fibroblasts, they find that the majority of interactions between enhancers and promoters have already formed prior to the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors to enhancers. The regulatory targets of the transcription factor thus appear to have been hardwired into the chromatin architecture. A large number of cis-regulatory sequences have been annotated in the human genome1,2, but defining their target genes remains a challenge3. One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques4. However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C)5. We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5–10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter–enhancer contacts after TNF-α signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner."

https://openalex.org/W2098613050,"It is generally believed that cytoskeletal activities drive random cell migration, whereas signal transduction events initiated by receptors regulate the cytoskeleton to guide cells. However, we find that the cytoskeletal network, involving SCAR/WAVE, Arp 2/3 and actin-binding proteins, is capable of generating only rapid oscillations and undulations of the cell boundary. The signal transduction network, comprising multiple pathways that include Ras GTPases, PI(3)K and Rac GTPases, is required to generate the sustained protrusions of migrating cells. The signal transduction network is excitable, exhibiting wave propagation, refractoriness and maximal response to suprathreshold stimuli, even in the absence of the cytoskeleton. We suggest that cell motility results from coupling of ‘pacemaker’ signal transduction and ‘idling motor’ cytoskeletal networks, and various guidance cues that modulate the threshold for triggering signal transduction events are integrated to control the mode and direction of migration. Devreotes and colleagues analyse cytoskeletal regulator and signal transduction networks and use computational simulations to provide a model for cell migration. They propose that activation of an excitable signalling network needs to engage an oscillatory cytoskeletal network to promote formation of large protrusions and cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W2137429375,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major pathological protein in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There are many disease-associated mutations in TDP-43, and several cellular and animal models with ectopic overexpression of mutant TDP-43 have been established. Here we sought to study altered molecular events in FTD and ALS by using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived patient neurons. We generated multiple iPSC lines from an FTD/ALS patient with the TARDBP A90V mutation and from an unaffected family member who lacked the mutation. After extensive characterization, two to three iPSC lines from each subject were selected, differentiated into postmitotic neurons, and screened for relevant cell-autonomous phenotypes. Patient-derived neurons were more sensitive than control neurons to 100 nM straurosporine but not to other inducers of cellular stress. Three disease-relevant cellular phenotypes were revealed under staurosporine-induced stress. First, TDP-43 was localized in the cytoplasm of a higher percentage of patient neurons than control neurons. Second, the total TDP-43 level was lower in patient neurons with the A90V mutation. Third, the levels of microRNA-9 (miR-9) and its precursor pri-miR-9-2 decreased in patient neurons but not in control neurons. The latter is likely because of reduced TDP-43, as shRNA-mediated TDP-43 knockdown in rodent primary neurons also decreased the pri-miR-9-2 level. The reduction in miR-9 expression was confirmed in human neurons derived from iPSC lines containing the more pathogenic TARDBP M337V mutation, suggesting miR-9 downregulation might be a common pathogenic event in FTD/ALS. These results show that iPSC models of FTD/ALS are useful for revealing stress-dependent cellular defects of human patient neurons containing rare TDP-43 mutations in their native genetic contexts."

Here, we identified the protein-serine/threonine kinase PIM2, a known oncogene, as a novel binding partner of PKM2. The interaction between PIM2 and PKM2 was confirmed by multiple biochemical approaches in vitro and in cultured cells. Importantly, we found that PIM2 could directly phosphorylate PKM2 on the Thr-454 residue, resulting in an increase of PKM2 protein levels. Compared with wild type, PKM2 with the phosphorylation-defective mutation displayed a reduced effect on glycolysis, co-activating HIF-1α and β-catenin, and cell proliferation, while enhancing mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells. These findings demonstrate that PIM2-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 is critical for regulating the Warburg effect in cancer, highlighting PIM2 as a potential therapeutic target.

https://openalex.org/W1997281289,"Vimentin, a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein, is phosphorylated predominantly in mitosis. The expression of a phosphorylation-compromised vimentin mutant in T24 cultured cells leads to cytokinetic failure, resulting in binucleation (multinucleation). The physiological significance of intermediate filament phosphorylation during mitosis for organogenesis and tissue homeostasis was uncertain. Here, we generated knock-in mice expressing vimentin that have had the serine sites phosphorylated during mitosis substituted by alanine residues. Homozygotic mice (VIM(SA/SA)) presented with microophthalmia and cataracts in the lens, whereas heterozygotic mice (VIM(WT/SA)) were indistinguishable from WT (VIM(WT/WT)) mice. In VIM(SA/SA) mice, lens epithelial cell number was not only reduced but the cells also exhibited chromosomal instability, including binucleation and aneuploidy. Electron microscopy revealed fiber membranes that were disorganized in the lenses of VIM(SA/SA), reminiscent of similar characteristic changes seen in age-related cataracts. Because the mRNA level of the senescence (aging)-related gene was significantly elevated in samples from VIM(SA/SA), the lens phenotype suggests a possible causal relationship between chromosomal instability and premature aging."
https://openalex.org/W2084058548,"Background Viral small RNAs (vsiRNAs) in the infected host can be generated from viral double-stranded RNA replicative intermediates, self-complementary regions of the viral genome or from the action of host RNA-dependent RNA polymerases on viral templates. The vsiRNA abundance and profile as well as the endogenous small RNA population can vary between different hosts infected by the same virus influencing viral pathogenicity and host response. There are no reports on the analysis of vsiRNAs of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), a segmented negative stranded RNA virus in the family Bunyaviridae, with two of its gene segments showing ambisense gene arrangement. The virus causes significant economic losses to numerous field and horticultural crops worldwide. Principal Findings Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)-specific vsiRNAs were characterized by deep sequencing in virus-infected experimental host Nicotiana benthamiana and a commercial, susceptible host tomato. The total small (s) RNA reads in TSWV-infected tomato sample showed relatively equal distribution of 21, 22 and 24 nt, whereas N. benthamiana sample was dominated by 24 nt total sRNAs. The number of vsiRNA reads detected in tomato was many a magnitude (~350:1) higher than those found in N. benthamiana, however the profile of vsiRNAs in terms of relative abundance 21, 22 and 24 nt class size was similar in both the hosts. Maximum vsiRNA reads were obtained for the M RNA segment of TSWV while the largest L RNA segment had the least number of vsiRNAs in both tomato and N. benthamiana. Only the silencing suppressor, NSs, of TSWV recorded higher antisense vsiRNA with respect to the coding frame among all the genes of TSWV. Significance Details of the origin, distribution and abundance of TSWV vsiRNAs could be useful in designing efficient targets for exploiting RNA interference for virus resistance. It also has major implications toward our understanding of the differential processing of vsiRNAs in antiviral defense and viral pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2036171395,"The regulatory role of miRNA in gene expression is an emerging hot new topic in the control of hypometabolism. Sea cucumber aestivation is a complicated physiological process that includes obvious hypometabolism as evidenced by a decrease in the rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia nitrogen excretion, as well as a serious degeneration of the intestine into a very tiny filament. To determine whether miRNAs play regulatory roles in this process, the present study analyzed profiles of miRNA expression in the intestine of the sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), using Solexa deep sequencing technology. We identified 308 sea cucumber miRNAs, including 18 novel miRNAs specific to sea cucumber. Animals sampled during deep aestivation (DA) after at least 15 days of continuous torpor, were compared with animals from a non-aestivation (NA) state (animals that had passed through aestivation and returned to the active state). We identified 42 differentially expressed miRNAs [RPM (reads per million) >10, |FC| (|fold change|) ≥ 1, FDR (false discovery rate) <0.01] during aestivation, which were validated by two other miRNA profiling methods: miRNA microarray and real-time PCR. Among the most prominent miRNA species, miR-200-3p, miR-2004, miR-2010, miR-22, miR-252a, miR-252a-3p and miR-92 were significantly over-expressed during deep aestivation compared with non-aestivation animals. Preliminary analyses of their putative target genes and GO analysis suggest that these miRNAs could play important roles in global transcriptional depression and cell differentiation during aestivation. High-throughput sequencing data and microarray data have been submitted to GEO database."
https://openalex.org/W2082248802,"Conservation research aims at understanding whether present protection schemes are adequate for the maintenance of ecosystems structure and function across time. We evaluated long-term variation in rocky reef communities by comparing sites surveyed in 1993 and again in 2008. This research took place in Tigullio Gulf, an emblematic case study where various conservation measures, including a marine protected area, have been implemented to manage multiple human uses. Contrary to our prediction that protection should have favored ecosystem stability, we found that communities subjected to conservation measures (especially within the marine protected area) exhibited the greatest variation toward architectural complexity loss. Between 1993 and 2008, chronic anthropogenic pressures (especially organic load) that had already altered unprotected sites in 1993 expanded their influence into protected areas. This expansion of human pressure likely explains our observed changes in the benthic communities. Our results suggest that adaptive ecosystem-based management (EBM), that is management taking into account human interactions, informed by continuous monitoring, is needed in order to attempt reversing the current trend towards less architecturally complex communities. Protected areas are not sufficient to stop ecosystem alteration by pressures coming from outside. Monitoring, and consequent management actions, should therefore extend to cover the relevant scales of those pressures."
https://openalex.org/W1988368673,"The cornea is the clear, outermost portion of the eye composed of three layers: an epithelium that provides a protective barrier while allowing transmission of light into the eye, a collagen-rich stroma, and an endothelium monolayer. How cornea development and aging is controlled is poorly understood. Here we characterize the mouse cornea transcriptome from early embryogenesis through aging and compare it with transcriptomes of other epithelial tissues, identifying cornea-enriched genes, pathways, and transcriptional regulators. Additionally, we profiled cornea epithelium and stroma, defining genes enriched in these layers. Over 10,000 genes are differentially regulated in the mouse cornea across the time course, showing dynamic expression during development and modest expression changes in fewer genes during aging. A striking transition time point for gene expression between postnatal days 14 and 28 corresponds with completion of cornea development at the transcriptional level. Clustering classifies co-expressed, and potentially co-regulated, genes into biologically informative categories, including groups that exhibit epithelial or stromal enriched expression. Based on these findings, and through loss of function studies and ChIP-seq, we show that the Ets transcription factor EHF promotes cornea epithelial fate through complementary gene activating and repressing activities. Furthermore, we identify potential interactions between EHF, KLF4, and KLF5 in promoting cornea epithelial differentiation. These data provide insights into the mechanisms underlying epithelial development and aging, identifying EHF as a regulator of cornea epithelial identity and pointing to interactions between Ets and KLF factors in promoting epithelial fate. Furthermore, this comprehensive gene expression data set for the cornea is a powerful tool for discovery of novel cornea regulators and pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1987577798,"Mutations in the BEST1 gene constitute an underlying cause of juvenile macular dystrophies, a group of retinal disorders commonly referred to as bestrophinopathies and usually diagnosed in early childhood or adolescence. The disease primarily affects macular and paramacular regions of the eye leading to major declines in central vision later in life. Currently, there is no cure or surgical management for BEST1-associated disorders. The recently characterized human disease counterpart, canine multifocal retinopathy (cmr), recapitulates a full spectrum of clinical and molecular features observed in human bestrophinopathies and offers a valuable model system for development and testing of therapeutic strategies. In this study, the specificity, efficiency and safety of rAAV-mediated transgene expression driven by the human VMD2 promoter were assessed in wild-type canine retinae. While the subretinal delivery of rAAV2/1 vector serotype was associated with cone damage in the retina when BEST1 and GFP were co-expressed, the rAAV2/2 vector serotype carrying either GFP reporter or BEST1 transgene under control of human VMD2 promoter was safe, and enabled specific transduction of the RPE cell monolayer that was stable for up to 6 months post injection. These encouraging studies with the rAAV2/2 vector lay the groundwork for development of gene augmentation therapy for human bestrophinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2024760968,"We recently identified meclizine, an over-the-counter drug, as an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Curiously, meclizine blunted respiration in intact cells but not in isolated mitochondria, suggesting an unorthodox mechanism. Using a metabolic profiling approach, we now show that treatment with meclizine leads to a sharp elevation of cellular phosphoethanolamine, an intermediate in the ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway of phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. Metabolic labeling and in vitro enzyme assays confirmed direct inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (PCYT2). Inhibition of PCYT2 by meclizine led to rapid accumulation of its substrate, phosphoethanolamine, which is itself an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Our work identifies the first pharmacologic inhibitor of the Kennedy pathway, demonstrates that its biosynthetic intermediate is an endogenous inhibitor of respiration, and provides key mechanistic insights that may facilitate repurposing meclizine for disorders of energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2054866068,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are a group of trimeric cation permeable channels gated by extracellular protons that are mainly expressed in the nervous system. Despite the structural information available for ASIC1, there is limited understanding of the molecular mechanism that allows these channels to sense and respond to drops in extracellular pH. In this report, we employed the substituted cysteine accessibility method and site-directed mutagenesis to examine the mechanism of activation of ASIC1a by extracellular protons. We found that the modification of E238C and D345C channels by MTSET reduced proton apparent affinity for activation. Furthermore, the introduction of positively charged residues at position 345 rendered shifted biphasic proton activation curves. Likewise, channels bearing mutations at positions 79 and 416 in the palm domain of the channel showed reduced proton apparent affinity and biphasic proton activation curves. Of significance, the effect of the mutations at positions 79 and 345 on channel activation was additive. E79K-D345K required a change to a pH lower than 2 for maximal activation. In summary, this study provides direct evidence for the presence of two distinct proton coordination sites in the extracellular region of ASIC1a, which jointly facilitate pore opening in response to extracellular acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2082133398,"Prolactin (PRL) regulates activity of nociceptors and causes hyperalgesia in pain conditions. PRL enhances nociceptive responses by rapidly modulating channels in nociceptors. The molecular mechanisms underlying PRL-induced transient signaling in neurons are not well understood. Here we use a variety of cell biology and pharmacological approaches to show that PRL transiently enhanced capsaicin-evoked responses involve protein kinase C ε (PKCε) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways in female rat trigeminal (TG) neurons. We next reconstituted PRL-induced signaling in a heterologous expression system and TG neurons from PRL receptor (PRLR)-null mutant mice by expressing rat PRLR-long isoform (PRLR-L), PRLR-short isoform (PRLR-S), or a mix of both. Results show that PRLR-S, but not PRLR-L, is capable of mediating PRL-induced transient enhancement of capsaicin responses in both male and female TG neurons. However, co-expression of PRLR-L with PRLR-S (1:1 ratio) leads to the inhibition of the transient PRL actions. Co-expression of PRLR-L deletion mutants with PRLR-S indicated that the cytoplasmic site adjacent to the trans-membrane domain of PRLR-L was responsible for inhibitory effects of PRLR-L. Furthermore, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry data indicate that in normal conditions, PRLR-L is expressed mainly in glia with little expression in rat sensory neurons (3-5%) and human nerves. The predominant PRLR form in TG neurons/nerves from rats and humans is PRLR-S. Altogether, PRL-induced transient signaling in sensory neurons is governed by PI3K or PKCε, mediated via the PRLR-S isoform, and transient effects mediated by PRLR-S are inhibited by presence of PRLR-L in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969471723,"Background Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) affects 5–10% of all newborns and is associated with increased risk of memory, attention and anxiety problems in late childhood and adolescence. The neurostructural correlates of long-term abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR are unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of the long-term functional and neurostructural correlates of abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR in a near-term rabbit model (delivered at 30 days of gestation) and evaluate the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers of abnormal neurodevelopment based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and connectivity. Methodology At +70 postnatal days, 10 cases and 11 controls were functionally evaluated with the Open Field Behavioral Test which evaluates anxiety and attention and the Object Recognition Task that evaluates short-term memory and attention. Subsequently, brains were collected, fixed and a high resolution MRI was performed. Differences in diffusion parameters were analyzed by means of voxel-based and connectivity analysis measuring the number of fibers reconstructed within anxiety, attention and short-term memory networks over the total fibers. Principal Findings The results of the neurobehavioral and cognitive assessment showed a significant higher degree of anxiety, attention and memory problems in cases compared to controls in most of the variables explored. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) revealed significant differences between groups in multiple brain regions mainly in grey matter structures, whereas connectivity analysis demonstrated lower ratios of fibers within the networks in cases, reaching the statistical significance only in the left hemisphere for both networks. Finally, VBA and connectivity results were also correlated with functional outcome. Conclusions The rabbit model used reproduced long-term functional impairments and their neurostructural correlates of abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR. The description of the pattern of microstructural changes underlying functional defects may help to develop biomarkers based in diffusion MRI and connectivity analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1971131580,"Analysis of the metaproteome of microbial communities is important to provide an insight of community physiology and pathogenicity. This study evaluated the metaproteome of endodontic infections associated with acute apical abscesses and asymptomatic apical periodontitis lesions. Proteins persisting or expressed after root canal treatment were also evaluated. Finally, human proteins associated with these infections were identified. Samples were taken from root canals of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis before and after chemomechanical treatment using either NaOCl or chlorhexidine as the irrigant. Samples from abscesses were taken by aspiration of the purulent exudate. Clinical samples were processed for analysis of the exoproteome by using two complementary mass spectrometry platforms: nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap quadrupole Velos Orbitrap and liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight. A total of 308 proteins of microbial origin were identified. The number of proteins in abscesses was higher than in asymptomatic cases. In canals irrigated with chlorhexidine, the number of identified proteins decreased substantially, while in the NaOCl group the number of proteins increased. The large majority of microbial proteins found in endodontic samples were related to metabolic and housekeeping processes, including protein synthesis, energy metabolism and DNA processes. Moreover, several other proteins related to pathogenicity and resistance/survival were found, including proteins involved with adhesion, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance, stress proteins, exotoxins, invasins, proteases and endopeptidases (mostly in abscesses), and an archaeal protein linked to methane production. The majority of human proteins detected were related to cellular processes and metabolism, as well as immune defense. Interrogation of the metaproteome of endodontic microbial communities provides information on the physiology and pathogenicity of the community at the time of sampling. There is a growing need for expanded and more curated protein databases that permit more accurate identifications of proteins in metaproteomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2075026420,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in worldwide including Japan. Several studies have identified common genetic variants to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. Due to the complex linkage disequilibrium structure and various environmental exposures in different populations, it is essential to identify variants associated with breast cancer in each population, which subsequently facilitate the better understanding of mammary carcinogenesis. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as well as whole-genome imputation with 2,642 cases and 2,099 unaffected female controls. We further examined 13 suggestive loci (P<1.0 × 10(-5)) using an independent sample set of 2,885 cases and 3,395 controls and successfully validated two previously-reported loci, rs2981578 (combined P-value of 1.31 × 10(-12), OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.16-.30) on chromosome 10q26 (FGFR2), rs3803662 (combined P-value of 2.79 × 10(-11), OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.15-.28) and rs12922061 (combined P-value of 3.97 × 10(-10), OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.15-.31) on chromosome 16q12 (TOX3-LOC643714). Weighted genetic risk score on the basis of three significantly associated variants and two previously reported breast cancer associated loci in East Asian population revealed that individuals who carry the most risk alleles in category 5 have 2.2 times higher risk of developing breast cancer in the Japanese population than those who carry the least risk alleles in reference category 1. Although we could not identify additional loci associated with breast cancer, our study utilized one of the largest sample sizes reported to date, and provided genetic status that represent the Japanese population. Further local and international collaborative study is essential to identify additional genetic variants that could lead to a better, accurate prediction for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2030003939,"MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that modulates transcription via its cytoplasmic domain. We evaluated the capacity of MUC1 to regulate the global transcription of microRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells expressing MUC1. Results indicated that MUC1 regulated expression of at least 103 microRNAs. We evaluated further regulation of the microRNA transcript cluster miR-200c/141, which was among the most highly regulated microRNAs. We found that MUC1 directly interacted with ZEB1, a known transcriptional repressor of the miR-200c/141 cluster, at the promoter of miR-200c/141, and further reduced transcript production. These data indicate that signaling through MUC1 influences cancer progression by regulating transcription of microRNAs that are associated with the process of metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2051896677,"Tryptophanyl-tRNA Synthetase (TrpRS) Urzyme (fragments A and C), a 130-residue construct containing only secondary structures positioning the HIGH and KMSKS active site signatures and the specificity helix, accelerates tRNA(Trp) aminoacylation with ∼10-fold specificity toward tryptophan, relative to structurally related tyrosine. We proposed that including the 76-residue connecting peptide 1 insertion (Fragment B) might enhance tryptophan affinity and hence amino acid specificity, because that subdomain constrains the orientation of the specificity helix. We test that hypothesis by characterizing two new constructs: the catalytic domain (fragments A-C) and the Urzyme supplemented with the anticodon-binding domain (fragments A, C, and D). The three constructs, together with the full-length enzyme (fragments A-D), comprise a factorial experiment from which we deduce individual and combined contributions of the two modules to the steady-state kinetics parameters for tryptophan-dependent (32)PPi exchange, specificity for tryptophan versus tyrosine, and aminoacylation of tRNA(Trp). Factorial design directly measures the energetic coupling between the two more recent modules in the contemporary enzyme and demonstrates its functionality. Combining the TrpRS Urzyme individually in cis with each module affords an analysis of long term evolution of amino acid specificity and tRNA aminoacylation, both essential for expanding the genetic code. Either module significantly enhances tryptophan activation but unexpectedly eliminates amino acid specificity for tryptophan, relative to tyrosine, and significantly reduces tRNA aminoacylation. Exclusive dependence of both enhanced functionalities of full-length TrpRS on interdomain coupling energies between the two new modules argues that independent recruitment of connecting peptide 1 and the anticodon-binding domain during evolutionary development of Urzymes would have entailed significant losses of fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2010345765,"Our goals are to simultaneously determine the three-dimensional distribution patterns of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in cardiac myocytes and to study the mechanism and functional implications for variations in KCNQ1/KCNE1 colocalization in myocytes. We monitored the distribution patterns of KCNQ1, KCNE1, and markers for subcellular compartments/organelles using immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy and confirmed the findings in ventricular myocytes by directly observing fluorescently tagged KCNQ1-GFP and KCNE1-dsRed expressed in these cells. We also monitored the effects of stress on KCNQ1-GFP and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remodeling during live cell imaging. The data showed that 1) KCNE1 maintained a stable cell surface localization, whereas KCNQ1 exhibited variations in the cytosolic compartment (striations versus vesicles) and the degree of presence on the cell surface; 2) the degree of cell surface KCNQ1/KCNE1 colocalization was positively correlated with slow delayed rectifier (IKs) current density; 3) KCNQ1 and calnexin (an ER marker) shared a cytosolic compartment; and 4) in response to stress ([Ca(2+)]i elevation, oxidative overload, or AT1R stimulation), KCNQ1 exited the cytosolic compartment and trafficked to the cell periphery in vesicles. This was accompanied by partial ER fragmentation. We conclude that the cellular milieu regulates KCNQ1 distribution in cardiac myocytes and that stressful conditions can increase IKs by inducing KCNQ1 movement to the cell surface. This represents a hitherto unrecognized mechanism by which IKs fulfills its function as a repolarization reserve in ventricular myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2084094005,"The physiological maintenance of a stable internal temperature by mammals and birds - the phenomenon termed homeothermy - is well known to be energetically expensive. The annual energy requirements of free-living mammals and birds are estimated to be 15-30 times higher than those of similar-size ectothermic vertebrates like lizards. Contemporary humans also use energy to accomplish thermoregulation. They are unique, however, in having shifted thermoregulatory control from the body to the occupied environment, with most people living in cities in dwellings that are temperature-regulated by furnaces and air conditioners powered by exogenous energy sources. The energetic implications of this strategy remain poorly defined. Here we comparatively quantify energy costs in cities, dwellings, and individual human bodies. Thermoregulation persists as a major driver of energy expenditure across these three scales, resulting in energy-versus-ambient-temperature relationships remarkably similar in shape. Incredibly, despite the many and diversified uses of network-delivered energy in modern societies, the energy requirements of six North American cities are as temperature-dependent as the energy requirements of isolated, individual homeotherms. However, the annual per-person energy cost of exogenously powered thermoregulation in cities and dwellings is 9-28 times higher than the cost of endogenous, metabolic thermoregulation of the human body. Shifting the locus of thermoregulatory control from the body to the dwelling achieves climate-independent thermal comfort. However, in an era of amplifying climate change driven by the carbon footprint of humanity, we must acknowledge the energetic extravagance of contemporary, city-scale thermoregulation, which prioritizes heat production over heat conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2022389072,"In agreement with historical documentation, several genetic studies have revealed ancestral links between the European Romani and India. The entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 27 Spanish Romani was sequenced in order to shed further light on the origins of this population. The data were analyzed together with a large published dataset (mainly hypervariable region I [HVS-I] haplotypes) of Romani (N=1,353) and non-Romani worldwide populations (N>150,000). Analysis of mitogenomes allowed the characterization of various Romani-specific clades. M5a1b1a1 is the most distinctive European Romani haplogroup; it is present in all Romani groups at variable frequencies (with only sporadic findings in non-Romani) and represents 18% of their mtDNA pool. Its phylogeographic features indicate that M5a1b1a1 originated 1.5 thousand years ago (kya; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8) in a proto-Romani population living in Northwest India. U3 represents the most characteristic Romani haplogroup of European/Near Eastern origin (12.4%); it appears at dissimilar frequencies across the continent (Iberia: ≈ 31%; Eastern/Central Europe: ≈ 13%). All U3 mitogenomes of our Iberian Romani sample fall within a new sub-clade, U3b1c, which can be dated to 0.5 kya (95% CI: 0.3-0.7); therefore, signaling a lower bound for the founder event that followed admixture in Europe/Near East. Other minor European/Near Eastern haplogroups (e.g. H24, H88a) were also assimilated into the Romani by introgression with neighboring populations during their diaspora into Europe; yet some show a differentiation from the phylogenetically closest non-Romani counterpart. The phylogeny of Romani mitogenomes shows clear signatures of low effective population sizes and founder effects. Overall, these results are in good agreement with historical documentation, suggesting that cultural identity and relative isolation have allowed the Romani to preserve a distinctive mtDNA heritage, with some features linking them unequivocally to their ancestral Indian homeland."

Similar conditions also result in racemization of the H220 cysteine. Here, we report that racemization occurs on both H220 and L214 on an IgG1 with a λ light chain (IgG1λ) but almost entirely on H220 of an IgGl with a κ light chain (IgG1κ) under similar conditions. Likewise, racemization was detected at significant levels on H220 and L214 on endogenous human IgG1λ but only at the H220 position on IgG1κ. Low but measurable levels of d-cysteines were found on IgG2 cysteines in the hinge region, both with monoclonal antibodies incubated under basic pH conditions and on antibodies isolated from human serum. A simplified reaction mechanism involving reversible β-elimination on the cysteine is presented that accounts for both base-catalyzed racemization and thioether formation at the hinge disulfide.

Much of the product quality attribute monitoring for biotherapeutics, including mAbs, is for posttranslational modifications. The recent regulatory agency focus on “quality by design” places greater emphasis on how the product quality attributes affect the safety and efficacy of the drug. Those product quality attributes that must be controlled within certain ranges are considered critical quality attributes. Many posttranslational modifications found in biotherapeutic proteins, including methionine oxidations, deamidations, glycations, and disulfide isoforms, form during production or storage (3Liu H.

Some of the posttranslational modifications that increase in the IgG1 antibody subtype during storage are localized to the flexible hinge region between the Fab arms and the Fc region. Under stress conditions such as exposure to heat, chemicals, or UV light, fragmentation, thioether bond formation, and racemization of cysteines have been detected in this region (4Cohen S.L.

Recently, we explored the base-catalyzed thioether bond formation in human IgG1s (10Zhang Q. Schenauer M.R. McCarter J.D. Flynn G.C. IgG1 thioether bond formation in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16371-16382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Formation rates were faster in antibodies containing λ light chains over those with the more common κ light chains. A reaction mechanism was proposed in which dehydrogenation occurred on either the H220 or L214 to form dehydroalanine as an intermediate in the thioether formation pathway. More dehydrogenation occurred on the cysteine L214 of the λ than the κ light chains, presumably due to its position, which on the λ light chain is one residue away from the C terminus. One prediction from the proposed mechanism, which was not explored in the previously reported study, was that reversibility of the dehydrogenation step would cause racemization of cysteine. Because dehydrogenation occurred on both the H220 and L214 in IgG1λ antibodies, racemization would also be expected to be detected on both cysteines in the H220-L214 disulfide bond. Here, we explore the racemization reaction in IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies and integrate these findings into a simplified reaction mechanism for both thioether formation and cysteine racemization. Four recombinant human monoclonal antibodies, mAbA (IgG1κ), mAbB (IgG1λ), mAbC (IgG2κ), and mAbD (IgG2λ) were produced from CHO cells and purified at Amgen, Inc. Human IgGs (myIgG1κ, myIgG1λ, myIgG2κ, and myIgG2λ), purified from plasma of myeloma patients, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyclonal endogenous IgGs were isolated from the serum of healthy human donors as described previously (11Liu Y.D. van Enk J.Z. Flynn G.C.

TFA and dithiothreitol were purchased from Thermo Scientific Pierce (Rockford, IL). Synthetic peptides with L/D cysteine, TVAPTECS, TVAPTE(d-Cys)S, SFNRGEC, SFNRGE(d-Cys), SCDK, S(d-Cys)DK, were obtained from 21 Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). 50 mm deuterated glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.3) was prepared by mixing 2.5 ml of 0.2 m glycine dissolved in D2O with 0.44 ml of 0.2 m NaOH (prepared in D2O). Monoclonal antibodies mAbA, mAbB, mAbC, and mAbD (at ∼30 mg/ml) were briefly dried with a centrifuge under vacuum and incubated in both H2O-based glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.1), and D2O-based glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.3) for 6 days at 56 °C. To denature the antibodies, 50 μl of antibody solutions (∼3 mg/ml) were mixed with 10 μl of 1.0 m NaH2PO4, 10 μl of 0.4 m NH2OH, 6 μl of 36 mg/ml methionine, and 36 mg of urea. After vortexing, 3 μl of 20% TFA (v/v) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Prior to digestion, the denatured antibody mixture was neutralized with 14 μl of 1.0 m NaOH, followed by adding 26 μl of water and 1.2 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The digestion reaction was carried out by adding 10 μl of 1 μg/μl Lys-C and incubating the mixture at 37 °C overnight, followed by reduction with 30 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. To determine the pH effects on the formation of cysteine racemization, both mAbA and mAbB were diluted 18-fold to ∼3 mg/ml into different buffers to obtain specific pH values. To generate pH 7 and 8, 0.1 m phosphate buffer was used; for pH 9, 50 mm glycine-NaOH buffer was used. The final pH of each sample was measured to be 7.0, 8.0, and 9.1. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C up to 30 days in the dark. The online LC-MS/MS analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1290 HPLC system, coupled with a Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. The Lys-C digest was injected onto a Waters BEH C18 Column (2.1 × 150 mm; pore size, 300 Å; particle size, 1.7 μm) with the column temperature maintained at 50 °C. The mobile phase A contained 0.2% (v/v) TFA and 0.8% (v/v) formic acid in water, and the mobile phase B was prepared in acetonitrile with 0.2% (v/v) TFA and 0.8% formic acid (v/v). A gradient (hold at 0% B for 2 min, 0% to 40% B for 120 min) was used to separate the digested peptides at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The eluted peptides were monitored by both UV (214 and 280 nm wavelengths) and mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer was set up to acquire one high-resolution full scan at 60,000 resolution (at m/z 400), followed by either a data-dependent scan mode or a preselected ion mode. The width for precursor ion isolation was set to 3.0 (m/z) with an activation Q of 0.25 and an activation time of 10 ms. The spray voltage was 3 kV, and the temperature for the heated capillary was 300 °C. The relative racemization level was quantified by calculating the ratio of the peak areas, extracted from the base peak ion chromatogram corresponding to the d-cysteine containing peptide, over the sum of the corresponding peak areas observed for both the d-cysteine and l-cysteine containing peptides. Under high pH conditions, a human IgG1 antibody can form a thioether bond between a cysteine in the heavy chain hinge region (H220, Eu numbering) and a cysteine in the light chain (L214, κ LC, Kabat numbering). The thioether bond formed at this position can be detected as a non-reducible species possessing the combined mass of the LC and HC by reducing capillary electrophoresis or reducing RP-HPLC/MS, or can be detected by peptide mapping (5Tous G.I. Wei Z. Feng J. Bilbulian S. Bowen S. Smith J. Strouse R. McGeehan P. Casas-Finet J. Schenerman M.A. Characterization of a novel modification to monoclonal antibodies: thioether cross-link of heavy and light chains.Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2675-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping under non-reducing conditions has been used to characterize this species as well as quantify the relative levels (10Zhang Q. Schenauer M.R. McCarter J.D. Flynn G.C. IgG1 thioether bond formation in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16371-16382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Digestions of a previously stressed IgG1 antibody containing a κ light chain (IgG1κ) with the protease Lys-C generates a thioether-linked peptide of the sequence (H)SC*DK/(L)SFNRGEC*, where the asterisks represent positions of the modified cystine linkage, also called a lanthionine, and the letters in parentheses represent the antibody polypeptide chains (H for heavy chain, L for light chain). The thioether-linked peptide cannot be cleaved with thiol reducing reagents such as dithiothreitol and has a mass 32 Da less than the parent disulfide-linked version. For IgG1κ, the thioether containing peptides can be resolved into two isobaric peaks by RP-HPLC, consistent with racemization on HC cysteine 220 (10Zhang Q. Schenauer M.R. McCarter J.D. Flynn G.C. IgG1 thioether bond formation in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16371-16382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the high pH incubations were performed in D2O, a mass increase of 1 Da was observed on both peaks. Tandem MS analysis indicated that the mass increase was associated with the HC cysteine on this peptide. These results indicate that dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation occurred on the HC cysteine during the reaction as had been proposed previously. Thioethers also form at the same relative positions in IgG1λ antibodies (peptide (H)SC*DK/(L)TVAPTEC*S) incubated under similar conditions, which, similar to IgG1κ antibodies, resulted in peak splitting on the RP-HPLC peptide map analysis. However, multiple observations suggested that the dehydrogenation step occurred on both the HC and the LC cysteines for IgG1λ antibodies. First, although not completely resolved, further peak splitting of the thioether containing peptides occurred. Second, in high pH studies with D2O, two deuterium atoms could be incorporated per thioether-linked peptide. Third, tandem MS analyses showed that the deuterium was incorporated in both the HC 220 and the LC 214 cysteines. Taken together, the results suggested that dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation also occurred on the LC cysteine, which had not previously been observed. Thus, racemization might be expected to occur on the LC cysteine as well. Peak splitting was also observed on the disulfide-linked parental LC-HC peptides (Fig. 1) involved in the thioether forming reaction. The disulfide-linked peptide SCDK/SFNRGEC obtained from an IgG1κ incubated at high pH, resolved into two major isobaric peaks (Fig. 1a, lower panel) when analyzed by non-reduced peptide mapping. High pH D2O incubations resulted in a 1-Da increase in mass in the peptide (Fig. 1a, lower panel, inset), localized on the HC cysteine (data not shown). Although nearly all of the peptide in the new peak (IIK′) had a 1-Da mass increase (631.75 versus 631.25 m/z, doubly charged) over a peptide from a non-deuterated sample, the peptides at the original position (IK′) contained a mixture of material with a +1 Da mass with material without mass shift. Peptide maps of IgG1λ after high pH treatments produced four peaks for the LC-HC disulfide-linked peptide in the same region (Fig. 1b, lower panel). Both a 1- and 2-Da increase in mass were detected on the IgG1λ HC-LC peptides when the incubations were performed in D2O. The isotopic distribution of the HC-LC peptide in the peak eluting at the position of the unincubated sample (IL′) contained a mixture of the original mass (m/z 628.76) and a +1 Da mass (629.26 m/z, doubly charged). A similar isotopic distribution was seen in peak IIL′. The distribution in peak IIIL′, was similar to peak IIK′ for IgG1κ, with, mainly a +1-Da shift (629.26 m/z) and little of the original mass. Finally, the fourth peak, IVL′ had mainly a mass shift of +2 Da (629.77 m/z), with very little of the +1 Da or original mass material. The combination of peak splitting, MS/MS characterization (data not shown), and the isotopic distribution results, suggested racemization on these LC-HC disulfide-linked peptides. The additional peaks and mass increases observed on the IgG1λ were suspected to due to the racemization on both HC 220 and LC cysteine 214 of these peptides. A +2-Da shift would indicate racemization on both cysteines in the same disulfide-linked peptide. A series of experiments were performed to characterize the chemical changes occurring in the LC-HC linkage region upon high pH incubations. These incubations were also performed under the same conditions but in deuterated water (D2O). Peptides generated by the protease Lys-C were treated with dithiothreitol to reduce disulfide bonds and separated and analyzed by RP-HPLC/MS. Because the denaturation and protease digestion steps were performed in water, only non-exchangeable deuterium remained from those reactions. No quantitative or qualitative differences were observed in the UV chromatograms between the D2O- and the H2O-based reactions. The resultant reduced LC and HC peptides from the HC-LC linkage could be resolved on the same chromatographic run. Prior to incubation, the IgG1κ-reducing peptide map produced a single peak for the peptide SCDK (HK1; Fig. 2a, top panel, at 4.7 min), which is the HC portion of the disulfide-linked peptide SCDK/SFRGEC. Over time at a high pH (shown for 6 days, 56 °C, pH 9.3), IgG1κ generated a second peak at 5.5 min (HK2′, Fig. 2a, second panel from top). MS/MS analysis confirmed that both peaks are of the same sequence (Fig. 2b). Mass shifts in peptide SCDK were observed when the high pH incubations were performed in D2O. The peptide eluting at the position of HK1 (called HK1′ for D2O incubation experiments) showed mainly a +1-Da shift (453.19 m/z, singly charged species) over the unincubated sample. Peak HK2′ showed a similar mass shift. This +1 Da mass was localized to the cysteine by tandem MS performed on the HK1′ and HK2′ peptides (Fig. 2b). To identify the shifted peaks, synthetic peptides were purchased with l-cysteine or d-cysteine in position 220 of the IgG1 HC (sequence S(l-C)DK, called l-H, sequence S(d-C)DK, called d-H), or isoAsp at HC position 221 [S(l-C)isoDK, another known degradant on this peptide). Peptide l-H eluted at 4.7 min, the position of H1 (and H1′), whereas peptide d-H eluted at, 5.5 min the same position as H2 (and H2′). Some low level of l-H appears to exist in the d-H sample as indicated as a small isobaric peak eluting in Fig. 2a (second from bottom panel). The synthetic S(l-C)isoDK peptide eluted at 4.3 min (Fig. 2a, bottom panel). Little of the HC peptide containing isoD was observed in the original sample or in subsequent stressed samples. An isoaspartate containing peptide also would not be expected to result in a mass increase in D2O incubations. This deuterium incorporation approach was used by Amano et al. (8Amano M. Hasegawa J. Kobayashi N. Kishi N. Nakazawa T. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. Specific racemization of heavy-chain cysteine-220 in the hinge region of immunoglobulin γ1 as a possible cause of degradation during storage.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 3857-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to first identify racemization at the H220 position. Very little racemization appeared to occur in the LC 214 cysteine of the IgG1κ when incubated under the high pH conditions described above. Fig. 3 shows analysis performed on the peptide SFNRGEC, the LC portion of the HC-LC disulfide peptide SCDK/SFNRGEC. The elution positions and isotopic distributions are given in Fig. 3. After high pH stress conditions, where significant racemization occurs on the HC 220 cysteine (Fig. 2a, second panel from top), the LC peptide elutes primarily as a single peak at 38.5 min in the chromatogram (Fig. 3, second panel from top). A very small peak, with the same mass as Lκ1, eluted at 39–40 min (called Lκ2′ in D2O incubations, with a 1-Da increase). Synthetic peptides of the sequence SFNRGEC with either l- or d-isomers of cysteine 214 eluted slightly differently from each other in the RP-HPLC chromatogram, with the l-cysteine containing peptide (l-LK) eluting at 38.5 min and the one with the d-cysteine (d-LK) eluting at 39.5 min (Fig. 3, third from top and bottom, respectively). MS/MS spectrum of LK2′ looked similar to the synthetic d-LK peptide, but the quality of the LK2′ spectrum was poor (spectrum not shown). For this reason, it was not possible to unambiguously assign the 1-Da increase in the D2O high pH stressed LK2′ peptide to the terminal cysteine. These results are consistent with those by Amano et al. (8Amano M. Hasegawa J. Kobayashi N. Kishi N. Nakazawa T. Uchiyama S. Fukui K. Specific racemization of heavy-chain cysteine-220 in the hinge region of immunoglobulin γ1 as a possible cause of degradation during storage.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 3857-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) who observed racemization on HC cysteine 220 in an IgG1κ but not on the LC 214 cysteine. Identical high pH incubation experiments were performed on an IgG1λ antibody. Peptides generated by the protease Lys-C were separated by RP-HPLC under disulfide-reducing conditions and analyzed by MS. The HC and LC portions of the disulfide-linked peptide SCDK/TVAPTECS were analyzed as described above for the IgG1κ antibody. Results for the HC portion, SCDK, were similar to those observed for that portion of the IgG1κ HC-LC peptide. In an unstressed IgG1λ sample, the peptide eluted as a single peak at 4.7 min (Hλ1, Fig. 4a, top panel). After the antibody was stressed at high pH, a second peptide with the same mass was observed at position 5.5 min (Hλ2′, Fig. 4a, second panel from the top). High pH incubations in D2O resulted in a 1-Da mass increase (Fig. 4a, second panel from top) on both peaks (Hλ1′ and Hλ2′), which were localized to cysteine 220 (Fig. 4b, second and third panel from top). In contrast to the IgG1κ high pH incubations where only a single peak was observed for the resultant LC peptide from the HC-LC linkage (Lκ1), a second later eluting peak (38.2 min versus 37 min) was observed for the LC peptide TVAPTECS from IgG1λ, which grew in intensity over time (Fig. 5a, second panel from top). When the IgG1λ was incubated in D2O at high pH, a 1-Da increase in mass was observed on both the peak eluting at the original position (Lλ1′) and at the new position (Lλ2′, see Fig. 5a, second panel from top). MS/MS analysis of this peptide (Lλ2′, Fig. 5b, lower panel) was similar to the peptide Lλ1 in the original sample, with deuterium incorporated in the LC cysteine residue. These results suggest that racemization occurred on both the LC and HC cysteines of the disulfide-linked peptide SCDK/TVAPTECS from IgG1λ. To confirm this racemization, synthetic versions the C-terminal lambda LC peptide TVAPTECS were obtained with either d- or l-cysteine at position 214. The peptide with l-cysteine (l-Lλ, Fig. 5a, third panel from top) eluted at the position of the peptide from the untreated sample (Lλ1, Fig. 5a, top panel), whereas the d-cysteine containing peptide (d-Lλ, Fig. 5a, bottom panel) eluted at the same position as Lλ2′ (Fig. 5a, second panel from top). These results confirm that racemization occurs to a similar degree on both the LC cysteine and HC cysteine involved in the HC-LC linkage of an IgG1λ, when the protein is incubated at high pH. Racemization rates were measured in the IgG1κ and IgG1λ antibodies by monitoring the generation of Lys-C peptides containing the d-cysteine by MS relative to the l-cysteine peptide signal. HC cysteine 220 racemization rates increased with increasing pH, for both the IgG1κ and IgG1λ antibodies (Fig. 6). No significant racemization was observed in the IgG1κ LC cysteine 214 over this pH range (7Yan B. Yates Z. Balland A. Kleemann G.R.

However, racemization rates in the IgG1λ LC cysteine were similar to those observed for the HC cysteine, in both magnitude and pH profile. Because racemization has previously only been observed at HC 220 of an IgG1 antibody, it has been proposed that the CDK in the primary sequence possesses unique properties facilitating this reaction (8Amano M. Hasegawa J. Kobayashi N. Kishi N. Nakazawa T. Uchiyama S. Fukui K.

Chem. 2011; 83: 3857-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test whether this specific sequence is required, we probed for racemization in IgG2 antibodies under high pH conditions both with and without D2O. Incubations of a monoclonal IgG2λ at pH 9.3 at 56 °C generated d-cysteine in the LC peptide TVAPTECS (Fig. 7). A 1-Da increase in mass was observed in the peak containing d-cysteine (Lλ2′, Fig. 7a, bottom panel). Even though this peak was very small and is shown 10× the normal scale in the figure for clearer viewing, MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 7b, bottom panel) clearly indicates that deuterium was incorporated in this LC cysteine. The small peak eluting at 36 min (Fig. 7a, bottom panel) was not identified but does not involve cysteine racemization (data not shown). Racemization was also observed on the HC portion of the HC-LC linkage.

As shown in Fig. 8a (second panel from top), a second HC hinge peptide RP-HPLC peak (H2λ2′) forms over time in IgG2λ antibody samples incubated at high pH. When the incubations were performed in D2O, a +1-Da shift was observed for this peak (triply charged state shown). Tandem MS analysis localized the mass shift to the N-terminal three amino acids of the peptide (CCV), but limited fragmentation prevented more specific assignments (Fig. 8b). High pH incubations of a monoclonal IgG2κ antibody yielded identical changes in its HC hinge peptide (data not shown).

Infected animals show signs of pustular lesions on the mouth and muzzle and develop scabs over the lesions. Although the infection is usually cleared within 1–2 months, delayed growth and associated secondary infections could still impact the herds. Orf virus can also infect humans, causing lesions similar to the animals in pathological histology. Prior infection of orf virus apparently offers little protective immunity against future infections. Several gene products of orf virus have been identified as responsible for immunomodulatory functions. In our recent study of orf virus isolates from an area along the Minjiang River in northern Fujian Province, we found a high heterogeneity among isolates from 10 farms within a 120-kilometer distance. Only two isolates from locations within 1 km to each other had same viral genes. There is no correlation between the geographical distance between the corresponding collection sites and the phylogenetic distance in ORFV011 or ORV059 genes for any two isolates. This finding suggests that there are diverse populations of orf virus present in the environment. This may in part contribute to the phenomenon of recurring outbreaks and heighten the need for better surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2126865778,"Elevated serum heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) levels are atheroprotective; however, the role of HSP27 after arterial injury is unknown. Human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were treated with recombinant (r)HSP27 (50 μg/ml) or its inactive C1 terminus, and gene expression was characterized before functional studies were performed in vitro and in vivo. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was markedly up-regulated by rHSP27 (10- and 6-fold increases in mRNA and secretion, respectively). Pretreatment of EPCs with rHSP27 resulted in a 60% reduction in reendothelialization (RE) time in a scratch assay, an effect that was blocked with VEGF-neutralizing antibodies. Mice overexpressing HSP27 demonstrated more robust mobilization of EPCs at the time of arterial injury, as well as a 67% increase in RE and a 45% reduction in neointima (NI) formation at 28 d. Implantation of rHSP27-eluting stents in rabbit carotid arteries resulted in a marked improvement in RE at 7 and 28 d and transient attenuation of NI formation by 42% at 7 d. Hence, extracellular HSP27 up-regulated VEGF and improved EPC migration in vitro. Augmented systemic or local levels of HSP27 markedly improved RE after vascular injury, an effect that is of particular relevance to the safety profile of vascular stents.—Ma, X., Hibbert, B., McNulty, M., Hu, T., Zhao, X., Ramirez, F.

S1A proteases contain a highly conserved disulfide bond (Cys191–Cys220 in chymotrypsin numbering) that links two β-loop structures that define the rim of the active site pocket. Mast cell βII-tryptase is a S1A protease that is associated with pathological inflammation. In this study, we have found that the conserved disulfide bond (Cys220–Cys248 in βII-tryptase) exists in oxidized and reduced states in the enzyme stored and secreted by mast cells. The disulfide bond has a standard redox potential of −301 mV and is stoichiometrically reduced by the inflammatory mediator, thioredoxin, with a rate constant of 350 m−1 s−1. The oxidized and reduced enzymes have different substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of both small and macromolecular substrates.

These observations indicate that βII-tryptase activity is post-translationally regulated by an allosteric disulfide bond. It is likely that other S1A serine proteases are similarly regulated. Over 3% of human genes encode for proteolytic enzymes, and approximately one-quarter of these are serine proteases (1Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. MEROPS. The peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The name stems from the nucleophilic serine in the active site of the enzyme, which attacks the carbonyl moiety of the substrate peptide bond. The serine proteases function in most biological processes, including development, fertilization, immunity, blood coagulation, digestion, and apoptosis. The majority of serine proteases have a trypsin fold, which is defined by a two β-barrel architecture, and trypsin-like substrate specificity, which is a preference for Arg or Lys side chains at the P1 position in the substrate (2Di Cera E. Serine proteases.IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). One class of the trypsin-like serine proteases are the mast cell tryptases. Activated mast cells undergo degranulation, releasing tryptases, proteoglycans, and histamine into the extracellular space, promoting inflammation. Tryptases are one of the most abundant proteins stored in human mast cells (∼90% of the total protein in secretory granules), which contribute to inflammatory processes in an incompletely understood manner (3Fiorucci L. Ascoli F. Mast cell tryptase, a still enigmatic enzyme.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1278-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Among the identified forms of human tryptase, the β form is by far the most abundant in mast cells (3Fiorucci L. Ascoli F. Mast cell tryptase, a still enigmatic enzyme.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1278-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The polymorphic TPSAB1 and TPSAB2 gene loci on chromosome 16p13.3 encode four tryptase isoforms: α and three nearly identical forms of β (βI, βII, and βIII). The α-tryptase isoform is inactive and is genetically absent in many human subjects (4Trivedi N.N. Tamraz B. Chu C. Kwok P.Y. Caughey G.H.

Immunol. 2009; 124: 1099-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the β-tryptases are proteolytically active, with βII predominant in the lung and βI abundant in the skin (5Miller J.S.

U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3811-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Little is known about the βIII form. Because the individual β-tryptase isoforms can be difficult to differentiate in vivo, they are often referred to generically as β-tryptase. β-Tryptase is involved in many acute and chronic inflammatory processes. This includes promotion of tissue remodeling, fibrosis, airway hyperreactivity, and bronchoconstriction (reviewed in Ref. 7Cairns J.A. Inhibitors of mast cell tryptase β as therapeutics for the treatment of asthma and inflammatory disorders.Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 18: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Increased levels of β-tryptase are commonly found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with allergic rhinitis (8Castells M. Schwartz L.B. Tryptase levels in nasal-lavage fluid as an indicator of the immediate allergic response.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1988; 82: 348-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and atopic asthma (9Jarjour N.N. Calhoun W.J. Schwartz L.B. Busse W.W. Elevated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid histamine levels in allergic asthmatics are associated with increased airway obstruction.Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Increased levels of β-tryptase are also found in the joints of patients with inflammatory arthritis (10Buckley M.G. Walters C. Wong W.M. Cawley M.I. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. Walls A.F. Mast cell activation in arthritis. Detection of α- and β-tryptase, histamine and eosinophil cationic protein in synovial fluid.Clin. Sci. 1997; 93: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas tryptase knock-out mice have significantly reduced joint disease during induction of inflammatory arthritis models (11McNeil H.P. Shin K. Campbell I.K. Wicks I.P. Adachi R. Lee D.M. Stevens R.L.

Despite the growing correlation between β-tryptase and inflammatory responses, the actual biological targets of tryptase are relatively unknown. β-Tryptase has been proposed to cleave fibronectin, fibrinogen, protease-activated receptor 2, and kininogen and is also thought to activate matrix metalloproteinase-3 and pro-urokinase by discrete proteolysis (reviewed in Ref. 3Fiorucci L. Ascoli F. Mast cell tryptase, a still enigmatic enzyme.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1278-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Also, no endogenous inhibitors of β-tryptase have been identified as yet. This poses puzzling questions as to how β-tryptase activity is regulated in vivo. We have observed that the βII-tryptase Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond exists in oxidized and reduced states in the enzyme stored and secreted by mast cells. The disulfide bond is reduced by the inflammatory mediator, thioredoxin. Importantly, the oxidized and reduced isoforms have different specificity and catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of both small peptide and macromolecular protein substrates. These observations indicate that βII-tryptase activity is allosterically regulated by a redox active disulfide bond. The disulfide bond is highly conserved in S1A serine proteases, which suggests that other enzymes in this class will be similarly regulated. The human leukemia mast cell line HMC-1 was kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Butterfield (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Cells were thawed from liquid nitrogen and grown in flasks containing Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.01% α-thioglycerol. The cells were split and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml into Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, and no serum. The cells were placed at 37 °C for 24 h before collection of the conditioned medium was collected by centrifugation and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off centrifugal filters. For experiments where media supernatant and cell lysates were collected, α-thioglycerol and FBS were excluded from the media for 24 h prior to harvesting.

HMC-1 conditioned medium, HMC-1 cell lysate, or bone marrow mast cell lysate was incubated with Me2SO or 2 mm PEG-maleimide (TMM(PEG)12; Thermo Scientific) for 1 h. A sample of the reaction was resolved on SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) with MOPS running buffer under nonreducing conditions, protein-transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore), and blotted with anti-mMCP-6 (R&D Systems; AF3736) and rabbit anti-goat peroxidase antibodies (Dako). The blots were visualized using chemiluminescence (NEN, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant βII-tryptase (Promega) was produced in Pichia pastoris cells and purified from the conditioned medium. βII-Tryptase (1 μm) was incubated without or with thioredoxin (0.5-1 μm) and then labeled with PEG-maleimide for 1 h at room temperature. Human thioredoxin-1 was produced as previously described (13Schwertassek U. Balmer Y. Gutscher M. Weingarten L. Preuss M. Engelhard J. Winkler M. Dick T.P.

Just before use, the active site disulfide bond of the oxidoreductase was reduced using tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-agarose (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature before desalting the thioredoxin into buffer using a Zeba spin desalting column (Thermo Scientific). The βII-tryptase was resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with an anti-tryptase antibody (anti-tryptase clone AA1, Dako; or anti-tryptase, clone G3, Millipore) and secondary goat anti-mouse peroxidase antibody. βII-Tryptase (1 μm) was incubated without or with reduced thioredoxin (0.5 μm) for 1 h at 30 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. We employed mass spectrometry with differential cysteine labeling to identify the redox active disulfide bond in the enzyme (15Ganderton T. Wong J.W. Schroeder C. Hogg P.J. Lateral self-association of VWF involves the Cys2431-Cys2453 disulfide/dithiol in the C2 domain.Blood. 2011; 118: 5312-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, any free thiols in the samples were labeled with iodoacetamide before SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen), and bands corresponding to tryptase were excised, destained, dried, and incubated with 100 mm DTT and then washed and incubated with 50 mm methyl methanethiolsulfonate (Sigma-Aldrich). The slices were washed and dried before digestion of proteins with 20 ng/μl of trypsin (Promega) or 12 ng/μl of chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 25 mm NH4CO2 overnight at 25 °C. Peptides were eluted from the slices with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile and separated by liquid chromatography on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Samples (2.5 μl) were concentrated and desalted onto a micro C18 precolumn (500 μm × 2 mm; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) with H2O:CH3CN (98:2, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) at 15 μl/min. After a 4-min wash, the precolumn was switched (Valco 10 port valve; Dionex) into line with a fritless nano column (75 μm × ∼10 cm) containing C18 medium (5 μ, 200 Å Magic; Michrom) manufactured as described (16Gatlin C.L.

Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of H2O:CH3CN (98:2, 0.1% formic acid) to H2O:CH3CN (64:36, 0.1% formic acid) at 250 nl/min over 30 min. High voltage (2000 V) was applied to low volume tee (Upchurch Scientific), and the column tip was positioned ∼0.5 cm from the heated capillary (280 °C) of an Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer. Positive ions were generated by electrospray, and the Orbitrap operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. A survey scan m/z 350–1750 was acquired in the Orbitrap (resolution = 30,000 at m/z 400, with an accumulation target value of 1,000,000 ions) with lockmass enabled. Up to the 10 most abundant ions (>5,000 counts) with charge states of >+2 were sequentially isolated and fragmented within the linear ion trap using collisionally induced dissociation with an activation q of 0.25 and an activation time of 30 ms at a target value of 30,000 ions. The m/z ratios selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 30 s. MS data were searched using Mascot (V2.2; Matrix Science) against the nonredundant database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Search parameters were: precursor tolerance, 6 ppm; and product ion tolerances, ±0.6 Da. Methionine oxidation, Cys-methyldisulfide, and Cys-carboxyamidomethyl were selected as variable modifications with full tryptic and chymotryptic cleavage of up to five missed cleavages. To determine the extent of alkylated cysteine residues in tryptase, the relative ion abundance of peptides containing Cys-carboxyamidomethyl and Cys-methyldisulfide was used. To calculate ion abundance of peptides, extracted ion chromatograms were generated using the XCalibur Qual Browser software (v2.1.0; Thermo Scientific). The area was calculated using the automated peak detection function built into the software. The ratio of carboxyamidomethyl to methyldisulfide (the methyl methanethiolsulfonate adduct) labeling represents the fraction of the cysteine in the population that is in the reduced state. Zymography was performed using gelatin 10% Tris-glycine gels according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Recombinant βII-tryptase (1 μm) was incubated in argon-flushed phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTTox (oxidized DTT or 4,5-dihydroxy-1,2-dithiane; Sigma) and various concentrations of DTTred (reduced DTT; dithiothreitol; Sigma) for 18 h at room temperature to allow equilibrium to be reached. Microcentrifuge tubes were flushed with argon prior to sealing to prevent oxidation during the incubation period. Reactions were quenched with 2 mm 3-(N-maleimido-propionyl) biocytin (MPB; Invitrogen) for 60 min at 22 °C and unreacted MPB quenched with glutathione (4 mm) for 60 min at 22 °C. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE as described above, protein-transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with 1:10,000 dilution of streptavidin-peroxidase to detect the MPB label. Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ version 1.43u software. The fraction of reduced Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond was measured from the intensity of labeling with MPB with reference to labeling of fully reduced disulfide bond. The results were expressed as the ratio of reduced to oxidized protein and fitted to Equation 1, R=A+{(1-A)*([DTTred][DTTox])}Keq+([DTTred][DTTox])(Eq. 1) where R is the fraction of reduced protein at equilibrium, A is the fraction of reduced βII-tryptase in the native recombinant protein, and Keq is the equilibrium constant. The standard redox potential (E0′) of the Cys220–Cys248 bond was calculated using the Nernst equation (Equation 2), E0'=EDTT0'-RT2FlnKeq(Eq. 2) using a value of −307 mV for the redox potential of the DTT disulfide bond (17Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Equilibrium and kinetic constants for the thiol-disulfide interchange reaction between glutathione and dithiothreitol.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7944-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The rate of reduction by thioredoxin and rate of air oxidation of the Cys220–Cys248 disulfide were measured by incubating 1 μm recombinant βII-tryptase and 10 or 1 μm thioredoxin at 37 °C in argon-flushed phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Aliquots were removed at specified time points, and free thiols were immediately labeled with 200 μm MPB for 1 h before quenching unreacted MPB with 400 μm glutathione. For the rate of reduction of the β-tryptase disulfide bond, the data were fit to one-phase exponential association using Prism (GraphPad). For the rate of oxidation of β-tryptase, the data were fit to one-phase exponential decay using Prism (GraphPad). βII-Tryptase was incubated in the presence or absence of 2 μm thioredoxin in one of four different buffer conditions for 1 h at 37 °C: pH 7.4, ionic strength 50 (50 mm HEPES, 30 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml PEG 6000); pH 7.4, ionic strength 150 (50 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml PEG 6000); pH 6.2, ionic strength 50 (50 mm MES, 30 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml PEG 6000); and pH 6.2, ionic strength 150 (50 mm MES, 130 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml PEG 6000). After diluting into corresponding buffer with substrate, the initial rate of hydrolysis of pyro-Glu-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Hyphen Biomed or Sigma-Aldrich) by oxidized or reduced βII-tryptase (10 nm) was measured as a function of peptide substrate concentration (0–2 mm). βII-Tryptase was prepared as described for the chromogenic substrate assay. Any unpaired cysteines in the thioredoxin were alkylated with 25 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h to prevent thioredoxin from reducing disulfide bonds in fibronectin or fibrinogen. Alkylation of reduced βII-tryptase with iodoacetamide had no effect on activity in the chromogenic substrate assay (data not shown). Oxidized or reduced βII-tryptase (20 nm) was incubated with fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich; 10 mg/ml) or fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich; 5 mg/ml) at room temperature for 21 h in either 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 buffer containing 30 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml PEG 6000 or 50 mm MES, pH 6.2 buffer containing 30 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml PEG 6000. Aliquots were removed at various time points, and cleavage of fibronectin was measured by resolving the reactions on SDS-PAGE and staining with silver (Thermo Scientific). βII-Tryptase is not visible in the stained gels because of the low concentration, and thioredoxin (17.2 kDa) runs significantly below the fibronectin (30–50 kDa) and fibrinogen (200–400 kDa) peptides and does not interfere with interpretation of protein cleavage. The human mast cell line, HMC-1, produces, stores, and secretes β-tryptase (18Nilsson G. Blom T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Butterfield J.H. Sundström C. Nilsson K. Hellman L. Phenotypic characterization of the human mast-cell line HMC-1.Scand. J. Immunol. 1994; 39: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We confirmed secretion of the active enzyme by chromogenic substrate assays of conditioned medium from serum-deprived cells (not shown). Conditioned medium and lysate of HMC-1 cells was incubated with a branched polyethylene glycol-maleimide (three 12-PEG units). Maleimides specifically react with thiolates at neutral pH (19Torchinski M. Thiol and Disulfide Groups of Proteins. Consultants Bureau, New York1974Crossref Google Scholar). This alkylator adds a mass of ∼2.5 kDa per labeled thiol, and incorporation is measured by increase in molecular mass by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the protein of interest. Both the secreted (Fig. 1A) and lysate (Fig. 1B) β-tryptase incorporated up to two molecules of PEG-maleimide, indicating the presence of two unpaired cysteine thiols in the enzyme. The crystal structure of βII-tryptase shows that all eight cysteines in each monomer participate in a disulfide bond (20Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Human β-tryptase is a ring-like tetramer with active sites facing a central pore.Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This result indicates that β-tryptase stored and secreted by HMC-1 cells contains a reduced disulfide bond. The majority of the β-tryptase was labeled with PEG-maleimide, indicating that most of the secreted enzyme was in the reduced state. This finding suggested that β-tryptase is post-translationally regulated by a redox active disulfide bond. The murine equivalent of β-tryptase is mMCP-6, which shares 77% sequence identity to human βII-tryptase and has similar substrate specificity (3Fiorucci L. Ascoli F. Mast cell tryptase, a still enigmatic enzyme.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1278-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. Induction of a selective and persistent extravasation of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity by tryptase mouse mast cell protease 6.J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mMCP-6 contains the same conserved disulfide bonds as human βII-tryptase. Bone marrow mast cells were harvested from wild type and mMCP-6 null C57BL/6 mice, and the redox state of mMCP-6 in bone marrow mast cell lysate was measured by labeling with PEG-maleimide. The majority of the mMCP-6 is reduced (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the nature of the enzyme stored and secreted by human mast cells (Fig. 1, A and B). No bands were observed in the mMCP-6 null mice, indicating that the antibody is specific for mMCP-6. The identity of the redox active disulfide bond in βII-tryptase was determined using recombinant enzyme produced in yeast cells and mass spectrometry. Differential cysteine labeling allows identification of the individual cysteines that are unpaired and those that participate in a disulfide bond. The unpaired cysteines were alkylated with iodoacetamide and the disulfide-bonded cysteines with methyl methanethiolsulfonate following reduction with DTT. The ratio of carboxyamidomethyl (the iodoacetamide adduct) to methyldisulfide (the methyl methanethiolsulfonate adduct) labeling represents the fraction of the cysteine in the population that is in the reduced state. We were able to detect seven of the eight cysteines in βII-tryptase and so could measure the redox state of all four disulfide bonds in the enzyme. Recombinant βII-tryptase appears as two bands of ∼34 and 30 kDa on SDS-PAGE because of different glycosylation patterns (3Fiorucci L. Ascoli F. Mast cell tryptase, a still enigmatic enzyme.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1278-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond was reduced in ∼30% of βII-tryptase molecules in the preparation, which increased to ∼80% following incubation of 1 μm enzyme with 0.5 μm thioredoxin (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Thioredoxin is a relevant protein reductant in the cell and in inflammatory environments where β-tryptase is found. Thioredoxin gene expression is up-regulated, and the protein is secreted by immune cells during inflammation, leading to a high local concentration and also elevated blood levels (22Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Thioredoxin and related molecules. From biology to health and disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar).

The ∼50% increase in reduction of the Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond in an incubation of 0.5 mol of thioredoxin/mol of βII-tryptase indicates that the reaction is stoichiometric. Thioredoxin did not influence the redox state of the other three disulfide bonds in βII-tryptase.TABLE 1The Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond in βII-tryptase is reduced in a fraction of the molecules, and the oxidized fraction can be reduced by thioredoxinDigestionβII-Tryptase peptideCysNo thioredoxinWith thioredoxinAbundancePercentage reducedAbundancePercentage reducedIAM adductMMTS adductIAM adductMMTS adductChymotrypsinCGGSLIHPQW5960,999287,06018402,680127,74125TrypsinTAAHCVGPDVK7528,314600,511518,112384,3335TrypsinVPIMENHICDAK1885,788,35023,433,269204,242,67614,492,33023TrypsinIVRDDMLCAGNTR2111,580,2739,798,215141,067,6045,531,00216TrypsinDSCQGDSGGPL220146,813474,10824176,25443,48980TrypsinDSCQGDSGGPLVCK230775,24711,931,3926433,2166,693,4786ChymotrypsinGEGCAQPNRPGIY248643,4601,302,075331,885,816354,13784 Open table in a new tab To test the veracity of the mass spectrometry analysis, the reduced βII-tryptase was labeled with PEG-maleimide. A fraction of the βII-tryptase incorporated two molecules of PEG-maleimide, in accordance with partial reduction of the Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond, and incubation with a molar equivalent of thioredoxin fully reduced the enzyme, which is consistent with the mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 2C). The redox potential and rate of reduction of the βII-tryptase Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond by thioredoxin were measured. The standard redox potential of the Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond was determined using oxidized and reduced DTT. The MPB labeling of fully reduced βII-tryptase was used to calculate the ratio of reduced to oxidized βII-tryptase as a function of the ratio of reduced to oxidized DTT (Fig. 3A). A standard redox potential of −301 mV was calculated (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the DTT titration results indicated that 24% of the βII-tryptase molecules were already reduced (variable A in Equation 1; Fig. 3B). This result is consistent with the fraction of reduced βII-tryptase molecules in the preparation measured by mass spectrometry (Table 1) and PEG-maleimide labeling (Fig. 2C). The rate of reduction of the βII-tryptase Cys220–Cys248 disulfide bond by thioredoxin was measured under pseudo-first order conditions (Fig. 3C). A kobs of 0.21 ± 0.05 min−1 was calculated, which equates to a second order rate constant of 350 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 3D). The rate of oxidation of the Cys220 and Cys248 dithiol was calculated from reactions of equimolar βII-tryptase and thioredoxin (Fig. 3E).

FA and entropy values were measured in white matter bundles, white matter fiber crossing areas, different gray matter (GM) regions and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Axonal densities' from the same regions of interest (ROIs) were evaluated in Bielschowsky and Luxol fast blue stained autopsy (n = 30) brain sections by light microscopy. As a case demonstration, a Wistar rat subjected to TBI and treated with bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) 1 week after TBI was employed to illustrate the superior ability of entropy over FA in detecting reorganized crossing axonal bundles as confirmed by histological analysis with Bielschowsky and Luxol fast blue staining.Unlike FA, entropy was less affected by axonal orientation and more affected by axonal density. A significant agreement (r = 0.91) was detected between entropy values from in vivo human brain and histologically measured axonal density from post mortum from the same brain structures. The MSC treated TBI rat demonstrated that the entropy approach is superior to FA in detecting axonal remodeling after injury. Compared with FA, entropy detected new axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed with immunohistological staining.Entropy measurement is more effective in distinguishing axonal remodeling after injury, when compared with FA. Entropy is also more sensitive to axonal density than axonal orientation, and thus may provide a more accurate reflection of axonal changes that occur in neurological injury and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991725185,"Prioritizing efforts for conserving rare and threatened species with limited past data and lacking population estimates is predicated on robust assessments of their occupancy rates. This is particularly challenging for elusive, long-lived and wide-ranging marine mammals. In this paper we estimate trends in long-term (over 50years) occupancy, persistence and extinction of a vulnerable and data-poor dugong (Dugong dugon) population across multiple seagrass meadows in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago (India). For this we use hierarchical Bayesian dynamic occupancy models accounting for false negatives (detection probability<1), persistence and extinction, to two datasets: a) fragmentary long-term occurrence records from multiple sources (1959–2004, n = 40 locations), and b) systematic detection/non-detection data from current surveys (2010–2012, n = 57). Dugong occupancy across the archipelago declined by 60% (from 0.45 to 0.18) over the last 20 years and present distribution was largely restricted to sheltered bays and channels with seagrass meadows dominated by Halophila and Halodule sp. Dugongs were not found in patchy meadows with low seagrass cover. In general, seagrass habitat availability was not limiting for dugong occupancy, suggesting that anthropogenic factors such as entanglement in gillnets and direct hunting may have led to local extinction of dugongs from locations where extensive seagrass meadows still thrive. Effective management of these remnant dugong populations will require a multi-pronged approach, involving 1) protection of areas where dugongs still persist, 2) monitoring of seagrass habitats that dugongs could recolonize, 3) reducing gillnet use in areas used by dugongs, and 4) engaging with indigenous/settler communities to reduce impacts of hunting."
https://openalex.org/W1990638412,"Signal peptide cleavage and N-glycosylation of proteins are co-translational processes, but little is known about their interplay if they compete for adjacent sites. Here we report two unique findings for processing of glycoprotein 3 of equine arteritis virus. Glycoprotein 3 (Gp3) contains an N-terminal signal peptide, which is not removed, although bioinformatics predicts cleavage with high probability. There is an overlapping sequon, NNTT, adjacent to the signal peptide that we show to be glycosylated at both asparagines. Exchanging the overlapping sequon and blocking glycosylation allows signal peptide cleavage, indicating that carbohydrate attachment inhibits processing of a potentially cleavable signal peptide. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that a similar processing scheme may exist for some cellular proteins. Membrane fractionation and secretion experiments revealed that the signal peptide of Gp3 does not act as a membrane anchor, indicating that it is completely translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane attachment is caused by the hydrophobic C terminus of Gp3, which, however, does not span the membrane but rather attaches the protein peripherally to endoplasmic reticulum membranes."

Proliferation was assessed by KI67 (immunohistochemistry) and genomic grade index (transcriptomic analysis). IHC3 (IHC4 score for HER2 negative tumors) was also determined.In the training set (109 cases), the optimal cut-off was 34 breakpoints with a specificity of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 0.57 (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.81[0.71; 0.91]).

https://openalex.org/W2123641196,"The activation of a high affinity Ca(2+) influx system (HACS) in the plasma membrane is required for survival of yeast cells exposed to natural or synthetic inhibitors of essential processes (secretory protein folding or sterol biosynthesis) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mechanisms linking ER stress to HACS activation are not known. Here we show that Kch1, a recently identified low affinity K(+) transporter in the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is up-regulated in response to several ER stressors and necessary for HACS activation. The activation of HACS required extracellular K(+) and was also dependent on the high affinity K(+) transporters Trk1 and Trk2. However, a paralog of Kch1 termed Kch2 was not expressed and not necessary for HACS activation in these conditions. The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans carries only one homolog of Kch1/Kch2, and homozygous knock-out mutants were similarly deficient in the activation of HACS during the responses to tunicamycin. However, the Kch1 homolog was not necessary for HACS activation or cell survival in response to several clinical antifungals (azoles, allylamines, echinocandins) that target the ER or cell wall. Thus, Kch1 family proteins represent a conserved linkage between HACS and only certain classes of ER stress in these yeasts."
https://openalex.org/W2021359978,"Temperature variation is an important factor determining the outcomes of interspecific interactions, including those involving hosts and parasites. This can apply to variation in average temperature or to relatively short but intense bouts of extreme temperature. We investigated the effect of heat shock on the ability of aphids (Aphis fabae) harbouring protective facultative endosymbionts (Hamiltonella defensa) to resist parasitism by Hymenopteran parasitoids (Lysiphlebus fabarum). Furthermore, we investigated whether heat shocks can modify previously observed genotype-by-genotype (G x G) interactions between different endosymbiont isolates and parasitoid genotypes. Lines of genetically identical aphids possessing different isolates of H. defensa were exposed to one of two heat shock regimes (35°C and 39°C) or to a control temperature (20°C) before exposure to three different asexual lines of the parasitoids. We observed strong G x G interactions on parasitism rates, reflecting the known genetic specificity of symbiont-conferred resistance, and we observed a significant G x G x E interaction induced by heat shocks. However, this three-way interaction was mainly driven by the more extreme heat shock (39°C), which had devastating effects on aphid lifespan and reproduction. Restricting the analysis to the more realistic heat shock of 35°C, the G x G x E interaction was weaker (albeit still significant), and it did not lead to any reversals of the aphid lines' susceptibility rankings to different parasitoids. Thus, under conditions feasibly encountered in the field, the relative fitness of different parasitoid genotypes on hosts protected by particular symbiont strains remains mostly uncomplicated by heat stress, which should simplify biological control programs dealing with this system."
https://openalex.org/W2047201781,"NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) is a flavoprotein that protects cells against radiation and chemical-induced oxidative stress. Disruption of the NQO2 gene in mice leads to γ radiation-induced myeloproliferative diseases. In this report, we showed that the 20 S proteasome and NQO2 both interact with myeloid differentiation factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). The interaction of the 20 S proteasome with C/EBPα led to the degradation of C/EBPα. NQO2, in the presence of its cofactor NRH, protected C/EBPα against 20 S degradation. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that NQO2 and 20 S competed for the same binding region of S(268)GAGAGKAKKSV(279) in C/EBPα. Exposure of mice and HL-60 cells to γ radiation enhanced the levels of NQO2, which led to an increased NQO2 interaction with C/EBPα and decreased 20 S interaction with C/EBPα. NQO2 stabilization of C/EBPα was independent of NQO1, even though both interacted with the same C/EBPα domain. NQO2(-/-) mice, deficient in NQO2, failed to stabilize C/EBPα. This contributed to the development of γ radiation-induced myeloproliferative disease in NQO2(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W1974490447,"Size variance among similarly aged individuals within populations is a pattern common to many organisms that is a result of interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic traits of individuals. While genetic and maternal effects, as well as physiological and behavioral traits have been shown to contribute to size variation in animal populations, teasing apart the influence of such factors on individual growth rates remain a challenge. Furthermore, tracing the effects of these interactions across life stages and in shaping adult phenotypes also requires further exploration. In this study we investigated the relationship between genetics, hatching patterns, behaviors, neuroendocrine stress axis activity and variance in growth and metamorphosis among same-aged larval amphibians. Through parallel experiments we found that in the absence of conspecific interactions, hatch time and to a lesser extent egg clutch identity (i.e. genetics and maternal effects) influenced the propensity for growth and development in individual tadpoles and determined metamorphic traits. Within experimental groups we found that variance in growth rates was associated with size-dependent foraging behaviors and responses to food restriction. We also found an inverse relationship between glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and body mass and developmental stage among group-reared tadpoles, which suggests that GC expression plays a role in regulating differing within-population growth trajectories in response to density-dependent conditions. Taken together these findings suggest that factors that influence hatching conditions can have long-term effects on growth and development. These results also raise compelling questions regarding the extent to which maternal and genetic factors influence physiological and behavioral profiles in amphibians."

The optimum pre-treatment, extraction time, sediment to solution ratio and sodium hydroxide-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH-EDTA) extractant solution composition were determined. The total P and Po recovery rates were higher from freeze- and air-dried samples than from fresh samples. An extraction time of 16 h was adequate for extracting Po, and a shorter or longer extraction time led to lower recoveries of total P and Po, or led to the degradation of Po. An ideal P recovery rate and good-quality NMR spectra were obtained at a sediment:solution ratio of 1∶10, showing that this ratio is ideal for extracting Po. An extractant solution of 0.25 M NaOH and 50 mM EDTA was found to be more appropriate than either NaOH on its own, or a more concentrated NaOH-EDTA mixture for 31P-NMR analysis, as this combination minimized interference from paramagnetic ions and was appropriate for the detected range of Po concentrations. The most appropriate preparation method for Po analysis, therefore, was to extract the freeze-dried and ground sediment sample with a 0.25 M NaOH and 50 mM EDTA solution at a sediment:solution ratio of 1∶10, for 16 h, by shaking. As lyophilization of the NaOH-EDTA extracts proved to be an optimal pre-concentration method for Po analysis in the river sediment, the extract was lyophilized as soon as possible, and analyzed by 31P-NMR."

In non-human primate models replicating adenovirus (Ad)-HIV/SIV recombinant vaccine vectors have been shown to stimulate potent immune responses culminating in protection against challenge exposures. Nonetheless, an increase in the transgene carrying capacity of these Ad vectors, currently limited to approximately 3000 base pairs, would greatly enhance their utility. Using a replicating, E3-deleted Ad type 5 host range mutant (Ad5 hr) encoding full-length single-chain HIVBaLgp120 linked to the D1 and D2 domains of rhesus macaque CD4 (rhFLSC) we systematically deleted the genes encoding early region 4 open reading frame 1 (E4orf1) through E4orf4. All the Ad-rhFLSC vectors produced similar levels of viral progeny. Cell cycle analysis of infected human and monkey cells revealed no differences in virus-host interaction. The parental and E4-deleted viruses expressed comparable levels of the transgene with kinetics similar to Ad late proteins. Similar levels of cellular immune responses and transgene-specific antibodies were elicited in vaccinated mice. However, differences in recognition of Ad proteins and induced antibody subtypes were observed, suggesting that the E4 gene products might modulate antibody responses by as yet unknown mechanisms. In short, we have improved the transgene carrying capacity by one thousand base pairs while preserving the replicability, levels of transgene expression, and immunogenicity critical to these vaccine vectors. This additional space allows for flexibility in vaccine design that could not be obtained with the current vector and as such should facilitate the goal of improving vaccine efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effects of these E4 deletions on transgene expression and immunogenicity in a replicating Ad vector."

In this study, we examined the impacts of understory litter on the decomposition and nutrient release of tree litter both in a pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) and a poplar (Populus × xiaozhuanica) plantation in Northeast China. Leaf litter of tree species, and senesced aboveground materials from two dominant understory species, Artemisia scoparia and Setaria viridis in the pine stand and Elymus villifer and A. sieversiana in the poplar stand, were collected. Mass loss and N and P fluxes of single-species litter and three-species mixtures in each of the two forests were quantified. Data from single-species litterbags were used to generate predicted mass loss and N and P fluxes for the mixed-species litterbags. In the mixture from the pine stand, the observed mass loss and N release did not differ from the predicted value, whereas the observed P release was greater than the predicted value. However, the presence of understory litter decelerated the mass loss and did not affect N and P releases from the pine litter. In the poplar stand, litter mixture presented a positive non-additive effect on litter mass loss and P release, but an addition effect on N release. The presence of understory species accelerated only N release of poplar litter. Moreover, the responses of mass loss and N and P releases of understory litter in the mixtures varied with species in both pine and poplar plantations. Our results suggest that the effects of understory species on tree litter decomposition vary with tree species, and also highlight the importance of understory species in litter decomposition and nutrient cycles in forest ecosystems."

The muraymycin gene cluster (mur) was recently cloned, and bioinformatic analysis of mur34 revealed its encoding product exhibits high homology to a large family of proteins, including KanI and RacI in individual biosynthetic pathway of kanamycin and ribostamycin. However, the precise role of these proteins remains unknown.Here we report the identification of Mur34 as the novel negative regulator involved in muraymycin biosynthesis. Independent disruption of mur34 on chromosome and cosmid directly resulted in significant improvement of muraymycin production by at least 10 folds, thereof confirming the negative function of Mur34 during muraymycin biosynthesis and realizing the engineered production of muraymycin in heterologous host. Gene expression analysis indicated that the transcription level of the mur genes in mur34 mutant (DM-5) was dramatically enhanced by ca. 30 folds. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that Mur34 specifically bound to the promoter region of mur33. Further experiments showed that a 28-bp region downstream of the transcription start point (TSP) was protected by His6Mur34, and the -10 region is essential for the activity of mur33 promoter.Mur34 plays an unambiguously negative role in muraymycin biosynthesis via binding to the upstream of mur33.

From an RNase perspective, little is known about the RNA or miRNA species it targets for degradation or whose expression it regulates; except for c-myc and miR-221. To further elucidate the functional implications of hPNPaseold-35 in cellular physiology, we knocked-down and overexpressed hPNPaseold-35 in human melanoma cells and performed gene expression analyses to identify differentially expressed transcripts. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that knockdown of hPNPaseold-35 resulted in significant gene expression changes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and cholesterol biosynthesis; whereas overexpression of hPNPaseold-35 caused global changes in cell-cycle related functions. Additionally, comparative gene expression analyses between our hPNPaseold-35 knockdown and overexpression datasets allowed us to identify 77 potential “direct” and 61 potential “indirect” targets of hPNPaseold-35 which formed correlated networks enriched for cell-cycle and wound healing functional association, respectively. These results provide a comprehensive database of genes responsive to hPNPaseold-35 expression levels; along with the identification new potential candidate genes offering fresh insight into cellular pathways regulated by PNPT1 and which may be used in the future for possible therapeutic intervention in mitochondrial- or inflammation-associated disease phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2011027901,"Deregulation of ErbB receptor-tyrosine kinases is a hallmark of many human cancers. Conserved in the ErbB family is a cluster of basic amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region. We found that charge-silencing mutagenesis within this juxtamembrane region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in the generation of a mutant receptor (EGFR Mut R1-6) that spontaneously transforms NIH 3T3 cells in a ligand-independent manner. A similar mutant with one additional basic residue, EGFR Mut R1-5, fails to exhibit ligand-independent transformation. The capacity of EGFR Mut R1-6 to mediate this transformation is maintained when this mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum via a single point mutation, L393H, which we describe. We show that EGFR Mut R1-6 with or without L393H exhibits enhanced basal tyrosine phosphorylation when ectopically expressed, and the ligand-independent transforming activity of EGFR Mut R1-6 is sensitive to inhibition of EGFR kinase activity and is particularly dependent on PI3K and mTOR activity. Similar to EGFR Mut R1-6/L393H in NIH 3T3 cells, EGFR variant type III, a highly oncogenic mutant form of EGFR linked to human brain cancers, confers transforming activity while it is wholly endoplasmic reticulum-retained in U87 cells. Our findings highlight the importance of the polybasic juxtamembrane sequence in regulating the oncogenic potential of EGFR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2016177687,"A constant influx of new data poses a challenge in keeping the annotation in biological databases current. Most biological databases contain significant quantities of textual annotation, which often contains the richest source of knowledge. Many databases reuse existing knowledge; during the curation process annotations are often propagated between entries. However, this is often not made explicit. Therefore, it can be hard, potentially impossible, for a reader to identify where an annotation originated from. Within this work we attempt to identify annotation provenance and track its subsequent propagation. Specifically, we exploit annotation reuse within the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), at the level of individual sentences. We describe a visualisation approach for the provenance and propagation of sentences in UniProtKB which enables a large-scale statistical analysis. Initially levels of sentence reuse within UniProtKB were analysed, showing that reuse is heavily prevalent, which enables the tracking of provenance and propagation. By analysing sentences throughout UniProtKB, a number of interesting propagation patterns were identified, covering over sentences. Over sentences remain in the database after they have been removed from the entries where they originally occurred. Analysing a subset of these sentences suggest that approximately are erroneous, whilst appear to be inconsistent. These results suggest that being able to visualise sentence propagation and provenance can aid in the determination of the accuracy and quality of textual annotation.

https://openalex.org/W2040631915,"Overexpression of the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase and the mitochondrial inner membrane protein UCP2 occurs frequently in aggressive cancers with dysfunctional mitochondria. Overexpressed ERBB2 signals constitutively and elevated UCP2 can uncouple mitochondria and alleviate oxidative stress. However, the physiological contributions of UCP2 and ERBB2 at the low expression levels that are typical of most tissues, as well as the path to oncogenic deregulation, are poorly understood. We now show that ERBB2 directly controls UCP2 levels, both at low physiological levels and oncogenic overexpression. At low levels of receptor and UCP2, ligand stimulation creates a distinct temporal response pattern driven by the opposing forces of translational suppression of the exceptionally short lived UCP2 protein and a time delayed transcriptional up-regulation. The latter becomes dominant through constitutive signaling by overexpressed ERBB2, resulting in high levels of UCP2 that contribute mitochondrial uncoupling. By contrast, ligand stimulation of non-overexpressed ERBB2 transiently removes UCP2 and paradoxically reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and OXPHOS on a signaling time scale. However, neither the transporter activity nor down-regulation of already low UCP2 levels drive this reduction in mitochondrial activity. Instead, UCP2 is required to establish mitochondria that are capable of responding to ligand. UCP2 knockdown impairs proliferation at high glucose but its absence specifically impairs ligand-induced growth when glucose levels fluctuate. These findings demonstrate the ability of growth factor signaling to control oxidative phosphorylation on a signaling time scale and point toward a non-transporter role for low levels of UCP2 in establishing dynamic response capability."
https://openalex.org/W2027510567,"Post-transcriptional regulation of stem cell differentiation is far from being completely understood. Changes in protein levels are not fully correlated with corresponding changes in mRNAs; the observed differences might be partially explained by post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms, such as alternative polyadenylation. This would involve changes in protein binding, transcript usage, miRNAs and other non-coding RNAs. In the present work we analyzed the distribution of alternative transcripts during adipogenic differentiation and the potential role of miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation. Our in silico analysis suggests a modest, consistent, bias in 3′UTR lengths during differentiation enabling a fine-tuned transcript regulation via small non-coding RNAs. Including these effects in the analyses partially accounts for the observed discrepancies in relative abundance of protein and mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2061638960,"Fras1 is an extracellular matrix associated protein with essential roles in adhesion of epithelia and mesenchyme during early embryonic development. The adhesive function of Fras1 is achieved through interaction with a group of related proteins, Frem 1-3, and a cytoplasmic adaptor protein Grip1. Mutation of each of these proteins results in characteristic epithelial blistering and have therefore become known as ""blebs"" proteins. Human Fraser syndrome presents with a similar phenotype and the blebs mice have been instrumental in identification of the genetic basis of Fraser syndrome. We have identified a new ENU-induced blebs allele resulting from a novel missense mutation in Fras1. The resulting mouse strain, blood filled blisters (bfb), presents with a classic blebs phenotype but does not exhibit embryonic lethality typical of other blebs mutants and in addition, we report novel palate and sternal defects. Analysis of the bfb phenotype confirms the presence of epithelial-mesenchymal adhesion defects but also supports the emerging role of blebs proteins in regulating signalling during organogenesis. The bfb strain provides new opportunities to investigate the role of Fras1 in development."
https://openalex.org/W2063758872,"We compute the singular value decomposition of the radial distribution function g(r) for hard sphere, and square well solutions. We find that g(r) decomposes into a small set of basis vectors allowing for an extremely accurate representation at all interpolated densities and potential strengths. In addition, we find that the coefficient vectors describing the magnitude of each basis vector are well described by a low-order polynomial. We provide a program to calculate g(r) in this compact representation for the investigated parameter range."
