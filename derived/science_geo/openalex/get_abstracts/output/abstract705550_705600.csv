https://openalex.org/W4310937706,"Precision medicine aims to treat an individual based on their clinical characteristics. A differential drug response, critical to using these features for therapy selection, has never been examined directly in type 2 diabetes. In this study, we tested two hypotheses: (1) individuals with body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, compared to BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2, have greater glucose lowering with thiazolidinediones than with DPP4 inhibitors, and (2) individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2, compared to eGFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m2, have greater glucose lowering with DPP4 inhibitors than with SGLT2 inhibitors. The primary endpoint for both hypotheses was the achieved HbA1c difference between strata for the two drugs. In total, 525 people with type 2 diabetes participated in this UK-based randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover trial of 16 weeks of treatment with each of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, canagliflozin 100 mg once daily and pioglitazone 30 mg once daily added to metformin alone or metformin plus sulfonylurea. Overall, the achieved HbA1c was similar for the three drugs: pioglitazone 59.6 mmol/mol, sitagliptin 60.0 mmol/mol and canagliflozin 60.6 mmol/mol (P = 0.2). Participants with BMI > 30 kg/m2, compared to BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2, had a 2.88 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98, 4.79) lower HbA1c on pioglitazone than on sitagliptin (n = 356, P = 0.003). Participants with eGFR 60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2, compared to eGFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m2, had a 2.90 mmol/mol (95% CI: 1.19, 4.61) lower HbA1c on sitagliptin than on canagliflozin (n = 342, P = 0.001). There were 2,201 adverse events reported, and 447/525 (85%) randomized participants experienced an adverse event on at least one of the study drugs. In this precision medicine trial in type 2 diabetes, our findings support the use of simple, routinely available clinical measures to identify the drug class most likely to deliver the greatest glycemic reduction for a given patient.

https://openalex.org/W4311583297,"Clinical neuroimaging data availability has grown substantially in the last decade, providing the potential for studying heterogeneity in clinical cohorts on a previously unprecedented scale. Normative modeling is an emerging statistical tool for dissecting heterogeneity in complex brain disorders. However, its application remains technically challenging due to medical data privacy issues and difficulties in dealing with nuisance variation, such as the variability in the image acquisition process. Here, we approach the problem of estimating a reference normative model across a massive population using a massive multi-center neuroimaging dataset. To this end, we introduce a federated probabilistic framework using hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) to complete the life-cycle of normative modeling. The proposed model provides the possibilities to learn, update, and adapt the model parameters on decentralized neuroimaging data. Our experimental results confirm the superiority of HBR in deriving more accurate normative ranges on large multi-site neuroimaging datasets compared to the current standard methods. In addition, our approach provides the possibility to recalibrate and reuse the learned model on local datasets and even on datasets with very small sample sizes. The proposed method will facilitate applications of normative modeling as a medical tool for screening the biological deviations in individuals affected by complex illnesses such as mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4310947362,"Patient preference is very important for medication selection in chronic medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes, where there are many different drugs available. Patient preference balances potential efficacy with potential side effects. As both aspects of drug response can vary markedly between individuals, this decision could be informed by the patient personally experiencing the alternative medications, as occurs in a crossover trial. In the TriMaster (NCT02653209, ISRCTN12039221), randomized double-blind, three-way crossover trial patients received three different second- or third-line once-daily type 2 diabetes glucose-lowering drugs (pioglitazone 30 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and canagliflozin 100 mg). As part of a prespecified secondary endpoint, we examined patients’ drug preference after they had tried all three drugs. In total, 448 participants were treated with all three drugs which overall showed similar glycemic control (HbA1c on pioglitazone 59.5 sitagliptin 59.9, canagliflozin 60.5 mmol mol−1, P = 0.19). In total, 115 patients (25%) preferred pioglitazone, 158 patients (35%) sitagliptin and 175 patients (38%) canagliflozin. The drug preferred by individual patients was associated with a lower HbA1c (mean: 4.6; 95% CI: 3.9, 5.3) mmol mol−1 lower versus nonpreferred) and fewer side effects (mean: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.64) fewer side effects versus nonpreferred). Allocating therapy based on the individually preferred drugs, rather than allocating all patients the overall most preferred drug (canagliflozin), would result in more patients achieving the lowest HbA1c for them (70% versus 30%) and the fewest side effects (67% versus 50%). When precision approaches do not predict a clear optimal therapy for an individual, allowing patients to try potential suitable medications before they choose long-term therapy could be a practical alternative to optimizing treatment for type 2 diabetes. A prespecified secondary endpoint from the TriMaster study demonstrates that after trying three different classes of diabetes medications most patients preferentially selected the drug that was associated with the best glycemic control on an individual level."
https://openalex.org/W4311580556,"Background Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a low-cost and easy-to-implement method to measure vital signs, including heart rate (HR) and pulse rate variability (PRV) which widely used as a substitute of heart rate variability (HRV). The method is used in various wearable devices. For example, Samsung smartwatches are PPG-based open-source wristbands used in remote well-being monitoring and fitness applications. However, PPG is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. A validation study is required to investigate the accuracy of PPG-based wearable devices in free-living conditions. Objective We evaluate the accuracy of PPG signals—collected by the Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch in free-living conditions—in terms of HR and time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters against a medical-grade chest electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor. Methods We conducted 24-hours monitoring using a Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch and a Shimmer3 ECG device. The monitoring included 28 participants (14 male and 14 female), where they engaged in their daily routines. We evaluated HR and HRV parameters during the sleep and awake time. The parameters extracted from the smartwatch were compared against the ECG reference. For the comparison, we employed the Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman plot, and linear regression methods. Results We found a significantly high positive correlation between the smartwatch’s and Shimmer ECG’s HR, time-domain HRV, LF, and HF and a significant moderate positive correlation between the smartwatch’s and shimmer ECG’s LF/HF during sleep time. The mean biases of HR, time-domain HRV, and LF/HF were low, while the biases of LF and HF were moderate during sleep. The regression analysis showed low error variances of HR, AVNN, and pNN50, moderate error variances of SDNN, RMSSD, LF, and HF, and high error variances of LF/HF during sleep. During the awake time, there was a significantly high positive correlation of AVNN and a moderate positive correlation of HR, while the other parameters indicated significantly low positive correlations. RMSSD and SDNN showed low mean biases, and the other parameters had moderate mean biases. In addition, AVNN had moderate error variance while the other parameters indicated high error variances. Conclusion The Samsung smartwatch provides acceptable HR, time-domain HRV, LF, and HF parameters during sleep time. In contrast, during the awake time, AVNN and HR show satisfactory accuracy, and the other HRV parameters have high errors."
https://openalex.org/W4311587111,"Vocalizations in animals, particularly birds, are critically important behaviors that influence their reproductive fitness. While recordings of bioacoustic data have been captured and stored in collections for decades, the automated extraction of data from these recordings has only recently been facilitated by artificial intelligence methods. These have yet to be evaluated with respect to accuracy of different automation strategies and features. Here, we use a recently published machine learning framework to extract syllables from ten bird species ranging in their phylogenetic relatedness from 1 to 85 million years, to compare how phylogenetic relatedness influences accuracy. We also evaluate the utility of applying trained models to novel species. Our results indicate that model performance is best on conspecifics, with accuracy progressively decreasing as phylogenetic distance increases between taxa. However, we also find that the application of models trained on multiple distantly related species can improve the overall accuracy to levels near that of training and analyzing a model on the same species. When planning big-data bioacoustics studies, care must be taken in sample design to maximize sample size and minimize human labor without sacrificing accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4311572975,"Rising ocean temperature is a major driver of kelp forest decline worldwide and one that threatens to intensify over the coming decades. What is not particularly well understood are the mechanisms that drive loss and how they operate at differing life stages. This study aimed to establish an understanding of the effects of increasing temperature on the early developmental stages of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera . Sporulation was carried out across 10 temperature treatments from 9.5 to 26.2°C ± 0.2°C at approximately 2°C intervals. Spores were then incubated at these temperatures under a 20.3±1.7 μmol photons m -2 s -1 , 16L:8D photoperiod for 5 days. Results indicate that spore release was positively correlated with increasing temperature, whereas an inverse trend was observed between temperature and the growth of germ-tube. The thermal threshold for spore and germling development was determined to be between 21.7°C and 23.8°C. Spore settlement was the most drastically effected developmental phase by increasing temperature. This study highlights the vulnerability of early life stages of M . pyrifera development to rising ocean temperature and has implications for modelling future distribution of this valuable ecosystem engineer in a changing ocean."
https://openalex.org/W4311587804,"Healthcare has been one of the most affected sectors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The utilization of related services for non-COVID-19 diseases fell dramatically following the point at which the virus broke out; however, little is known about whether this observed decline in healthcare use was due to voluntary behaviors or enforced measures. This paper quantifies the spontaneous change in healthcare utilization during the pandemic. We utilize a county-by-week-level dataset from Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) record, covering the entire Taiwanese population, and a difference-in-differences design. Our results indicate that even if there were no human mobility restrictions or supply-side constraints, people voluntarily reduced their demand for healthcare, due to fears of contagion, or COVID-related precautionary behaviors. We find that the number of outpatient visits (inpatient admissions) decreased by 19% (10%) during the pandemic period (February to May 2020). Furthermore, the demand response of healthcare for Influenza-like illness (ILI) was much greater and more persistent than for non-ILI, thereby suggesting that the substantial decline in accessing healthcare was induced by positive public health externality of prevention measures for COVID-19. Finally, we find that the demand for healthcare services did not get back to the pre-pandemic baseline, even when there were no local coronavirus cases for 253 consecutive days (mid-April to December 2020) in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W4311575099,"This study investigates the association between objective and subjective indicators of economic uncertainty, generated by the COVID-19 health and economic crisis, and young Italians' fertility plans during the 2020. We use unique repeated cross-sectional data, collected at different time points during the pandemic (March and October/November 2020) together with pre-COVID data (2016). The data offer a standard fertility intention question pre- and during-COVID, and also a direct question on whether pre-COVID fertility plans have been confirmed, postponed or abandoned. In March 2020, individuals with more vulnerable occupations show a lower probability of intending to have a(nother) child in the short-term and a higher probability of abandoning their pre-COVID fertility plan; in October 2020 changes in fertility plans do not vary by employment condition. Instead, both in March and October, those who suffered from a negative income shock and those with negative expectations on their future income and occupation are more likely to abandon their pre-pandemic fertility plan compared to their better off counterparts. Overall, economic uncertainty seems to have similarly affected men and women's fertility intentions. Our findings point to the fact that the unequal economic consequences of the pandemic also produced and will produce heterogeneous effects on fertility intentions."
https://openalex.org/W4311575804,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS COV-2) known as COVID-19 since its outbreak in 2019, more than 375 and 5.6 million were infected and dead, respectively. Its influence in all disciplines stimulated different industries to work day to night relentlessly to develop safe and effective vaccines to reduce the catastrophic effect of the disease. With the increasing number of people globally who have been vaccinated, the reports on possible adverse events have grown and gained great public attention. This study aims to determine post-COVID-19 vaccination adverse effects and associated factors among vaccinated Health care providers in the Oromia region, Ethiopia in 2021.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 912 health care workers working in government hospitals in the central Oromia region from November 20 to December 15/2021. Respondents absent from work due to different reasons were excluded during the interview. The outcome variable was COVID-19 side effects (response as Yes/No). A descriptive analysis displayed findings in the form of the frequencies and percentages, and logistic regression was employed to see the association of different variables with side effects experienced.Overall, 92.1% of the participants experienced side effects either in 1st or 2nd doses of post-COVID-19 vaccination; 84.0% and (71.5%) of participants experienced at least one side effect in the 1st and 2nd dose of the vaccines, respectively. COVID-19 infection preventive protocols like keeping distance, hand wash using soap, wearing mask and using sanitizer were decreased post vaccination. About 74.3% of the respondents were worried about the adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine they received. The majority (80.2%) of the respondent felt fear while receiving the vaccine and 22.5% of the respondents suspect the effectiveness of the vaccine they took. About 14.8% of the vaccinated Health workers were infected by COVID-19 post-vaccination. Engaging in moderate physical activity and feeling fear when vaccinated were the independent factors associated with reported side effects of post-COVID-19 vaccination using multiple logistic regression. Respondents who did not engage in physical activity were 7.54 fold more likely to develop post-COVID-19 vaccination side effects compared to those who involved at least moderate-intensity physical activity[AOR = 7.54, 95% CI;2.46,23.12]. The odds of experiencing side effects among the respondents who felt fear when vaccinated were 10.73 times compared not felt fear (AOR = 10.73, 95% CI; 2.47,46.64), and similarly, those who felt little fear were 4.28 times more likely to experience side effects(AOR = 4.28, 95% CI; 1.28, 14.39).Significant numbers of the respondents experienced side effects post COVID-19 vaccination. It is recommended to provide pre-awareness about the side effects to reduce observed anxiety related to the vaccine. It is also important to plan monitoring and evaluation of the post-vaccine effect using standard longitudinal study designs to measure the effects directly."
https://openalex.org/W4311577551,"Tomatoes (Lycopersicun esculentum L.) are an important group of vegetable crops that have high economical and nutritional value. The use of fertilizers and appropriate substrates is one of the important strategies that can assist in increasing the yield and quality of fruits. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous seaweed extract (Nizamuddinia zanardinii), silicon (Na2SiO3), and selenium (Na2SeO3) on quality attributes and fruit yield (FY) of tomato under palm peat + perlite and coco peat + perlite substrates. Seaweed extract significantly improved several of the fruit quality attributes such as total carbohydrate content, total soluble solids (TSS), and pH as well as the FY. The results showed that silicon (Si) (75 mg) was the best foliar spray treatment to enhance the fruit firmness (30.46 N), fruit volume (196.8 cm3), and FY (3320.5 g). The highest amount of plant yield (3429.33 g) was obtained by the interaction effects of silicon (75 mg L-1) under the effect of palm peat. The use of selenium (Se) led to improvements in flavor index (TSS/TA). Also, the application of palm peat + perlite substrate caused an increase in vitamin C (16.62 mg/100g FW), compared to other substrates (14.27 mg/100g FW). The present study suggested that foliar spray with seaweed extract and Si had beneficial effects on the quality and FY of tomatoes. Also, the palm peat substrate can be used as a good alternative to the coco peat substrate in the hydroponic system."
https://openalex.org/W4311578141,"Cervids are economically important to a wide range of stakeholders and rights holders in the United States. The continued expansion of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting wild and farmed cervids, poses a direct and indirect threat to state and federal government agency operations and cervid related economic activity. However, the scale of this disease's direct economic costs is largely unknown. I synthesized existing publicly available data and stakeholder-provided data to estimate CWD's costs within the continental United States. Federal government agencies collectively spent over $284.1 million on CWD-related efforts between 2000 and 2021, with $203.6 million of this total being spent by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. In fiscal year 2020, state natural resources agencies and state agriculture/animal health agencies spent over $25.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, on CWD-related work. Natural resources agencies in states with known CWD cases spent over 8 times as much on CWD as agencies from states with no known cases. The farmed cervid industry spent at least $307,950 on CWD sampling in 2020, though a lack of available data prevented a complete assessment of costs to this industry. Based on limited data, CWD's economic effects on the hunting industry (i.e., outfitters and guides, companies leasing land to cervid hunters), may be negligible at this time. Overall, however, the realized economic costs of CWD appear considerable, and it is likely that the number of stakeholders financially affected by this disease and regulations meant to stem its spread will continue to grow. By understanding the current economic impacts of CWD, we are better positioned to assess the costs and benefits of investments in management and research and to understand the magnitude of this disease's broader societal impacts."
https://openalex.org/W4311582581,"Smoking is a chronic and relapsing disease, with up to 60% of quitters relapsing within the first year. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), targets cortical circuits and acutely reduces craving and withdrawal symptoms among cigarette smokers. However, the efficacy of tDCS as an adjunct to standard smoking cessation treatments has not been studied. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of tDCS in combination with varenicline for smoking cessation. We hypothesize that active tDCS combined with varenicline will improve cessation outcomes compared to sham tDCS combined with varenicline.This is a double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial where fifty healthy smokers will be recruited in Toronto, Canada. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either active tDCS (20 minutes at 2 mA) or sham tDCS (30 seconds at 2 mA, 19 minutes at 0 mA) for 10 daily sessions (2 weeks) plus 5 follow up sessions, occurring every two weeks for 10 weeks. All participants will be given standard varenicline treatment concurrently for the 12-week treatment period. The primary outcome is 30 day continuous abstinence at end of treatment, confirmed with urinary cotinine. Measurements made at each study visit include expired carbon monoxide, self-reported craving and withdrawal. Three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be conducted: two at baseline and one at end of treatment, to assess any functional or structural changes following treatment.For every two smokers who quit, one life is saved from a tobacco-related mortality. Therefore, it is important to develop new and more effective treatment approaches that can improve and maintain long-term abstinence, in order to decrease the prevalence of tobacco-related deaths and disease. Furthermore, the addition of longitudinal neuroimaging can shed light on neural circuitry changes that might occur as a result of brain stimulation, furthering our understanding of tDCS in addiction treatment.This trial has been registered with Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03841292 since February 15th 2019 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03841292)-retrospectively registered."
https://openalex.org/W4311588966,"There are conflicting predictions of climate change effects and landuse on the discharge of the Mississippi River-the largest river in North America. Are discharges becoming higher or lower, and if they did change, then when? To address these uncertainties I compiled a two-hundred-year long dataset of the annual average, minimum, and maximum discharges at five stations draining the Mississippi River watershed: at Clinton, IA, Herman, MO, St. Louis, MO, Louisville, KY, and Vicksburg, MS. A spline/Lowess analysis tested for trends and inflection points. All three discharge metrics increased, and the minimum annual discharge increased faster than either the annual maximum discharge or annual average discharge. A regression analysis of variations in average discharges from 1950 to 2020 at these five locations demonstrates correlations to the air pressure differentials represented in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index for January, February and March. The longest data set, for the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, demonstrates a similar direct relationship with the NAO Index from 1826 to 1969. After 1969, however, the relationship between discharge and the NAO Index is insignificant even though the range of Index values overlap for the two intervals. A breakpoint and rise in discharge ca. 1970 is consistent with well-documented land cover and land use changes occurring then that resulted in reduced evapotranspiration as homogenous cropping systems were established, and a higher percent of precipitation was routed into groundwater and baseflow. The Bonnet Carré Spillway at New Orleans, LA, is being opened more frequently to reduce flood threats as the river's stage increasingly reaches the threshold for opening it. Significant water quality impairments in the coastal zone will appear or be sustained with these openings. These data may be useful for climate change assessments through modeling or synthetic assessments in combination with other data sets."
https://openalex.org/W4311883639,"Background Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are important for child survival and healthy growth, but IYCF practices remain suboptimal in Nigeria. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of Alive &amp; Thrive’s IYCF social and behavior change communication intervention on early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, and minimum dietary diversity in Kaduna and Lagos States. Methods Local government areas were randomly allocated to intervention or comparison. Cross-sectional surveys of households with children aged 0–23 months were conducted [N = 6,266 baseline (2017), N = 7,320 endline (2020)]. Logistic regression was used to calculate difference-in-differences estimates (DDEs) of impact on IYCF practices and to assess within group changes from baseline to endline. Associations between intervention exposures and IYCF practices were tested in both study groups combined. Results In Kaduna, a positive differential effect of the intervention was found for exclusive breastfeeding (adjusted DDE 8.9 pp, P &lt;0.099). Increases in both study groups from baseline to endline were observed in Kaduna for early initiation of breastfeeding (intervention 12.2 pp, P = 0.010; comparison 6.4 pp, P = 0.118) and minimum dietary diversity (intervention 20.0 pp, P &lt;0.001; comparison 19.7 pp, P &lt;0.001), which eliminated differential effects. In Lagos, no differential intervention impacts were found on IYCF practices because changes in early initiation of breastfeeding from baseline to endline were small in both study groups and increases in both study groups from baseline to endline were observed for exclusive breastfeeding (intervention 8.9 pp, P = 0.05; comparison 6.6 pp, P &lt;0.001) and minimum dietary diversity (intervention 18.9 pp, P &lt;0.001; comparison 24.3 pp, P &lt;0.001). Odds of all three IYCF practices increased with exposure to facility-based interpersonal communication in both states and with community mobilization or mass media exposure in Kaduna. Conclusions This evaluation found weak impacts of the Alive &amp; Thrive intervention on IYCF practices in the difference-in-differences analysis because of suspected intervention spillover to the comparison group. Substantial within group increases in IYCF practices from baseline to endline are likely attributable to the intervention, which was the major IYCF promotion activity in both states. This is supported by the association between intervention exposures and IYCF practices. Trial registration The study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02975063 )."
https://openalex.org/W4311573191,"Introduction The recent publication of a national guideline and quality standards in Canada have provided clinicians with new, evidence-based recommendations on safe, appropriate opioid use. We sought to characterize how well opioid initiation practices aligned with these recommendations before and following their release. Methods We conducted a population-based study among people initiating opioids prior to the release of national guidelines (April 2015—March 2016; fiscal year [FY] 2015) and in the most recent year available (January—December 2019) in Ontario, Canada. We used linked administrative claims data to ascertain the apparent indication for opioid therapy, and characterized the initial daily dose (milligrams morphine or equivalent; MME) and prescription duration for each indication. Results In FY2015, 653,885 individuals commenced opioids, compared to 571,652 in 2019. Over time, there were small overall reductions in the prevalence of initial daily doses exceeding 50MME (23.9% vs. 20.1%) and durations exceeding 7 days (17.4% vs. 14.8%); but the magnitude of the reductions varied widely by indication. The prevalence of high dose (&gt;50MME) initial prescriptions reduced significantly across all indications, with the exception of dentist-prescribed opioids (13.6% vs. 12.1% above 50MME). In contrast, there was little change in initial durations exceeding 7 days across most indications, with the exception of some surgical indications (e.g. common excision; 9.3% vs. 6.2%) and among those in palliative care (35.2% vs. 29.2%). Conclusion Despite some modest reductions in initiation of high dose and long duration prescription opioids between 2015 and 2019, clinical practice is highly variable, with opioid prescribing practices influenced by clinical indication. These findings may help identify medical specialties well-suited to targeted interventions to promote safer opioid prescribing."
https://openalex.org/W4311574500,"We show that large private shareholders have an information advantage about their industry; this can alleviate the information asymmetry suffered by banks, and consequently, increase bank lending to these shareholders’ industry. Using a sample of Chinese city commercial banks, we show that an increase in the large private shareholders’ shareholding of banks increases bank lending to these shareholders’ industry. Importantly, using Chinese local government industrial policy as a moderator, we find that industrial policies have a positive and significant moderating effect on the relationship between large private shareholders and banks’ industry-specific lending. This relationship strengthens when local industrial policy supports these shareholders’ industry. This helps explain why banks prefer the industries to which their large private shareholders belong to and how industrial policy affects bank credit allocation."
https://openalex.org/W4311574564,"Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignant plasma cell infiltration of the bone marrow, is generally considered incurable: resistance to multiple therapeutic drugs inevitably arises from tumor cell-intrinsic and tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated mechanisms. Here we report that the proteoglycan tandem repeat 1 (PTR1) domain of the TME matrix protein, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1), induces a host of cell survival genes in MM cells and variable resistance to different classes of clinical drugs, including certain proteasome inhibitors, steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and DNA damaging agents, in several MM cell lines tested. Collectively, our study identifies HAPLN1 as an extracellular matrix factor that can simultaneously confer MM cell resistance to multiple therapeutic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4311577984,"The repair of infected bone defects remains a clinical challenge. Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogenic micro-organism associated with such infections. Gentamycin (GM) is a broad spectrum antibiotic that can kill S . aureus in a dose-dependent manner. However, the systemic administration of antibiotics may lead to drug resistance and gut dysbiosis. In this work, we constructed β-tricalcium phosphate/gelatin composite scaffolds incorporated with gentamycin-loaded chitosan microspheres (CMs(GM)-β-TCP/gelatin composite scaffolds), which helped optimize the local GM release in the infected defect areas and enhance bone regeneration. The cumulative release curves showed that both microspheres and composite scaffolds reached a sustained slow-release phase after the initial rapid release, and the latter further stabilized the initial drug release rate. The release curve of CMs(GM)-β-TCP/gelatin composite scaffolds reached a plateau after 24 h, and the cumulative release reached 41.86% during this period. Moreover, the combination of β-TCP and gelatin mimicked bone composition and were able to provide the requisite mechanical strength (0.82 ± 0.05 MPa) during the first phase of bone generation. The inner structure of the scaffold was arranged in the shape of interconnected pores, and presented a porosity level of 16%. The apertures were uniform in size, which was beneficial for cell proliferation and material transportation. Macroscopic observation and histological analysis showed that CMs(GM)-β-TCP/gelatin composite scaffolds fused with bone tissues, and new tissues were formed in defect areas without any infection. This new composite scaffold may be a promising repair material for treating infected bone defects."
https://openalex.org/W4311579382,"Rodent control is necessary to prevent damage and spread of disease, and the most common pesticides used for urban and rural rodent control are anticoagulant rodenticides. The aim of this present study was to present data on suspected exposure to rodenticides in humans and domestic animals in Norway based on inquiries to the Norwegian Poison Information Centre in the 16-year period from 2005 through 2020. A total of 4235 inquiries regarding suspected exposures to rodenticides were registered in the study period. Of these, 1486 inquiries involved humans and 2749 animals. Second generation anticoagulants were involved in 68% of human exposures and 79% of animal exposures. Dogs were the most frequent species involved in the animal exposures with 93% of the inquiries, while cats were second most frequent involved. Around 50% of the human inquiries concerned children at the age of 0–4 years. Only 2% of the cases were in the age group 10–19 years, while adults comprised 35% of the inquiries. Acute poisonings accounted for almost 100% of the inquiries among both humans and animals. The exposure was accidental in 99% of the animal exposures and in 85% of the human exposures. In humans, only 14 inquiries were regarding occupational related accidents. Misdeed or self-inflicted injury accounted for 15% of the human inquiries and were the cause of 79% of the severe poisonings. Severe poisoning was only assessed in 1% of the cases involving children under 5 years. In contrast, 17% of the inquiries concerning adults (≥20 years) were assessed as severe. Subsequently, to prevent human and animal rodenticide exposure, we urge the use of non-chemical methods such as sanitation, rodent proofing (a form of construction which will impede or prevent rodents access to or from a given space or building) and mechanical traps. Restricting the use of rodenticides to professional pest controllers (or other persons with authorisation), reinforcing high quality education of these persons, and securing compliance of the best codes of practice could be advocated to reduce accidental exposure to rodenticides in humans and animals."
https://openalex.org/W4311579537,"Background Venetoclax (VEN) is the first selective small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor approved by FDA and used in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and some acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the long-term safety of VEN in large sample population was unknown. This study evaluated the adverse events (AEs) of VEN from FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) since its approval in 2016 by data mining. Methods The disproportionality analyses, including four algorithms of reporting odd ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), bayesian configuration promotion neural network (BCPNN), and multi item gamma poisson shrinker (MGPS), were employed to quantify the signals of VEN-associated AEs. Results From the FAERS database, a total of 8,379,682 reports were collected during the study period. After removing the duplication, the number of reports with VEN as the primary suspect (PS) was 19,107. The 19,107 cases of AEs involved 27 organ systems, 256 significant PTs which conforming to the four algorithms. Unexpected serious AEs, such as pleural effusion, splenic infarction, atrial fibrillation, skin squamous cell carcinoma, etc., have signals. The median time of occurrence of AEs related to VEN was 31 days (inter quartile range [IQR] 7–131 days), and half of the reported AEs occurred within 1 month after administration. Conclusion Our research has found new significant AEs signals of VEN, which improved its safety information in real-world after marketing approval, and contributed to its risk control of use in clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4311579714,"Background Studies on genome-wide associations help to determine the cause of many genetic diseases. Genome-wide associations typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genotyping every SNP in a chromosomal region for identifying genetic variation is computationally very expensive. A representative subset of SNPs, called tag SNPs, can be used to identify genetic variation. Small tag SNPs save the computation time of genotyping platform, however, there could be missing data or genotyping errors in small tag SNPs. This study aims to solve Tag SNPs selection problem using many-objective evolutionary algorithms. Methods Tag SNPs selection can be viewed as an optimization problem with some trade-offs between objectives, e.g. minimizing the number of tag SNPs and maximizing tolerance for missing data. In this study, the tag SNPs selection problem is formulated as a many-objective problem. Nondominated Sorting based Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III), and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), which are Many-Objective evolutionary algorithms, have been applied and investigated for optimal tag SNPs selection. This study also investigates different initialization methods like greedy and random initialization. optimization. Results The evaluation measures used for comparing results for different algorithms are Hypervolume, Range, SumMin, MinSum, Tolerance rate, and Average Hamming distance. Overall MOEA/D algorithm gives superior results as compared to other algorithms in most cases. NSGA-III outperforms NSGA-II and other compared algorithms on maximum tolerance rate, and SPEA2 outperforms all algorithms on average hamming distance. Conclusion Experimental results show that the performance of our proposed many-objective algorithms is much superior as compared to the results of existing methods. The outcomes show the advantages of greedy initialization over random initialization using NSGA-III, SPEA2, and MOEA/D to solve the tag SNPs selection as many-objective optimization problem."
https://openalex.org/W4311580852,"Amidst the therapeutic void at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical mass of scientific and clinical interest coalesced around COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). To date, the CCP literature has focused largely on safety and efficacy outcomes, but little on implementation outcomes or experience. Expert opinion suggests that if CCP has a role in COVID-19 treatment, it is early in the disease course, and it must deliver a sufficiently high titer of neutralizing antibodies (nAb). Missing in the literature are comprehensive evaluations of how local CCP programs were implemented as part of pandemic preparedness and response, including considerations of the core components and personnel required to meet demand with adequately qualified CCP in a timely and sustained manner. To address this gap, we conducted an evaluation of a local CCP program at a large U.S. academic medical center, the University of North Carolina Medical Center (UNCMC), and patterned our evaluation around the dimensions of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to systematically describe key implementation-relevant metrics. We aligned our evaluation with program goals of reaching the target population with severe or critical COVID-19, integrating into the structure of the hospital-wide pandemic response, adapting to shifting landscapes, and sustaining the program over time during a compassionate use expanded access program (EAP) era and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) era. During the EAP era, the UNCMC CCP program was associated with faster CCP infusion after admission compared with contemporaneous affiliate hospitals without a local program: median 29.6 hours (interquartile range, IQR: 21.2–48.1) for the UNCMC CCP program versus 47.6 hours (IQR 32.6–71.6) for affiliate hospitals; (P&lt;0.0001). Sixty-eight of 87 CCP recipients in the EAP (78.2%) received CCP containing the FDA recommended minimum nAb titer of ≥1:160. CCP delivery to hospitalized patients operated with equal efficiency regardless of receiving treatment via a RCT or a compassionate-use mechanism. It was found that in a highly resourced academic medical center, rapid implementation of a local CCP collection, treatment, and clinical trial program could be achieved through re-deployment of highly trained laboratory and clinical personnel. These data provide important pragmatic considerations critical for health systems considering the use of CCP as part of an integrated pandemic response."
https://openalex.org/W4311582516,"Introduction While numerous guidelines do not recommend preoperative tests for low risk patients undergoing low risk surgeries, they are often routinely performed. Canadian data suggests preoperative tests (e.g. ECGs and chest x-rays) preceded 17.9%-35.5% of low-risk procedures. Translating guidelines into clinical practice can be challenging and it is important to understand what is driving behaviour when developing interventions to change it. Aim Thus, we completed a theory-based investigation of the perceived barriers and enablers to reducing unnecessary preoperative tests for low-risk surgical procedures in Newfoundland, Canada. Method We used snowball sampling to recruit surgeons, anaesthesiologists, or preoperative clinic nurses. Interviews were conducted by two researchers using an interview guide with 31 questions based on the theoretical domains framework. Data was transcribed and coded into the 14 theoretical domains and then themes were identified for each domain. Results We interviewed 17 surgeons, anaesthesiologists, or preoperative clinic nurses with 1 to 34 years’ experience. Overall, while respondents agreed with the guidelines they described several factors, across seven relevant theoretical domains, that influence whether tests are ordered. The most common included uncertainty about who is responsible for test ordering, inability to access patient records or to consult/communicate with colleagues about ordering decisions and worry about surgery delays/cancellation if tests are not ordered. Other factors included workplace norms that conflicted with guidelines and concerns about missing something serious or litigation. In terms of enablers, respondents believed that clear institutional guidelines including who is responsible for test ordering and information about the risk of missing something serious, supported by improved communication between those involved in the ordering process and periodic evaluation will reduce any unnecessary preoperative testing. Conclusion These findings suggest that both health system and health provider factors need to be addressed in an intervention to reduce pre-operative testing."
https://openalex.org/W4311589178,"Oncogenic kinase inhibitors show short-lived responses in the clinic due to high rate of acquired resistance. We previously showed that pharmacologically exploiting oncogene-induced proteotoxic stress can be a viable alternative to oncogene-targeted therapy. Here, we performed extensive analyses of the transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteostatic perturbations during the course of treatment of Her2+ breast cancer cells with a Her2 inhibitor covering the drug response, resistance, relapse and drug withdrawal phases. We found that acute Her2 inhibition, in addition to blocking mitogenic signaling, leads to significant decline in the glucose uptake, and shutdown of glycolysis and of global protein synthesis. During prolonged therapy, compensatory overexpression of Her3 allows for the reactivation of mitogenic signaling pathways, but fails to re-engage the glucose uptake and glycolysis, resulting in proteotoxic ER stress, which maintains the protein synthesis block and growth inhibition. Her3-mediated cell proliferation under ER stress during prolonged Her2 inhibition is enabled due to the overexpression of the eIF2 phosphatase GADD34, which uncouples protein synthesis block from the ER stress response to allow for active cell growth. We show that this imbalance in the mitogenic and proteostatic signaling created during the acquired resistance to anti-Her2 therapy imposes a specific vulnerability to the inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control machinery. The latter is more pronounced in the drug withdrawal phase, where the de-inhibition of Her2 creates an acute surge in the downstream signaling pathways and exacerbates the proteostatic imbalance. Therefore, the acquired resistance mechanisms to oncogenic kinase inhibitors may create secondary vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4311589761,"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) usually become exhausted and dysfunctional owing to chronic contact with tumor cells and overexpression of multiple inhibitor receptors. Activation of TILs by targeting the inhibitory and stimulatory checkpoints has emerged as one of the most promising immunotherapy prospectively. We investigated whether triggering of CD28, 4-1BB, and PD-1 checkpoints simultaneously or alone could enhance the immune response capacity of lymphocytes. In this regard, anti-PD-1, CD80-Fc, and 4-1BBL-Fc proteins were designed and produced in CHO-K1 cells as an expression host. Following confirmation of the Fc fusion proteins’ ability to bind to native targets expressed on engineered CHO-K1 cells (CHO-K1/hPD-1, CHO-K1/hCD28, CHO-K1/hCTLA4, and CHO-K1/h4-1BB), the effects of each protein, on its own and in various combinations, were assessed in vitro on T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokines secretion using the Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay, 7-AAD/CFSE cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay, and a LEGENDplex™ Human Th Cytokine Panel, respectively. MLR results demonstrated that T cell proliferation in the presence of the combinations of anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc, CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc, and anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc proteins was significantly higher than in the untreated condition (1.83-, 1.91-, and 2.02-fold respectively). Furthermore, anti-PD-1 (17%), 4-1BBL-Fc (19.2%), anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc (18.6%), anti-PD-1/4-1BBL-Fc (21%), CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc (18.5%), and anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc (17.3%) significantly enhanced cytotoxicity activity compared to untreated condition (7.8%). However, concerning the cytokine production, CD80-Fc and 4-1BBL-Fc alone or in combination significantly increased the secretion of IFN‐γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 compared with the untreated conditions. In conclusion, this research establishes that the various combinations of produced anti-PD-1, CD80-Fc, and 4-1BBL-Fc proteins can noticeably induce the immune response in vitro . Each of these combinations may be effective in killing or destroying cancer cells depending on the type and stage of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4311883653,"Background Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening complication of sepsis. In surgical ICUs, DIC is frequently caused by abdominal sepsis, and the disarranged coagulation and complications often lead to death. The severity of sepsis is associated with a higher DIC score according to the parameters proposed by the International Society of Hemostasis and Thrombosis (ISTH) in 2001: platelet count, bleeding time (Quick), D-dimer, and fibrinogen. One problem in studying DIC is finding an adequate animal model that reflects the clinical situation of polymicrobial overwhelming infection. Aims and methods We investigated whether a well-established polymicrobial sepsis model of colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) is suited to investigate the complexity of DIC. For this purpose, CASP-operated mice were examined 20 h after the operation with regard to coagulation parameters using cell counts, bleeding times, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), ELISAs for D-dimer and fibrinogen, and platelet accumulation in affected organs via immunohistochemistry to see if the mice develop a coagulation disorder that meets the definition of DIC proposed by the ISTH 2001 consensus conference. Results Herein, we showed that the CASP model is an all-encompassing animal model to analyze the complexity of systemic DIC in murine abdominal sepsis. There is highly reproducible thrombocytopenia, a significant prolongation of the bleeding time, and a loss of fibrinogen in plasma. We also observed microvascular thrombosis due to platelet accumulation in the microcirculation of the liver. Conclusion The CASP model seems superior to other artificial models, e.g., injecting substances, for inducing DIC. CASP is one of the best true-to-life models for analyzing the complexity of disseminated intravascular coagulation in polymicrobial sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W4311572557,"In low- and middle-income countries, undernutrition often co-exists with intestinal parasites, especially Soil Transmitted Helminth (STH) infections in children. The collective impact of both conditions result in undernutrition and can exacerbate the general poor health status of children. A cross-sectional survey of 422 mother-child (12-59 months old) pairs from 14 villages in the District of Ndelele, East Region of Cameroon, was carried out to assess the magnitude and correlates of undernutrition and intestinal parasites. Socio-demographic data were collected from mothers and anthropometric data were collected from children. Parasitological assessment was performed using a combination of direct microscopy flotation, sedimentation and centrifugation techniques. Correlates of undernutrition and intestinal parasites were identified using multinomial logistic regression at individual and household levels. 83.77% of the children assessed for undernutrition were undernourished and 66.82% were positive for one or more intestinal parasites. It was not uncommon for the study participants to be concurrently infected with two or more intestinal parasites. The most common intestinal parasitic infections detected in the study were A. lumbricoides, E. histolytica/dispar and Hookworm infection. Multinomial logistic regression using Nutritional status as outcome showed that, children who were not exclusively breastfed were 106% (RR = 2.06; C.I = 1.12-3.80) more likely to be underweight compared to those who were exclusively breastfed. The household size of 4 to 6 persons also significantly impacted wasting (p-value = 0.007) at 7% (RR = 1.07, C.I = 0.49-2.32). Analysis by a logistic regression model with STH infection as outcome revealed that, Fingernail cleanness (p-value = 0.044; AOR = 1.75; CI = 1.09-2.78) and household size (p-value = 0.038; AOR = 0.55; CI = 0.32-0.92) were positively associated with intestinal parasite infection at the 5% significant level. This study reveals that intestinal helminthic parasitic infections (STH) and undernutrition are serious health problems in children below five in the study area. To address this dire situation, concerted efforts are needed to improve sanitation, hygiene education access, community deworming programs, and improve diets."
https://openalex.org/W4311574558,"Depression in mammals is known to be associated with poor reproductive capacity. In males, it has been associated with decreased efficiency of spermatogenesis as well as the production of spermatozoa of reduced structural and functional integrity. Although antidepressants are effective in correcting depressive states, there is controversy regarding their effectiveness in restoring male reproductive function. Here, using an animal model of depression induced by a forced swim test, we confirmed that depression is accompanied by impaired male reproductive function. We further show that administration of a conventional antidepressant of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class (paroxetine) impairs male reproductive performance in terms of sperm production and quality when administered to healthy animals. Intriguingly, when paroxetine is administered to ""depressed"" animals, it resulted in a complete restoration of the animal’s ability to produce sperm that appears to be as capable of meeting the parameters evaluated here as those of control animals. The one-carbon cycle (1CC) is one of the most important metabolic cycles that include the methionine and folate cycles and plays a major role in DNA synthesis, amino acids, and also the production of antioxidants. Our results show that depression affects the main components of this cycle and paroxetine on healthy mice increases homocysteine levels, decreases glycine and vitamin B12, while in depressed mice, it increases folate levels and decreases vitamin B12. Thus, paroxetine exerts negative impacts on male reproductive function when administered to healthy animals and it well correlate with the altered sperm parameters and functions of depressed animals, and its mechanism remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W4311575017,"The development of the green economy has significantly impact the traditional mining industry. Mining enterprises must invest in green technology to reduce the environmental pollution caused by flying dust and soil erosion and are subject to increased scrutiny to be socially responsible when conducting their business. To address this issue, we consider a competitive mining supply chain system consisting of two excavators and two exclusive retailers. Among them, the excavators have a certain sense of corporate social responsibility (CSR), that is, in addition to pursuing economic profits, they also consciously pay attention to the interests of consumers. We establish three different game models that two excavators exhibit no CSR behaviour (NN), two excavators exhibit CSR behaviour (SS) and one excavator exhibits CSR behaviour (SN). We examine the optimal decision-making strategies and analyse the impact of social responsibility. Analytical results show that the optimal strategies of mining supply chain are different under different supply chain structures. The optimal decisions of the mining supply chain members are the same in each case under the NN and SS models. In the SN model, the optimal decision strategy value of mining supply chain members is always greater than non-socially responsible supply chain members. In SS model, when the intensity of social responsibility competition is low, two excavators reduce the wholesale price, and retailers reduce the sales price; when the intensity of social responsibility competition is strong, two excavators will increase the wholesale price, and retailers will increase the sales price. These help to promote product sales and increase the profits of the supply chain system. In SN model, with the increase of social responsibility competition intensity, the wholesale price of two excavators and the sales price of retailers first increased and then decreased. Finally, numerical examples illustrated to justify the proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W4311576331,"Background Women, gender minorities and their children are at heightened risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) following stressful life events (SLE). The increase in IPV during the global pandemic of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is recent evidence. Studies have linked IPV to poor health, resulting in lower mental, physical, sexual, and reproductive health outcomes. IPV has also been shown as a barrier to labour force participation, leading to negative socioeconomic outcomes (i.e., low or no employment). Formal and informal supports help individuals who experience IPV, but it is unclear if and how these are being accessed during SLEs such as environmental disasters, pandemics, and economic recessions. Accessibility to programs is an issue in normal times because of stigma, social norms, and lack of knowledge; this has been further amplified by situations where individuals who experience violence are isolated physically and emotionally, as well as face controlling behaviours by their perpetrators of violence. This scoping review will be used to conduct a comprehensive review of literature and address the research question: What is known in published literature about access to services by individuals who experience IPV during stressful life events in high-income countries ? Methods The following electronic databases will be searched for relevant publications: MEDILINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsychINfo (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (EBSCO), Gender Watch (ProQuest), Web of Science and Applied Social Sciences Index &amp; Abstracts (ProQuest). Key terms and medical subject headings (MeSH) will be based on previous literature and consult with an expert librarian. The major concepts include ‘stressful life events’ AND intimate partner violence’ AND ‘access to services’. Google, Google Scholar, and the WHO website will be used to search for grey literature, books/chapters, and programme reports as well as references of relevant reviews. Studies will be screened and extracted by two reviewers and conflicts resolved through discussion or a third reviewer. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis of relevant data will outline key findings. Discussion The scoping review will provide synthesized and summarized findings on literature regarding access to informal and formal social supports by victims of IPV during SLEs (i.e., pandemics and natural/environmental disasters/emergencies, economic recessions) where possible, highlighting key barriers, facilitators and lessons learned. Findings have potential to inform programs, policies, and interventions on accessibility to necessary support and health services during disasters."

Analytical results indicate that the firms’ incentives to adopt the excess information strategy, the Nash equilibrium configuration of firms adopting the strategy, and the market and welfare impacts of excess information are case-specific and dependent on the consumer reaction to excess information, the quality of the firms’ products, the degree of product differentiation between the brand producing firms, and whether the market is covered or not."
https://openalex.org/W4311578404,"Association analysis has been proven as a powerful tool for the genetic dissection of complex traits. This study was conducted to identify association of recovery, persistence, and summer dormancy with sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers in 36 smooth bromegrass genotypes under two moisture conditions and find stable associations. In this study, a diverse panel of polycross-derived progenies of smooth bromegrass was phenotyped under normal and water deficit regimes for three consecutive years. Under water deficit, dry matter yield of cut 1 was approximately reduced by 36, 39, and 37% during 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, compared with the normal regime. For dry matter yield of cut 2, these reductions were approximately 38, 60, and 56% in the same three consecutive years relative to normal regime. Moreover, water deficit decreased the RY and PER of the genotypes by 35 and 28%, respectively. Thirty primer combinations were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). From these, 541 polymorphic bands were developed and subjected to association analysis using the mixed linear model (MLM). Population structure analysis identified five main subpopulations possessing significant genetic differences. Association analysis identified 69 and 46 marker-trait associations under normal and water deficit regimes, respectively. Some of these markers were associated with more than one trait; which can be attributed to pleiotropic effects or tightly linked genes affecting several traits. In normal and water-deficit regimes, these markers could potentially be incorporated into marker-assisted selection and targeted trait introgression for the improvement of drought tolerance of smooth bromegrass."

In this paper, we describe the study cohort, survey data collection, and preliminary results. We identified 39,605 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) from two large integrated health care delivery systems who were diagnosed with incident VTE and received initial anticoagulation therapy of 3 months or longer. A subset of the cohort (12,737) was invited to participate in a survey. Surveys were completed in English, Spanish or Mandarin via a mailed questionnaire, an online secure web link, or telephone. The survey domains included demographics, personal medical history, anticoagulant treatment history, anticoagulant treatment satisfaction, health-related quality of life and health literacy. A total of 5,017 patients participated in the survey for an overall response rate of 39.4%. The mean (SD) age of the survey respondents was 63.0 (14.5) years and self-reported race was 76.0% White/European, 11.1% Black/African American, and 3.8% Asian/Pacific Islander and 14.0% reported Hispanic ethnicity. Sixty percent of respondents completed the web survey, while 29.0% completed the mail-in paper survey, and 11.0% completed the survey via telephone. The ALTERNATIVE Study will address knowledge gaps by comparing several treatment alternatives for the extended management of VTE so that this information could be used by patients and clinicians to make more informed, patient-centered treatment choices."
https://openalex.org/W4311580037,"Falls are a critical public health issue among older adults. One notable factor contributing to falls in older adults is a deterioration of the structures supporting balance and overall balance control. Preliminary evidence suggests older adults who ride a bicycle have better balance than those who do not. Cycling may be an effective intervention to prevent falls among older adults. This study aims to objectively measure the relationship between bicycling, physical activity, and balance for older adults. Older adult cyclists (n = 19) and non-cyclists (n = 27) were recruited to (1) complete a survey that assessed demographics; (2) wear an accelerometer for 3 weeks to objectively assess physical activity; and (3) complete balance-related tasks on force platforms. Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed to detect differences in balance and physical activity metrics between cyclists and non-cyclists. Cyclists were significantly more physically active than non-cyclists. Cyclists, compared to non-cyclists, exhibited differences in balance-related temporospatial metrics and long-range temporal correlations that suggest a more tightly regulated postural control strategy that may relate to higher stability. Cycling was observed to correlate more strongly with balance outcomes than other physical activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the possible implications for cycling as an effective intervention to improve balance and reduce fall risk."
https://openalex.org/W4311580225,"The risk posed by wildlife to air transportation is of great concern worldwide. In Australia alone, 17,336 bird-strike incidents and 401 animal-strike incidents were reported to the Air Transport Safety Board (ATSB) in the period 2010-2019. Moreover, when collisions do occur, the impact can be catastrophic (loss of life, loss of aircraft) and involve significant cost to the affected airline and airport operator (estimated at globally US$1.2 billion per year). On the other side of the coin, civil aviation, and airport operations have significantly affected bird populations. There has been an increasing number of bird strikes, generally fatal to individual birds involved, reported worldwide (annual average of 12,219 reported strikes between 2008-2015 being nearly double the annual average of 6,702 strikes reported 2001-2007) (ICAO, 2018). Airport operations including construction of airport infrastructure, frequent take-offs and landings, airport noise and lights, and wildlife hazard management practices aimed at reducing risk of birdstrike, e.g., spraying to remove weeds and invertebrates, drainage, and even direct killing of individual hazard species, may result in habitat fragmentation, population decline, and rare bird extinction adjacent to airports (Kelly T, 2006; Zhao B, 2019; Steele WK, 2021). Nevertheless, there remains an imperative to continually improve wildlife hazard management methods and strategies so as to reduce the risk to aircraft and to bird populations. Current approved wildlife risk assessment techniques in Australia are limited to ranking of identified hazard species, i.e., are ‘static’ and, as such, do not provide a day-to-day risk/collision likelihood. The purpose of this study is to move towards a dynamic, evidence-based risk assessment model of wildlife hazards at airports. Ideally, such a model should be sufficiently sensitive and responsive to changing environmental conditions to be able to inform both short and longer term risk mitigation decisions. Challenges include the identification and quantification of contributory risk factors, and the selection and configuration of modelling technique(s) that meet the aforementioned requirements. In this article we focus on likelihood of bird strike and introduce three distinct, but complementary, assessment techniques, i.e., A lgebraic, B ayesian, and C lustering (ABC) for measuring the likelihood of bird strike in the face of constantly changing environmental conditions. The ABC techniques are evaluated using environment and wildlife observations routinely collected by the Brisbane Airport Corporation ( BAC ) wildlife hazard management team. Results indicate that each of the techniques meet the requirements of providing dynamic, realistic collision risks in the face of changing environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4311582689,"Research has clearly demonstrated that some study strategies (for example, self-testing and spaced studying) are effective, yet students often report studying ineffectively. Our focus with the current study is to update and extend the current literature on how college students study. We surveyed 484 introductory psychology students at a small liberal arts college-a different type of school from prior studies. Our survey built on an existing study strategies questionnaire used to assess a variety of student study behaviors and beliefs. Additionally, we asked new questions about multitasking and study scheduling. Overall, we found that the current sample reported studying in similar ways to what past research suggested; students used both effective and ineffective strategies, some of which correlated with grade point average (GPA). However, some differences emerged. For example, our students were more likely to report learning how to study from a teacher. Additionally, a majority of students believed that multitasking was ineffective, yet most reported multitasking while studying. Finally, an important, but exploratory, analysis demonstrated that study strategies were similar before and after COVID-19 forced classroom changes. We highlight the need for future research on study strategies to recruit participants from more diverse institutions."

With less than a decade left to reach these targets, it is important to identify those at greatest risk of not meeting these ambitious targets. Adolescent mothers and their children are a highly vulnerable group. We mapped 35 SGD-related targets among 1,046 adolescent mothers and their oldest child (n = 1046). Questionnaires using validated scales were completed by 10- to 24-year-old adolescent girls and young women who had their first child before age 20 in an HIV-endemic district in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Maternal outcomes included 26 SDG-aligned indicators, while child-related outcomes included 9 indicators. Data was collected by trained researchers, following informed voluntary consent by the adolescent mothers and their caregivers. Frequencies and chi-square tests were conducted to compare progress along SDG-aligned indicators among adolescent mothers by HIV status. Overall, adolescent mothers reported low attainment of SDG-aligned indicators. While four in five adolescent mothers lived in poor households, nearly 93% accessed at least one social cash transfer and 80% accessed a child support grant for their children. Food security rates among adolescent mothers (71%) were lower than among their children (91%). Only two-thirds of adolescent mothers returned to school after childbirth, and only one-fifth were either studying or employed. Over half of adolescent mothers had experienced at least one type of violence (domestic, sexual or community). HIV-positive status was associated with higher rates of hunger and substance use, poorer school attendance, and higher rates of exposure to violence. Understanding progress and gaps in meeting the SDGs among highly vulnerable groups is critical, particularly for adolescent mothers and their children. These complex vulnerabilities suggest that programming for adolescent mothers must address their unique needs."
https://openalex.org/W4311583181,"Background Childhood immunisation coverage is very low in Nigeria (31%) with Zamfara State being amongst the states with the poorest coverage (&lt;10%). Lack of maternal knowledge, attitude, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, cultural beliefs and assumptions of religious regulations of antenatal mothers towards childhood immunisation are the contributory factors to poor childhood immunisation uptake. This study aims is to develop, implement and evaluate the effects of an immunisation health educational intervention with application of Social Cognitive Theory on pregnant women to improve knowledge, attitude, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, cultural beliefs and assumptions on religious regulations regarding childhood immunization uptake in Federal Medical Centre Gusau, Zamfara State, Nigeria. Methodology The study will be a single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial, where baseline data will be collected from 392 estimated antenatal mothers, after that they will be evenly randomised using randomly generated permuted block sizes (each containing two intervention and two control assignments). The study participants will be antenatal mothers of ages 18 years and above who are in third trimesters and attending Federal Medical Centre Gusau, Zamfara State, Nigeria; during the study period and fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The intervention group will undergo five-health education sessions on immunisation, which will be strictly guided by Social Cognitive Theory-based intervention module: while the control group will receive usual care (standard care). Follow-up data will be collected using the same questionnaire at 6-weeks post-delivery, 10-weeks post-delivery and 14-weeks post-delivery. The generalized linear mixed model will be carried-out to determine the overall effect of the intervention after controlling for 14 potential confounding variables.

https://openalex.org/W4311583182,"Forecasting is of utmost importance for the Tourism Industry. The development of models to predict visitation demand to specific places is essential to formulate adequate tourism development plans and policies. Yet, only a handful of models deal with the hard problem of fine-grained (per attraction) tourism demand prediction. In this paper, we argue that three key requirements of this type of application should be fulfilled: (i) recency—forecasting models should consider the impact of recent events (e.g. weather change, epidemics and pandemics); (ii) seasonality—tourism behavior is inherently seasonal; and (iii) model specialization—individual attractions may have very specific idiosyncratic patterns of visitations that should be taken into account. These three key requirements should be considered explicitly and in conjunction to advance the state-of-the-art in tourism prediction models. In our experiments, considering a rich set of indoor and outdoor attractions with environmental and social data, the explicit incorporation of such requirements as features into the models improved the rate of highly accurate predictions by more than 320% when compared to the current state-of-the-art in the field. Moreover, they also help to solve very difficult prediction cases, previously poorly solved by the current models. We also investigate the performance of the models in the (simulated) scenarios in which it is impossible to fulfill all three requirements—for instance, when there is not enough historical data for an attraction to capture seasonality. All in all, the main contributions of this paper are the proposal and evaluation of a new information architecture for fine-grained tourism demand prediction models as well as a quantification of the impact of each of the three aforementioned factors on the accuracy of the learned models. Our results have both theoretical and practical implications towards solving important touristic business demands."
https://openalex.org/W4311583280,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is one of the most common inherited arrhythmias and multiple genes have been reported as causative. Presently, genetic diagnosis for LQTS patients is becoming widespread and contributing to implementation of therapies. However, causative genetic mutations cannot be detected in about 20% of patients. To elucidate additional genetic mutations in LQTS, we performed deep-sequencing of previously reported 15 causative and 85 candidate genes for this disorder in 556 Japanese LQTS patients. We performed in-silico filtering of the sequencing data and found 48 novel variants in 33 genes of 53 cases. These variants were predicted to be damaging to coding proteins or to alter the binding affinity of several transcription factors. Notably, we found that most of the LQTS-related variants in the RYR2 gene were in the large cytoplasmic domain of the N-terminus side. They might be useful for screening of LQTS patients who had no known genetic factors. In addition, when the mechanisms of these variants in the development of LQTS are revealed, it will be useful for early diagnosis, risk stratification, and selection of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4311583700,"Signed networks provide information to study the structure and composition of relationships (positive and negative) among individuals in a complex system. Individuals, through different criteria, form groups or organizations called communities. Community structures are one of the important properties of social networks. In this work, we aim to analyze the perturbation of negative relationships in communities. We developed a methodology to obtain and analyze the optimal community partitions in nine school networks in the state of Yucatán, México. We implemented a technique based on the social balance theory in signed networks to complete negative missing links and further applied two methods of community detection: Newman's and Louvain's algorithms. We obtain values close to Dunbar's ratio for both types of relationships, positive and negative. The concepts of balance and frustration were analyzed, and modularity was used to measure the perturbation of negative relationships in communities. We observe differences among communities of different academic degrees. Elementary school communities are unstable, i.e. significantly perturbed by negative relationships, in secondary school communities are semi-stable, and in high school and the university the communities are stable. The analyzes indicate that a greater number of negative links in the networks does not necessarily imply higher instability in the communities, but other social factors are also involved."
https://openalex.org/W4311586033,"Cellular response to stimulation governs tissue scale processes ranging from growth and development to maintaining tissue health and initiating disease. To determine how cells coordinate their response to such stimuli, it is necessary to simultaneously track and measure the spatiotemporal distribution of their behaviors throughout the tissue. Here, we report on a novel SpatioTemporal Response Analysis IN Situ (STRAINS) tool that uses fluorescent micrographs, cell tracking, and machine learning to measure such behavioral distributions. STRAINS is broadly applicable to any tissue where fluorescence can be used to indicate changes in cell behavior. For illustration, we use STRAINS to simultaneously analyze the mechanotransduction response of 5000 chondrocytes-over 20 million data points-in cartilage during the 50 ms to 4 hours after the tissue was subjected to local mechanical injury, known to initiate osteoarthritis. We find that chondrocytes exhibit a range of mechanobiological responses indicating activation of distinct biochemical pathways with clear spatial patterns related to the induced local strains during impact. These results illustrate the power of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W4311588240,"Synthesizing antenna arrays for fifth-generation communication technology is the most significant issue in the electromagnetic industry and academia. This paper focused on a comprehensive algorithm for developing a 5G base station antenna array. The suggested algorithm aims to provide a high-gain array antenna with a continuous wide scan angle without a grating lobe, as much as a compact size, low cost, and simplicity of fabrication, especially in the array feeding network system. The best architecture is specified by comparing the array factor of numerous subarray combinations to achieve the grating lobe’s minimum level. By considering additional limitations in our approach, such as different subarray symmetric architecture, complex weighting function, minimal number of overlapped elements, and an optimal number of microstrip layers, we improve the specification over previous research and lower the runtime procedure. The proposed method is also used to construct a linear array antenna with 49 radiating elements for a 5G base station antenna operating at 28 GHz. Consequently, the number of phase shifters has been reduced by more than 53%, significantly improving over earlier efforts. Then a hybrid genetic algorithm and a particle swarm optimization technique are applied to determine the optimal values of excitation coefficients to control side lobe level(SLL) and beam scanning. The amplitude and phase step variations are calculated as 0.1 and 1°, respectively. HPBW of 2.8°, gain of 28 dB, scanning up to ± 25° in one direction, and SLL below -24 dB are the electromagnetic properties of the designed aperiodic linear array. An example of implementing the suggested method, a 16-element array with a random overlap subarray structure, including the feeding network and microstrip antenna element, will be modeled using a full-wave simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for designing array topology."
https://openalex.org/W4311589602,"The 2007 melamine pet food contamination incident highlighted the need for enhanced reporting of toxicological exposures and development of a national quantitative disease surveillance system for companion animals. Data from poison control centers, such as the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), may be useful for conducting real-time surveillance in this population. In this study, we explored the suitability of APCC call data for early warning of toxicological incidents in companion animal populations by using a-priori knowledge of the melamine-related nephrotoxicosis outbreak. Patient and household-level information regarding possible toxicological exposures in dogs and cats reported to the APCC from 2005 to 2007, inclusive, were extracted from the APCC's AnTox database. These data were used to examine the impact of surveillance outcome, statistical methodology, analysis level, and call source on the ability to detect the outbreak prior to the voluntary recall issued by the pet food manufacturer. Retrospective Poisson temporal scan tests were applied for each combination of outcome, method, level, and call source. The results showed that month-adjusted scans using syndromic data may have been able to help detect the outbreak up to two months prior to the voluntary recall although the success of these methods varied across call sources. We also demonstrated covariate month-adjustment can lead to vastly different results based on the surveillance outcome and call source to which it is applied. This illustrates care should be taken prior to arbitrarily selecting a surveillance outcome and statistical model for surveillance efforts and warns against ignoring the impacts of call source or key covariates when applying quantitative surveillance methods to APCC call data since these factors can lead to very different results. This study provides further evidence that APCC call data may be useful for conducting surveillance in the US companion animal population and further exploratory analyses and validation studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4311589883,"The “time-space compression” effect of high-speed rail (HSR) has effectively improved the accessibility of the cities and has had a profound impact on tourism. This study explores the impact of HSR on tourism development in cities along HSR lines from the perspective of transfer of transport advantages, then evaluates the impact of HSR on tourism development using panel data of 286 cities in China from 2005 to 2013 by the difference-in-differences (DID) method. The empirical results show that the opening of HSR has significantly increased the tourism revenue and tourist arrivals. These results are still holds after considering endogenous HSR lines placement, and by various robustness checks. Further analysis of nodal effect shows that node cities experienced greater growth in tourism revenue than non-node cities. The analysis of mechanism found that tourism development in node cities relied on hotel industry, while tourism development in non-node cities relied on scenic spots industry. The findings of this study validate the role of HSR as a catalyst for urban tourism development, and reveal the comparative advantages of tourism in different cities under the influence of HSR. This study has important reference value for the development of tourism industry policies in cities along and around HSR lines."

Methods A total of 84 newly diagnosed castrated mPC patients treated with castration were recruited and divided into two groups: Group I served as control (statin non-users) while group II treated with Rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 6 months and served as statin users. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Caveolin-1 (CAV1), lipid profile (LDL, HDL, triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC)) and lipid metabolism related markers (aldoketoreductase (AKR1C4), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and soluble low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (SLDLRP1)) were measured at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and COX regression for prognostic significance. Results Before castration, HMG-CoA reductase was elevated in patients &lt;65 years (P = 0.009). Bone metastasis was associated with high PSA level (P = 0.013), but low HMGCR (P = 0.004). Patients with positive family history for prostate cancer showed high levels of EGFR, TG, TC, LDL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but low AKR1C4, SLDLRP1, CAV1 and ABCA-1 levels. Smokers had high CAV1 level (P = 0.017). After 6 months of castration and rosuvastatin administration, PSA, TG, LDL and TC were significantly reduced, while AKR1C4, HMGCR, SLDLRP1, CAV1 and ABCA-1 were significantly increased. Overall survival was reduced in patients with high baseline of SLDLRP1 (&gt;3385 pg/ml, P = 0.001), PSA (&gt;40 ng/ml, P = 0.003) and CAV1 (&gt;4955 pg/ml, P = 0.021). Conclusion Results of the current study suggest that the peripheral lipidogenic effects of rosuvastatin may have an impact on the treatment outcome and survival of castrated mPC patients.

https://openalex.org/W4311883665,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection still represents a major public health problem worldwide, and its vaccine remains elusive. The study of HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN) brings important information about the natural resistance to HIV, allows a better understanding of the infection, and opens doors for new preventive and therapeutic strategies. Among HESN groups, there are some men who have sex with men (MSM) with high-risk sexual behaviors, who represent an adequate cohort for HESN study because of their major HIV exposure without infection. This study aimed to compare the immunological profile of Colombian seronegative MSM with different risk sexual behaviors. This study included 60 MSM at high-risk (n = 16) and low-risk (n = 44) of HIV-1 acquisition. No sex worker nor homozygous delta 32 mutation subjects were included. All participants were negative for anti-HIV-1/2 antibodies and HIV-1 proviral DNA. A higher frequency of sexual partners in the last 3 months before the study participation (median, 30 vs. 2), lifetime sexual partners (median, 1,708 vs. 26), and unprotected anal intercourse (median 12.5 vs. 2) was determined in high-risk MSM than low-risk MSM. High-risk MSM also showed a quiescent profile of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, with a significantly lower percentage of CD4+CD38+, CD4+HLADR-CD38+, CD4+Ki67+ T cells, and NKG2D+ NK cells (CD3-CD16+CD56+), a significantly higher percentage of CD4+HLADR-CD38-, and a tendency to show a higher percentage of CD8+HLADR+CD38- T cells than the low-risk group. Likewise, they showed higher mRNA levels of Serpin A1 from PBMCs. The results suggest that this MSM cohort could be HESN individuals and their resistance would be explained by a quiescent profile of T cells and NK cells and an increased Serpin A1 expression. Further study on MSM at high risk of exposure to HIV-1 is necessary to better understand the natural resistance to HIV."
https://openalex.org/W4311883693,"People desire agentic representations of their personal and collective selves, such as their own nation. When national agency is put into question, this should increase their inclination to restore it, particularly when they simultaneously lack perceptions of personal control. In this article, we test this hypothesis of group-based control in the context of political elections occurring during socio-economic crises. We propose that people who are reminded of low (vs. high) personal control will have an increased tendency to reject traditional political parties that stand for the maintenance of a non-agentic political system. We experimentally manipulated the salience of low vs. high personal control in five studies and measured participants' intentions to support traditional and new political parties. Across four of five studies, in line with the predictions, low personal control reduced support for the main traditional conservative party (e.g., Partido Popular (PP) in Spain, the Republicans in France). These results appeared in contexts of national economic and/or political crisis, and were most pronounced when low (vs. high) national agency was made salient in Studies 4 and 5. The findings support the notion that rejecting the stability of the national political system can serve as a means to maintain a sense of control through the collective self."
https://openalex.org/W4311887965,"Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies indicate that Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a negative relationship with the incidence of cancers. Whether the Alzheimer's genetic risk factor, named as fermitin family homolog-2 (FERMT2), plays a pivotal part in the progressive process of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) yet remains unclear. This study revealed that FERMT2 was upregulated in CRC tissues which predicted an unfavorable outcome of CRC using the PrognoScan web tool. FERMT2 was co-expressed with a variety of genes have been linked with CRC occurrence and implicated in the infiltration of immune cell in CRC tissues. Overexpressing FERMT2 promoted CRC progression with upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Knockdown of FERMT2 suppressed the cell multiplication, colony formation rate, migration and invasion, along with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with downregulation Wnt/β-catenin proteins in cells of CRC, while overexpressing β-catenin reversed the inhibitory effects of silencing FERMT2 on the migration or invasion of CRC cells. Furthermore, Aβ1-42 treated HT22 cells induced downregulation of FERMT2 and inhibited the migration, invasion and EMT in co-cultured CT26 cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our results revealed that the downregulated FERMT2 gene during AD is prominently activated in CRC, which promotes its progression via Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4311930477,"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is key in clinical neuroimaging studies. In recent years, DWI has undergone rapid evolution and increasing applications. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used to analyse group-level differences in white matter (WM), but suffers from limitations that can be particularly impactful in clinical groups where 1) structural abnormalities may increase erroneous inter-subject registration and 2) subtle differences in WM microstructure between individuals can be missed. It also lacks standardization protocols for analyses at the subject level. Region of Interest (ROI) analyses in native diffusion space can help overcome these challenges, with manual segmentation still used as the gold standard. However, robust automated approaches for the analysis of ROI-extracted native diffusion characteristics are limited. Subject-Specific Diffusion Segmentation (SSDS) is an automated pipeline that uses pre-existing imaging analysis methods to carry out WM investigations in native diffusion space, while overcoming the need to interpolate diffusion images and using an intermediate T1 image to limit registration errors and guide segmentation. SSDS is validated in a cohort of healthy subjects scanned three times to derive test-retest reliability measures and compared to other methods, namely manual segmentation and tract-based spatial statistics as an example of group-level method. The performance of the pipeline is further tested in a clinical population of patients with traumatic brain injury and structural abnormalities. Mean FA values obtained from SSDS showed high test-retest and were similar to FA values estimated from the manual segmentation of the same ROIs (p-value &gt; 0.1). The average dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) comparing results from SSDS and manual segmentations was 0.8 ± 0.1. Case studies of TBI patients showed robustness to the presence of significant structural abnormalities, indicating its potential clinical application in the identification and diagnosis of WM abnormalities. Further recommendation is given regarding the tracts used with SSDS."
