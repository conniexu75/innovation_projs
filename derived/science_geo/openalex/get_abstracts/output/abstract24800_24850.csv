https://openalex.org/W1514575046,"Glucocorticoids stimulate apoptosis in rat thymocytes that is characterized by internucleosomal DNA degradation. We have previously identified an 18-kDa calcium-dependent nuclease whose activity is associated with this DNA degradation. The existence of this nuclease has been challenged by Alnemri and Litwack (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4104-4111, who suggest that the nuclease we observed was histone H2B. We report here a modified nuclease assay which uses [32P] DNA as a substrate that has enabled the purification and characterization of the 18-kDa nuclease (NUC18). Using Bio-Rex 70 chromatography in conjunction with this assay, we show that NUC18 can be separated from histone H2B. Enzymatically active NUC18, purified to apparent homogeneity, failed to react with two different anti-histone H2B antibodies. NUC18 was inactive in the absence of calcium and known inhibitors of apoptosis, i.e. zinc and aurintricarboxylic acid inhibit its activity. Although NUC18 activity was detected in nuclear extracts of thymocytes of both control and glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes, these activities were distinct. Gel filtration analysis revealed that NUC18 was present as a high molecular weight complex (greater than 100 kDa) in both groups of cells, whereas it also existed as a low molecular weight form in glucocorticoid-treated cells. Thus, NUC18 remains a candidate for the endonuclease responsible for the DNA degradation component of the apoptotic process."
https://openalex.org/W1502098572,"The mechanism of inhibition by apolipoprotein C of the uptake and degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from human plasma via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway was investigated in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) density subfractions and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) with or without added exogenous recombinant apolipoprotein E-3 were used. Total and individual (C-I, C-II, C-III-1, and C-III-2) apoC molecules effectively inhibited apoE-3-mediated cell metabolism of the lipoproteins through the LDL receptor, with apoC-I being most effective. When the incubation was carried out with different amounts of exogenous apoE-3 and exogenous apoC, it was shown that the ratio of apoE-3 to apoC determined the uptake and degradation of VLDL. Excess apoE-3 overcame, at least in part, the inhibition by apoC. ApoC, in contrast, did not affect LDL metabolism. Neither apoA-I nor apoA-II, two apoproteins that do not readily associate with VLDL, had any effect on VLDL cell metabolism. The inhibition of VLDL and IDL metabolism cannot be fully explained by interference of association of exogenous apoE-3 with or displacement of endogenous apoE from the lipoproteins. IDL is a lipoprotein that contains both apoB-100 and apoE. By using monoclonal antibodies 4G3 and 1D7, which specifically block cell interaction by apoB-100 and apoE, respectively, it was possible to assess the effects of apoC on either apoprotein. ApoC dramatically depressed the interaction of IDL with the fibroblast receptor through apoE, but had only a moderate effect on apoB-100. The study thus demonstrates that apoC inhibits predominantly the apoE-3-dependent interaction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with the LDL receptor in cultured fibroblasts and that the mechanism of inhibition reflects association of apoC with the lipoproteins and specific concentration-dependent effects on apoE-3 at the lipoprotein surface."
https://openalex.org/W1519510465,"We demonstrate here that human melanocytes could be regulated by endothelin (ET) derivatives, potent vasoconstrictive peptides synthesized by endothelial cells, to stimulate their proliferation and melanization via a receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway. Receptor-binding assay using [125I]ET indicated that unlabeled ET-1 or ET-2 competitively inhibited each binding of labeled ETs to melanocytes with a concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 0.7 or 0.9 nM, respectively. The dissociation constant (Kd) and the number of sites of the specific bindings of ET-1 and those of ET-2 were almost the same (Kd: 1.81 nM, binding sites: 7.0-8.0 x 10(4) per cell). Upon incubation with cultured cells, the mass contents of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and intracellular calcium level were substantially increased by 10 nM ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3, but not by big-ET with maximal response at 80-130-s postincubation. The addition of ET-1 and ET-2 at 1-50 nM concentrations caused human melanocytes to significantly stimulate DNA [( 3H]thymidine incorporation) and melanin synthesis (3H2O release and [14C] thiouracil incorporation). Furthermore, ETs exhibited an additive stimulatory effect on basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. In a long-term serum-free culture system, the strongest stimulation of growth by 10 nM ET-1 or ET-2 was observed in the presence of 10 nM cholera toxin and 0.2% bovine pituitary extract, resulting in a 4.5-fold increase in cell number for 12 culture days. These findings strongly suggest involvement of ET in the mechanism regulating proliferation and melanization of human melanocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1551547664,"A series of deletion and truncation mutants of protein kinase C (PKC) were expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell expression system in order to elucidate the ability of various domains of the enzyme to bind phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu). A PKC truncation mutant consisting of only the catalytic domain of the enzyme did not bind [3H]PDBu, whereas a PKC truncation mutant consisting of the regulatory domain (containing the tandem cysteine-rich putative zinc finger regions) bound [3H]PDBu. Deletion of the second conserved region (C2) of PKC did not abolish [3H]PDBu binding, whereas a deletion of the first conserved region (C1) of PKC, containing the two cysteine-rich sequences, completely abolished [3H]PDBu binding. Additional truncation and deletion mutants helped to localize the region necessary for [3H]PDBu binding; all PKC mutants that contained either one of the cysteine-rich zinc finger-like regions possessed phorbol ester binding activity. Scatchard analyses of these mutants indicated that each bound [3H]PDBu with equivalent affinity (21-41 nM); approximately 10-20-fold less than the native enzyme. In addition, a peptide of 146 amino acid residues from the first cysteine-rich region, as well as a peptide of only 86 amino acids residues from the second cysteine-rich region, both bound [3H]PDBu with high affinity (31 +/- 4 and 59 +/- 13 nM, respectively). These data establish that PKC contains two phorbol ester binding domains which may function in its regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1553332313,"The interaction between influenza virus and target membrane lipids during membrane fusion was studied with hydrophobic photoactivatable probes. Two probes, the newly synthesized bisphospholipid diphosphatidylethanolamine trifluoromethyl [3H]phenyl diazirine and the phospholipid analogue 1-palmitoyl-2(11-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)diazirinyl]phenyl]-[2-3H]- undecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Harter, C., Bachi, T., Semenza, G., and Brunner , J. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1856-1864), were used. Both labeled the HA2 subunit of the virus at low pH. By measuring virus-liposome interactions at 0 degrees C, it could be demonstrated that HA2 was inserted into the target membrane prior to fusion. As we have recently demonstrated, at this temperature, exposure of the fusion peptide of HA2 takes place within 15 s after acidification, but fusion does not start for 4 min (Stegmann, T., White, J. M., and Helenius, A. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 4231-4241). HA2 was labeled at least 2 min before fusion. No labeling of the HA1 subunit was seen. These data indicate that fusion is triggered by a direct interaction of the HA2 subunit of a kinetic intermediate form of HA with the lipids of the target membrane. Most likely, it is the fusion peptide of HA2 that is inserted into the target membrane. Just before fusion, HA is thus an integral membrane protein in both membranes. In contrast, the bromelain-derived ectodomain of HA was labeled by 1-palmitoyl-2(11-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)diazirinyl]phenyl]- [2-3H]undecanoyl)-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine at low pH but not by diphosphatidylethanolamine trifluoromethyl [3H]phenyl diazirine. This indicates that insertion of the fusion peptide of the bromelain-derived ectodomain of HA into a membrane differs from that of viral HA during fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1600839384,"Ferredoxins found in animal mitochondria function in electron transfer from NADPH-dependent ferredoxin reductase (Fd-reductase) to cytochrome P450 enzymes. To identify residues involved in binding of human ferredoxin to its electron transfer partners, neutral amino acids were introduced in a highly conserved acidic region (positions 68-86) by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA. Mutant ferredoxins were produced in Escherichia coli, and separate assays were used to determine the effect of substitutions on the capacity of each mutant to bind to Fd-reductase and cytochrome P450scc and to participate in the cholesterol side chain cleavage reaction. Replacements at several positions (mutants D68A, E74Q, and D86A) did not significantly affect activity, suggesting that acidic residues at these positions are not required for binding or electron transfer interactions. In contrast, substitutions at positions 76 and 79 (D76N and D79A) caused dramatic decreases in activity and in the affinity of ferredoxin for both Fd-reductase and P450scc; this suggests that the binding sites on ferredoxin for its redox partners overlap. Other substitutions (mutants D72A, D72N, E73A, E73Q, and D79N), however, caused differential effects on binding to Fd-reductase and P450scc, suggesting that the interaction sites are not identical. We propose a model in which Fd-reductase and P450scc share a requirement for ferredoxin residues Asp-76 and Asp-79 but have other determinants that differ and play an important role in binding. This model is consistent with the hypothesis that ferredoxin functions as a mobile shuttle in steroidogenic electron transfer, and it is considered unlikely that a functional ternary complex is formed."
https://openalex.org/W1608453530,"Glucocorticoid treatment of certain lymphoma cell lines and thymocytes activates a self-destructive pathway of programmed cell death referred to as apoptosis. Calcium and calmodulin (CaM) may be important signals in the apoptotic cascade because an early event is a sustained elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ and CaM inhibitors interfere with the death pathway. In the present study, expression of the CaM gene was examined during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in WEHI7.2 lymphocytes. Steady state levels of CaM mRNA were increased up to 10-fold following a 4-6-h exposure of WEHI7.2 cells to 10(-6) M dexamethasone. This increase was mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor since the response was not observed in WEHI7.418, a variant line which does not express active glucocorticoid receptor. Induction of CaM mRNA was dose-dependent and highly specific for glucocorticoids, as other steroids were unable to elicit the response. A stringent cell specificity was also observed. Pretreatment of WEHI7.2 lymphocytes with cycloheximide did not interfere with dexamethasone-dependent increases in CaM mRNA levels, and studies with actinomycin D demonstrated that the stability of the transcript was not altered by hormone, Finally, a calmodulin inhibitor elicited a protective effect on WEHI7.2 cells following glucocorticoid exposure. These results indicate that CaM mRNA levels were hormonally controlled in WEHI7.2 lymphocytes and support the putative involvement of CaM in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1483040869,"We have used proteolytic fragments and overlapping synthetic peptides to define the domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF) that forms a complex with botrocetin and modulates binding to platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib. Both functions were inhibited by the dimeric 116-kDa tryptic fragment and by its constituent 52/48-kDa subunit, comprising residues 449-728 of mature vWF, but not by the dimeric fragment III-T2 which lacks amino acid residues 512-673. Three synthetic peptides, representing discrete discontinuous sequences within the region lacking in fragment III-T2, inhibited vWF-botrocetin complex formation; they corresponded to residues 539-553, 569-583, and 629-643. The 116-kDa domain, with intact disulfide bonds, exhibited greater affinity for botrocetin than did the reduced and alkylated 52/48-kDa molecule, and both fragments had significantly greater affinity than any of the inhibitory peptides. Thus, conformational attributes, though not strictly required for the interaction, contribute to the optimal functional assembly of the botrocetin-binding site. Accordingly, 125I-labeled botrocetin bound to vWF and to the 116-kDa fragment immobilized onto nitrocellulose but not to equivalent amounts of the reduced and alkylated 52/48-kDa fragment; it also bound to the peptide 539-553, but only when the peptide was immobilized onto nitrocellulose at a much greater concentration than vWF or the proteolytic fragments. These studies demonstrate that vWF interaction with GP Ib may be modulated by botrocetin binding to a discontinuous site located within residues 539-643. The finding that single point mutations in Type IIB von Willebrand disease are located in the same region of the molecule supports the concept that this domain may contain regulatory elements that modulate vWF affinity for platelets at sites of vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1566760837,"We show that the structure and/or sequence of the first three base pairs at the end of the amino acid acceptor stem of Escherichia coli initiator tRNA and the discriminator base 73 are important for its formylation by E. coli methionyl-tRNA transformylase. This conclusion is based on mutagenesis of the E. coli initiator tRNA gene followed by measurement of kinetic parameters for formylation of the mutant tRNAs in vitro and function in protein synthesis in vivo. The first base pair found at the end of the amino acid acceptor stem in all other tRNAs is replaced by a C.A. mismatch in E. coli initiator tRNA. Mutation of this C.A. to U:A, a weak base pair, or U.G., a mismatch, has little effect on formylation, whereas mutation to C:G, a strong base pair, has a dramatic effect lowering Vmax/Kappm by 495-fold. Mutation of the second basepair G2:C71 to U2:A71 lowers Vmax/Kappm by 236-fold. Replacement of the third base-pair C3:G70 by U3:A70, A3:U70, or G3:C70 lowers Vmax/Kappm by about 67-, 27-, and 30-fold, respectively. Changes in the rest of the acceptor stem, dihydrouridine stem, anticodon stem, anticodon sequence, and T psi C stem have little or no effect on formylation."
https://openalex.org/W1513270228,"The response of the membrane-associated carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) from Rhodospirillum rubrum to solubilization by detergents and organic solvents, the properties of solubilized CODH, and the mechanism for coupling CO oxidation to hydrogen evolution via a CO-induced hydrogenase activity have been investigated. The release of CODH by a variety of ionic and nonionic detergents occurs in a redox-dependent fashion: CODH is solubilized in the presence of low-potential reductants (dithionite, CO, and H2) but is resistant to solubilization from membranes prepared in the absence of reductant or membranes prepared in the presence of reductant and subsequently dye-oxidized. This redox-dependent response to detergent solubilization has been exploited to release CODH from the membranes in a purified state. CODH can also be solubilized from deoxycholate-washed membranes in a redox-independent manner with 20% ethanol. CODH solubilized by deoxycholate or ethanol, when purified to homogeneity by the protocol previously described for heat-solubilized CODH (Bonam, D., and Ludden, P. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2980-2987), is associated with a previously unobserved 22-kDa protein. The 22-kDa protein can be dissociated from CODH with acetonitrile and can be reconstituted with CODH, after removal of acetonitrile, in a stoichiometric (1:1) fashion. The isolated 22-kDa protein contained 4.0 iron atoms, a reducible Fe-S center, and was O2- and heat-labile. The 22-kDa protein did not alter the catalytic properties of CODH as assayed in vitro with methyl viologen as the electron acceptor for CO oxidation, but was required for reconstituting CO oxidation to hydrogen evolution via the CO-induced membrane-bound hydrogenase. Other electron carrier proteins (ferredoxins and flavodoxin) were ineffective at coupling CO oxidation and hydrogen evolution. We conclude that the 22-kDa protein is a reversibly dissociable subunit of CODH tha mediates electron transfer to hydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1498386347,"The relationships between agonist-sensitive calcium pools and those discharged by the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin were studied in intact bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells and a subcellular adrenocortical membrane fraction. In Fura-2-loaded glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II (AII) stimulated a rapid increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) followed by a smaller plateau phase that was dependent on extra-cellular Ca2+. In such cells thapsigargin caused a sustained and dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i which was diminished in Ca(2+)-deficient medium. The contribution of an influx component to the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i response was demonstrated by measurement of 45Ca influx rate in glomerulosa cells. Thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry was significantly less than that evoked by AII, and its kinetics were similar to those of the concomitant increase in [Ca2+]i. The rate of emptying of the agonist-responsive Ca2+ pool after thapsigargin treatment, as indicated by the progressive decrease in the size of the AII-induced Ca2+ transient, showed a rapid initial (t1/2 = 1.7 min) component that accounted for about 80% of the response and a slowly decreasing phase with t1/2 = 112 min. The latter thapsigargin-resistant component was abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment with AII dose-dependently attenuated but did not abolish the subsequent Ca2+ response to thapsigargin and also increased the rate of the Ca2+ rise induced by thapsigargin. In bovine adrenocortical microsomes, thapsigargin inhibited the ATP-dependent filling of Ca2+ pools and caused a dose-dependent rise in extravesicular Ca2+ levels when added to previously loaded microsomes. The thapsigargin-releasable Ca2+ pool in adrenal microsomes was larger than the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-sensitive Ca2+ pool but only slightly greater than the GTP-releasable pool. Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced Ca2+ release was reduced markedly when ATP-dependent Ca2+ loading of the microsomes was prevented by prior addition of thapsigargin. However, the subsequent Ca2+ response to Ins(1,4,5)P3 was consistently better preserved after the addition of thapsigargin to microsomes preloaded with Ca2+. This difference suggests that although Ca2+ uptake by the Ins(1,4,5)P3-responsive pool is also sensitive to thapsigargin, once filled, this pool shows a slower passive leakage than other thapsigargin-sensitive pools. These findings indicate that thapsigargin increases [Ca2+]i by inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into multiple intracellular Ca2+ pools and by also promoting entry of extracellular Ca2+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1587876647,"We have previously reported that fatty acid synthase mRNA levels increase 10-15-fold during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to adipocytes, correlating well with the increase in the relative rate of synthesis for this enzyme. Here we show by transcription run-on assays that fatty acid synthase is highly transcribed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes. Furthermore, the transcription rate of the fatty acid synthase gene increased only 1.5-fold during the adipose conversion, whereas the apparent mRNA half-life increased from 2.5 h in preadipocytes to approximately 20 h in adipocytes. These results indicate that the increase in mRNA level during adipose conversion is not only due to the transcriptional activation of this gene but reflects the post-transcriptional stabilization of the message in adipocytes compared to preadipocytes. As thyroid hormone has been reported to increase lipogenic enzyme activities including fatty acid synthase in adipose tissue and in differentiating adipocytes in vitro, we used fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to study T3 regulation of mammalian fatty acid synthase expression. We measured the effect of T3 on the relative rate of protein synthesis, mRNA content, and transcription rate of this gene. When mature adipocytes were treated with 10 nM T3, the relative rate of synthesis of fatty acid synthase increased 1.9-fold at 6 h, and it reached a maximum of 2.9-fold at 12 h. In addition, Northern blot analysis showed that T3 increased the steady-state mRNA level for fatty acid synthase by 2.4-fold at 12 h and 4.5-fold at 24 h. Furthermore, run-on transcription analysis with isolated nuclei from cells treated with T3 showed that the transcription rate of the fatty acid synthase gene increased 4.1-fold after 6 h of T3 treatment and remained at the stimulated level for 24 h. These results demonstrate that the increase in transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene preceded that of the steady-state mRNA level, indicating that T3 regulates expression of fatty acid synthase primarily by modulating the transcription rate of the gene. In conclusion, while the differentiation-dependent increase in fatty acid synthase is mediated by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes, T3 regulation is primarily at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1540063665,"We describe the effect of mutations in the acceptor stem of Escherichia coli initiator tRNA on its function in vivo. The acceptor stem mutations were coupled to mutations in the anticodon sequence from CAU----CUA to allow functional studies on the mutant tRNAs in initiation and in elongation in vivo. We show that, with one exception, there is a good correlation between the kinetic parameters for formylation of the mutant tRNAs in vitro (preceding paper, Lee, C.P., Seong, B. L., and RajBhandary, U.L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18012-18017) and their activity in initiation in vivo. These results suggest an important role for formylation of initiator tRNA in its function in initiation, at least when it is aminoacylated with glutamine as is the case with the mutant tRNAs used here. Mutant tRNAs that have a base pair between nucleotides 1 and 72 at the top of the acceptor stem function as elongators, as analyzed by their ability to suppress an amber mutation in the E. coli beta-galactosidase gene. One of these mutants is also quite active in initiation. Thus, activities of a tRNA in initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis are not mutually exclusive. Using a mRNA with two in frame UAG codons, we show that this mutant tRNA can both initiate protein synthesis from the upstream UAG and suppress the down-stream UAG. We discuss the potential use of tRNAs with such dual functions in tightly regulated expression of genes for proteins in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1511106709,"An extracellular lipase catalyzing the synthesis of macrocyclic lactones in anhydrous organic solvents was purified to homogeneity from Pseudomonas nov. sp. 109, and characterized. The lipase showed a pI of 5.3 on isoelectric focusing and a Mr of 29,000 +/- 1,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With respect to substrate specificity, optimum chain length for acyl moiety varied depending on the type of reaction catalyzed: C18 in monomer lactone formation, C11 or shorter in dimer lactone formation, and C8 in ester hydrolysis. The amino-terminal 19 amino acid residues of the purified lipase were determined as Ser-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Gln-Thr-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Leu-Ala-His-Gly-Met-Leu-Gly- Phe, and the gene encoding the lipase was identified by hybridization to a synthetic 20-nucleotide probe, cloned, and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis predicted a 311-amino acid open reading frame, a putative ribosome-binding site, and a 26-amino acid sequence at the amino terminus of the sequence that is not found in the mature protein. This 26-amino acid sequence has many of the characteristics common to known signal peptides. The lipase gene encoded a sequence of Val-Asn-Leu-Ile-Gly-His-Ser-His-Gly-Gly which is very well conserved among lipases, and showed 38-40% overall homology to the amino acid sequences of lipases from Pseudomonas fragie and Pseudomonas cepacia, but showed little homology to those of other lipases, suggesting that some structural features are required for catalyzing macrocyclic lactone synthesis in organic solvents and are restricted to lipases of the Pseudomonas origin."
https://openalex.org/W1592215057,"Mercury resistance operons (mer) from transposons Tn21, Tn501, and plasmid pDU1358 are highly homologous and inducible with Hg2+. The regulatory gene merR is transcribed from one promoter, which is divergently oriented from the promoter for the other mer genes. MerR, the product of the regulatory gene, negatively regulates its own expression as well as the expression of the other genes. MerR activates transcription of the operon in the presence of inducing concentrations of Hg2+. The most promoter distal gene, merD, which is cotranscribed with the structural genes, down regulates the mer operon. A frame-shift mutation in merD, created by deletion of 3 bp and an insertion of a 16 bp sequence upstream of the major inverted repeats present at the 3' end of the merD sequence, resulted in increased synthesis of the structural gene transcript and higher level of resistance to Hg2+ by a factor of about 2. MerD protein was over-produced using a T7 expression system. The overproduced protein was present in the pellet fraction, when cell lysates were centrifuged at a low speed. Approximately 80% pure MerD protein was recovered from the pellet fraction by extracting with a buffer solution containing 5 M urea. The purified protein migrated as a 13,500 molecular weight protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence corresponded to that deduced from the DNA sequence of merD. MerD bound specifically with the mer promoter sequence. DNase I footprinting experiments identified a common mer operator sequence for MerR and MerD."
https://openalex.org/W1486087230,"Carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (CBP35), also known as the macrophage surface antigen Mac-2, is a lactosamine-specific lectin whose extracellular properties include the ability to agglutinate cells and to bind avidly to the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. Although these and other properties would be facilitated by dimerization of this lectin, previous studies have argued against multimeric forms of this protein. We report here that macrophage CBP35, purified by laminin affinity chromatography, exists as several distinct species (Mr 35,000, 67,000, and 80,000) when analyzed under non-reducing conditions. This unexpected finding prompted us to study the biochemistry of multimerization using recombinant CBP35 (rCBP35). rCBP35 expressed in Escherichia coli forms disulfide-linked homodimers (Mr 67,000). The dimeric form of CBP35 binds to laminin with higher affinity than does monomer and by a lactosamine-dependent mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that cysteine 186, the single cysteine residue in CBP35, is required for dimerization. These results raise the possibility that homo- and heterodimeric forms of CBP35 contribute to its postulated functions in cell-matrix interactions and growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1481094744,"Astrocytes can be induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. This study was undertaken to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways involved in IFN-gamma induction of class II MHC. We examined the effects of Na+/H+ antiporter and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors on class II expression and Na+ influx in astrocytes. We found that amiloride and ethyl isopropylamiloride, inhibitors of Na+/H+ exchange, blocked IFN-gamma-induced class II gene expression. IFN-gamma stimulated Na+ influx, and this increased influx was inhibited by amiloride. Treatment of astrocytes with the PKC inhibitor H7 also blocked the increase in Na+ uptake induced by IFN-gamma, indicating that IFN-gamma-induced PKC activation is required for subsequent Na+ influx. IFN-gamma treatment produced an increase of total PKC activity, which was associated with a rapid translocation of PKC activity from cytosolic to particulate fraction. H7 and another PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, inhibited IFN-gamma-induced class II gene expression. However, 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate, a potent PKC activator, did not affect class II expression. Taken together, our data indicate that both IFN-gamma-induced PKC activation and Na+ influx are required for class II MHC expression in astrocytes but that activation of PKC alone is not sufficient for ultimate expression of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1514849167,"To investigate the role of peptide backbone conformation on the biological activity of chemotactic peptides, we synthesized a unique analog of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-OH incorporating the C alpha,alpha disubstituted residue, dipropylglycine (Dpg) in place of Leu. The conformation of the stereochemically constrained Dpg analog was examined in the crystalline state by x-ray diffraction and in solution using NMR, IR, and CD methods. The secretagogue activity of the peptide on human neutrophils was determined and compared with that of a stereochemically constrained, folded type II beta-turn analog incorporating 1-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Ac6c) at position 2 (f-Met-Ac6c-Phe-OMe), the parent peptide (f-Met-Leu-Phe-OH) and its methyl ester derivative (f-Met-Leu-Phe-OMe). In the solid state, the Dpg analog adopts an extended beta-sheet-like structure with an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the NH and CO groups of the Dpg residue, thereby forming a fully extended (C5) conformation at position 2. The phi and psi values for Met and Phe residues are significantly lower than the values expected for an ideal antiparallel beta conformation causing a twist in the extended backbone both at the N and C termini. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggest the presence of a significant population of the peptide molecules in an extended antiparallel beta conformation and the involvement of Dpg NH in a C5 intramolecular hydrogen bond in solutions of deuterated chloroform and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide. IR studies provide evidence for the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the molecule and the antiparallel extended conformation in chloroform solution. CD spectra in methanol, trifluoroethanol, and trimethyl phosphate indicate that the Dpg peptide shows slight conformational flexibility, whereas the folded Ac6c analog is quite rigid. The extended Dpg peptide consistently shows the highest activity in human peripheral blood neutrophils, being approximately 8 and 16 times more active than the parent peptide and the folded Ac6c analog, respectively. However, the finding that all four peptides have ED50 (the molar concentration of peptide to induce half-maximal enzyme release) values in the 10(-8)-10(-9) M range suggests that an induced fit mechanism may indeed be important in this ligand-receptor interaction. Moreover, it is also possible that alterations in the backbone conformation at the tripeptide level may not significantly alter the side chain topography and/or the accessibility of key functional groups important for interaction with the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1552336169,"After binding, the protein toxins ricin, abrin, and modeccin are endocytosed and processed through the cell's vesicular system in a poorly understood fashion, prior to translocation to the cytosol. The role of the Golgi apparatus in toxin processing was studied using brefeldin-A (BFA), a fungal metabolite which blocks Golgi function. At concentrations that inhibit secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2), BFA blocks ricin, modeccin, and abrin intoxication of a lymphocyte derived cell line (Jurkat). Paradoxically, BFA enhances the toxicity of two ricin A-chain immunotoxins targeted against distinct cell surface determinants. BFA concentrations which are optimal for immunotoxin enhancement are below those needed to affect ricin intoxication or IL-2 secretion. BFA blockade of ricin does not involve effects on ricin endocytosis, toxin translocation to the cytosol, or the enzymatic activity of toxin A-chain. In contrast, BFA has no effect on immunotoxin processing but does enhance the immunotoxin translocation step. It is concluded that: 1) intact Golgi function is required for holotoxin processing. 2) Intact Golgi function is not required for holotoxin translocation. 3) Golgi function is tightly linked to immunotoxin translocation. 4) BFA has effects on vesicular routing in addition to the block of Golgi function in secretion which has been reported."

Using these antibodies in immunohistochemical experiments, metabolite binding was localized to the damaged areas of the proximal tubule after treatment of male rats with TFEC. Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions of rat kidney tissue after in vivo treatment with TFEC revealed a high specificity for binding of metabolites to proteins of the mitochondrial fraction. These proteins may represent target molecules which play a role in cysteine conjugate induced nephrotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1543804839,"The bacteriophage T4 motA protein is required for transcription from T4 middle promoters. These promoters, which contain the Escherichia coli promoter consensus sequence at the -10 region (TATAAT) but a unique sequence centered at -30 ((a/t)(a/t)TGCTT(t/c)A) (Guild, N., Gayle, M., Sweeney, R., Hollingsworth, T., Modeer, T., and Gold, L. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 199, 241-258), become active about 2 min after infection, a time when the host RNA polymerase has been modified by phage proteins. This paper shows that motA protein binds to a T4 middle promoter in vitro and that the addition of the motA protein allows in vitro transcription from this promoter by T4-modified RNA polymerase. The T4 motA gene was cloned into a multicopy plasmid that complemented T4 motA mutants in vivo. MotA protein, partially purified from cells containing a motA+ plasmid, specifically retarded the electrophoretic mobility of an oligomer containing the T4 middle promoter located 195 bases upstream of uvsX (PuvsX). RNA polymerase isolated from infected cells during T4 middle gene expression supported in vitro transcription from PuvsX only when fractions containing the motA protein were added. In contrast, unmodified host RNA polymerase catalyzed the synthesis of minor amounts of RNA from PuvsX, but this synthesis was not motA dependent. Thus, the in vitro transcription system described here provides the basis for a detailed study of the phage and host factors needed to regulate T4 middle gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1599165373,"Human S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase is synthesized as a 38-kDa proenzyme that is autocatalytically cleaved, forming the covalently attached pyruvate cofactor and the two subunits (67 and 267 amino acid residues) of the mature enzyme. Both the cleavage reaction and the catalytic activity of the mature enzyme are stimulated by putrescine. Using site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro transcription followed by translation of the resultant RNA in a cellfree system, we have examined the importance of several amino acid residues on the processing reaction rate and catalytic activity and on stimulation of each of these by putrescine. Changing Cys82 to Ala decreased the stimulatory effect of putrescine on processing and completely eliminated catalytic activity, indicating a probable role in the active site of the enzyme, whereas changing Cys49 or Cys226 to Ala had minimal effects on processing and activity or the putrescine stimulation of either. Since Cys49 is the only cysteine residue in the smaller subunit, this indicates that disulfide-bond formation between the two subunits cannot be necessary for maintenance of the conformation for proenzyme processing or catalytic activity. Changing Glu8 or Glu11 to Gln produced an AdoMet decarboxylase that processed, but was catalytically inactive. Mutation at Glu11 also completely eliminated the putrescine stimulation of proenzyme processing, as did double mutation at Glu8 and Glu11, whereas the single mutation at Glu8 had no effect on the putrescine stimulation of proenzyme processing. Changing Glu15, Glu61, Glu67, Glu247, or Glu247 and Glu249 to Gln had a minimal effect on processing and activity or putrescine stimulation of either. These results demonstrate a role for the smaller subunit in the catalytic activity of the mature AdoMet decarboxylase enzyme and show that Glu8, Glu11, and Cys82 are essential for catalytic activity, with Glu11 also being essential for the putrescine stimulation of AdoMet decarboxylase proenzyme processing."
https://openalex.org/W1547774078,"Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells spontaneously form structures in vitro that resemble capillary-like cords or tubes. This process is associated with changes in the expression of certain extracellular matrix proteins that include type I collagen. BAE cells exhibiting angiogenesis in vitro were transfected with plasmids containing either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or human growth hormone genes directed by promoter sequences from the human alpha 1(I)-collagen gene. Immunostaining for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase demonstrated that collagen promoter activity was restricted to cells involved in the formation of endothelial cords. In comparison to transfected monolayers of BAE cells, the transcriptional activity of the alpha 1(I)-collagen promoter increased by 7-fold in cultures undergoing angiogenesis in vitro. The selective ability of angiogenic endothelium to utilize the alpha 1(I)-collagen promoter is consistent with previous studies showing high levels of alpha 1(I)-collagen mRNA in BAE cells actively engaged in the formation of tubes (Iruela-Arispe, L., Hasselaar, P., and Sage, H. (1991) Lab. Invest. 64, 174-186). We conclude that transcriptional activation of the alpha 1(I)-collagen gene is closely linked to the morphologic alterations in cellular phenotype that accompany the transition of quiescent endothelial monolayers to the angiogenic state."
https://openalex.org/W1604849883,"The activation of gene transcription by nuclear receptors is invariably associated with alterations in chromatin structure at hormone-responsive elements of target genes. To identify the molecular functions underlying receptor-mediated chromatin structure alterations we have evaluated the effects of DNA binding and transactivation of estrogen receptor derivatives on the promoter chromatin structure of estrogen-responsive reporter minichromosomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We report here that the DNase I-hypersensitive chromatin structure at the promoter region is not simply a consequence of estrogen receptor binding to estrogen-responsive elements but is greatly enhanced by transactivation functions. These chromatin structure alterations are dependent on the presence of more than one estrogen-responsive element as well as downstream promoter sequences and appear to be correlated with transcriptional competence of the promoter. Our results imply that a disruption of chromatin structure at promoters is associated with the establishment of active transcription complexes. Since RNA polymerase cannot initiate transcription on nucleosomal DNA in vitro (Lorch, Y., Lapointe, J.W., and Kornberg, R.D. (1987) Cell 49, 203-210) this local disruption of chromatin structure may represent a nucleosome-free window, allowing initiation to occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501858216,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a multifunctional polypeptide that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of various types of animal cells. TGF-beta 1 stimulated glucose uptake and the expression of a brain-type glucose transporter (GLUT1) mRNA in quiescent mouse 3T3 cells. TGF-beta 1 also synergistically stimulated these activities when given together with calf serum, phorbol ester, fibroblast growth factor, or epidermal growth factor. The increases in glucose uptake and the GLUT1 mRNA level were induced by picomolar concentrations of TGF-beta 1 within 3 h of stimulation, reached a peak between 6 and 9 h, and then decreased gradually to basal levels before an increase in DNA synthesis. The stimulation of GLUT1 mRNA expression was completely abolished by actinomycin D, but was not affected by cycloheximide, suggesting that new protein synthesis was not required for the expression of GLUT1 mRNA. TGF-beta 1 had little mitogenic activity and did not affect serum-induced DNA synthesis in quiescent 3T3 cells. However, it stimulated DNA synthesis synergistically when given with fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester, or insulin. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 mediates the stimulation of glucose uptake, GLUT1 mRNA expression, and DNA synthesis via a pathway(s) and cellular components distinct from those for other growth factors. The possible role of the TGF-beta 1-induced stimulation of glucose transport activity in the control of mouse fibroblast proliferation is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537265329,"We have determined the primary structure of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) of the striated adductor muscle of the scallop Aequipecten irradians by cloning and sequencing its cDNA. It is the first heavy chain sequence obtained in a directly Ca(2+)-regulated myosin. The 1938-amino acid sequence has an overall structure similar to other MHCs. The subfragment-1 region of the scallop MHC has a 59-62% sequence identity with sarcomeric and a 52-53% identity with nonsarcomeric (smooth and metazoan nonmuscle) MHCs. The heavy chain component of the regulatory domain (Kwon, H., Goodwin, E. B., Nyitray, L., Berliner, E., O'Neall-Hennessey, E., Melandri, F. D., and Szent-Gyorgyi, A. G. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 4771-4775) starts at either Leu-755 or Val-760. Ca(2+)-sensitive Trp residues (Wells, C., Warriner, K. E., and Bagshaw, C. R. (1985) Biochem. J. 231, 31-38) are located near the C-terminal end of this segment (residues 818-827). More detailed sequence comparison with other MHCs reveals that the 50-kDa domain and the N-terminal two-thirds of the 20-kDa domain differ substantially between sarcomeric and nonsarcomeric myosins. In contrast, in the light chain binding region of the regulatory domain (residues 784-844) the scallop sequence shows greater homology with regulated myosins (smooth muscle, nonmuscle, and invertebrate striated muscles) than with unregulated ones (vertebrate skeletal and heart muscles). The N-terminal 25-kDa domain also contains several residues which are preserved only in regulated myosins. These results indicate that certain heavy chain sites might be critical for regulation. The rod has features typical of sarcomeric myosins. It is 52-60% and 30-33% homologous with sarcomeric and nonsarcomeric MHCs, respectively. A Ser-rich tailpiece (residues 1918-1938) is apparently nonhelical."
https://openalex.org/W1517566133,"We have established an in vitro assay to characterize the binding of endocytic carrier vesicles to microtubules. Magnetic beads coated with microtubules were used as an affinity matrix. A fraction from nocodazole-treated cells enriched in endocytic carrier vesicles, labeled with internalized horseradish peroxidase, was used in the binding experiments. Binding of the endocytic carrier vesicles to microtubules in vitro was cytosol-dependent. This activity of cytosolic factors was saturable, heat-sensitive, and insensitive to N-ethyl-maleimide. Binding was sensitive to GTP and ATP. Addition of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins completely abolished binding of the endocytic organelles to microtubules. This binding was independent of the cytosolic microtubule-based motor proteins kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, since cytosol depleted of these proteins remained fully active. Microtubule-binding proteins from HeLa cells, however, stimulated the interaction of endocytic carrier vesicles with microtubules. Trypsinized vesicles could no longer bind to microtubules in the presence of cytosol. These results suggest that cytosolic microtubule-binding proteins, other than the known microtubule-based motor proteins, as well as membrane proteins are involved in the nucleotide-dependent interaction of endocytic carrier vesicles with microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1571814996,"Creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) (CK) isoenzymes are crucial to energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy requirements. Nuclear genes encode four known CK subunits: cytoplasmic muscle, cytoplasmic brain, ubiquitous mitochondrial (uMtCK), and sarcomeric mitochondrial (sMtCK). Herein, we report the isolation and complete structural characterization of the human sMtCK gene. It contains 11 exons and encompasses more than 37 kilobase pairs (kb). The sites of exon localization in the sMtCK-coding region and their precise sizes are identical with the human uMtCK gene. The translation start codon is in the third exon and lies 17 kb from the transcription start site. The human sMtCK gene is located on chromosome 5. Sequence analysis of the sMtCK genomic upstream sequences reveals a typical TATAA box within the 80 base pairs (bp) that, by transfection experiments, are sufficient to promote expression of chimeric plasmids with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter. Cis-acting sequences in a fragment containing 3360 bp of upstream sequence, the first exon, and 750 bp of the first intron are sufficient to mediate tissue-specific expression. However, these sequences only partially regulate induction of sMtCK expression in differentiating mouse myoblasts. MEF1/MYOD and MEF2 sequence motifs present in the sMtCK gene are not sufficient to regulate differentiation-specific expression. The sMtCK gene contains sequences homologous to several motifs that are shared among some nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and that may be essential for the coordinated activation of these genes during mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1536897708,"Higher plant tissues contain two alpha-glucan phosphorylase isozymes (EC 2.4.1.1), types L and H, localized in the plastid and the cytoplasm, respectively. We already isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone encoding the type L isozyme. Presently, a cDNA clone encoding the type H counterpart was isolated from a cDNA library of immature potato tuber by plaque hybridization, using two oligonucleotide probes synthesized based on the partial amino acid sequences of the type H isozyme. The message encodes a polypeptide of 838 amino acid residues. Sequence comparison of the two potato tuber phosphorylase isozymes revealed two major distinctions; the type L isozyme contains a 78-residue insertion in the middle of the polypeptide chain as well as a 50-residue amino-terminal extension. Except for these extra portions, the two isozyme sequences show an identity of 63%. The entire structural gene for the type H isozyme was inserted 3'-downstream of the strong T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the expression plasmid pET-3b. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying this plasmid produced active phosphorylase upon induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside at 22 degrees C. The expression is entirely dependent on the temperature; the bacteria did not produce a detectable amount of the active enzyme at 37 degrees C. Addition of pyridoxine to the culture medium was effective for the enzyme production."
https://openalex.org/W1511836859,"Abstract Nine unmodified endotoxin preparations constituted of Re-, Rd-, and Rc-type lipopolysaccharides (2 to 5 glycoses), representing four species of enterobacteria were analyzed by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry. The constituent lipopolysaccharides were characterized by the ion pair: (M-H)- and its corresponding lipid fragment ion. The lipid fragment ion is produced by cleavage of the glycosidic bond of the 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid unit that substitutes O-6' of the glucosamin beta 1'-6glucosamine (lipid A backbone) disaccharide of the lipid A moiety. These lipid fragment ions were identical to the (M-H)- ions seen in the spectra of homologous isolated lipid A preparations that were obtained by hydrolysis (pH 4.5, 100 degrees C) promoted by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Since the molecular components present in the endotoxin preparations analyzed are known, the ion pair (M-H)(-)-lipid fragment ion defines the molecular compositions of each individual lipopolysaccharide. Heterogeneity of the R-type endotoxin preparations analyzed was due almost exclusively to differing lipid A moieties. In three Salmonella minnesota 595 Re endotoxin preparations 10 different lipopolysaccharides were identified, only two of which were common to all three preparations. Of the nine lipopolysaccharides identified in two S. minnesota R7 endotoxin preparations, only two were present in both."
https://openalex.org/W1561931819,"The involvement of a histidyl residue in the catalytic mechanism of thioesterase II, a serine active-site enzyme that catalyzes the chain terminating reaction in de novo fatty acid synthesis, has been inferred from studies with the inhibitor diethyl pyrocarbonate. Its likely location has been predicted by identification of conserved residues in related thioesterases and ultimately confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivated the enzyme with a second-order rate constant of 49 M-1 s-1 at pH 6, 10 degrees C. Data analysis indicated that although several residues reacted with the reagent, modification of a single residue was responsible for the inactivation. Removal of a single ethoxycarbonyl moiety by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine completely restored enzyme activity. Prior ethoxycarbonylation of the histidyl residue blocked the ability of the active-site serine to react with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of five structurally related proteins indicated that only 1 histidine has been completely conserved. Replacement of this residue in rat thioesterase II (His-237) with arginine and leucine by mutagenesis reduced the catalytic activity by 2-3 orders of magnitude. The activity of the mutant thioesterases, unlike that of the wild-type enzyme, was relatively insensitive to inhibition by diethyl pyrocarbonate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. These studies provide strong evidence that His-237 is involved directly in catalysis and suggest that its role is to increase the nucleophilic character of the active-site Ser-101 by acting as a proton acceptor thus facilitating acylation of the seryl residue. The mechanism appears to share certain common features with the charge-relay system characteristic of other esterases."
https://openalex.org/W1858299364,"BioBreeding (BB) rats are derived from an outbred colony of Wistar rats and are used as a model of autoimmune diabetes mellitus. A corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) variant with reduced affinity for glucocorticoids has now been found in the blood of these animals. The dissociation rate constants of BB CBG for cortisol (4.42 nM) and corticosterone (1.43 nM) are both about 50% higher than those associated with Wistar CBG, but no obvious difference in the steroid binding specificity of BB and Wistar CBGs was detected. Purified BB and Wistar CBGs exhibit the same size heterogeneity when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and the sizes of their respective hepatic mRNAs are identical. The genetic basis for this abnormality was therefore determined by comparing the cDNA sequences for BB and Wistar CBG, and this revealed a point mutation that results in a single amino acid substitution at residue 276 (Ile in BB CBG and Met in Wistar CBG). To confirm that this mutation is responsible for the reduced steroid binding affinity associated with BB CBG, the cDNAs for rat CBG-Ile276 and CBG-Met276 were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The steroid binding affinities of the CBGs secreted by these cells were essentially identical with those observed in the corresponding serum samples from these two rat strains. The amino acid substitution identified in BB rat CBG therefore clearly accounts for the reduction in its steroid binding affinity, and further analysis of this and other natural CBG variants may reveal important information about the CBG steroid binding site. It is also possible that this mutation may contribute to the etiology of pathological abnormalities that are characteristic of the BB rat."
https://openalex.org/W1492607760,"Abstract An expression vector encoding wild type or mutated forms of the rabbit progesterone receptor was transfected into COS-7 cells and phosphorylation was studied by incubation with 32Pi followed by specific immunoprecipitation. The features of phosphorylation of the wild type receptor were identical to those previously observed in uterine cells: there was a basal level of phosphorylation which was increased approximately 7-fold by incubation with the hormone. The hyperphosphorylated receptor had decreased electrophoretic mobility (upshift). These experiments thus showed that the presence of the receptor specific kinase is not restricted to the target cells. Cleavage of the receptor by hydroxylamine and cyanogen bromide, and use of receptor mutants deleted in the N-terminal region, showed the absence of any detectable phosphorylation downstream from amino acid 520 (thus in the DNA and steroid binding domains). The majority of the phosphorylation sites were localized between amino acids 166 and 520. This localization was similar for basal and hormone-induced phosphorylation. DNA binding and hormone-induced hyperphosphorylation were not directly related, since deletion of the first zinc finger provided a hyperphosphorylated receptor. We showed that the constitutive receptor (totally deleted in the steroid binding region) exhibited only a low basal level of phosphorylation, and antagonist RU 486-receptor complexes were found to be hyperphosphorylated, leading us to conclude that the active form of the receptor was not the hyperphosphorylated one. Moreover receptor down regulation and hormone-induced receptor hyperphosphorylation were two independent phenomena. Basal phosphorylation was observed for both cytoplasmic and nuclear mutants, whereas nuclear localization was necessary but not sufficient for hyperphosphorylation. Finally, the second finger region and the hormone binding domain, which are necessary for receptor hyperphosphorylation, may be involved in the hormonally induced increased affinity of the receptor toward its kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1520011494,"Previous reports have shown that thrombin and activators of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibit neurite outgrowth (NOG) in neuroblastoma cells cultured in serum-free medium. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that PKC activation mediates the effect of thrombin on NOG in murine neuroblastoma NB-2a cells. After 2 h in serum-free medium, 70% of the cells displayed neurites; addition of 300 ng/ml thrombin reduced NOG to 24% within 1 h. This inhibition was reduced after NB-2a cells were pretreated for 24 h with 200 nM phorbol dibutyrate down-regulate PKC. Thrombin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited NOG in an additive way and the protein kinase inhibitors H-7, H-8, and HA1004 reversed the effect of thrombin on NOG with a rank order of activity consistent with PKC inhibition. Furthermore, PKC was translocated from the cytosol to a membrane-bound form 5 to 10 min after addition of thrombin. These findings indicate that thrombin inhibits NOG through a PKC-dependent pathway. Thrombin stimulates the synthesis of the phospholipid platelet-activating factor (PAF) in some cells. However, NOG was markedly stimulated when PAF or its analogue carbamyl-PAF were added to NB-2a cells in medium with serum. Furthermore, the PAF receptor antagonist SRI 63072 inhibited NOG in NB-2a cells in serum-free medium. These cells accumulated PAF with kinetics similar to that of NOG inducPAF was synthesized by the de novo pathway, as shown by the incorporation of [3H]choline. These findings suggest that PAF is a mediator of NOG in NB-2a cells. Thrombin neither stimulates nor inhibits PAF synthesis in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562195815,"The effect of cellular differentiation on the response of cells to hypoxic stress has been evaluated using the myogenic cell line BC3H1. Aerobic myocytes were predominantly in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and could be induced into S and G2/M of the cell cycle only by replating in high serum-containing medium at subconfluent cell density. In contrast, hypoxic myocytes demonstrated marked progression into S and G2/M upon reoxygenation without replating in the presence of serum. This modulation of myocytes by hypoxia was suggested further by the induction of 100-kDa and 9-kDa proteins (PSP 100 and PSP 9) which were otherwise only detectable in myoblasts. Two-dimensional gel analysis of newly synthesized proteins demonstrated that the five major glucose/oxygen-regulated proteins (GRP/ORP 260, 150, 100, 80, and 33) were induced in hypoxic myogenic cells independent of their state of differentiation. In addition to the GRP/ORPs, synthesis of 20 and 23 other major proteins was influenced in myocytes and myoblasts, respectively. The bulk of these alterations in myoblasts (70%) were inhibitions. In contrast, 75% of the alterations in myocyte protein synthesis were either enhancements or inductions. The data show that hypoxia can modulate the myocyte phenotype and invoke proliferative characteristics. Moreover, the data suggest that ischemia will have a different effect on and prognosis for tissues with a high mitotic index compared with differentiated tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1582620449,"The location of the covalent binding site of the third component of complement (C3) on the IgG heavy chain was determined by sequence analysis of peptides generated by cyanogen bromide digestion of C3-IgG adducts. Activation of the alternative pathway by incubation of heat-aggregated human IgG1 with fresh normal human plasma formed covalent adducts of C3b-IgG. CNBr peptides of these adducts were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and amino-terminal sequences were determined. A 40-kDa dipeptide containing the covalent bond was identified by labeling the free thiol group (generated during activation of the internal thioester of C3b) with iodo[1-14C]acetamide and analyzed by amino acid sequencing. The resulting double sequence suggested an adduct with NH2 termini at residue 938 (pro-C3 numbering) of C3 (75 residues NH2-terminal to the thioester) and residue 84 in the variable region of the IgG heavy chain. These results combined with results from hydroxylamine treatment (splits ester linkage between C3b and IgG) imply that this adduct peptide consists of a 22-kDa C3 fragment and an 18-kDa IgG fragment. Therefore, C3 binds covalently within the region extending from the last 20 residues of the variable region through the first 20 residues of CH2."
https://openalex.org/W1482426117,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that expresses its biological effects by binding to specific membrane receptors. Although the diverse biological properties of this molecule have been characterized extensively the biochemical mechanisms by which extracellular binding events lead to biological responses remain unclear. IL-4 can stimulate the proliferation of several hemopoietic cell types, and we have taken advantage of its ability to induce the growth of leukemic cell lines to investigate the role that protein phosphorylation events might play in IL-4 mitogenic signal transduction. We show that the addition of IL-4 to several leukemic cell lines of different origin causes the rapid dephosphorylation of an 80-kDa phosphoprotein (p80) from tyrosine residues. This event occurs in a dose-responsive manner closely correlating to that of biological activity, and both are blocked by an anti-IL-4-specific antiserum. The ability of sodium orthovanadate to prevent IL-4-induced dephosphorylation of p80 suggests that this event is mediated by a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.48). The importance of the role that tyrosine-specific dephosphorylation plays in mediating IL-4 mitogenic signal transduction is substantiated by the ability of sodium orthovanadate in cell culture to block effectively IL-4-induced proliferation at doses that enhance the proliferation stimulated by either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3."
https://openalex.org/W1515416097,"One-carbon metabolism mediated by folate coenzymes plays an essential role in several major cellular processes. In the prokaryotes studied, three folate-dependent enzymes, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (EC 6.3.4.3), 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.5) generally exist as monofunctional or bifunctional proteins, whereas in eukaryotes the three activities are present on one polypeptide. The structural organization of these enzymes in plants had not previously been examined. We have purified the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity from spinach leaves to homogeneity and raised antibodies to it. The protein was a dimer with a subunit molecular weight of Mr = 67,000. The Km values for the three substrates, (6R)-tetrahydrofolate, ATP, and formate were 0.94, 0.043, and 21.9 mM, respectively. The enzyme required both monovalent and divalent cations for maximum activity. The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase activities of spinach coeluted separately from the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity on a Matrex Green-A column. On the same column, the activities of the yeast trifunctional C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase coeluted. In addition, antibodies raised to the purified spinach protein immunoinactivated and immunoprecipitated only the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity in a crude extract of spinach leaves. These results suggest that unlike the trifunctional form of C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase in the other eukaryotes examined, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase in spinach leaves is monofunctional and 5,10-methyl-enetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase appear to be bifunctional. Although structurally dissimilar to the other eukaryotic trifunctional enzymes, the 35 amino-terminal residues of spinach 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase showed 35% identity with six other tetrahydrofolate synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W1508769426,"One of insulin's least studied actions is its ability to induce DNA synthesis and cell division. In rat H4IIE hepatoma cells insulin, acting through its own receptor, stimulates cell division. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. The proto-oncogene c-myc is a cellular gene which when expressed at abnormal levels is often associated with the process of tumorigenesis. Expression of the normal cellular myc gene may be necessary for growth factor-induced cell cycling. In the present work, insulin was shown to regulate cellular accumulation and transcription of the c-myc gene in rat hepatoma cells. The control of c-myc by insulin was complex, with an initial-induced decrease in c-myc transcription to 50% of control values at 15 and 30 min. This was followed by an increase in transcription of about 3-fold by 60-120 min. Similar to the initial inhibitory effect of insulin, the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide or anisomycin decreased c-myc transcription. However, there was no secondary induction of c-myc transcription by protein synthesis inhibitors. The effects of both insulin and protein synthesis inhibitors were shown to be through alterations in intragenic pausing of transcription of the sense mRNA, not through changes initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1545793117,"1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PLPC) labeled in either the choline, glycerol, palmitate, or linoleate component in reconstituted rat high density lipoprotein (rHDL), was administered by vein to rats with bile fistula and taurocholate infusion. PLPC disappeared from plasma in a monoexponential fashion with a half-life of 50 min. A small fraction, about 14%, of PLPC disappearance was due to removal of linoleate from the sn-2 ester bond to form plasma cholesterol esters, presumably by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Otherwise, nearly all of the PLPC components that disappeared from blood in 1 h were recovered in the liver. The choline, glycerol, and linoleate components appeared predominantly in hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC). These three components remained together in the liver with similar fractions of each in individual PC molecular species, most notably 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-PC and dilinoleoyl-PC as well as PLPC. However, the palmitate component was spread among hepatic triglyceride, free fatty acid, other phospholipids, and all palmitate-containing molecular species of PC. Less than 2% of any administered PLPC component appeared in 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-PC, the major species by mass in the liver. The palmitate component from plasma PLPC appeared in biliary PC at a more rapid rate than glycerol and linoleate components; the latter components appeared in bile in identical fashion. The results show that about two-thirds of plasma PLPC disappearance is due to phospholipase A1 hydrolysis, probably hepatic lipase. The putative produce, 2-linoleoyl-lysoPC, is efficiently reacylated with a saturated fatty acid in the liver, conserving PC."
https://openalex.org/W1565233301,"Abstract We have constructed a plasmid, pLTR100, which contains human interleukin 2 receptor light (IL-2R L) chain cDNA in the inverted orientation relative to the upstream SV40 promoter. The cDNA segment is flanked by the immunoglobulin gene recombination signal sequences so that the cDNA segment can invert and the human IL-2R L chain is subsequently expressed under the control of the SV40 promoter. A murine pre-B cell line, 38B9, transfected with pLTR100 began to express the human IL-2R L chain on the cell surface. The frequency of human IL-2R L chain positive cells increased almost linearly up to 50% for 60 days of culture after transfection. Southern blot analysis and sequencing of the DNA fragments at the recombination junction confirmed that the cDNA segment was inverted in a signal sequence-dependent manner by the variable-diversity-joining recombination process. Transgenic mice bearing the recombination substrate DNA similar to pLTR100 expressed the human IL-2 L chain in the spleen, thymus, and bone marrow, but not in the other tissues examined at the detectable level. Both IgM- and CD3-positive cells expressed the human IL-2R L chain, indicating that this artificial DNA can serve as a substrate for recombination both in B- and T-cells and that another DNA segment may be necessary to confer the cell-type specificity on the substrate DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1557969050,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that the abundance of apoA-I mRNA in liver and intestine correlates with a 2-3-fold species-specific difference in the plasma concentration of high density lipoprotein and apoA-I. In order to determine the role of gene transcription in regulating the tissue, steady state apoA-I mRNA abundance nuclear run-on assays were conducted using nuclei from two species of nonhuman primates. The transcriptional activity expressed as the ratio of apoA-I signal intensity to that for the constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was calculated for seven individual animals in each of the two nonhuman primate species. The African green monkey showed a ratio of 4.18 +/- 0.35, and the cynomolgus monkey showed 2.03 +/- 0.13 (n = 7, p less than 0.004). To identify possible cis-acting elements that may be involved in transcriptional regulation of the apoA-I gene, a portion of the apoA-I regulatory region, corresponding to nucleotides -231 to +263 (where +1 is the start site of transcription), was isolated from both species using the polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of this region was compared between monkey species, as well as with the same region from the apoA-I gene isolated from human genomic DNA. In this region, the African green monkey apoA-I gene showed 95% similarity, whereas the cynomolgus monkey showed 94% similarity to the human sequence. Although a high degree of sequence similarity was observed among all species, numerous sequence specific differences were noted in the first intron between the two primate species and between nonhuman and human primate sequences. Results from studies measuring relative promoter strength indicated that the African green monkey 5'-regulatory region had a consistently higher level of activity (1.4-3.0-fold) than the same region from the cynomolgus monkey. Interestingly, the African green monkey promoter also showed a significantly higher transcriptional activity than the human or rabbit promoter, suggesting the presence of a nonhuman primate specific cis-acting element(s) regulating apoA-I gene expression. These results demonstrate that a portion of the species-specific difference in apoA-I gene expression may be explained by sequence divergence in the 5'-regulatory region including exon/intron 1 of the apoA-I gene."
https://openalex.org/W1540616643,"Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase displays a strict specificity toward its second substrate L-ornithine. After forming a binary complex with carbamoyl phosphate and undergoing an induced-fit isomerization (Miller, A. W., and Kuo, L. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15023-15027), the enzyme selects only the minor, zwitterionic ornithine with an uncharged delta-amino group for transcarbamoylation. Formation of the productive ternary complex is linked to two enzymic ionizations (pK alpha 6.2 approximately 6.3 and 9.1 approximately 9.3) and two ornithine ionizations (pK alpha 8.5 and 10.6) (Kuo, L. C., Herzberg, W., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 4754-4761). To elucidate the mechanism through which substrate specificity is achieved, the binding of L-ornithine to two site-specific point mutants (Arg-57----Gly and Cys-273----Ala) of the enzyme has been examined. For the Gly-57 mutant enzyme, which does not undergo the induced-fit isomerization, affinity for ornithine drops by a factor of 500. The pH profile of the apparent equilibrium constant governing the association of L-ornithine to the binary complex of this mutant reveals that only two enzymic ionizations affect ornithine binding. The ionizations linked to L-ornithine are not detected. Hence, the preisomerized binary complex binds not only poorly but also indiscriminately all ionic species of L-ornithine. For the Ala-273 mutant enzyme, which exhibits the induced-fit isomerization, affinity of the amino acid is decreased by an order of magnitude. Ionizations of L-ornithine to yield a zwitterion for binding are detected in pH analyses for this mutant, but the pK alpha of 6.2 associated with the enzymic deprotonation in the wild type is absent. Therefore, Cys-273 is a binding site of L-ornithine. The D-isomer of ornithine is a very weak, deadend ligand to all three forms of the enzyme with affinities in the millimolar range. Employing the estimated affinities of D- and L-ornithine, the binding stereospecificity of the wild-type and mutant binary complexes toward the amino acid substrate may be evaluated. L-Ornithine binds preferentially over D-ornithine by two and four orders of magnitude in the absence and presence of protein isomerization, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2116762776,"We have developed a three-step cross-linking procedure that is specifically targeted at the carbohydrate on a protein and applied it to CD4 as a model system for studying the role of multivalent interactions in function. In the first step CD4 was oxidized with periodate, creating aldehydes that served as targets for the subsequent chemistry. Next the aldehydes were modified with cystamine, converting the reactive group into a thiol. Finally cross-linking through the thiol moiety was generated with the homobifunctional cross-linker bismaleimidohexane. With this procedure, approximately 60% of the CD4 was converted into higher molecular weight complexes that were soluble and retained function as assessed by glycoprotein gp120 binding activity. CD4 dimers and tetramers by mass were 4 and 15 times as active as CD4 monomer in blocking virus infection with HTLV-IIIB in an in vitro cellular assay. The cross-linking chemistry provides an efficient method for producing homomultimers of a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1596459244,"Abstract In the preceding report we demonstrated that the expression of two developmentally regulated alpha-mannosidase activities is induced in Dictyostelium discoideum during its differentiation from single-cell amoebae to multicellular organism (Sharkey, D. J., and Kornfeld, R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18477-18484). These activities, designated membrane alpha-mannosidase I (MI) and membrane alpha-mannosidase II (MII), were shown to have several properties in common with rat liver Golgi alpha-mannosidases I and II, respectively, suggesting that MI and MII may play a role in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in developing D. discoideum. In this study we analyzed the structures of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides synthesized by D. discoideum at various stages of development to determine the timing and extent of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide processing. Cells were labeled with [2-3H] mannose, and then total cellular glycoproteins were digested with Pronase to generate glycopeptides that were fractionated on concanavalin A-Sepharose. Glycopeptides from each fraction were digested with endoglycosidase H, both before and after desulfation by solvolysis, and the released, neutral oligosaccharides were sized by high pressure liquid chromatography. At early stages of development, D. discoideum contain predominantly large high mannose-type oligosaccharides (Man9GlcNAc and Man8GlcNAc). Some of these are modified by GlcNAc residues attached beta 1-4 to the mannose-linked alpha 1-6 to the beta-linked core mannose (the position), as well as by fucose, sulfate, and phosphate. In contrast, the oligosaccharides found at late stages of development (18-24 h) have an array of sizes from Man9GlcNAc to Man3GlcNAc. These are still modified by GlcNAc, fucose, sulfate, and phosphate, but the percent of larger high mannose oligosaccharides that are modified with GlcNAc in the intersecting position decreases after 6 h of development, in parallel with the decrease in the intersecting GlcNAc transferase activity. Similarly, the changes in the size of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides synthesized during development correlate well with the appearance of MI and MII activities and suggest that these developmentally regulated alpha-mannosidase activities function in the processing of these oligosaccharides. This is supported further by the observation that oligosaccharide processing was inhibited in late stage cells labeled in the presence of either deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of MI, or swainsonine, an inhibitor of MII."
https://openalex.org/W1524855504,"Polymerization of G-actin to F-actin was indicated by an increase in light-scattering intensity after the addition of a heptapeptide (Ile-Arg-Ile-Cys(MT)-Arg-Lys-Gly-OEt), an analog of the actin-binding S-site on S-1 heavy chain. The half-maximal concentration of the heptapeptide which induced an increase in the light-scattering intensity at 25 degrees C was about 110 microM, which was in the range of the dissociation constant of this peptide with F-actin. The polymerization of G-actin to F-actin by binding of the heptapeptide was further demonstrated by ultracentrifugal separation, Pi liberation, and electron microscopy. The polymerization of G-actin was induced only by the heptapeptide, but not by fragments of the heptapeptide. The well known acceleration of polymerization of G-actin by the myosin head may be due to the binding of G-actin with the S-site on the myosin head."
https://openalex.org/W1491365606,"We have previously shown that BDS.1 rat hepatoma cells are hypersensitive to the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids, and secrete a glucocorticoid suppressible mitogenic activity (denoted GSM). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that GSM purified to near homogeneity migrated as a 28-kDa protein under nonreducing conditions and as a single 15-kDa polypeptide in the presence of sulfhydryl reducing agents suggesting a homodimeric structure. Anti-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain specific antibodies selectively immunodepleted the mitogenic activity which can be extracted from nonreducing gels in the 26-30-kDa fraction and, in Western blots, recognized the 15-kDa reduced form of GSM. Western blot analysis further showed that dexamethasone suppressed the level of secreted PDGF A-chain protein in BDS.1 cells but not in glucocorticoid receptor-deficient hepatoma cells. Northern blots revealed that dexamethasone reduced expression of the PDGF A-chain 2.3- and 1.7-kilobase transcripts in proportion to the level of detectable PDGF-AA protein. Similarly to PDGF-AA, the hepatoma cell-derived GSM has a potent angiogenic activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the predominant glucocorticoid suppressible mitogen secreted from rat hepatoma cells is a PDGF A-chain homodimer and suggest that in vivo glucocorticoids may potentially regulate hepatoma growth by modulating PDGF-stimulated tumor vascularization."
https://openalex.org/W1513214279,"Abstract Purified rat liver cytochrome P-450MC or P-450PB was co-reconstituted with epoxide hydrase in liposomal vesicles made of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine at a lipid to protein weight ratio of 5 by the cholate dialysis procedure. Rotational diffusion of the cytochromes was measured by observing the decay of absorption anisotropy, r(t), after photolysis of the heme.CO complex by a vertically polarized laser flash. Analysis of r(t) was based on a rotation-about-membrane-normal model. The measurements were used to investigate interactions of cytochrome P-450MC or P-450PB with epoxide hydrase. Different rotational mobilities of the two cytochromes were observed. The amount of mobile molecules was 78% for cytochrome P-450MC and 91% for P-450PB, and the rest was immobile within the experimental time range of 1 ms. In the presence of epoxide hydrase 85% of cytochrome P-450MC and 96% of P-450PB were mobile. Cross-linking of epoxide hydrase by anti-epoxide hydrase antibodies resulted in a drastic immobilization of the cytochromes, reducing the mobile population to 49% for P-450MC and to 60% for P-450PB. The rotational relaxation times phi of the mobile populations ranged from 210 to 283 microseconds. These results imply that both cytochromes P-450MC and P-450PB transiently associate with epoxide hydrase in liposomal membranes. Further analysis of the data showed that the angle between the heme plane of P-450MC and the membrane is 48 degrees or 62 degrees, different from the value of 55 degrees reported previously for P-450PB (Gut, J., Richter, C., Cherry, R. J., Winterhalter, K. H., and Kawato, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8588-8594)."
https://openalex.org/W1674127279,"alpha 1-Inhibitor III (alpha 1 I3), a broad range plasma proteinase inhibitor, is synthesized with striking tissue specificity in rat livers. The gene is expressed strongly in periportal hepatocytes of healthy adults and less abundantly in regions near the centrilobular vein. This expression pattern is suggestive of a concentration gradient of a blood-borne hormone that enters through the portal vein and diffuses across the lobe toward the centrilobular vein. The alpha 1 I3 gene was known to be regulated both by glucocorticoids and interleukin 6, and therefore the hypothesis was tested that the normal constitutive expression of this gene depended on glucocorticoids. alpha 1 I3 mRNA levels in the livers of hypophysectomized rats with low endogenous glucocorticoid levels were only about 20% of those in control rat livers. Injection of exogenous glucocorticoids reconstituted hepatic alpha 1 I3 mRNA levels up to 64% of their original values in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, treatment of FAZA rat hepatoma cells with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone induced alpha 1 I3 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together these data suggested that glucocorticoids are required for the constitutive high level expression of this gene in normal adult rat livers. A series of 5' deletion constructs and linker scanning mutants of the promoter upstream region were produced and transfected into FAZA cells. A functional glucocorticoid response element was mapped between -168 and -151 base pairs 5' of the transcription start site. This element conforms with an inverted consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE) but differs in two positions essential for protein DNA interaction between the GRE and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The induction of alpha 1 I3 gene promoter region constructs by dexamethasone was abolished by the receptor antagonist RU486, indicating that the GR participated in the activation of the alpha 1 I3 gene. In DNase I footprinting experiments with nuclear protein extracts from untreated and dexamethasone-treated FAZA cells, similar extents of alpha 1 I3 promoter upstream sequences were protected, indicating that proteins capable of binding in the glucocorticoid response-mediating element (GME) region were present before and after arrival of the hormonal signal. However, a purified recombinant fragment of the GR which contained essentially only its DNA binding domain was unable to bind at the GME although it interacted strongly with a consensus GRE sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1554238160,"Three strains of inbred rats, AVN, DA and LOU/M, were found to express human blood group A-active glycosphingolipids in the small intestine. Two A phenotypes were detected by immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms with monoclonal anti-blood group A antibody. One phenotype (DA and LOU/M) displayed a novel glycolipid which was characterized as an A-active octaglycosylceramide with a type 1 chain repeat by methylation analysis, electron-impact mass spectrometry of the permethylated and permethylated LiAlH4-reduced molecule, and 1H NMR spectroscopy.
