https://openalex.org/W4241363254,"The psychoactive constituent of cannabis, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, produces in humans subjective responses mediated by CB1 cannabinoid receptors, indicating that endogenous cannabinoids may contribute to the control of emotion. But the variable effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol obscure the interpretation of these results and limit the therapeutic potential of direct cannabinoid agonists. An alternative approach may be to develop drugs that amplify the effects of endogenous cannabinoids by preventing their inactivation. Here we describe a class of potent, selective and systemically active inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. Like clinically used anti-anxiety drugs, in rats the inhibitors exhibit benzodiazepine-like properties in the elevated zero-maze test and suppress isolation-induced vocalizations. These effects are accompanied by augmented brain levels of anandamide and are prevented by CB1 receptor blockade. Our results indicate that anandamide participates in the modulation of emotional states and point to fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibition as an innovative approach to anti-anxiety therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2052798492,"The influx of inflammatory cells to sites of injury is largely directed by signals from the epithelium, but how these cells form chemotactic gradients is not known. In matrilysin null mice, neutrophils remained confined in the interstitium of injured lungs and did not advance into the alveolar space. Impaired transepithelial migration was accompanied by a lack of both shed syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and KC, a CXC chemokine, in the alveolar fluid. KC was bound to shed syndecan-1, and it was not detected in the lavage of syndecan-1 null mice. In vitro, matrilysin cleaved syndecan-1 from the surface of cells. Thus, matrilysin-mediated shedding of syndecan-1/KC complexes from the mucosal surface directs and confines neutrophil influx to sites of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2031512086,"Thiamin and riboflavin are precursors of essential coenzymes—thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN)/flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), respectively. In Bacillus spp, genes responsible for thiamin and riboflavin biosynthesis are organized in tightly controllable operons. Here, we demonstrate that the feedback regulation of riboflavin and thiamin genes relies on a novel transcription attenuation mechanism. A unique feature of this mechanism is the formation of specific complexes between a conserved leader region of the cognate RNA and FMN or TPP. In each case, the complex allows the termination hairpin to form and interrupt transcription prematurely. Thus, sensing small molecules by nascent RNA controls transcription elongation of riboflavin and thiamin operons and possibly other bacterial operons as well."

https://openalex.org/W2027991357,"Cellular communication in the nervous system is mediated by chemical messengers that include amino acids, monoamines, peptide hormones, and lipids. An interesting question is how neurons regulate signals that are transmitted by membrane-embedded lipids. Here, we report the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the integral membrane protein fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme that degrades members of the endocannabinoid class of signaling lipids and terminates their activity. The structure of FAAH complexed with an arachidonyl inhibitor reveals how a set of discrete structural alterations allows this enzyme, in contrast to soluble hydrolases of the same family, to integrate into cell membranes and establish direct access to the bilayer from its active site."

https://openalex.org/W2065368005,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) mobilizes Ca(2+) in many cells and species. Unlike other Ca(2+)-mobilizing messengers, NAADP mobilizes Ca(2+) from an unknown store that is not the endoplasmic reticulum, the store traditionally associated with messenger-mediated Ca(2+) signaling. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a Ca(2+) store in sea urchin eggs mobilized by NAADP that is dependent on a proton gradient maintained by an ATP-dependent vacuolar-type proton pump. Moreover, we provide pharmacological and biochemical evidence that this Ca(2+) store is the reserve granule, the functional equivalent of a lysosome in the sea urchin egg. These findings represent an unsuspected mechanism for messenger-mediated Ca(2+) release from lysosome-related organelles."

https://openalex.org/W2018947464,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules are highly polymorphic proteins that bind and present foreign peptides to the clonally distributed alphabeta receptors (TCR) of T lymphocytes. As a population, the immature T lymphocytes generated in the thymus express a very diverse set of TCR specificities. A process of positive selection filters this broad repertoire to optimize peripheral T cells for antigen recognition in the context of available MHC products. Only those precursor T cells whose TCRs generate an adequate but not excessive signalling response to self-peptides bound to the expressed MHC proteins undergo successful maturation. Here we show that post-thymic self-recognition facilitates the antigen reactivity of mature T cells. Both experimental and physiological interruption of T-cell contact with self-peptide MHC ligands leads to a rapid decline in signalling and response sensitivity to foreign stimuli. Because the adaptive immune system must be recruited early in an infectious process when antigen is limiting, these findings suggest that positive selection ensures predictable T-cell recognition of available self-ligands, which in turn promotes efficient responses to pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2139855364,"The reovirus polymerase and those of other dsRNA viruses function within the confines of a protein capsid to transcribe the tightly packed dsRNA genome segments. The crystal structure of the reovirus polymerase, lambda3, determined at 2.5 A resolution, shows a fingers-palm-thumb core, similar to those of other viral polymerases, surrounded by major N- and C-terminal elaborations, which create a cage-like structure, with four channels leading to the catalytic site. This ""caged"" polymerase has allowed us to visualize the results of several rounds of RNA polymerization directly in the crystals. A 5' cap binding site on the surface of lambda3 suggests a template retention mechanism by which attachment of the 5' end of the plus-sense strand facilitates insertion of the 3' end of the minus-sense strand into the template channel."

https://openalex.org/W2060354653,"Major histocompatibility complex ( mhc )–encoded molecules govern immune responses by presenting antigenic peptides to T cells. The extensive polymorphism of genes encoding these molecules is believed to enhance immune defense by broadening the array of antigenic peptides available for T cell recognition, but direct evidence supporting the importance of this mechanism in combating pathogens is limited. Here we link mhc polymorphism - driven diversification of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) repertoire to the generation of high-avidity, protective antiviral T cells and to superior antiviral defense. Thus, much of the beneficial effect of the mhc polymorphism in immune defense may be due to its critical influence on the properties of the selected CTL repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2109412588,"The maternal Dorsal regulatory gradient initiates the differentiation of several tissues in the early Drosophila embryo. Whole-genome microarray assays identified as many as 40 new Dorsal target genes, which encode a broad spectrum of cell signaling proteins and transcription factors. Evidence is presented that a tissue-specific form of the NF-Y transcription complex is essential for the activation of gene expression in the mesoderm. Tissue-specific enhancers were identified for new Dorsal target genes, and bioinformatics methods identified conserved cis-regulatory elements for coordinately regulated genes that respond to similar thresholds of the Dorsal gradient. The new Dorsal target genes and enhancers represent one of the most extensive gene networks known for any developmental process."
https://openalex.org/W2080888080,"Human activity causes increasing background concentrations of the greenhouse gases CO2 and O3. Increased levels of CO2 can be found in all terrestrial ecosystems. Damaging O3 concentrations currently occur over 29% of the world's temperate and subpolar forests but are predicted to affect fully 60% by 2100 (ref. 3). Although individual effects of CO2 and O3 on vegetation have been widely investigated, very little is known about their interaction, and long-term studies on mature trees and higher trophic levels are extremely rare. Here we present evidence from the most widely distributed North American tree species, Populus tremuloides, showing that CO2 and O3, singly and in combination, affected productivity, physical and chemical leaf defences and, because of changes in plant quality, insect and disease populations. Our data show that feedbacks to plant growth from changes induced by CO2 and O3 in plant quality and pest performance are likely. Assessments of global change effects on forest ecosystems must therefore consider the interacting effects of CO2 and O3 on plant performance, as well as the implications of increased pest activity."
https://openalex.org/W2117779825,"Interactions between Ets family members and a variety of other transcription factors serve important functions during development and differentiation processes,e.g. in the hematopoietic system. Here we show that the endothelial basic helix-loop-helix PAS domain transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) (but not its close relative HIF-1α), cooperates with Ets-1 in activating transcription of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-2) gene (Flk-1). The receptor tyrosine kinase Flk-1 is indispensable for angiogenesis, and its expression is closely regulated during development. Consistent with the hypothesis that HIF-2α controls the expression of Flk-1 in vivo, we show here that HIF-2α and Flk-1 are co-regulated in postnatal mouse brain capillaries. A tandem HIF-2α/Ets binding site was identified within the Flk-1 promoter that acted as a strong enhancer element. Based on the analysis of transgenic mouse embryos, these motifs are essential for endothelial cell-specific reporter gene expression. A single HIF-2α/Ets element conferred strong cooperative induction by HIF-2α and Ets-1 when fused to a heterologous promoter and was most active in endothelial cells. The physical interaction of HIF-2α with Ets-1 was demonstrated and localized to the HIF-2α carboxyl terminus and the autoinhibitory exon VII domain of Ets-1, respectively. The deletion of the DNA binding and carboxyl-terminal transactivation domains of HIF-2α, respectively, created dominant negative mutants that suppressed transactivation by the wild type protein and failed to synergize with Ets-1. These results suggest that the interaction between HIF-2α and endothelial Ets factors is required for the full transcriptional activation of Flk-1 in endothelial cells and may therefore represent a future target for the manipulation of angiogenesis.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7177) Google Scholar, 2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell proliferation is mediated primarily by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF1; also known as VPF, vascular permeability factor) signaling via its high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors. The VEGF receptors are expressed prominently on endothelial cells, thus establishing the cell specificity of VEGF. VEGF signaling is also important for behavioral changes of the capillary endothelium during blood vessel growth, such as invasive migration, matrix degradation, and sprouting, and also for the survival of endothelial cells in immature blood vessels. VEGF is induced in response to hypoxia and/or low intracellular glucose, thus stimulating neovascularization in accordance with the increasing metabolic demands of a growing tissue (3Breier G. Damert A. Plate K.H. Risau W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Semenza G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 39-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Veikkola T. Alitalo K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The function of the high affinity VEGF receptors is not redundant. Although VEGF receptor-1 (Flt-1) is necessary for early embryonic vascular integrity (6Fong G.H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar), VEGF receptor-2 (KDR in humans/Flk-1 in mouse) is indispensable for the formation of the primordial vasculature during early embryogenesis; mouse embryos with targeted disruption of the Flk-1 gene fail to differentiate both blood and endothelial cells and die as a consequence of avascularity (7Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Consistent with this phenotype, Flk-1 is strongly expressed by the mesodermal precursors of both endothelial and hematopoietic cells (hemangioblasts) (8Yamaguchi T.P. Dumont D.J. Conlon R.A. Breitman M.L. Rossant J. Development. 1993; 118: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kataoka H. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Tsuchida K. Kodama H. Kunisada T. Risau W. Kita T. Nishikawa S.I. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Later on, during ontogeny, Flk-1 is expressed primarily on proliferating endothelial cells but becomes largely down-regulated in many vascular domains in the adult. However, Flk-1 expression is reactivated in newly forming blood vessels, e.g. in the corpus luteum, and in neoplastic lesions that express high amounts of VEGF, such as glioblastomas (10Plate K.H. Risau W. Glia. 1995; 15: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar,11Vajkoczy P. Farhadi M. Gaumann A. Heidenreich R. Erber R. Wunder A. Tonn J.C. Menger M.D. Breier G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The level of VEGF receptor expression appears to be influenced by the availability of their ligand VEGF, which is secreted upon tissue vascularization (12Flamme I. Von Reutern M. Drexler H.C.A. Syedali S. Risau W. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Gerber H.P. Keyt B.A. Ferrara N. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol.

Signaling in the embryonic endothelium has been demonstrated convincingly only for Flk-1, whereas the role of Flt-1 in the developing vasculature is still puzzling (14Waltenberger J.

Although other signaling systems, such as angiopoietins/tie2 receptor and ephrins/eph receptors, as well are indispensable for vascular differentiation (16Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U.

Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar), the role of Flk-1 signaling is pivotal because inhibition of Flk-1 signaling, but not of any other receptor, prevents vascular development from its beginning and consistently inhibits tumor vascularization (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4792) Google Scholar). Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the expression of Flk-1 in the endothelium would provide general insights into the mechanisms of vascular development in health and disease and might open up new approaches to the as yet frustrating therapy of ischemic and proliferative malignancies.We recently characterized the essential regulatory elements of theFlk-1 gene (19Kappel A. Ronicke V. Damert A. Flamme I. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4284-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 939-bp 5′-flanking region together with a 430-bp minimal enhancer from the first intron was essential and sufficient to convey endothelial cell-specific expression of thelacZ reporter gene in the transgenic mouse. By mutational analysis in transgenic animals, distinct SCL/TAL-1, GATA, and Ets consensus sites within the enhancer were shown to be essential forFlk-1 gene expression (20Kappel A. Schlaeger T.M. Flamme I. Orkin S.H. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that members of the SCL, GATA, and Ets transcription factor families are not only important regulators of hematopoiesis (21Orkin S.H. Saga Y. Hata N. Kobayashi S. Magnuson T. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) but also act upstream of Flk-1 expression during development. Consistently, members of all three families are expressed by endothelial cells and have been implicated in vascular development in the embryo and in tumor angiogenesis. SCL, a candidate master regulator of hematopoiesis, appears also to be involved in early endothelial cell differentiation and possibly acts upstream of Flk-1 at least in zebrafish (22Gering M. Rodaway A.R. Gottgens B. Patient R.K. Green A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4029-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 23Liao E. Paw B. Oates A. Pratt S. Postlethwait J. Zon L.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ets-1 is highly expressed in the lateral mesoderm when Flk-1 starts to be expressed in vascular endothelial cell precursors (31Pardanaud L. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the up-regulation of Ets-1 in capillary-invading tumors can be correlated with re-expression of VEGF receptors (32Wernert N. Raes M.B. Lassalle P. Dehouck M.P. Gosselin B. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). Also the Ets family members NERF2 and TEL appear to serve important functions during angiogenesis (29Dube A.

Kihara-Negishi F. Yamamoto H. Kondoh N. Hitomi Y. Hashimoto Y. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or may play a critical role in the differentiation of epithelia, such as ESE-1 and -2 (35Oettgen P. Kas K. Dube A. Gu X. Grall F. Thamrongsak U. Akbarali Y. Finger E. Boltax J. Endress G. Munger K. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. J. Biol.

Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others cloned a novel member of the bHLH PAS family of transcription factors, which is expressed at high levels in vascular endothelium in mouse and quail embryos but also in tissues expressing high amounts of VEGF, and was denominated EPAS-1/HRF/HLF/MOP2 (37Ema M.

This factor is highly homologous to hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and therefore was renamed HIF-2α (42Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar). Like HIF-1α, HIF-2α protein is stabilized by hypoxia and, as a heterodimer with ARNT, binds to a six-base pair consensus sequence, the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the regulatory sequences of hypoxia-responsive genes (40Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 43Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, HIF-2α activates not only the transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes such as VEGF and erythropoietin (37Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 40Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) but also of genes for endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Flk-1 andtie-2 (19Kappel A. Ronicke V. Damert A. Flamme I. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4284-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Although in the erythropoietin enhancer and the VEGF promoter HIF-2α apparently utilizes the HRE, Flk-1 expression was not activated by HIF-1α, and no classical HRE was detected in the Flk-1 promoter.The expression pattern and the biological activity of HIF-2α collectively suggested that this transcription factor is a dual candidate regulator of vascular development by activating both components of the VEGF/Flk-1 signaling system. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the mechanism by which HIF-2α activates transcription of Flk-1. In this study, we found that HIF-2α (but not HIF-1α), although a relatively moderate activator of Flk-1 transcription, is synergistic with Ets-1 in stimulating the Flk-1 promoter. HIF-2α and Ets-1 (but not HIF-1α) physically interact via their carboxyl termini and exon-VII domains, respectively. HIF-2 binds to two HRE-related sequences, each in close proximity to functional Ets binding sites in the Flk-1 promoter. These two pairs of transcription factor binding sites constitute enhancer elements that confer strong inducibility by HIF-2 and Ets-1 when fused to heterologous promoters. They are indispensable, positively acting elements for the Flk-1 5′-flanking region and are essential for endothelial cell-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic mice. As HIF-2α protein and Flk-1 are found to be co-regulated during development in brain capillaries, our data emphasize the importance of a cooperative interaction of the HIF-2α and Ets transcription factors for vascular growth and differentiation.DISCUSSIONSignaling via the VEGF receptor, Flk-1, is thought to be limiting for endothelial cell proliferation and survival and indispensable for the initial development of the vascular system. Because expression of Flk-1 is highly restricted to endothelial cells and tightly regulated during development, characterization of the gene regulatory elements of Flk-1 would provide insights into the mechanisms of both endothelial cell-specific restriction and temporal regulation of gene expression. In previous studies we identified a 430-bp minimal enhancer from the first intron of the Flk-1 gene, which in conjunction with the Flk-1 promoter is sufficient and necessary to drive endothelial cell-specific gene expression in transgenic mice (19Kappel A. Ronicke V. Damert A. Flamme I. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4284-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the enhancer partially conferred endothelial cell-specific expression of the lacZ reporter gene to a heterologous promoter, full recapitulation of endothelial expression was obtained only in conjunction with the Flk-1 promoter (19Kappel A. Ronicke V. Damert A. Flamme I. Risau W. Breier G. Blood. 1999; 93: 4284-4292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data together with the endothelial cell-specificity of the Flk-1 promoter (47Ronicke V. Risau W. Breier G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) indicate that the binding of endothelial cell-specific transcription factors to the promoter is necessary to enhance the expression of Flk-1.In this study, we have identified two functional binding sites for HIF-2 within the Flk-1 promoter, located in close proximity to functional Ets consensus sites. These binding sites constitute positively acting elements that confer inducibility by HIF-2α and Ets-1 and their cooperative effects to a heterologous promoter in an insertion-independent manner. Inducibility of the Flk-1 promoter was almost completely lost when these elements were mutated. Therefore, these elements were likely to represent the sought positively acting elements that are necessary for complete endothelial cell-specific expression of Flk-1. Finally, by mutational analysis in transgenic mouse embryos these elements were proved necessary for endothelial cell-specific reporter gene expression in vivo. Interestingly, mutation of both the HBS2/EBS6 and EBS1/HBS2 elements was necessary to obtain the loss of endothelial cell-specific transgene expression. These results suggest that the HBS/EBS elements may be used alternatively in vivo, which is consistent with our finding that both HBS readily bind HIF-2 from endothelial nuclear extracts and are occupied by nuclear protein. The in vivo findings do not explain the large difference in inducibility conferred by the HBS/EBS elements when fused to heterologous promoters. It can be speculated that the different distances between the neighboring HIF-2 and Ets binding sites and/or the distance to the transcriptional start site are critical parameters that influence the degree of inducibility conferred by the enhancer elements.Cooperative activation of the Flk-1 promoter is reflected by the physical interaction between Ets-1 and HIF-2α. The physical interaction of Ets-1 and other Ets family members with a variety of other transcription factors has been demonstrated and implicated in differentiation processes mainly in hematopoiesis (36Sieweke M.H. Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although Ets-1 interacts with the bHLH protein USF-1 at the DNA-binding domains (46Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), our GST pull-down experiments indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of HIF-2α strongly interacts with the exon VII domain of Ets-1. This domain is known as a negative regulatory domain, which needs to be conformationally changed to allow Ets-1 to bind DNA (55Kim W.Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,56Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of this domain with HIF-2α probably enhances DNA binding of Ets-1 and thereby establishes the mechanism underlying hyperadditive transactivation. The RUNT domain factor, AML1, interacts with Ets-1 in a similar manner (55Kim W.Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Unlike its close relative HIF-2α, HIF-1α is not able to interact with the exon VII domain of Ets-1 functionally. By swapping the parts of the HIF molecules, the failure of interaction could be attributed to structural differences in the carboxyl-terminal halves. The fact that deletion of the TAD N domain completely abrogated cooperativity suggests that TAD N is necessary for the recruitment of Ets-1 to the DNA via binding to the exon VII domain. In contrast, the TAD C domain does not appear to be required for this interaction. All mutants (HIF-2α dnb, HIF-2α dn, HIF-2α ΔTAD N) that fail to interact with Ets-1 are dominant negative over the wild type HIF-2α but do not reduce the basal level of Flk-1 promoter stimulation by Ets-1. Therefore, it can be concluded that endogenous HIF-2α is not necessary for the basal activation of Flk-1 promoter by Ets-1. This is further supported by the fact that high levels of basal activity were obtained in HEK-293 cells, which lack detectable amounts of HIF-2α protein (43Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It cannot be ruled out that HIF-2α can also co-activate Ets-1 without specific DNA binding, because deletion of the HBS1 from our tk enhancer constructs did abrogate the induction by HIF-2α but not the cooperativity with Ets-1 completely. In contrast, intact EBS3 is absolutely required for induction by Ets-1 and synergism with HIF-2. If this speculation holds true, HIF-2α would represent another example of a DNA binding transcription factor that can transactivate via cofactors without specific DNA binding (57Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown by deletion experiments, the DNA-binding domain of HIF-2α is indispensable for synergism with Ets-1. The seemingly conflicting observation, that a DNA-binding domain but not the specific recognition sequence is needed for activity, may be resolved by the hypothesis that HIF-2α requires binding to DNA for cooperative activation but, when associated with Ets-1, not necessarily binding to its specific recognition sequence.It may be speculated that, depending on the genetic background HIF-1α can substitute for HIF-2α in endothelial cells in vivo. This could account for the varying outcomes of the HIF-2α knock-out in mice, such as the lack of any vascular phenotype and severe defects in angiogenesis (58Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 59Peng J. Zhang L. Drysdale L. Fong G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8386-8391Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Whether the weak interaction of HIF-1α with the amino terminus of Ets-1 (as observed in our GST-pull-down experiments) is of functional relevance remains to be elaborated. In addition, in endothelial nuclear extracts only little residual binding activity to the Flk-1 HBS was detected after supershifting with specific HIF-2α antiserum. This indicates that HIF-2α is the predominant endothelial HIF.In the present study we show that HIF-2α protein is highly expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells of mice during angiogenesis and is localized to endothelial cell nuclei. The kinetics of endothelial cell proliferation were best studied in the brain, and down-regulation of Flk-1 was shown to precede the decrease in mitoses of capillary endothelial cells in the brain of postnatal mice and rats (51Kremer C. Breier G. Risau W. Plate K.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3852-3859PubMed Google Scholar, 52Robertson P.L. Du Bois M. Bowman P.D. Goldstein G.W. Brain Res. 1985; 355: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In parallel to Flk-1, expression of HIF-2α protein is largely down-regulated in the cytosol and disappears from the nuclei of endothelial cells, although strong expression of mRNA is still retained. This finding indicates that HIF-2α is regulated post-translationally in endothelial cells and raises the question of the underlying mechanism. Induction of HIF-2α by hypoxia has been proven and, similar to HIF-1α, is likely to depend on stabilization of the protein under hypoxia. This is achieved via an “oxygen-dependent degradation domain,” which under normoxia is targeted by hydroxylation of distinct proline residues to the degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (54O'Rourke J.F.

Relative hypoxia in the growing brain may be an important factor that contributes to stabilization of endothelial HIF-2α protein and consecutively influences transcription of its target gene,Flk-1. However, the data on a transcriptional induction of Flk-1 by hypoxia are controversial (62Tuder R.M. Flook B.E. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin.

In contrast to Flk-1, the transcription of VEGF receptor-1/flt-1 is induced by hypoxia via an hypoxia-responsive element within the promoter (64Gerber H.P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Whether flt-1, like Flk-1 and tie-2, is another HIF-2 target gene, remains to be examined. Interestingly, gene regulatory elements of both tie-2 and flt-1contain functional Ets sites and, like many other endothelial genes, these can be transcriptionally activated by Ets-1 (2"

https://openalex.org/W2020894858,"An α-l-arabinofuranosidase and a β-d-xylosidase, designated ARA-I and XYL, respectively, have been purified about 1,000-fold from extracts of 5-day-old barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings using ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, and size-exclusion chromatography. The ARA-I has an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.5, and its catalytic efficiency during hydrolysis of 4′-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside is only slightly higher than during hydrolysis of 4′-nitrophenyl β-d-xyloside. Thus, the enzyme is actually a bifunctional α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidase. In contrast, the XYL enzyme, which also has an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.7, preferentially hydrolyzes 4′-nitrophenyl β-d-xyloside, with a catalytic efficiency ∼30-fold higher than with 4′-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside. The enzymes hydrolyze wheat flour arabinoxylan slowly but rapidly hydrolyze oligosaccharide products released from this polysaccharide by (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan endohydrolase. Both enzymes hydrolyze (1 → 4)-β-d-xylopentaose, and ARA-I can also degrade (1 → 5)-α-l-arabinofuranohexaose. ARA-I and XYL cDNAs encode mature proteins of 748 amino acid residues which have calculated molecular masses of 79.2 and 80.5 kDa, respectively. Both are family 3 glycoside hydrolases. The discrepancies between the apparent molecular masses obtained for the purified enzymes and those predicted from the cDNAs are attributable to COOH-terminal processing, through which about 130 amino acid residues are removed from the primary translation product. The genes encoding the ARA-I and XYL have been mapped to chromosomes 2H and 6H, respectively. ARA-I transcripts are most abundant in young roots, young leaves, and developing grain, whereas XYL mRNA is detected in most barley tissues.

ARA-I transcripts are most abundant in young roots, young leaves, and developing grain, whereas XYL mRNA is detected in most barley tissues. Heteroxylans are major constituents of cell walls in the Poaceae, which include many commercially important cereals and pasture grasses. In the endosperm of barley grains and in elongating coleoptiles, these polysaccharides may comprise 20–70% by weight of the walls (1Fincher G.B. Shewry P.R. Barley: Genetics, Molecular Biology and Bio/Technology. CAB Publishing, Wallingford, U. K.1992: 413-437Google Scholar) and consist of a backbone of (1 → 4)-β-linkedd-xylopyranosyl residues substituted predominantly with α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues. The α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues can be linked to O-3, O-2, or both O-3 and O-2 of xylanopyranosyl residues of the (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan backbone, and other substituents or short side chains are also detected in low abundance (2Viëtor R.J.

Biol. 1996; 47: 445-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues can be esterified with hydroxycinnamic acids, in particular ferulic acid, which may form cross-bridges between adjacent arabinoxylan chains, or with lignin, by oxidative dimerization (4Iiyama K. Lam T.B.T. Stone B.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 104: 315-320Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar).As observed with many wall components in higher plants, the arabinoxylans of primary cell walls can be restructured during normal growth and development. For example, newly synthesized arabinoxylans in maize coleoptiles are deposited in the walls in a highly substituted form, but arabinofuranosyl residues are removed later, and this leads to significant changes in the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharides and hence in the walls themselves (5Andrewartha K. Phillips D.R. Stone B.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 191-204Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Gibeaut D.M. Carpita N.C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Removal of α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues is also observed when wall arabinoxylans are degraded (7Wilkie K.C.B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1979; 36: 215-264Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Heyn A.N.J. Plant Sci. 1986; 45: 77-82Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presence of α-l-arabinofuranosidases in germinated barley grain or in isolated aleurone layers has been taken as evidence that these enzymes perform this function during the mobilization of the starchy endosperm after cereal grain germination (9Taiz L. Honigman W.A. Plant Physiol. 1976; 58: 380-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Banik M. Li C.D. Langridge P. Fincher G.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although this activity has also been attributed to a separate group of enzymes, known as arabinoxylan α-l-arabinofuranohydrolases (11Ferré H. Broberg A. Duus J.Ø. Thomsen K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6633-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Lee R.C. Burton R.A. Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Most α-l-arabinofuranosidases are so designated because they can hydrolyze the synthetic aryl glycoside 4′-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside (4NPA), 1The abbreviations used are: 4NPA, 4′-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; ARA-I, α-l-arabinofuranosidase; HCA, hydrophobic cluster analysis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; 4NPX, 4′-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; XYL, β-d-xylosidase 1The abbreviations used are: 4NPA, 4′-nitrophenyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; ARA-I, α-l-arabinofuranosidase; HCA, hydrophobic cluster analysis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; 4NPX, 4′-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; XYL, β-d-xylosidase and although they are presumed to be responsible for changes in arabinoxylans during wall modification or degradation, this class of enzymes may be subdivided into several quite distinct groups. Thus, α-l-arabinofuranosidases have been classified in glycoside hydrolase families 3, 43, 51, 54, and 62 (13; afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr), and members of each family exhibit characteristic substrate specificities, action patterns, and reaction mechanisms (14Pitson S.M.

Lett. 1998; 164: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar). Although most of the characterized enzymes are from saprophytic or rumen microorganisms, several plant α-l-arabinofuranosidases have also been identified. Family 51 arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases, which remove α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues from polymeric arabinoxylans, have been purified from germinated barley grain, and their primary structures have been defined (11Ferré H. Broberg A. Duus J.Ø. Thomsen K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6633-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Lee R.C. Burton R.A. Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There are other reports of the purification or partial purification of higher plant α-l-arabinofuranosidases, but in most cases no amino acid sequence information is available, and it is therefore not possible to classify the enzymes accurately, to draw conclusions about their reaction mechanisms, or to identify their true substrates and biological functions.Here we have purified a bifunctional family 3 α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidase (ARA-I) from young barley seedlings, defined its kinetic and enzymic properties, and determined its complete amino acid sequence from corresponding cDNAs. The enzyme is unable to hydrolyze arabinoxylans at a significant rate but could play an important role in the complete depolymerization of arabinoxylans through its ability to hydrolyze oligosaccharides released from the polysaccharide by (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan endohydrolases. In parallel, a family 3 β-d-xylosidase (XYL) was purified and characterized.DISCUSSIONAn α-l-arabinofuranosidase and a β-d-xylosidase, both of which are family 3 glycoside hydrolases (13Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), were purified ∼1,000-fold (Table I) from extracts of germinated barley grain as outlined in Scheme FS1. The purified enzymes have been designated ARA-I and XYL, respectively. A second, less abundant, α-l-arabinofuranosidase isoenzyme, designated ARA-II, was detected in the extracts (Fig. 1 A) but was not purified to homogeneity. The ARA-I and XYL enzymes have apparent molecular masses of 67 kDa (Fig. 2) and isoelectric points of 5.5 and 6.7, respectively. Examination of their substrate specificities and kinetic properties indicated that α-l-arabinofuranosidase ARA-I can also hydrolyze 4NP-β-d-xylopyranoside, 4NP-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 4NP-α-l-arabinopyranoside at significant rates, whereas the XYL enzyme has a more restricted, or “tighter,” specificity for β-d-xylosides (Table III). Thus, the XYL enzyme hydrolyzes not only 4NPX but also, with a 30-fold lower catalytic efficiency, 4NPA. The catalytic efficiency factor for ARA-I was of the same order of magnitude for 4NPA and 4NPX but slightly higher for 4NPA (Table II). For ease of expression we have referred to the enzyme here as an α-l-arabinofuranosidase, but because ARA-I can hydrolyze both substrates efficiently, we acknowledge that it should probably be referred to as a bifunctional α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylopyranosidase and that both activities might be important for its biological functionin planta. Certain family 43 (50, 51), 54 (52–54), and 62 (16) α-l-arabinofuranosidases and β-d-xylopyranosidases show similar flexibility in their substrate specificities.Using amino acid sequences generated from the purified barley ARA-I and XYL enzymes, several cDNAs were isolated, and near full-length cDNA sequences were subsequently assembled (Fig. 4). Deduced amino acid sequences indicated that both enzymes have a typical endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal peptide (Fig. 4) that presumably directs secretion from cells in which they are synthesized. This is a significant observation, given recent indications that the (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan endohydrolase involved in arabinoxylan depolymerization in germinated barley grain is not located in the endomembrane secretory compartment of aleurone layers but is found instead in the cytosol and is likely to be released from aleurone layers only after programmed cell death (56Caspers M.P. Lok F. Sinjorgo K.M. van Zeijl M.J. Nielson K.A. Cameron-Mills V. Plant J. 2001; 26: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 57Simpson D.J. Fincher G.B. Huang A.H.C. Cameron-Mills V. J. Cereal Sci. 2002; 35: 1-17Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In isolated aleurone layers, α-l-arabinofuranosidases and β-d-xylosidases are secreted and can be detected in the surrounding medium much earlier than the (1 → 4)-β-xylan endohydrolases (10Banik M. Li C.D. Langridge P. Fincher G.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the secretion from aleurone layers of endohydrolases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, and β-d-xylosidases involved in arabinoxylan degradation is clearly not coincident.Although the NH2 terminus of ARA-I could not be defined with certainty, the cDNAs encode primary translation products of 748 amino acid residues (Fig. 4). The calculated molecular masses of the enzymes, based on these deduced amino acid sequences, are about 80 kDa. This value is much higher than the apparent molecular mass values of 67 kDa observed during SDS-gel electrophoresis of the purified enzymes (Fig. 2) and represents a much longer polypeptide than other plant members of the family 3 group of glycoside hydrolases (19Harvey A.J. Hrmova M. De Gori R. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Proteins. 2000; 41: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry was therefore used to examine further the molecular masses of the two enzymes and in both cases confirmed that the enzymes were ∼67 kDa in size. Particular attention was paid to ARA-I, for which the analysis of proteolytic peptides accounted for all regions of the enzyme except the COOH terminus predicted from the cDNA sequence (Fig. 4). The amino acid sequence data also suggested that the COOH termini of the enzymes were heterogeneous and that a single COOH-terminal residue could therefore not be identified. At this stage the weight of evidence suggests that the COOH termini of both ARA-I and XYL are close to the Met-614/Tyr-606 residue of ARA-I/XYL, respectively (Fig. 4). Thus, more than 130 amino acid residues appear to have been removed from the COOH termini during post-translational processing of the enzymes. These values may be compared with the 605 residues found in the family 3 barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase (58Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J. Jones G.P. Stone B.A. Høj P.B. Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No biological rationale for COOH-terminal processing of the barley ARA-I and XYL enzymes can be provided at this stage. In the case of the barley (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan endohydrolase, both NH2- and COOH-terminal processing of the primary translation product occurs (56Caspers M.P. Lok F. Sinjorgo K.M. van Zeijl M.J.

Cereal Sci. 2002; 35: 1-17Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the mature enzymes with other members of the family 3 glycoside hydrolases suggested that COOH-terminal processing does not occur in all members of the family. Although β-d-xylosidases from other higher plants are similar in size to those purified here from barley, 2S. Khan, GenBank accession number AC009243, unpublished data. the β-d-xylosidases from Aspergillus niger (59van Peij N.N.M.E. Brinkmann J. Vrsanska M. Visser J. de Graaff L.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar),Aspergillus oryzae (60Kitamoto N. Yoshino S. Ohmiya K. Tsukagoshi N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 20-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Erwinia chrysanthemi(61Vroemen S. Heldens J. Boyd C. Henrissat B. Keen N.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are much larger (∼85 kDa) than the barley enzymes and correspond in size to those predicted from cDNA sequences.The relatively relaxed substrate specificities observed here for the family 3 ARA-I and XYL enzymes from barley can be rationalized in terms of their predicted three-dimensional structures. The three-dimensional structure of a family 3 β-d-glucan glucohydrolase from barley has been solved (62Varghese J.N. Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 179-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and although it is the only family 3 crystal structure available, it has been used to model three-dimensional structures of other family 3 enzymes (19Harvey A.J. Hrmova M. De Gori R. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Proteins. 2000; 41: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling suggests that the barley ARA-I and XYL enzymes have overall structures similar to that of the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase from barley, although the three-dimensional conformation of the 130-amino acid residue COOH-terminal region of ARA-I and XYL, which is not present in the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase group, cannot be modeled (data not shown).The barley β-d-glucan glucohydrolase has a broad specificity for different linkage types in unsubstituted oligomeric and polymeric β-d-glucan substrates (48Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1033-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 63Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 305: 209-221Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), probably because only two glucosyl residues of the substrate enter the active site pocket and because the glucosyl residue bound at subsite +1 is located between two tryptophan residues that allow some positional flexibility (48Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1033-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The remainder of the substrate projects away from the enzyme surface, and activity is therefore relatively independent of substrate shape and hence of linkage type (34Hrmova M. Varghese J.N. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Driguez H. Fincher G.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The barley ARA-I and XYL enzymes examined here also exhibit some flexibility in substrate specificity. Both 4NPA and 4NPX can fit in their catalytic sites. To provide a structural rationale for this observation, the three-dimensional structure of β-d-xylopyranose was taken from the Protein Data Bank and the three-dimensional structure of α-l-arabinofuranose was built. When the two structures were superimposed, a similar stereochemistry was observed about C-1, C-2, and C-3 in both pentoses, and their overall hydrodynamic volumes were also similar (Fig. 7). It is therefore not surprising that the active site of ARA-I can accommodate both substrates.In addition to the aryl glycosides, both enzymes hydrolyze linear oligosaccharides, but neither hydrolyzes substituted polysaccharides. Similarly, the fact that no arabinose is removed from oligoarabinoxylosides released by (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan endohydrolase action (Fig. 3) suggests that neither enzyme is able to hydrolyze substituted oligomeric substrates completely. Only unsubstituted oligoxylosides or oligoarabinoxylosides with two to three unsubstituted xylosyl residues at their nonreducing ends would be expected to fit into a substrate-binding pocket of the shape found in other family 3 enzymes (19Harvey A.J. Hrmova M. De Gori R. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Proteins. 2000; 41: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 48Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1033-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and only xylose would be released.Family 3 glycoside hydrolases from higher plants can be grouped into two major clades, based on amino acid sequence alignments (48Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1033-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One group contains the broad specificity β-d-glucan glucohydrolases, and the other contains β-d-xylosidases and α-l-arabinofuranosidases. As expected, the ARA-I and XYL enzymes characterized here fall into the second group (data not shown). Although the catalytic amino acid residues, corresponding to Glu-481 and Asp-275 for ARA-I and Glu-474 and Asp-268 for XYL (Fig. 4), are conserved in higher plant family 3 glycoside hydrolases, Hrmovaet al. (48Hrmova M. De Gori R. Smith B.J. Fairweather J.K. Driguez H. Varghese J.N. Fincher G.B. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1033-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) provided a structural explanation for the differences in substrate specificity of the two groups. Thus, the conserved amino acid residue Asp-95 in the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase group that binds the C6-OH of the glycosyl residue bound at subsite −1 is not found in the α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidase group. Clearly, the pentoses l-arabinofuranose andd-xylose have no C6-OH group, and the α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidases have a Glu residue in the position corresponding to Asp-95 of the β-d-glucan glucohydrolase group.When the phylogeny of the α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidase group of family 3 enzymes is examined in more detail (Fig. 8), the higher plant representatives are clearly separated from the fungal representatives. There is one bacterial sequence of Thermotoga neapolitana in this group (Fig. 8). In most cases the true substrate specificities of enzymes encoded by the genes shown in Fig. 8 have not been investigated, and the β-d-xylosidase assignment of identity is based on similarities with a small number of partially characterized enzymes. The dual α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidase specificity of the barley ARA-I has not been reported for other members of family 3 (13Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the barley ARA-I is some distance from XYL in the phylogenetic tree, and this may eventually provide clues for more detailed classification of closely related enzymes in this family.Figure 8Unrooted radial phylogenetic tree of plant family 3 β-d-xylosidases.Amino acid sequences of α-l-arabinofuranosidase/β-d-xylosidase and β-d-xylosidase were aligned with ClustalW (64Thompson J.D.

The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To provide some insight into the likely biological functions of the barley ARA-I and XYL enzymes, expression patterns of the genes were investigated, together with the action of the enzymes on well defined oligomeric and polymeric substrates. Reverse transcription-PCR showed the presence of XYL mRNA in all tissues examined. However, ARA-I mRNA appeared to be absent, or in very low abundance, in the aleurone layer and scutellum of germinated grain (Fig. 5). This is somewhat surprising, given that α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity, measured by activity on 4NPA, has been widely reported in the media surrounding isolated barley aleurone layers (9Taiz L. Honigman W.A. Plant Physiol. 1976; 58: 380-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Banik M. Li C.D. Langridge P. Fincher G.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 65Dashek W.V. Chrispeels M.J. Planta. 1977; 134: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At the substrate specificity level, XYL was able to hydrolyze (1 → 4)-β-d-xylopentaose to xylose relatively quickly but exhibited no activity against (1 → 5)−α-l-arabinofuranohexaose (Fig. 3,B and C). In contrast, ARA-I hydrolyzed (1 → 5)−α-l-arabinofuranohexaose to arabinose and (1 → 4)-β-d-xylopyranopentaose to xylose, albeit at slow rates (Fig. 3, B and C).Neither enzyme hydrolyzed arabinoxylan at a significant rate, but both ARA-I and XYL rapidly released xylose from oligoarabinoxylosides or oligoxylosides that were first released from the arabinoxylan by the action of (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan endohydrolase. The low levels of arabinose in these hydrolysates (Fig. 3 A) were unexpected, given that this polysaccharide contains about 30% (mol/mol) α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues (55Fincher G.B. Stone B.A. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1974; 1: 297-311Crossref Google Scholar), but suggest that neither enzyme can bypass substituted xylosyl residues in oligoarabinoxylosides. In summary, it might be concluded that the ARA-I and XYL enzymes could participate in further hydrolysis of oligosaccharides released from arabinoxylans by endohydrolases in germinated barley grain. The enzymes could also play an important role during cell wall turnover in elongating coleoptiles and in other tissues during normal growth and development. Heteroxylans are major constituents of cell walls in the Poaceae, which include many commercially important cereals and pasture grasses. In the endosperm of barley grains and in elongating coleoptiles, these polysaccharides may comprise 20–70% by weight of the walls (1Fincher G.B. Shewry P.R. Barley: Genetics, Molecular Biology and Bio/Technology. CAB Publishing, Wallingford, U. K.1992: 413-437Google Scholar) and consist of a backbone of (1 → 4)-β-linkedd-xylopyranosyl residues substituted predominantly with α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues. The α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues can be linked to O-3, O-2, or both O-3 and O-2 of xylanopyranosyl residues of the (1 → 4)-β-d-xylan backbone, and other substituents or short side chains are also detected in low abundance (2Viëtor R.J.

Biol. 1996; 47: 445-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues can be esterified with hydroxycinnamic acids, in particular ferulic acid, which may form cross-bridges between adjacent arabinoxylan chains, or with lignin, by oxidative dimerization (4Iiyama K. Lam T.B.T. Stone B.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 104: 315-320Crossref Scopus (639) Google Scholar). As observed with many wall components in higher plants, the arabinoxylans of primary cell walls can be restructured during normal growth and development. For example, newly synthesized arabinoxylans in maize coleoptiles are deposited in the walls in a highly substituted form, but arabinofuranosyl residues are removed later, and this leads to significant changes in the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharides and hence in the walls themselves (5Andrewartha K. Phillips D.R. Stone B.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 191-204Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Gibeaut D.M. Carpita N.C. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Removal of α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues is also observed when wall arabinoxylans are degraded (7Wilkie K.C.B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1979; 36: 215-264Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Heyn A.N.J. Plant Sci. 1986; 45: 77-82Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presence of α-l-arabinofuranosidases in germinated barley grain or in isolated aleurone layers has been taken as evidence that these enzymes perform this function during the mobilization of the starchy endosperm after cereal grain germination (9Taiz L. Honigman W.A. Plant Physiol. 1976; 58: 380-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Banik M. Li C.D. Langridge P. Fincher G.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), although this activity has also been attributed to a separate group of enzymes, known as arabinoxylan α-l-arabinofuranohydrolases (11Ferré H. Broberg A. Duus J.Ø. Thomsen K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6633-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Lee R.C. Burton R.A. Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1988028924,"Short-lived insects surprisingly still suffer senescence under natural conditions. Ageing (senescence) has never been demonstrated convincingly in any insect in the wild, where mean lifespans are probably much shorter than in the laboratory1, and most evidence for senescence in other wild animals (such as mammals) is limited to their reduced survival with age2. Here we show that ageing is detectable in wild populations of a very short-lived insect, the antler fly (Protopiophila litigata), and causes debilitating and costly effects that force a decline not only in survival probability, but also in the reproductive rate of males. Our findings argue against the possibility of a trade-off between fitness components, whereby survival may decline without senescence if investment in reproduction increases with age3, and indicate that ageing rates are subject to intense selection in the wild."

Mutations that impair PTEN function result in a marked increase in cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and constitutive activation of Akt survival signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of apoptosis, hyperplasia, and tumor formation (1–5,7). RANKL is expressed by osteoblastic lineage cells and stimulates its specific receptor, the receptor activator ofNFκB (RANK), which located on osteoclasts, to promote differentiation, survival, fusion, and activation of osteoclasts and to prevent osteoclast apoptosis. The signaling cascade of RANK activation involves stimulation of the c-Jun, NFκB, and serine/threonine kinase Akt pathways (13Roodman G.D. Exp.

Osteopontin (OPN) is one of the major noncollagenous bone matrix proteins produced by osteoblasts and osteoclasts (22Rittling S.R. Matsumoto H.N. McKee M.D. Nanci A. An X.-R. Novick K.E.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study indicates that Akt is essential for cell migration (29Lee M.-J. Thangada S. Paik J.-H. Sapkota G.P.

The major function of PTEN appears to be down-regulation of the PI3K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which regulates Akt and complex downstream pathways affecting cell growth, survival, and migration. In addition, PTEN has weak protein tyrosine phosphatase activity, which may target focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Shc, and thereby modulate other complex pathways (1Tamura M. Gu J. Tran H. Yamada K.M. J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Yamada K.M. Araki M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2375-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that PTEN regulates the RANKL-activated Akt survival signaling pathway and the OPN-stimulated cell migration in RAW 264.7 osteoclast precursors. Moreover, we found that PTEN also regulates RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation from RAW 264.7 osteoclast precursors. In addition, we suggest that RANKL may regulate balance of activated Akt and activated PTEN and have influence osteoclast differentiation. Thus, it is likely that PTEN plays multiple roles involving osteoclast formation, survival, and migration. RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Polyclonal anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308), anti-IκB-α, anti-phospho-IκB-α (Ser-32), anti-Bad, anti-phospho-Bad (Ser-136), and anti-phospho-Rac/cdc42 (Ser-71) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-NFκB/p50 is obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-Rho is purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Green fluorescent protein (GFP), GFP-PTEN wild-type (WT), and GFP-PTEN point mutant C124A (Cys-124 → Ala) cDNA plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth M. Yamada (Craniofacial Developmental Biology and Regeneration Branch, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Myc (empty) and Myc-Akt1 (K179M) dominant-negative (Lys-179 → Met) cDNA plasmid were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The cDNA encoding Rho (V14Rho), Rac (L61Rac), and cdc42 (V12cdc42) were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Hall (MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, Department of Biochemistry, University College of London, London, UK). RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage line capable of RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 24 h, GFP, GFP-PTEN (WT), GFP-PTEN (C124A; phosphatase dead mutant), Myc (empty), or Myc-Akt (K179M) dominant-negative expression vector were transiently cotransfected into the cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, the GFP- or GFP-PTEN (WT)- expressing cells treated with or without RANKL were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to observe cell morphology. Mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were prepared from the femur and tibia of 4–6-week-old C57BL/6 mice and incubated in tissue culture dishes (100-mm dishes) in the presence of recombinant mouse macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (20 ng/ml). After 24 h in culture, the non-adherent cells were collected and layered on Histopaque gradient, and the cells at the gradient interface were collected. The cells were replated (60-mm dishes) at 65,000/cm2 in αMEM, supplement with 10% heat-inactivated FBS in the presence of M-CSF (100 ng/ml). After 3 days in culture, cells were harvested for immunoblotting. 24–36 h after transfection, medium was removed, and cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then cultured in DMEM serum-free medium for 24 h. For RANKL (100 ng/ml) or OPN (25 μg/ml) stimulation experiments, RANKL or OPN were added to the culture medium and incubated for 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs) to prepare whole cell lysates. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked in 5% skim milk, 1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and probed with primary antibodies. For the detection of NFκB/p50, nuclear extracts were used instead of whole cell lysates. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs), bound immunoglobulins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). After cotransfected, cells were treated with RANKL (100 ng/ml). Then, whole cell lysates were prepared as above. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant fractions were harvested. Caspase-3 activity assay of cell extracts were measured using a kit (CaspACETM assay system; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured in a 60-mm dish (40 × 104 cells/5-ml dish) in DMEM containing 10% FBS overnight. Cells were then transfected with five expression vectors, respectively. After 24 h, media was removed, and cells were washed two times with PBS and then cultured in the above-mentioned medium with RANKL (100 ng/ml). After culturing for 2 days, cells were added to fresh medium and RANKL. Then, after culturing for 2 days, cells were fixed and stained for TRAP (30Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs) containing more than three nuclei were counted as osteoclasts under microscopic examination (31Itoh K. Udagawa N. Katagiri T. Iemura S. Ueno N. Yasuda H. Higashio K. Quinn J.M.W. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Takahashi N. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3656-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The cells (RAW cells or RAW cells with GFP-PTEN·WT) were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Rho-binding lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) to prepare whole cell lysates. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and equal volumes of lysates were incubated with the Rhotekin Rho binding domain (20 μg; Upstate Biotechnology) beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound Rho proteins were detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-Rho. Constitutively active Rho (V14Rho), Rac (L61Rac), and cdc42 (V12cdc42) were cloned in-frame into a bacterial expression vector, pTAT-HA, to produce TAT fusion proteins. The vector pTAT-HA has an N-terminal His6 leader followed by the 11-amino acid TAT protein transduction domain flanked by glycine residues, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag, and polylinker. The cDNAs encoding V14Rho, L61Rac, and V12cdc42 were cloned into the Tat-HA plasmid. High copy number plasmids were obtained by transformation of the pTAT-HA with V14Rho, L61Rac, and V12cdc42 in BL21. The purification protocol was adapted from the published procedure using a Ni-NTA column (32Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A.

Briefly, bacterial pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), and 8 m urea and sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10–20 mm and purified in the Ni-NTA column as described (32Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A.

Addition of 8 m urea to the sonication buffer allows for the isolation of insoluble protein in bacterial inclusion bodies and efficient transduction into cells. Bound proteins were eluted with stepwise addition of 5–10 ml each of 100, 250, and 500 mm and 1 m imidazole in the above buffer. Urea was removed by rapid display by using the Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce) or by the use of desalting PD-10 columns (Sephadex G-25; Amersham Biosciences). Cell migration assays were performed using transwell migration chambers (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) (10Chellaiah M. Soga N. Swanson S. McAllister S. Alvarez U. Wang D. Dowdy S.F. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11993-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Membranes with a pore size of 8 μm (Corning Inc.) were coated with OPN (25 ng/ml) at 4 °C overnight (haptotaxis) and dried under air. Approximately 5 × 104 cells (RAW cells with or without GFP, GFP-PTEN WT, GFP-PTEN C124A, Myc, or Myc-Akt K179M) were added to the upper chamber in DMEM containing 1% FBS and 2% bovine serum albumin (100 μl) and allowed to adhere for 1–2 h. After cells with GFP-PTEN (WT) attached to the membrane, TAT fusion protein was added to a final concentration of 100 nm in the upper chamber in the above medium (100 μl). Substrates such as OPN (25 μg/ml) were added to the lower chamber in DMEM containing 1% FBS and 2% bovine serum albumin (600 μl; chemotaxis). The cells were allowed to migrate for 12–14 h at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2. After the incubation period, nonmigrated cells on the upper side on the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Wells were fixed with an alcohol/formaldehyde/acetic acid mixture (20:2:1) for 15 min. Filters were stained with hematoxylin stain (Sigma), rinsed well with water, and dried. Dried filters were cut out and mounted with permount solution (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) on a glass slide. Cells were viewed under a ×40 objective in an inverted microscope and counted (Zeiss microscope). Data are presented as the number of cell-migrated fields (mean ± S.D.), and all assays were performed in triplicate. For the generation of whole cell lysates prepared from cells with or without RANKL (100 ng/ml) treatment, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs) to prepare whole cell lysates. The lysates were centrifuged and supernatants analyzed using PTEN malachite green assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RANKL activates PI3K/Akt survival signaling and activity of osteoclasts (17Hofbauer L.C. Heufelder A.E. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 19Wong B.R.

PTEN, a tumor suppressor, is frequently mutated in human cancers and is a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt survival signaling (1Tamura M. Gu J. Tran H. Yamada K.M. J. Nat.

Therefore, we examined whether PTEN regulates Akt survival signaling pathway in RANKL-treated RAW 264.7 osteoclast precursors. Activation of Akt and Bad has been implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (8Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev.

As shown in Fig. 1, RANKL activated Akt and Bad in 5 min in GFP-expressing cells (peaks at 5 min and 10 min, respectively), and the effects were blocked by GFP-PTEN (WT) expression (Fig. 1,A and B). Moreover, RANKL altered cell morphology in RAW 264.7 osteoclast precursors with and without GFP (Fig. 1 C). RANKL-treated GFP-PTEN (WT)-expressing cells revealed no obvious morphological change (Fig. 1 C). In most cell types, mobilization of NFκB involves phosphorylation IκB-α serine residues 32/36, resulting in ubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitory protein (34Huxford T.

https://openalex.org/W1963638190,"The structure of a sunspot is determined by the local interaction between magnetic fields and convection near the Sun's surface. The dark central umbra is surrounded by a filamentary penumbra, whose complicated fine structure has only recently been revealed by high-resolution observations. The penumbral magnetic field has an intricate and unexpected interlocking-comb structure and some field lines, with associated outflows of gas, dive back down below the solar surface at the outer edge of the spot. These field lines might be expected to float quickly back to the surface because of magnetic buoyancy, but they remain submerged. Here we show that the field lines are kept submerged outside the spot by turbulent, compressible convection, which is dominated by strong, coherent, descending plumes. Moreover, this downward pumping of magnetic flux explains the origin of the interlocking-comb structure of the penumbral magnetic field, and the behaviour of other magnetic features near the sunspot."

The ACDS β subunit contains nickel and an Fe/S center and reacts with acetyl-CoA forming an acetyl-enzyme intermediate presumably directly involved in acetyl C–C bond activation. To investigate the role of nickel in this process two forms of the Methanosarcina thermophila β subunit were overexpressed in anaerobically grown Escherichia coli. Both contained an Fe/S center but lacked nickel and were inactive in acetyl-enzyme formation in redox-dependent acetyltransferase assays. However, high activity developed during incubation with NiCl2. The native and nickel-reconstituted proteins both contained iron and nickel in a 2:1 ratio, with insignificant levels of other metals, including copper. Binding of nickel elicited marked changes in the UV-visible spectrum, with intense charge transfer bands indicating multiple thiolate ligation to nickel. The kinetics of nickel incorporation matched the time course for enzyme activation. Other divalent metal ions could not substitute for nickel in yielding catalytic activity. Acetyl-CoA was formed in reactions with CoA, CO, and methylcobalamin, directly demonstrating C–C bond activation by the β subunit in the absence of other ACDS subunits. Nickel was indispensable in this process too and was needed to form a characteristic EPR-detectable enzyme-carbonyl adduct in reactions with CO. In contrast to enzyme activation, EPR signal formation did not require addition of reducing agent, indicating indirect catalytic involvement of the paramagnetic species. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Cys-278 and Cys-280 coordinate nickel, with Cys-189 essential for Fe/S cluster formation.

A mechanism for C–C bond activation is proposed that includes a specific role for the Fe4S4 center and accounts for the absolute requirement for nickel. The methanogenic Archaea utilize a unique metabolic pathway for degradation of acetate under anaerobic conditions, and cleavage of acetate thereby accounts for a major proportion of the methane formed in the environment. The central reaction in this pathway is carried out by an unusual multienzyme complex, designated acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase (ACDS), 1The abbreviations used are: ACDS, acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase; H4SPt, tetrahydrosarcinapterin; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CODH/ACS, CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase which contains five different polypeptide subunits and accounts for as much as 25% of the soluble protein in species such as Methanosarcina thermophila and Methanosarcina barkeri growing on acetate. The ACDS complex catalyzes cleavage of the acetyl C–C bond using the substrates acetyl-CoA and tetrahydrosarcinapterin (H4SPt), a tetrahydrofolate analog which serves as methyl acceptor, and yields the products CoA,N 5-methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin, CO2, and two reducing equivalents, as given in Reaction 1 (1Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22227-22233Google Scholar). acetyl­CoA+H4SPt+H2O⇄CoASH+CH3­H4SPt+CO2+2H++2e−REACTION 1 This overall reaction is made up of a series of partial reactions catalyzed by different protein subcomponents of the ACDS complex as shown in Scheme FS1 (2Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA binds to the β subunit, and under low redox potential conditions, as required for activity, transfers the acetyl group to a nucleophilic center on the enzyme forming an acetyl-enzyme species and releasing CoA (Scheme FS1, acetyl transfer) (2Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Google Scholar, 3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar). The acetyl intermediate then undergoes C–C bond cleavage by a reaction that is presumed to involve metal-based decarbonylation and/or methyl group migration (Scheme FS1, cleavage). The nascent methyl group is then transferred to a corrinoid cofactor present on the γδ subcomponent, which catalyzes subsequent methyl transfer to the substrate H4SPt (Scheme FS1, methyl transfer) (2Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Google Scholar). The carbonyl group is oxidized to CO2 by a process involving the αε CO dehydrogenase subcomponent, with regeneration of the reduced form of the β subunit. Previous studies on the β subunit have focused on a C-terminally truncated form of the protein purified from the native ACDS complex following partial proteolytic digestion (2Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Google Scholar, 3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar, 4Murakami E. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4699-4707Google Scholar). The genes encoding the five ACDS subunits are arranged together in an operon along with one additional open reading frame in all species ofMethanosarcina and in certain other methanogens as well (5Maupin-Furlow J.A.

The operon structure is shown in Scheme FS2, with the designated genes and corresponding subunit molecular masses indicated for M. thermophila TM-1. The additional open reading frame encodes an accessory protein thought to be involved in nickel insertion, and nickel is present in both the large CO dehydrogenase subunit α (CdhA) and in the β subunit (CdhC) containing the active site for acetyl-enzyme formation. In addition to nickel, CdhA and CdhC also contain iron in the form of Fe/S clusters. Early indications that the β subunit contains a unique Ni-Fe/S center, the spectroscopically designated A cluster, came from studies on detergent dissociation of the clostridial CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase enzyme (CODH/ACS), an α2β2 heterodimer, with α subunit homologous to the β subunit from methanogens (10Xia J. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6037-6042Google Scholar, 11Xia J. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 483-484Google Scholar). When reacted with CO in the presence of a reducing agent, the isolated clostridial α subunit exhibited an EPR spectrum similar to the A cluster NiFeC signal found in earlier studies on the intact ACDS complex and the native clostridial CODH/ACS enzyme (11Xia J. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 483-484Google Scholar). Characterization of the ability of the ACDS β subunit to bind acetyl-CoA and CoA, and to catalyze acetyl group transfer reactions by way of a high energy acetyl-enzyme intermediate formed on the enzyme at low redox potentials (3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar), and other studies (4Murakami E. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4699-4707Google Scholar), further implicated the β subunit A center as the site where acetyl C–C bond activation takes place. Functional preparations of the clostridial α subunit have now been obtained that catalyze acetyl-CoA formation from CoA and CO in the presence of methylated clostridial corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (12Loke H.-K. Tan X. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8667-8672Google Scholar). Recently, a crystallographic structure of the clostridial CODH/ACS enzyme was published in which the A center was shown to contain an Fe4S4 cluster in close proximity to a binuclear metal site containing nickel and another metal ion suggested to be copper (13Doukov T.I. Iverson T.M. Seravalli J. Ragsdale S.W. Drennan C.L. Science. 2002; 298: 567-572Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to characterize the role of the β subunit in cleavage of the acetyl C–C bond and to better understand the role of nickel at the active site. Therefore, we developed methods to generate large quantities of the protein using recombinant techniques to overexpress the ACDS β subunit inEscherichia coli under anaerobic growth conditions. UV-visible spectroscopic analyses were employed to investigate the kinetics and stoichiometry of nickel binding to the β subunit apoprotein. The requirements for nickel were established for activity in acetyltransferase, and for the ability to form the C–C bond of acetyl-CoA in the absence of all other protein components. EPR analyses were used to examine the role of nickel in forming a paramagnetic A-center enzyme-CO adduct, with the non-requirement for reducing agent indicative of the oxidation state of nickel in the NiFeC species, relevant to indirect involvement of this species in the mechanism of C–C bond activation. In efforts to define the nickel and Fe/S coordination environments site-directed mutagenic analysis was employed to identify amino acid residues providing ligands to nickel and iron. Additional insight into the structure and catalytic function of the Ni-Fe/S active center was obtained from spectroscopic and enzymological characterization of the mutants. The absolute requirement for nickel and a defined role for the Fe/S center are incorporated in a mechanism proposed for C–C bond activation that is consistent with the properties of the Ni-Fe/S center described here and in accordance with findings from previous investigations. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Unless otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were from Sigma and of the highest purity grade offered. All solutions were prepared using Milli-Q deionized water (Millipore Corp.). Anaerobic procedures were performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen containing 1–3% H2 using a Coy-type anaerobic chamber. Oxygen levels were monitored by a Teledyne model 3190 trace oxygen analyzer and were typically in the range of 0.5–2 ppm O2. Previously we determined the complete sequence of the ACDS operon from M. thermophila strain TM-1 (GenBankTM accession number AF173830). The gene for the full-length ACDS β subunit (cdhC) and a truncated form of the gene coding for a protein lacking 75 amino acids at the C terminus (cdhC*) were overexpressed using a modified version of the pQE60 (Qiagen) vector from which the His6 tag was deleted, designated pQE60ΔHis. Modifications to remove the His6tag were as described previously (14Gencic S. LeClerc G.M. Gorlatova N. Peariso K. Penner-Hahn J.E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13068-13078Google Scholar). PCR amplifications ofcdhC and cdhC* were performed using genomic DNA as template isolated from M. thermophila strain TM-1 with forward primers incorporating an NcoI site and reverse primers containing a BamHI site. PCR products were initially subcloned into the plasmid pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). After digestion with NcoI and BamHI and purification by agarose gel electrophoresis, the eluted fragments were cloned into the pQE60ΔHis vector, previously cut with NcoI andBamHI. E. coli strain M15 [pREP4] was then transformed with the pQE60ΔHis expression constructs and used for overexpression as described below. Site-directed mutagenesis ofcdhC* was performed using the QuikChange Multisite-directed Mutagenesis kit, according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The sequences of all genetic constructs and bordering regions were verified by sequencing of isolated plasmid DNAs using the method of dideoxynucleotide termination with the ABI PRISM Big-Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit version 3.0 with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS (Applied Biosystems). Overexpression of the wild type and all mutant forms of the ACDS β subunit was carried out by growth at 31 °C under strictly anaerobic conditions in Luria-Bertani medium containing 1% glucose and 40 mm sodium fumarate as electron acceptor. Hydrogen gas evolved during growth was allowed to escape through a 22-gauge syringe needle fitted to one of two ports constructed in the stopper used to seal the culture vessels. A second port provided the means to remove aliquots for monitoring the growth and for required additions. Cultures were inoculated at 1:100 using an anaerobic starter culture grown overnight. About 3 h later, after reaching an OD600 nm of 0.7–0.9, the cells were induced by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Research Organics) and immediately supplemented with iron, sulfide, and nickel, 100 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 200 μm Na2S, and 5 μmNiCl2 added from sterile, anaerobic stock solutions. The cultures were further supplemented after 2 and 4 h following induction. These subsequent additions were needed to provide sufficient iron, as was evident from small amounts of black iron sulfide that remained in the final cell pellets under these conditions, but not when either lower levels or fewer additions of iron and sulfide were employed. Cells were harvested by centrifugation under anaerobic conditions 5 h after induction (at an OD600 nm of around 2–2.5), and the cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crude buffer-soluble extracts were prepared by French press cell lysis at 20,000 pounds/square inch at 4 °C of 6.5 g of cell paste resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris·SO4, 25 mm Na2SO4, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and the lysate was centrifuged at 34,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. These steps as well as all others subsequently used for purification of various forms of the ACDS β subunit were performed under anaerobic conditions. The supernatant obtained following centrifugation was applied at ∼1.6 ml/min to a 12 × 2.5 cm diameter column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris·SO4, 25 mm Na2SO4, pH 7.5) at room temperature. The column was then washed with ∼270 ml of buffer A and eluted with 400 ml of linear gradient of 0–0.4 mNa2SO4 in buffer A. Fractions (8 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and for UV-visible absorbance. Fractions with the maximum absorbance ratioA 400 nm/A 280 nm and displaying the highest purity on SDS gels were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon stirred cell, and diafiltered to remove salt and low molecular mass contaminants. Samples were adjusted to contain 10% glycerol prior to storage by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein was determined on the basis of absorbance at 280 nm using an absorptivity coefficient for CdhC of 72,300m−1 cm−1 (66,600m−1 cm−1 for CdhC*) obtained from the expression 1.03 × (5550 ΣTrp + 1340 ΣTyr + 150 ΣCysnon-cluster) + 4500 ΣCysFe/S-cluster, modified from the original method of Perkins (15Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Google Scholar) to include the number of cysteine residues involved in Fe/S clusters in order to account for absorbance contributed by Fe/S clusters. Comparable results were obtained from protein measurements performed by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Metal analyses were carried out by ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy using a Thermo Jarrell-Ash 965 AtomComp plasma emission spectrometer on samples submitted to the University of Georgia, Research Services, Chemical Analysis Laboratory. Purified recombinant CdhC at a concentration of 7–35 μm that contained iron but lacked nickel was reconstituted with Ni2+ by incubation under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 100 μmNiCl2 in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at different times, diluted with sufficient water to give 1.4 μm CdhC, and immediately assayed by transferring 10 μl of the diluted sample to 110 μl of acetyltransferase assay solution, and the reactions were completed as described below. Large scale reconstitution of the enzyme employed 60–80 μm CdhC* and 180 μmNiCl2 in reaction volumes of up to 12 ml. Sufficient time was allowed for metal incorporation (as determined in separate trials), and the reaction mixtures were thereafter concentrated to 1.3 ml by ultrafiltration on an Amicon YM30 ultrafiltration membrane, 44.5 mm diameter. Excess Ni2+ was removed by applying the concentrated enzyme to a 1.5-cm diameter, 10-ml bed volume column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in 40 mm HEPES, 10 mm Na2SO4, pH 7.2, and 1.0-ml fractions were collected. The protein was recovered in three brown fractions, which were combined and reconcentrated to yield a preparation of holoenzyme at a final concentration equal to that of the starting apoenzyme. The ability of recombinant CdhC to catalyze redox-dependent transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA (acetyltransferase) was measured by a modified method similar to that described previously (3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 100 μm acetyl-CoA, 100 μm3′-dephospho-CoA, 50 μm aquocobalamin, 4.0 mmTi3+-EDTA, 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2. Reactions were carried out in 12 × 75-mm glass tubes at 25 °C and were initiated by addition of a 10-μl aliquot of sufficiently diluted protein to 110 μl of an assay solution that contained all the above components at concentrations needed to give the final values indicated in a total reaction volume of 120 μl. A series of reactions were carried out for each enzymatic rate determination and stopped at different time points (from 0 to 8 min) by addition of 120 μl of 2 mm TiCl3 in 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 4.0, and the mixtures were frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to analysis by HPLC for the products CoA andS-acetyl-3′-dephospho-CoA. HPLC analyses and calculation of reaction rates were performed as described previously (3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar). Net synthesis of acetyl-CoA by the recombinant ACDS β subunit from carbon monoxide, CoA, and methylcobalamin was measured in reaction mixtures containing 0.65–3.9 μm nickel-reconstituted CdhC, 500 μm methylcobalamin, 100 μm CoA, 1 mm Ti3+-citrate in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, under an atmosphere of 100% CO at room temperature. Reactions were initiated by addition of CdhC and were followed over time by removal of aliquots that were mixed with an equal volume of 2 mm TiCl3 in 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 4.0, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently analyzed by HPLC for the formation of acetyl-CoA. Metal ion incorporation into nickel-deficient CdhC* in titration experiments was monitored spectrophotometrically on the basis of increase in absorbance around 336–340 nm observed due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer band formation when the nickel-deficient protein was exposed to different divalent metal ions in the late 3d transition series. Titration of 16.4 nmol of CdhC* contained in 590 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, was carried out in a semi-microspectrophotometer cuvette by addition of 5.0-μl aliquots of 1.20 mm stock solutions of divalent metal ions (e.g. MnCl2, Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, CoCl2, NiCl2, CuSO4). UV-visible scans were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A spectrophotometer set up inside the anaerobic chamber. After addition of each aliquot of divalent metal solution, scans were recorded over time until no further changes were observed in the spectrum. The gene encoding the β subunit of the ACDS complex from M. thermophila was overexpressed in two separate forms in E. coli. One of these was the full-length 472-amino acid protein, CdhC, and the other was a 397-amino acid form truncated at the C terminus, CdhC*. CdhC* includes all major regions of conservation among β subunit homologs and is about 30 amino acids smaller than the estimated size of the native protein isolated in truncated form following disruption of the ACDS complex by partial proteolysis (2Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Google Scholar, 3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis showed that similar amounts of CdhC and CdhC* were produced over time after induction of E. coli cultures grown under anaerobic conditions, as described under “Materials and Methods.” However, CdhC was considerably less soluble than CdhC* as found by analysis of cell extracts and fractions from subsequent purification procedures. Yields of the purified proteins were around 3 mg per g of cell paste for CdhC versus 20–22 mg per g of cells for CdhC*. As shown in Fig. 1, Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography of the supernatant obtained from an extract of E. coli expressing CdhC* resulted in elution of a major peak of protein with absorbance at 280 and at 400 nm (due to Fe/S clusters), with fractions containing highly purified CdhC*. The final preparation consisting of the pooled and concentrated peak fractions was ∼90–92% pure as judged by densitometric analysis of SDS gels (Fig. 1, inset). Samples analyzed for metal content by plasma emission spectroscopy contained 2.7 to 3.0 g atom of iron per mol of CdhC*, but nickel was not detected, even though 5 μm NiCl2 had been added to the growth medium. Samples of purified CdhC and CdhC* were assayed for acetyltransferase activity to determine their ability to react with acetyl-CoA under low redox potential conditions generating an acetyl-enzyme intermediate. As isolated, both recombinant proteins showed very low levels of acetyltransferase activity, less than 1% of the specific activity of the native β subunit. However, high activity was found for both proteins, CdhC and CdhC*, after incubation with Ni2+. A progressive increase in activity was observed over time, reaching a maximum after several hours of incubation of CdhC, 7.1 μm, with NiCl2, 100 μm, as shown in Fig. 2. Activation of the enzyme under these conditions in which [Ni2+] ≫ [apoCdhC] followed pseudo-first order kinetics with an apparent half-time for activation of about 32 min. Activity in the assay showed absolute dependence on low redox potential, as expected, because it is a characteristic property of the subunit isolated from the ACDS complex (3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar). Turnover rates for acetyl transfer were up to 1250 min−1 for CdhC and 4500 min−1 for CdhC*, as compared with the value of 3100 min−1 (3Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Google Scholar) for the native β subunit isolated from the ACDS complex. Plasma emission spectroscopic analyses on samples of the β subunit isolated from the ACDS complex and on samples from large scale nickel reconstitution of CdhC* showed significant levels of iron and nickel but only trace amounts of other metals. In particular, levels of copper were extremely low, as shown in Fig. 3. Notably, the measured iron/nickel ratio was 1.9 for nickel-reconstituted CdhC*, and a similar value of 2.2 was observed for the isolated β subunit. These results indicate that binding of nickel is required for activation of the enzyme and that the enzyme contains iron and nickel in a ratio of ∼2:1. Therefore, direct spectrophotometric methods were developed to examine further the interaction of nickel with the β subunit. Preparations of the brown, iron-containing, nickel-deficient β subunit (CdhC and CdhC*) exhibited absorbance at around 400 nm typical of a simple Fe/S protein with minimum values for the ratioA 280 nm/A 400 nm of around 5.1. Upon addition of NiCl2 a marked, time-dependent change was observed in the UV-visible spectrum of the recombinant protein resulting in a final spectrum closely resembling that of the subunit isolated from the ACDS complex. Difference spectra obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the apoenzyme from that of the nickel-reconstituted protein showed a sharp peak of absorbance increase centered around 332–336 nm and a broader peak at around 550 nm, as shown in Fig.4 A (middle panel). A third peak with the highest intensity was found at 262 nm (not shown). These features are attributed to ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorption formed when nickel binds to the enzyme, with multiple S ligation indicated by the high values of molar absorptivity. In addition, similar features were observed for the enzyme after incubation with other divalent first row transition metals including Co2+ and Cu2+, Fig. 4 A(top and bottom panels), with lower intensityd-d transitions at 680 and 720 nm found in the spectrum of the Co2+-substituted protein. Titration of the β subunit apoprotein (CdhC*) was carried out with various different metal ions using the changes in absorbance to monitor the extent of binding. The results, shown in Fig. 4 B, indicated that Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+bind to the β subunit with end points all significantly greater than 1 eq. The values for Ni2+ and Cu2+ were close to 2, indicating a stoichiometry of 2 g atom of nickel per mol of CdhC*. Evidence for binding of Mn2+ and Fe2+was also obtained; however, much higher levels were required to saturate the enzyme, suggesting a weaker affinity for these metals. Acetyltransferase assays were performed on samples removed after the titrations and showed expected high levels of activity in the presence of nickel; however, no activity could be detected with any of the other metals (including manganese, iron, cobalt, and copper). These results indicate that the enzyme is capable of binding other divalent metal ions at the nickel sites, involving multiple thiolate ligation, but that only nickel is able to generate the active enzyme. The kinetics of nickel binding to the β subunit were monitored spectrophotometrically by following the increase in absorbance over time after a single addition of excess Ni2+ to CdhC*. Under conditions in which the concentration of CdhC* was significant relative to [Ni2+], the reaction followed second order kinetics in which the rate was dependent upon the concentration of both apoenzyme and [Ni2+], with an apparent second order rate constant of ∼3 × 10−4 μm−1min−1, as shown in Fig. 5. These results agree with the time course for activation of the enzyme in Fig. 2 in which [Ni2+] ≫ [apoenzyme], corresponding to pseudo-first order conditions, indicating that activation is limited by the rate of nickel binding. Nickel reconstitution at pH 7.2 (Fig. 5) was much faster than at pH 6.5 but markedly slower than the reaction at pH 8.0. The magnitude of these differences was consistent with deprotonation of more than one cysteine thiol"
https://openalex.org/W2005248423,"The saliva of the blood-feeding insectRhodnius prolixus contains numerous pharmacologically active substances. Included among these are a number of lipocalin proteins that bind various ligands important in hemostasis and inflammation. One such protein is a biogenic amine-binding protein (ABP) that binds serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Based on amino acid alignments, it is most similar to the nitrophorin group of lipocalins found in the same insect species. Physiologically, this protein appears to act as both a vasodilator and platelet aggregation inhibitor. This protein inhibits smooth muscle contraction of the rat uterus in response to serotonin and of the rabbit aorta in response to norepinephrine. Platelet aggregation induced by a combination of low concentrations of ADP and either serotonin or epinephrine is inhibited because of the binding of serotonin and epinephrine. Potentiation of aggregation induced by low concentrations of collagen along with serotonin or epinephrine is also inhibited. Dissociation constants for biogenic amines were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry and the Hummel-Dreyer method of equilibrium gel filtration. In this manner, K d values of 102, 24, and 345 nm were found for serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, respectively. Molecular modeling of ABP suggests that ligand binding is mediated by interaction with the side chains of aromatic amino acids and charged residues that line the binding pocket.

The structure of lipocalins is characterized by an 8-stranded β-barrel having a generally hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket in its interior (8Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The entry to the binding pocket is surrounded by a number of flexible loops that can modulate binding through ligand-induced conformational changes (9Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Roberts S.A. Montfort W.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Andersen J.F. Ding X.D. Balfour C. Shokhireva T.K. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10118-10131Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A common mechanism of action for salivary lipocalins is the removal of small molecule receptor agonists from the feeding area (7Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Harlos K. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.I. Mol.

High affinity binding of the pharmacologically active compounds histamine and ADP by the lipocalins nitrophorin and RPAI-1, respectively, has been demonstrated in R. prolixus (4Ribeiro J.M.C. Walker F.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Serotonin and catecholamines are important mediators of platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction, and inflammatory processes. Serotonin is contained in the dense granules of platelets and is released upon stimulation by various agonists. It acts to increase vascular permeability and is itself also a weak platelet agonist, leading to the activation of phospholipase C. The catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine, released by local nerves, cause vasoconstriction in response to bleeding. Epinephrine also potentiates platelet aggregation by a Gi-dependent signaling mechanism, leading to a decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity (12Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The inhibition of serotonin-induced smooth muscle contraction byR. prolixus salivary extracts has been shown. However, its mechanism remains to be determined. In this study, a lipocalin-encoding sequence that was encountered frequently during the random sequencing of a R. prolixus salivary gland library has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was refolded and shown to be a biogenic amine-binding protein. It was found to bind serotonin as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine. It inhibits the serotonin-mediated contraction of the rat uterine horn, and the norepinephrine-mediated contraction of the rabbit aorta. During feeding, this protein also appears to function as a platelet-aggregation inhibitor by sequestering the agonists serotonin and epinephrine secreted by activated platelets and neural sources. It also may act to inhibit inflammatory responses at the feeding site by binding these proinflammatory molecules. Serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were obtained from Sigma. The MicroFast Track mRNA preparation kit was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), and the SMART library construction kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). A salivary gland cDNA library was prepared using the SMART cDNA library construction system (13Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2429-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Valezuela J. Pham V. Garfield M. Francischetti I. Ribeiro J.M.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1101-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was prepared from 4 pairs of R. prolixus salivary gland pairs (5, 7, 10, and 14 days after blood feeding) using the MicroFast Track system. The cDNA for the ABP was cloned as part of an expressed tag sequencing project in which ∼500 clones from the R. prolixus salivary gland library were partially sequenced. The ABP sequence was recognized as encoding a previously uncharacterized lipocalin and was well represented in the library. Using the ABP N-terminal sequence as a guide, the cDNA was modified to exclude the 5′-untranslated region and the region encoding the signal peptide. The modifications were performed using PCR with the primer CGCACCATATGGCATCTGGTTGTTCTACTGTGGATACTG. The resulting PCR product had a methionine (ATG) codon directly upstream of the first codon of the mature polypeptide. The PCR product was cloned into the vector PCR 2.1 and sequenced. An NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end of the cDNA, added as part of the PCR mutagenesis, enabled its insertion into the expression vector pET 17b. The expression construct was then moved into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys-E. For the production of protein, 4 liters of LB broth were inoculated with the expression strain and shaken at 250 rpm and 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm was about 0.7. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm and the flasks were shaken under the same conditions for another 3 h. At the end of this period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The cell pellet was suspended in 100 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cells were lysed using a probe sonicator. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g and 10 °C for 20 min. Analysis by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue showed the protein to be present as inclusion bodies. The insoluble pellet was extracted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The extracted pellet was washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with each wash followed by centrifugation. The protein was solubilized in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 10 mmdithiothreitol. This material was diluted to 250 ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m arginine. After centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against 2 changes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The dialyzed sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration, centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and purified by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-100 (16/60 column, Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl for elution. Longitudinal contractions of isolated pieces of rat uterus horns (animals were primed 24 h before dissection with 50 μg of stilbestrol) were recorded isotonically with transducers from Harvard Apparatus Inc. (Holliston, MA). Muscles were suspended in a 0.5-ml bath kept at 30 °C, using the solution recommended by Gaddum et al. (15Gaddum J.H. Peart W.S. Vogt M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1949; 108: 467-481Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rabbit aortic ring contractions were evaluated isometrically using transducers from the same company. The bath was kept at 37 °C, and Tyrode's solution was used (16Webster M. Prado E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 681-699Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Additions to the bath were never greater than 5% of the volume of the bath. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by platelet pheresis from medication-free platelet donors at the DTM/NIH blood bank under the direction of Dr. S. Leitmann, as described (17Francischetti I.M. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, after addition of 0.2 units/ml of apyrase, platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at 1100 × g for 15 min and washed twice by centrifugation in Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mmMgCl2, 5.55 mm, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Platelets were resuspended in apyrase-free Tyrode's buffer, containing 0.5 mg/ml fibrinogen and adjusted to a concentration of 200,000–400,000 platelets/μl. Washed human platelets (300 μl) were placed in a Chrono-Log Lumi-aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA) and stirred at 1,200 rpm at 37 °C for 1 min followed by addition of reagents as indicated in figure legends. In some experiments, platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 50 μm indomethacin for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a washing procedure as described above. To measure binding of ABP to serotonin, ABP was injected in a Pharmacia Superdex Peptide HR/10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) perfused at 0.5 ml/min with 0.15 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, and the indicated concentrations of serotonin. The column was equilibrated with at least 5 volumes of the solution before injection of ABP. The eluent absorption was monitored at 280 nm by an absorbance detector (model SM4100 from ThermoSeparation Products, Rivera Beach, FL), and the total area under the ABP peak determined. The fluorescence emission of the eluent at 340 nm (excitation at 280 nm) was also measured using a fluorescence detector (model FL 3000 from the same company), and the total area of the fluorescence under the ABP peak determined. Previously, we have evaluated binding of nucleotides to proteins by the blue shift of the absorbance when the nucleotide is bound to the protein. Accordingly, measuring the absorption of the eluent in 2 wavelengths allowed estimation of binding constants (7Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Francischetti I.M. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this case, binding of serotonin does not change the position of the spectral maximum from its position at 290 nm. The fluorescence emission increases because of the binding, however, thus the measurement of the ratio of the fluorescence emission to the absorbance at 280 nm allows estimation of binding. Binding of serotonin to the protein increases the absorbance of the protein at 280 nm, but the fluorescence increase is greater than the absorbance increase, and thus their ratio represents a relevant measurement because the ratio of two hyperbolae is represented by another hyperbola. Theoretically, the fluorescence result alone would be sufficient to estimate an increase in binding, but using the ratio normalizes for several sources of error such as pipetting volumes, column band spreading, etc. Three independent column runs were made for each serotonin concentration tested. The change in the fluorescence emission at 340 nm divided by the absorbance at 280 nm following serotonin binding was modeled as described earlier (7Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Francischetti I.M. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by a hyperbolic equation of the type, R=Ro+{(Rm−Ro)·[L]/(K0.5+[L])}Equation 1 where r = observed fluorescence to absorbance ratio; R o = ratio in the absence of a ligand;R m = ratio when protein is saturated with ligand;K 0.5 = ligand concentration determining ½ of sites occupied in the protein; and [L] = molar concentration of the ligand. A bootstrap method was used to evaluate the affinity of ABP to serotonin (17Francischetti I.M. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3810-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ITC measurements were made on a Microcal (Northhampton, MA) VP-ITC calorimeter. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the dialysis buffer was used to prepare solutions of ligands, to dilute the protein, and to evaluate the baseline heats of dilution. All solutions were degassed under vacuum before use. Protein at concentrations between 1 and 5 μm, depending on the experiment, was inserted in the cell, and ligand at concentrations of 10–50 μm was used in the syringe. Heats of binding were measured at a temperature of 25 °C. After subtraction of the measured heats of dilution, the net enthalpy data were analyzed with a single-site binding model using the Microcal origin software package (18Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Vogel H.J. Calcium-binding Protein Protocols. 173. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 121-126Google Scholar). A homology-based molecular model of ABP was constructed based on the coordinates of the nitrophorin 2 crystal structure (19Andersen J.F. Montfort W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30496-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with all water and heme atoms removed (Protein Data Bank accession number 1EUO). The model was constructed by an automated procedure using the web-based SwissModel (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-27623Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). Equivalent positions in nitrophorin 2 and ABP were determined by alignment. The resulting model was minimized by 200 cycles of steepest descents followed by 300 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. Serotonin coordinates were added to the model and positioned manually using the Insight II (MSI, San Diego, CA) modeling software. ABP was first detected in a survey of expressed tag sequences from a R. prolixussalivary gland cDNA library. It was part of a group of related clones encoding putative lipocalins of unknown function (Fig. 1). Members of the group were encountered frequently, suggesting that the mRNAs were present in high abundance. Analysis using the Signal-P algorithm (21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Rrunak S. Heijne G.V. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), as well as alignments with known lipocalin sequences from R. prolixussaliva, showed a signal sequence to be present indicating that the protein is probably secreted into the saliva. A subsequent proteomic analysis of R. prolixus salivary gland homogenate that combined chromatographic separation of salivary components with N-terminal Edman degradation confirmed that members of this group were present in the saliva. 2J. M. C. Ribeiro, unpublished observation. The signal peptide cleavage position was also confirmed by this analysis. The ABP is most closely related to the nitrophorin group of lipocalins that is also found in R. prolixus. Alignment of the amino acid sequence with the published nitrophorin sequences shows ABP to match at least one of the four nitrophorins at 84 of 196 amino acid positions (Fig. 2); however, the degree of identity with any single nitrophorin sequence does not exceed 23%. This is consistent with the low identity levels commonly seen among members of the lipocalin group. The alignment of all four cysteine residues in ABP with their nitrophorin counterparts suggests that two disulfide bonds are present that correspond in position to those seen in crystal structures of nitrophorins 1, 2, and 4. A second group ofR. prolixus salivary lipocalins, typified by the ADP-binding protein RPAI-1, is less similar to ABP, having six cysteines and three apparent disulfide bonds. The ABP shares only 11% identity with a serotonin-histamine-binding lipocalin recently isolated from the saliva of the tick Dermacentor reticulatus, with a different distribution of cysteine residues, suggesting that the functional relationship between these two molecules is because of convergence rather than common lineage (22Sangamnatdej S. Paesen G.C. Slovak M. Nuttall P.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 2002; 11: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). ABP was expressed at high levels in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies. After solubilization in guanidine and reduction with dithiothreitol, the protein was folded by dilution in arginine-containing buffer, followed by dialysis. Gel filtration chromatography produced purified ABP as a soluble monomer. Because the protein is related to the heme-containing nitrophorins, heme was added to a portion of the refolded ABP followed by gel filtration chromatography. Monitoring of the eluent at both 280 and 405 nm indicated that no heme was associated with the monomeric protein (data not shown). Serotonin is a known mediator of mammalian uterine contraction via interaction with the 5-HT2A receptor. R. prolixus salivary homogenates and a partially purified salivary protein have been shown to inhibit this activity. In this study, both the R. prolixus salivary gland homogenate (results not shown) and the purified, reconstituted recombinant ABP completely abrogated the response of the rat uterus to serotonin when supplied in sufficient quantity (Fig. 3). When 25 μg of ABP was added to the uterine preparation, no response to incremental additions of serotonin were seen until the cumulative concentration of agonist in the bath just exceeded the concentration of ABP (Fig. 3). The approximate 1:1 protein-agonist stoichiometry required for minimal inhibition suggests that each molecule of ABP binds a single molecule of serotonin (Fig. 3). Replacement of the saline solution containing ABP with fresh solution caused the preparation to regain its normal response to serotonin, indicating that the inhibition is reversible (Fig. 3). Norepinephrine is important in the maintenance of vascular tone by inducing the contraction of smooth muscle via interaction with α-adrenergic receptors. The release of norepinephrine at sympathetic presynaptic membranes in response after wounding leads to rapid vasoconstriction (23Bond R.F. Johnson G.J. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 281-289PubMed Google Scholar). Scavenging of norepinephrine would benefit a feeding insect by inhibiting vasoconstriction, thereby allowing unimpeded blood flow to the feeding site. The effect of ABP on norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was evaluated using a rabbit aortic ring preparation. Addition of ABP (to a concentration of 2 μm) to a preparation stimulated to contract with 1 μm norepinephrine caused relaxation that began immediately after addition of protein (Fig. 4). When the protein was removed from the bath, the preparation could again be induced to contract by addition of agonist. This reversible antagonism of norepinephrine is consistent with binding of this compound by ABP. Serotonin and epinephrine are secreted by platelets upon activation as constituents of the dense granules. Serotonin is an agonist of platelet aggregation acting through activation of the 5-HT2A receptor (12Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Binding to this receptor activates phospholipase C, resulting in platelet shape change, but not aggregation. Serotonin alone has the effect of potentiating aggregation induced by subthreshold levels of other agonists such as collagen and ADP. Given in combination with epinephrine, an agonist of α2-adrenergic receptors, serotonin induces an aggregation response. Epinephrine alone does not produce a detectable effect on platelet aggregation, but like serotonin it potentiates the effect of other agonists (12Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We evaluated the effects of ABP on platelet aggregation in the presence of serotonin and epinephrine. When platelets are treated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, the effects of added serotonin and epinephrine on platelet activation can be evaluated in the absence of thromboxane A2 secretion. This limits the contribution of secreted agonists, such as ADP to platelet activation. ABP was found to completely eliminate, in a concentration-dependent manner, the shape change response of washed, indomethacin-treated human platelets to serotonin, consistent with the observed serotonin-binding activity of the protein (Fig. 5 A). Conversely, ABP had no effect on platelet shape change induced by low concentrations of ADP or on the aggregation response induced by higher agonist concentrations, indicating that ADP does not bind with ABP (Fig. 5 B). Serotonin and epinephrine are important as potentiators of platelet agonists such as ADP and collagen. When ADP is administered to indomethacin-treated platelets at concentrations below the threshold for platelet aggregation, only shape change is seen (Fig. 5 C). At higher concentrations of ADP, an aggregation response is observed (Fig. 5 C). However, when low concentrations of ADP are added along with serotonin or epinephrine, a full aggregation response is seen, indicating that serotonin and epinephrine potentiate the response to ADP. In the presence of ABP, no potentiation of aggregation by serotonin or epinephrine is observed (Fig. 5, C and D). This suggests binding of these two compounds by ABP eliminates any potentiation of the ADP response. A similar effect is observed on the potentiation by serotonin or epinephrine of collagen-mediated aggregation of nonindomethacin-treated platelets (Fig. 6, A andB). The results indicate that in the natural physiological system, where thromboxane A2 synthesis is not suppressed, ABP increases the threshold concentration of collagen necessary for an aggregation response. The binding affinity of ABP for serotonin was determined using both the Hummel-Dreyer method of equilibrium gel filtration and ITC. Fig. 7 shows a modified Hummel-Dreyer analysis of serotonin binding when the ligand concentration changed from 10 nm to 3 μm. The changes in optical properties were saturable with increasing ligand concentration, and allowed determination of a dissociation constant of 201 ± 71 nm. ITC was used to evaluate the binding of serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (Fig. 8). The results show that the primary amine norepinephrine binds with the highest affinity (K d = 24 ± 6 nm) whereas the secondary amine epinephrine binds with ∼10-fold lower affinity (K d = 345 ± 67 nm). The affinity for serotonin is intermediate with a K d value of 102 ± 38 nm, agreeing reasonably well with the result of the Hummel-Dreyer experiment. Analysis of the ITC data using a single-site binding model gave binding stoichiometries (N) of 0.85 ± 0.07, 0.80 ± 0.01, and 1.28 ± 0.03 for serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, respectively; this further strengthened the evidence for a single binding site for each ligand. To determine whether serotonin and the catecholamines bind to separate sites, the heats generated on titration of ABP with norepinephrine were measured in the presence of saturating (1 mm) concentrations of serotonin. After correcting for heats of dilution, no significant binding of norepinephrine could be detected, suggesting that identical, or considerably overlapping, binding sites are used for both serotonin and the catecholamines. The ABP sequence was aligned with that of nitrophorin 2 and modeled using the SwissModel automated program with the coordinates for the nitrophorin 2 crystal structure (Fig. 9). The resulting model shows the seventh strand of the β-barrel moved toward the center of the protein relative to the template, reducing the volume of the binding pocket. A molecule of serotonin, manually inserted into the protein, is surrounded by the side chains of the aromatic residues Phe59, Tyr111, and Tyr133, which stabilize the ligand via pi-pi interactions. Situated in this manner the aliphatic amino group of the serotonin molecule would be further stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the carboxylates of Glu57 and Asp113 as well as the hydroxyl group of Tyr88 (Fig. 9). The lipocalin fold is employed in many salivary functions that involve ligand binding and protein-protein interactions (24Montfort W.R. Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 18: 110-118Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 18: 92-101Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Three majorR. prolixus salivary lipocalin groups have been characterized to date. The nitrophorins are a group of heme-binding nitric oxide transporters that also bind histamine with high affinity (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M.H. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). RPAI-1 is a high affinity ADP-binding protein that also binds a variety of other adenosine derivatives (7Francischetti I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Champagne D. Andersen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12639-12650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Finally, ABP binds the biogenic amines serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. On a structural level, the propensity of lipocalins to bind so many ligand types derives from the flexibility of the β-barrel structure and its ability to tolerate considerable amino acid side chain variability while maintaining its fold (8Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons with other R. prolixus lipocalins show that ABP is most closely related to the nitrophorins (6Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Montfort W.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The positions of the cysteine residues are equivalent in the two groups, suggesting that the disulfide bonding pattern is the same in the two (Fig. 2). However, the proximal histidine residue (His59 of nitrophorin 1), which coordinates with the heme iron atom and is located on the third β-strand of the nitrophorins, is replaced with Asn61 (in the fully processed protein) in ABP. Consequently, ABP shows no ability to bind heme. ABP and the nitrophorins are apparently derived from a common ancestor through gene duplication events. Divergence of the two protein forms has resulted in highly different ligand-binding specificities and, consequently, very different functional roles. The high affinity binding of two structurally different amine types, having either hydroxyindole or catechol nuclei in the same binding site, suggests flexibility in the ABP-binding pocket. In the crystal structure of a histamine-binding lipocalin from saliva of the tickRhiphicephalus appendiculatus, pi-pi stacking interactions are important for the binding of aromatic ligands. In each of the two histamine-binding sites, the planar imidazole ring of histamine is stabilized by aromatic amino acid side chains (11Paesen G.C. Adams P.L. Harlos K. Nuttall P.A. Stuart D.I. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The aliphatic amino group is also stabilized by electrostatic interactions with a number of polar and acidic side chains, as well as ordered water molecules. Like the tick proteins, ABP contains numerous aromatic side chains that would be expected, from the results of alignments and modeling studies, to pack the ligand binding pocket. These side chains could potentially stabilize any appropriately sized aromatic group, and allow for the relatively broad specificity for various aromatic ligands displayed by ABP. When ABP is modeled based on the nitrophorin 2 crystal structure, the putative ligand binding pocket is seen as a cleft lined with the side chains of Phe45, Phe59, Tyr111, Tyr133, and Tyr135. When serotonin is manually placed in the cleft, its indole nucleus is surrounded by three aromatic side chains (Fig. 9) that form both stacking and end-on interactions between the protein and ligand. The acidic side chains of Glu57 and Asp113 as well as the hydroxyl group of Tyr88 are appropriately positioned to stabilize the aliphatic amino group of the ligand. The model is, of course, hypothetical, but these types of binding interactions may explain the combination of submicromolar binding affinity with the relative lack of specificity indicated by the ability to accommodate both hydroxyindole and catechol-type amines in the same binding site. Serotonin and catecholamines play important roles in numerous biologic processes. Inhibition of many of these would be of obvious benefit to a blood-feeding insect. The release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system occurs on wounding and results in the constriction of blood vessels to prevent blood loss. The highly abundant nitrophorins shuttle the vasodilator nitric oxide from the R. prolixus salivary gland to the host skin, and are apparently the primary mechanism for increasing blood flow around the feeding site. However, the binding of norepinephrine by ABP may complement the effect of nitric oxide by preventing an antagonistic constriction response. A functionally similar role is played by the salivary catechol oxidase of the mosquito Anopheles albimanus. This enzyme destroys norepinephrine oxidatively and apparently serves as a vasodilator (26Ribeiro J.M.C. Valenzuela J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 809-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of platelets by strong agonists such as thrombin or collagen induces the release of dense granules that contain the weak agonists ADP, serotonin, and epinephrine. Aggregation induced by weak agonists requires activation of phospholipase C and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via a Gi-coupled receptor pathway. At high concentrations, ADP stimulates both pathways sufficiently to induce aggregation. At low concentrations, only shape change is seen because of stimulation of phospholipase C via the P2Y1 receptor. Serotonin activates the phospholipase C pathway via the 5-HT2Areceptor but not the Gi-dependent pathway, and consequently induces only shape change when administered alone (12Jin J. Kunapuli S.P.

Epinephrine binds with Gi-coupled adrenergic receptors, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, and eliciting no detectable aggregation response by itself (12Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Administration of serotonin or epinephrine, along with low concentrations of ADP, induces a complete aggregation response, apparently by increasing the level of stimulation to the necessary signal transduction pathways (Fig. 5). Notably, addition of serotonin or epinephrine along with subthreshold levels of collagen produces a full aggregation response, indicating that these molecules are active in reducing the concentration threshold for collagen-mediated aggregation (Fig. 6). The presence of ABP in the circulation would therefore cause a localized increase in the agonist threshold concentration for platelet aggregation. This protein would act in concert with RPAI-1, the ADP-binding protein, and salivary apyrase to reduce the concentration of weak agonists in the vicinity of the feeding site, thereby attenuating the overall stimulus for platelet aggregation. Hemostasis and inflammation are complex and redundant host reactions (1Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ribeiro J.M.C. Schneider M. Jurberg I.T. Galvao J.

ABP is the latest such component to be described. Many of these antagonists act on the same physiologic processes, such as platelet aggregation, but are aimed at different biochemical pathways. Based on the properties of individual components of R. prolixus salivary secretion, an increasingly complex model is emerging to describe the interactions between the insect and the host hemostatic system. Nitrophorins released into the blood and skin provide a burst of nitric oxide that dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M.H. Nussenzveig R.H.

Nitrophorin 2 acts as a specific inhibitor of coagulation by interacting with the proteolytic factor Xase complex (28Ribeiro J.M.C. Schneider M. Guimaraes J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ABP binds norepinephrine and inhibits the host vasoconstriction response to blood loss. When platelets are activated and the contents of dense granules are released, ABP binds the agonists serotonin and epinephrine, whereas salivary apyrase degrades the agonist ADP (29Sarkis J.J.F. Guimaraes J.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Trace amounts of ADP are removed by binding with lipocalin RPAI-1 (7Francischetti I.M.

Additionally, any inflammation that may induce a defensive response from the host is inhibited via histamine binding by the four nitrophorins (4Ribeiro J.M.C. Walker F.A. J. Exp.

It is caused by an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat encoding polyglutamine in the atrophin-1 gene. Both patients and DRPLA transgenic mice have nuclear accumulation of atrophin-1, especially an ∼120-kDa fragment, which appears to represent a cleavage product. We now show that this is an N-terminal fragment that does not correspond to the previously described caspase-3 fragment, or any other known caspase cleavage product. The atrophin-1 sequence contains a putative nuclear localization signal in the N terminus of the protein and a putative nuclear export signal in the C terminus. We have tested the hypothesis that endogenous localization signals are functional in atrophin-1, and that nuclear localization and proteolytic cleavage contribute to atrophin-1 cell toxicity. In transient cell transfection experiments using a neuroblastoma cell line, full-length atrophin-1 with 26 (normal) or 65 (expanded) glutamines localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm, with no significant difference in toxicity between the normal and mutant proteins. A construct with 65 glutamine repeats encoding an N-terminal fragment (which removes an NES) of atrophin-1 similar in size to the truncation product in DRPLA patient tissue, showed increased nuclear labeling, and an increase in cellular toxicity, compared with a similar fragment with 26 glutamines. Full-length atrophin-1 with 65 polyglutamine repeats and mutations inactivating the NES also yielded increased nuclear localization and increased toxicity. These data suggest that truncation enhances cellular toxicity of the mutant protein, and that the NES is a relevant region deleted during truncation. Furthermore, mutating the NLS in the truncated protein shifted atrophin-1 more to the cytoplasm and eliminated the increased toxicity, consistent with the idea that nuclear localization enhances toxicity. In none of the experiments were inclusions visible in the nucleus or cytoplasm suggesting that inclusion formation is unrelated to cell death. These data indicate that truncation of atrophin-1 may alter its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, leading to abnormal nuclear interactions and cell toxicity.

DRPLA is one of at least eight disorders, including Huntington's disease and several forms of spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA), involving a polyglutamine expansion. These disorders are thought to occur through a genetic “gain of adverse function” mechanism (9Housman D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10MacDonald M.E.

Atrophin-1, the DRPLA gene product, encodes a hydrophilic 1184-amino acid protein (12Yazawa I. Nukina N. Hashida H. Goto J. Yamada M. Kanazawa I. Nat.

The sequence of atrophin-1 contains a putative NLS in its N terminus and a putative NES in its C terminus. The atrophin-1 protein normally localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells and its function is unknown (12Yazawa I. Nukina N. Hashida H. Goto J. Yamada M. Kanazawa I. Nat.

Degeneration and cell death in DRPLA occurs mainly in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, red nucleus, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus. Neurons in these regions show atrophin-1 containing inclusions and diffuse nuclear labeling. Therefore atrophin-1 expression levels alone do not explain the pathogenesis. The cellular site of toxicity in HD and DRPLA is controversial. Inclusions are predominantly nuclear in DRPLA (17Becher M.W. Ross C.A. Movement Disorders. 1998; 13: 852-853PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sato A. Shimohata T. Koide R. Takano H. Sato T. Oyake M. Igarashi S. Tanaka K. Inuzuka T. Nawa H. Tsuji S. Hum. Mol.

In some cell model studies of HD, an exogenous NLS or an exogenous NES was fused to the huntingtin protein, and cellular toxicity was correlated with nuclear location (22Peters M.F. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Kushi J. Seaman H.J. Cooper J.K. Herring W.J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Saudou F.

Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cleavage of atrophin-1 may also be relevant to pathogenesis, although the nature of the relevant cleavage product is uncertain. Igarashiet al. (25Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M.

In transient transfection of COS-7 cells, small truncated constructs of atrophin-1 with expanded repeats caused cellular toxicity, whereas full-length or long fragments of atrophin-1 with normal or expanded repeats did not (25Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M. Hayashi Y. Takano H. Date H. Oyake M. Sato T. Sato A. Egawa S. Ikeuchi T. Tanaka H. Nakano R. Tanaka K. Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These data suggest that generation of a short truncation fragment (which could diffuse into the nucleus) can lead to the formation of nuclear inclusions and cellular toxicity. Studies in HD have also indicated that short truncations of huntingtin are toxic (23Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E.

However, the DRPLA disease model mice and DRPLA patient tissue show a relatively large cleavage fragment of mutant atrophin-1, running in a gel at about 120 kDa (28Schilling G. Wood J.D. Duan K.

It is not known whether a fragment of this length could be toxic. Caspase cleavage of atrophin-1 at Asp109 can generate a large C-terminal fragment (30Miyashita T. Miyashita T. Okamura-Oho Y. Mito Y.

We have made several constructs to study the role of nuclear targeting and truncation of atrophin-1 in toxicity related to DRPLA. Our goal was to determine whether the putative endogenous NLS and NES sequences in atrophin-1 are functional, and whether a truncation fragment of the approximate size and site of cleavage seen in patients and transgenic mice enhances nuclear transport and cellular toxicity. Full-length constructs were prepared previously (13Margolis R.L. Li S-H. Young W.S. Wagster M.V. Stine O.C. Kidwai A.S. Ashworth R.G. Ross C.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and are in pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen). At-N917–26Q and At-N917–65Q were generated by restriction digest at uniqueBsrGI and XbaI sites blunt-ending, recircularizing, and deleting the region from BsrGI toXbaI. The NLS (amino acids 16–32) in atrophin-1 was mutated using PCR-based mutagenesis and designated At-N917–26Q-mNLS or At-N917–65Q-mNLS and the NES (amino acids 1033–1041) was mutated using PCR-based mutagenesis (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar) and designated At-FL-26Q-mNES or At-FL-65Q-mNES. Mouse Neuro-2a (N2a) cells were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Opti-MEM I supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 per well of one-well chamber slides (Nunc), cultured overnight, and transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA (At-FL-26Q, At-FL-65Q, At-N917–26Q, At-N917–65Q, At-N917–26Q-mNLS, At-N917–65Q-mNLS, At-FL-26Q-mNES, or At-FL-65Q-mNES) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. Cells were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 1 h in 5% normal goat serum. Rabbit polyclonal antibody AP 142 was used to detect the atrophin-1 or an anti-Myc antibody was used to detect the Myc epitope tag at the N terminus of the atrophin-1 constructs. Cells were incubated with antibody for 3 h at 37 °C. Washed cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) diluted 1:250. ToTo-3 (Molecular Probes) was used as a nuclear marker. Coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were viewed on a Noran confocal microscope. Atrophin-1 constructs were transcribed using T7 polymerase and then translated using thetnt system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translations were incubated with 10–50 ng of each of the caspases for 2 h in the following buffer: 20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, at 37 °C. Protein concentrations were assayed by the dye-binding method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples were solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then sonicated for 20 s, and microcentrifuged for 1 min prior to loading. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). Transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 10% methanol; and the blots were probed with anti-atrophin-1 antibody AP142, AP302, or Apg840 (34Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L.

Bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). N2a cells were cultured and transfected and immunofluorescence was performed as described above. N2a cells transfected with each of the atrophin-1 constructs were assessed by randomly selected fields and at least 100 cells per condition were counted. Cells were scored based on nuclear, nuclear and cytoplasmic, or cytoplasmic staining using standard epifluorescence on a Zeiss microscope. Each condition was assessed at least three times. N2a cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 and cotransfected with 0.5 μg of DNA for GFP and 0.5 μg of DNA for LacZ or atrophin-1 constructs (At-FL-26Q, At-FL-65Q, At-N917–26Q, At-N917–65Q, At-N917–26Q-mNLS, At-N917–65Q-mNLS, At-FL-26Q-mNES, or At-FL-65Q-mNES). GFP positive fluorescent cells were counted 48 h later by capture on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope via IP Spectrum Labs image analysis software. Each experiment contains cells from 10 randomly selected fields from each of three wells. Mean ± standard deviations are taken from at least three different experiments. As a measure of cell loss, GFP positive cells were counted in each condition and standardized to the LacZ condition (22Peters M.F. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Kushi J. Seaman H.J. Cooper J.K. Herring W.J.

We have previously shown that this measure of cell loss correlates with cell death as measured by propidium iodide to label dead cells and Hoechst 33342 to label total cells (22Peters M.F.

Plasmids purified in separate preparations gave similar results. The atrophin-1 protein with sequences relevant to this study is shown at the top of Fig. 1. Atrophin-1 is a 1184-amino acid protein with a glutamine repeat near the middle of the protein. It contains a putative NLS in its N terminus (amino acids 16–32) and a putative NES in its C terminus (amino acids 1033–1041) (see below). The recognition site for antibody AP302 is amino acids 1–15 and for antibody AP142 or APG840 is amino acids 425–439, which is near the glutamine repeat on the N-terminal side (34Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To identify which broad regions of atrophin-1 determine its cellular localization, four deletion constructs were generated: one coding for only the N-terminal 455 amino acids (which contains the putative NLS), two coding for only amino acids 416–731 (with either 26 or 65 glutamines), and one coding for amino acids 640–1184 (which contains the putative NES) (Fig. 1). N2a cells were transfected and immunofluoresence was performed 48 h later. The N-terminal construct localized to the nucleus, whereas the other three constructs were cytoplasmic (Fig.2), suggesting the existence of a functional NLS in the N terminus of the protein, and consistent with an NES in the C terminus of the protein. Because DRPLA forms nuclear aggregates and the putative NLS is in the N terminus, we performed a Western blot analysis on nuclear extracts from transgenic mice to confirm that the truncation product contains the N terminus, using an antibody to the N terminus (AP302) and an antibody to an epitope near the glutamine repeat (APG840). Fig.3 demonstrates the full-length protein of both alleles in the transgenic mice migrating at ∼190–200 kDa, and a band representing the truncation product, running at about 120 kDa (28Schilling G.

The truncation band is broader than the full-length bands, consistent with our previous observation that the fragment runs as a doublet, and that there is cleavage product accumulation over time (28Schilling G. Wood J.D. Duan K. Slunt H.H. Gonzales V. Yamada M. Cooper J.K. Margolis R.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Ross C.A.

Thus this truncation product contains the N terminus and lacks the C terminus. This is consistent with the N-terminal NLS being relevant for the abnormal nuclear localization seen in DRPLA. To address the question of whether the truncation product is caused by caspase cleavage, atrophin-1 protein was generated by in vitro translation and incubated with caspase 1–10 (Fig.4). Consistent with previous data, caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, and -8 can cleave wild type atrophin-1 (30Miyashita T. Miyashita T. Okamura-Oho Y. Mito Y. Nagafuchi S. Yamada M. J. Biol.

When the putative caspase-3 site at Asp109 is mutated, all but caspase-6 cleavage is abrogated (Fig. 4). This suggests that caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, and -8 cleave at Asp109 and that caspase-6 also cleaves at another site, which is currently unknown. We then compared the fragment in the DRPLA mouse model with the caspase fragments. When 293T extracts expressing full-length atrophin-1 with 65 glutamines were subjected to caspase-3, -6, or -7 treatment, the Western blot showed a band corresponding to full-length atrophin-1 in the absence of any caspase enzymes and a band migrating faster in the presence of these caspase enzymes, representing a cleavage product (Fig. 5). However, the product in each caspase condition is larger than the truncation seen in the transgenic mice, indicating that the cleavage product does not arise from any of the caspases known to cleave atrophin-1. Next we generated constructs to determine whether the putative NLS and putative NES are functional, and to determine the effect of a truncation similar in size and location of truncation to the cleavage product seen in DRPLA transgenic mice and patient postmortem tissue. A consensus bipartite NLS is 2 basic amino acids, a 10-amino acid spacer, followed by 3–5 basic amino acids. A consensus NES is a hydrophobic amino acid, followed by 2–4 amino acids, a hydrophobic amino acid, 2 amino acids, a leucine, an amino acid, and a hydrophobic amino acid. Consensus NLS and NES sequences are present in atrophin-1 (Fig6). Two full-length constructs with 26 or 65 repeats (At-FL-26Q and At-FL-65Q, respectively) (Fig. 7) were generated to determine whether the putative localization signals functioned in the context of atrophin-1 and to determine whether the localization of the protein influenced toxicity. We generated two constructs truncated at amino acid 917 with 26 or 65 repeats (At-N917–26Q and At-N917–65Q, respectively) (Fig. 7). This length was chosen because it removed the NES and should produce a product at least as large as, or slightly larger than, the 120-kDa fragment of mutant atrophin-1 seen in mice and DRPLA patients (Fig.8). Fig. 8 shows At-N917–65Q running at ∼120 kDa, demonstrating that At-N917–65Q is slightly larger than the truncation product seen in the mice and human patient tissue, and thus also too large to diffuse passively into the nucleus. Therefore, At-N917–65Q is reasonable to study in cell model experiments. Two constructs truncated at amino acid 917, and with the NLS mutated (At-N917–26Q-mNLS and At-N917–65Q-mNLS), were generated, to determine whether the NLS is functional and if nuclear localization is related to toxicity (Fig. 7). Finally, two full-length constructs with the NES mutated were generated (At-FL-26Q mNES and At-FL-65Q mNES), to determine whether the NES is functional and whether eliminating it would enhance nuclear localization and cellular toxicity (Fig.7). Immunofluorescence and subcellular localization of these constructs in N2a cells transfected with full-length atrophin-1, At-FL-26Q or At-FL-65Q was quantified to determine the effect of altering the endogenous targeting signals (Figs. 9 and10). Staining in most cells was in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. When atrophin-1 was truncated, removing the NES, At-N917–26Q, and At-N917–65Q showed predominately nuclear staining. Similar to the results from the truncation products, when the NES was mutated, At-FL-26Q-mNES or At-Fl-65Q-mNES showed predominately nuclear staining. When the NLS was mutated in the truncated product (At-N917–26Q-mNLS or At-N917–65Q-mNLS) most cells showed cytoplasmic staining (Figs. 9 and 10). In none of these experiments were there inclusion bodies or other large aggregates of atrophin-1, either in the nucleus or cytoplasm. These data suggest that both the putative NLS and NES are functional in the context of atrophin-1.Figure 10Quantification of cellular distribution of atrophin-1 constructs. Percent of N2a cells transfected with atrophin-1 constructs with localization to different cellular compartments. These data suggest that both the NLS and NES function in the context of atrophin-1. One-hundred cells were counted for each construct per experiment and the average of three experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell toxicity assays were performed using each of the constructs described above to determine the relationship between subcellular localization and cell death. Western blots using antibody AP 142 showed that each of these constructs yields expression at approximately the same levels (Fig. 8 and data not shown) and therefore, we can directly compare each construct for cellular toxicity. We did not detect any aggregation at the top of the Western blot, consistent with the lack of nuclear inclusions or other visible aggregates in our transient cell transfection assay. Cell viability was determined by co-transfecting an atrophin-1 construct with GFP as a marker for transfected cells (22Peters M.F. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Kushi J. Seaman H.J. Cooper J.K. Herring W.J.

Acholeplasma laidlawii andEscherichia coli membrane lipids are metabolically designed to yield a bilayer “window” with certain features between the gel and nonbilayer phases (1Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 16198-16207Google Scholar, 2Morein S. Andersson A.-S. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Google Scholar). In A. laidlawii this aims at maintaining (i) a certain lipid bilayer surface charge density and (ii) a constant radius of spontaneous curvature (elastic packing stress), including similar bilayer/nonbilayer transition temperatures (1Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 16198-16207Google Scholar, 3Österberg F. Rilfors L. Wieslander Å. Lindblom G. Gruner S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 18-24Google Scholar). Regulation of (i) and (ii) resides mainly at the polar headgroup level (4Wieslander Å. Karlsson O.P. Curr. Top. Membr. 1997; 44: 517-540Google Scholar), whereas in E. coli curvature is regulated at the acyl chain level (2Morein S. Andersson A.-S. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Google Scholar), with more or less constant headgroup composition. The bilayer-forming glucolipid α-diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG)1 is one of the major lipids in the small cell wall-less A. laidlawii, the other is the nonbilayer-prone α-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG),cf. pathway below. Another pathway leads from phosphatidic acid to phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Under certain circumstances more acylated, and more nonbilayer-prone, variants of MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG, i.e. MAMGlcDAG and MADGlcDAG, respectively, are synthesized (5Andersson A.-S. Rilfors L. Lewis R.N. McElhaney R.N. Lindblom F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 43-49Google Scholar). A. laidlawiican only synthesize saturated acyl chains, and to still be able to adapt to membrane stress and new environments, the amounts of the two major glucolipids are strongly adjusted to maintain a functional membrane bilayer. The MGlcDAG-synthesizing enzyme alMGS (EC 2.4.1.157) ((i) above) was recently cloned (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar) and found to be a surface-associating protein with no transmembrane segments, where bilayer binding was dependent on phosphatidylglycerol and stimulated by small amounts of nonbilayer lipids. 2L. Li, submitted for publication. This seemed logical given the strong involvement of this enzyme in the lipid surface charge regulation, i.e. (i) above (8Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Google Scholar). The 1,2-diacylglycerol-3-α-glucose (1 → 2)-α-glucosyl transferase (DGS) (EC 2.4.1.208) catalyzes the consecutive transfer of glucose from UDP-Glc to MGlcDAG to yield DGlcDAG (cf. (ii) above). This reaction is activated in an essential manner by certain anionic lipids and stimulated by other additives promoting nonbilayer tendencies both in vivo (1Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjölund M. Wikander G. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 16198-16207Google Scholar, 9Wieslander Å. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7511-7517Google Scholar) and with crude or pure enzymes in vitro (10Vikström S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Google Scholar, 11Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar), keeping or restoring bilayer packing conditions. Furthermore, an additional modulation of the activity is achieved by certain phosphorylated metabolites, double-stranded DNA (12Vikström S. Li L. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9296-9302Google Scholar), and by a low redox potential (7Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Google Scholar). Due to their small polar headgroups, nonbilayer-prone lipids of the reversed type, like MGlcDAG, make the two monolayers in a bilayer each want to curl concavely toward the water phase. This induces a curvature elastic stress (increased spontaneous curvature), with an increased chain order and a closer approach to a bilayer-nonbilayer phase transition. Similar packing features can be inferred for the major galactolipids in the membranes of chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria (13Dörmann P. Benning C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 112-118Google Scholar). A number of peripheral and integral membrane proteins are functionally affected by this lateral stress, but for none the exact mechanisms are known (14Ho C. Slater S.J. Stagliano B. Stubbs C.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10334-10341Google Scholar), although correlation with the lipid properties is very evident (e.g. Refs. 15Attard G.S. Templer R.H. Smith W.S. Hunt A.N. Jackowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9032-9036Google Scholar, 16Davies S.M.A. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10522-10531Google Scholar, 17Botelho A.V. Gibson N.J. Thurmond R.L. Wang Y. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6354-6368Google Scholar). Hence, a question of large importance is how the A. laidlawii DGS is able to sense the curvature stress and respond by increased or decreased synthesis of DGlcDAG. The cloned gene (this work) yielded an active enzyme from E. coli, and the deduced amino acid sequence and the predicted secondary and three-dimensional structure models strongly indicate this enzyme to be, unexpectedly, very similar in structure and surface association as the preceding MGlcDAG synthase (glucosyltransferase) and several other glycosyltransferases. Hence, the bilayer/nonbilayer lipid balance, and the connected bilayer physical forces, are sensed at the bilayer surface by the DGlcDAG synthase. Data base searches revealed a new group of related lipid glycosyltransferases in Gram-positive bacteria and archaea. Functional cloning of CpoA from Streptococcus pneumoniae suggests this group to be responsible for synthesis of α-diglycosyldiacylglycerols in a number of species. However, CpoA responds differently to the properties of the surrounding bilayer, and the latter is substantiated by certain differences in the enzyme structure models. A. laidlawii strain A-EF22 was grown in 28 °C in tryptose/bovine serum albumin medium (11Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.12 mm oleic acid (18:1c). The cells were harvested, and the DNA was prepared with the GenomicPrepTM kit (Amersham Biosciences). TheS. pneumoniae strain 19FCCUG 3030 was grown in Todd-Hewitt medium, pH 7.8 at 37 °C overnight. The DNA was prepared by heating the resuspended cell pellet at 95 °C for 10 min. After the subsequent centrifugation, the DNA was present in the supernatant. Degenerated DNA primers were made based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified A. laidlawii DGlcDAG synthase (alDGS) determined through Edman degradation (10Vikström S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Google Scholar). An internal sequence was also determined after proteolytic cleavage and fragment purification by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The primers 5′-GGT CGT GCT TTT TAT CA(C/T) CA(A/G) AAA-3′ and 5′-AAT AAC AGC ACC (A/G)TC IAC (A/G)TG-3′ were used in a PCR amplification procedure that resulted in a ∼600-bp DNA fragment. The PCR products were purified and ligated into the pCR-Script SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) linearized withSrfI and then sequenced. The purified PCR product was also radioactively labeled by α-35S-dATP and used as a probe in a Southern blot procedure with completelyHindIII/EcoRI digested DNA from A. laidlawii. The hybridization results were visualized by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant ImagerTM). The DNA fragments with corresponding size to the hybridization band were purified and ligated into the pCR-Script SK(+) cloning vector and transformed into E. coli TOP 10F heat-shock competent cells. Positive clones were found by colony replicating to nitrocellulose filter and hybridization (18$$Google Scholar) with the radioactively labeled probe. The nucleotide sequence of the inserted DNA fragment was determined using both gene-specific and vector-specific primers with ABI PRISM® Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Using these results, a construct was made where the geneALdgs from A. laidlawii A-EF22 strain was cloned into a pET15b-vector and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). This recombinant was used for the enzymatic assays. The gene coding for the spDGS in S. pneumoniae(cpoA), identified with the alDGS aa sequence in a computer search, was isolated by PCR with the primers 5′-TAG TTA TGG AGA AAA AGA AAT TAC G-3′ and 5′-TAC CTC ACT TTT TAC TTT CTC CC-3′, which bind to the Shine-Dalgarno and stop codon sequence regions, respectively. The PCR product was purified, ligated into a SmaI-digested pCR-script vector, and transformed into TOP10F. Syntheticrac-1,3-dioleoylglycerol (1,3-DOG) was purchased from Larodan (Malmö, Sweden). The MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG were prepared as described (8Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Google Scholar). Synthetic α-MGalDAG was obtained from Dr. D. Mannock (cf. Dahlqvist et al. (11Dahlqvist A. Nordström S. Karlsson O.P. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13381-13389Google Scholar)). Synthetic DOPA and DOPG were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and CHAPS detergent from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein expression in the recombinant strains was performed in 1× LB medium supplemented with 100 μg of carbenicillin/ml. The strains were grown at 37 °C, and 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at OD600 = 0.75. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after another 16 h at 23 °C. Harvested recombinant E. coli cells were solubilized in assay buffer (110 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 22 mm MgCl2, and 22 mm CHAPS) to a total protein concentration of ∼1.3 mg/ml, by 4 × 30 s in a sonication bath and three times extensive vortexing during incubation on ice for 3 h, before enzymatic assays. In the standard assay for glycolipid synthesis 25 μl of protein solution (cf. above) was added to 20 μl of lipid micellar solution and incubated on ice for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was started by addition of 5 μl of UDP-[14C]galactose or UDP-[14C]glucose to a concentration of 1 mm (30 GBq mol−1) in a total volume of 50 μl. Standard lipid concentration was 10 mm (1 mm MGlcDAG substrate in addition to the activator DOPG (or CL) and the nonbilayer-prone 1,3-DOG, with DGlcDAG as balance). After 30 min of incubation at 28 °C, the reaction was stopped with 375 μl of methanol/chloroform 2:1 (v/v), and the lipids were extracted and separated by TLC (10Vikström S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Google Scholar, 19Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Google Scholar). The lipid products on the TLC plates were visualized and quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant ImagerTM). All assays were done in duplicate. A variety of glycolipids was used as TLC references (20Fisher W. Arneth-Seifert D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2950-2957Google Scholar). Full-size (398 aa), N- (aa 1–226), and C-domain (aa 227–398) alMGS, respectively, were cloned upstream and in-frame with the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a PCR primer approach based on the alMGS sequence (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar) and the vector pGFPuv (Clontech), in E. coli JM109. Ligation, transformation, and selection followed standard procedures, and the obtained constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Enzymatic activities of the hybrid proteins were analyzed after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside by labeling of E. coli lipids in vivo with radioactive acetate (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar) and by assay for MGlcDAG synthesis after detergent solubilization in vitro (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar). Localization of the MGS-GFP variants in E. coli was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy at various growth and induction conditions, using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope, fluorescein isothiocyanate filters, a CCD camera (Sony), and Image Access 3.0 software (Imagic Bildverarbeitung AG). To find homologs to the alDGS and to predict a function for the genes in flanking regions, PSI-BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) at NCBI in the nonredundant data base and the data base for finished and unfinished microbial genomes, was used. Preliminary genomic sequence data were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research. Features of the primary structure of the alDGS sequence were further analyzed with tools available at the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (www.expasy.ch) (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) and with the Wisconsin Package Version 9.1 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Potential secondary and three-dimensional structure models were predicted from aa sequences by several local structure (PsiPred, Target99, and Jpred2) and fold recognition methods (FFAS, 3D-PSSM, GenTHREADER, mGenTHREADER, INBGU, Sam-T99, and FUGUE) and jointly evaluated using the Pcons consensus method (22Lundström J. Rychlewski L. Bujnicki J. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2354-2362Google Scholar) at the MetaServer (www.bioinfo.pl) (23Bujnicki J.M. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2001; 17: 750-751Google Scholar). The scores stating the similarity between the obtained models are derived from Levitt and Gerstein (cf. Ref. 22Lundström J. Rychlewski L. Bujnicki J. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2354-2362Google Scholar). The aa sequences from several known glycosyltransferase structures were analyzed (“benchmarked”) in a similar manner (with PDB Test, www.bioinfo.pl) and the suggested PDB structures compared with the DALI method (24Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar). Structural models of the glycosyltransferases were built, based on the sequence alignments and recognized folds given by the MetaServer (above), using the Swiss-PdbViewer program for alignment (Version 3.7; www.expasy.ch/spdbv/) (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar) and the optimize-mode of the SWISS-MODEL program server (Version 3.5; www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html) for automatic model building. For the MGS sequences the three protein structures of ecMurG (PDB-ID 1F0K), ecEpim (PDB-ID 1F6D), and aoGtfB (PDB-ID 1IIR) were used as templates, while the DGS sequences were modeled with the first two (ecMurG and ecEpim) as templates. All five proteins were successfully modeled. Although the models obtained from the SWISS-MODEL server are already energy minimized, they were subjected to an additional global energy minimization. Prior to the final minimization a few side chains were adjusted as they were trapped within the ring of aromatic side chains, a situation an energy minimization would not be able to correct. For the global energy minimization the Swiss-PdbViewer implementation of the GROMOS96 43B1 force field was used, together with the SWISS-MODEL server minimization protocol, namely 200 steps of steepest descent, followed by 300 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The quality of the models was accessed using the WhatCheck program (26Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Google Scholar). Identification of secondary structure elements, calculation of the electrostatic surface potential, and visualization were made using the program MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar). The electrostatic potentials were calculated assuming point charges on heavy atoms, dielectric constants of 2 and 80 for protein and solvent, respectively, an ionic strength of 0.3 m, a 2-Å salt radius, and a boundary condition of zero potential at 15 Å. A solvent radius of 1.4 Å was used when the accessible van der Waals surfaces of the heavy atoms of each model were identified. The relative solvent accessibility of residues was calculated from their coordinates and divided into three groups; buried (0–5%), intermediate (5–25%) and exposed (25–100%) (28Pascarella S. de Persio R. Bossa F. Argos P. Proteins. 1998; 32: 190-199Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence data for A. laidlawii DGlcDAG synthase have been deposited at GenBankTM with accession number AY078412. The N-terminal and an internal amino acid sequence of the purified DGlcDAG synthase from A. laidlawii (alDGS) were determined by Edman degradation (10Vikström S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Google Scholar). Designed degenerated PCR primers yielded a gene-specific probe, which was used in a Southern blot procedure identifying a 2.2-kbp DNA fragment that was cloned. The sequence of this contig (TableI) revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 999 bp coding for the alDGS sequence named ALdgs (Fig.1) with a potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence starting at position −16. The G+C content was 33%, which is typical for A. laidlawii DNA (31.7–35.7% (29Herrmann R. Maniloff J. McElhaney R.N. Finch L.R. Baseman J.B. Mycoplasmas: Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1992: 157-168Google Scholar)). The translated ORF found just downstream the ALdgs gene was related to proteins from the aldo/keto-reductase family. The sequence further downstream show similarity to trigger factor, a conserved chaperone found in all prokaryotes. No ORFs in the opposite direction were found. The A. laidlawii contigs containing the preceding glucosyltransferase gene ALmgs cloned earlier (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar) and the ALdgs determined here (Table I) have no nucleotide sequence in common and were not localized to the same DNA fragment according to hybridization. Hence, it was concluded that these two glycosyltransferase (GT) genes are not adjacent to each other on the chromosome and do not belong to the same operon.Table IAnalysis of the content of flanking regions to DGS in A. laidlawiiPositionDbsourceaData base accession number; new GenBank™ entry for DGS is shown.Function/name, speciesE-valuebp−74 to −1Unknown+1 to +999gb AY078412DGS+1002 to +1803emb CAA11712Putative reductase protein Bacillus subtilis7E-42+1877 togb AAC82391Trigger factor (TF) Streptococcus pyogenes2E-5a Data base accession number; new GenBank™ entry for DGS is shown. Open table in a new tab BLAST searches in the finished/unfinished and the nonredundant data bases at NCBI with the alDGS amino acid sequence gave several significant hits in eubacteria and archaea (Table II). All the top hits were Gram-positive sequences, and most were from pathogenic species. The best score showed a gene in Enterococcus faecium with 49% aa identity to the alDGS, and sequences from streptococcal or other closely related species (Lactococcus) had an identity above 45%. These species do all contain an α-diglycosyldiacylglycerol identical to the A. laidlawii one (30Shaw N. Bacteriol. Rev. 1970; 34: 365-377Google Scholar, 31$$Google Scholar), and the sugar moieties are solely glucose. In the corresponding glycolipid from S. pneumoniae(cf. Table II) the outer glucose is replaced by a galactose. For the alMGS glucosyltransferase aa identities of 31 and 29% were recorded to similar enzymes in S. pneumoniae andBorrelia burgdorferi, and these were shown to encode homologous functions to the A. laidlawii enzyme (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar). Most important, alDGS and all the sequences of Table II contain the conserved EX 7E motif characteristic for the retaining (α) GTs of CAZy family 4 of glycosyltransferases (32Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Google Scholar); the preceding enzyme alMGS (cf. Introduction) also belongs to this family (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar). They also contain a typical motif for glycosyltransferases belonging to Pfam family 00534 (conserved domain search). Proteins in this family transfer nucleoside diphosphate-linked sugars, like glucose, galactose, mannose, and X-glucose, to a variety of acceptor substrates such as glycogen and lipopolysaccharides.Table IIDGS homologs/analogsRankaThese genes are followed by three genes fromListeria species and two from Pyrococcus species.

The BLAST searches revealed no proteins with an established function, since many of them are from recently published genome projects and so far lack annotation. However, the S. pneumoniae gene in Table II was first sequenced by Grebe et al. (33Grebe T. Paik J. Hakenbeck R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3342-3349Google Scholar) and namedcpoA. This protein was proposed to be involved in resistance to β-lactams and was isolated from first-step piperacillin-resistant mutants. The cpoA and the consecutive ORF5 gene, both part of the same operon, were suggested (but not shown) to be involved in formation of the linkage unit in lipoteichoic acid or polymerization of teichoic acid precursors prior to translocation (33Grebe T. Paik J. Hakenbeck R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3342-3349Google Scholar). We showed recently that this ORF5 encoded an enzyme homologous in function to alMGS (cf. step (i) in Introduction) and that was named spMGS. This enzyme was of similarly high sequence identity to alMGS as the CpoA protein is to alDGS (cf. Table II and Fig. 1). Most intriguing, the majority of organisms with a potential alDGS homolog (Table II) also encode a homolog to alMGS, according to BLAST sequence analyses (data not shown) (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar). The fact that the homologs of DGS and MGS genes in S. pneumoniae were adjacent to each other (above), potentially in an operon organization, was true also for most of the species in Table II. However, not for A. laidlawii and the related species Clostridium acetobutylicum and not for Pyrococcus furiosus (data not shown). Since the function of the S. pneumoniae MGS enzyme (i.e. ORF5, see above) has been verified (6Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Google Scholar), the adjacent gene cpoA was PCR-cloned (see “Materials and Methods”) to establish its function (cf. below). The BLAST searches also revealed analogs in the three archaeal speciesHalobacterium sp. NRC-1, Pyrococcus horikoshiiand P. furiosus (Table II); all sequences are of unknown function.

Upon agonist binding, C5a receptor (C5aR) undergoes rapid phosphorylation on the six serine residues present in the C-terminal region followed by desensitization and internalization. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestins (β-arr 1- and β-arr 2-EGFP) we show a persistent complex between C5aR and β-arrestins to endosomal compartments. Serine residues in the C5aR C terminus were identified that control the intracellular trafficking of the C5aR-arrestin complex in response to C5a. Two phosphorylation mutants C5aR-A314,317,327,332 and C5aR-A314,317,332,334, which are phosphorylated only on Ser334/Ser338 and Ser327/Ser338, respectively, recruited β-arr 1 and were internalized. In contrast, the phosphorylation-deficient receptors C5aR-A334,338 and C5aR-A332,334,338were not internalized even though observations by confocal microscopy indicated that β-arr 1-EGFP and/or β-arr 2-EGFP could be recruited to the plasma membrane. Altogether the results indicate that C5aR activation is able to promote a loose association with β-arrestins, but phosphorylation of either Ser334/Ser338 or Ser327/Ser338 is necessary and sufficient for the formation of a persistent complex. In addition, it was observed that C5aR endocytosis was inhibited by the expression of the dominant negative mutants of dynamin (K44E) and β-arrestin 1 (β-arr 1-(319–418)-EGFP). Thus, the results suggest that the C5aR is internalized via a pathway dependent on β-arrestin, clathrin, and dynamin.

Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It is abundantly expressed in myeloid cells and to a lower level in a variety of non-myeloid cells (3Zwirner J. Fayyazi A. Gotze O. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, the activation of chemoattractant receptors including the C5aR triggers a complex array of cellular functions that results in directed cell migration and release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (4Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These responses are highly regulated since, despite the persistent presence of chemoattractants, the intracellular signaling events are transient.As for many other GPCRs, this attenuated responsiveness is thought to result from receptor desensitization through their phosphorylation and rapid internalization. The current concept for GPCR desensitization, largely extrapolated from studies with rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor, is that, once activated and phosphorylated, the GPCRs form a stable complex with a family of adapters known as arrestins and β-arrestins (5McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence indicating that the formation of this complex is a general intermediate for endocytosis of most GPCRs. The β-arrestins interact with clathrin and the adapter protein complex AP-2 (6Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G.J. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of a GTPase-defective dynamin mutant blocks the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway in a dominant-negative manner (11Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), and the agonist-mediated internalization of most GPCRs is inhibited (12Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, some GPCRs appear to depart from this standard model and are capable of utilizing alternative pathways. For instance, the angiotensin II 1A and N-formyl peptide receptors, although able to interact with β-arrestins, can be internalized through a process independent of β-arrestin and dynamin (13Zhang J.

The internalization of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor appears to proceed through an atypical pathway that is independent of clathrin (18Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 739-746PubMed Google Scholar).It has been previously established that the activated C5aR is phosphorylated on the 6 serine residues located in the C-terminal tail at positions 314, 317, 327, 332, 334, and 338 (19Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19166-19172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutants with combined amino acid replacements exhibit different capacities to incorporate phosphate on the remaining serine residues (20Naik N. Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J.

Combined mutations at positions 332 and 334, at positions 334 and 338, or at all 3 positions yield phosphorylation-deficient mutants, whereas mutants for which the serine pairs Ser327/Ser338 or Ser334/Ser338 are conserved retain the capacity to be phosphorylated (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation step plays a key role in the attenuation of the cellular response since phosphorylation-deficient mutants trigger sustained intracellular signaling events that result in a significant increase in C5a-mediated superoxide production by neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the first membrane proximal serine residue is dispensable for receptor desensitization, and agonist sequestration is apparently independent of desensitization (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In the present study, we used confocal microscopy and the green fluorescent protein conjugate of β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and the dominant negative mutant β-arrestin 1-(319–418) to examine the cellular trafficking of a series of C5aR mutants in response to C5a. Our results demonstrate that a minimal level of phosphorylation is required for internalization through a dynamin-, arrestin-, and clathrin-dependent internalization pathway. Moreover, β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 were found to have differential abilities to associate with the activated receptor. In contrast to β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2 redistributed to the plasma membrane regardless of whether C5aR was phosphorylated provided it was activated.DISCUSSIONFor most GPCRs, the primary effect of agonist binding is to bring about a conformational change that triggers the coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and promotes the phosphorylation of the receptor and its interaction with the β-arrestin scaffolding proteins. In the present work, by using green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin 1 and 2, we find that C5a stimulated a striking and rapid redistribution of β-arrestin 1 and 2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane followed by the formation of a long-lasting complex between wild-type C5aR and both β-arrestins as evidenced by the co-localization of C5aR and β-arrestins on the same endosomal compartments. Similar agonist-mediated translocation and association to endosomes have been previously described with a variety of GPCRs (6Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G.J. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 23Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The co-trafficking of β-arrestins and C5aR to perinuclear vesicles was consistently best observed with β-arrestin 2, suggesting that this isoform has a higher affinity for the activated wild-type receptor. The persistent association of β-arrestins with intracellular vesicular compartments that contain internalized GPCRs is not a general rule. The stability of β-arrestin-receptor interactions seems to differ from receptor to receptor. For instance, although “class B” receptors, such as the angiotensin II type 1A and the neurokinin 1 receptors, colocalize with β-arrestin 2 on endosomal compartments, “class A” receptors including the β2-adrenergic, dopamine D1A, and endothelin type A receptors rapidly dissociate from β-arrestins, which remain confined to the plasma membrane (14Zhang J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this respect, C5aR behaves as a “class B” receptor. The significance of this prolonged colocalization is not known, but it is likely to regulate the dephosphorylation and recycling of C5aR.Judging from the persistent association of β-arrestins to agonist-occupied C5aR and from the observation that co-expression of β-arrestin 1 increases by 1.4-fold the rate of C5aR internalization, 2L. Braun and F. Boulay, unpublished results. it is likely that β-arrestins play an important role in C5aR internalization. In the present study, we provide strong evidence that β-arrestins target the activated C5aR to clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner. First, confocal microscopy experiments with RINm5F cells clearly show that activated C5aR remains at the periphery of cells expressing the clathrin-interacting domain of β-arrestin 1. Second, the co-expression of C5aR with either the dominant negative mutant K44E of dynamin or β-arr 1-(319–418)-EGFP results in a severe reduction of internalization/sequestration of radiolabeled C5a in HEK-293 cells. Thus, similarly to the interleukin 8 receptor (35Barlic J. Khandaker M.H. Mahon E. Andrews J. DeVries M.E. Mitchell G.B. Rahimpour R. Tan C.M. Ferguson S.S. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16287-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the C5aR appears to be internalized via clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner. The role of β-arrestins and dynamin in the endocytosis of GPCRs is not a general rule since it has been reported that the internalization of several GPCRs, including the M2 muscarinic and angiotensin II type A receptors, is independent of β-arrestin and dynamin (13Zhang J.

As C5aR, the leukocyte chemoattractant receptors N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) appear to behave as “class B” receptors since they also form a persistent complex with β-arrestin 1.2 Our conclusions strikingly contrast with recent studies suggesting that C5aR and FPR are internalized through a β-arrestin-, clathrin-, and dynamin-independent pathway (15Gilbert T.L.

Our results do not, however, exclude the possibility that, under certain experimental conditions, the internalization of C5aR could proceed through an alternative pathway.In a previous study, we have shown that the phosphorylation of C5aR occurs through a hierarchical process on serine residues located in the C-terminal domain (21Christophe T.

The two most distal serine residues (i.e. Ser334 and Ser338) serve as primary phosphorylation sites. This step is strictly required for the phosphorylation of the other residues. Partial phosphorylation on Ser327/Ser338 as well as Ser334/Ser338 is sufficient to confer a wild-type phenotype of desensitization (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J.

Here, we show by confocal microscopy that the phosphorylation of either two-serine pair is sufficient to allow the co-trafficking of β-arrestins with the receptor to intracellular vesicles. Whether β-arrestin binding is required to inhibit the association of C5aR with the G protein is presently not known. In the case of the FPR it has been shown by an elegant in vitro reconstitution assay that a partial phosphorylation is sufficient to inhibit FPR-G protein interactions independently of arrestin binding (38Bennett T.A.

Although the affinity of β-arrestins for these mutant receptors is most likely low, it may be sufficient to impose structural constraints that result in the sequestration of C5a in its binding site. This could explain previous results where radiolabeled C5a has been found to be significantly sequestered by phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors (20Naik N. Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J.

Although β-arrestin 1 has been shown to recruit and activate c-Src kinase to the plasma membrane, thereby allowing the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1 and Erk2) (26Luttrell L.M.

Recently, β-arrestin 2 has been shown to be essential, presumably through its binding to phosphorylated receptors, for the directed migration of mouse lymphocyte in a gradient of stromal-derived factor 1 (40Fong A.M.

Our data indicating that β-arrestins can be recruited to the plasma membrane in the absence of receptor phosphorylation suggest that β-arrestin-mediated signaling is still possible in the absence of receptor internalization. With other chemoattractant receptors, the agonist-dependent recruitment of β-arrestin 2 by phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors may also occur to variable levels, depending on the receptor and the sets of residues that are mutated. This could explain why chemotaxis and the activation of MAP kinase mediated by phosphorylation-deficient mutants of chemoattractant receptors are variably affected (41Arai H. Monteclaro F.S.

Moreover, we further establish that phosphorylation of two serine pairs, namely Ser327/Ser338 or Ser332/Ser338, is sufficient to stabilize the interaction between β-arrestins and C5aR. In these serine pairs, the phosphorylation of Ser338 is likely to play a key role since its replacement by an alanine yields a mutant with a better ability to transduce signal (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a weaker interaction with β-arrestins and, thereby, a slightly prolonged interaction with the G protein. The complement C5a1anaphylatoxin receptor (C5aR) is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (GPCR) (1Boulay F. Mery L. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Nature. 1991; 349: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). It is abundantly expressed in myeloid cells and to a lower level in a variety of non-myeloid cells (3Zwirner J. Fayyazi A. Gotze O. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, the activation of chemoattractant receptors including the C5aR triggers a complex array of cellular functions that results in directed cell migration and release of large amounts of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (4Bokoch G.M. Blood. 1995; 86: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These responses are highly regulated since, despite the persistent presence of chemoattractants, the intracellular signaling events are transient. As for many other GPCRs, this attenuated responsiveness is thought to result from receptor desensitization through their phosphorylation and rapid internalization. The current concept for GPCR desensitization, largely extrapolated from studies with rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor, is that, once activated and phosphorylated, the GPCRs form a stable complex with a family of adapters known as arrestins and β-arrestins (5McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence indicating that the formation of this complex is a general intermediate for endocytosis of most GPCRs. The β-arrestins interact with clathrin and the adapter protein complex AP-2 (6Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G.J. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of a GTPase-defective dynamin mutant blocks the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway in a dominant-negative manner (11Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), and the agonist-mediated internalization of most GPCRs is inhibited (12Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, some GPCRs appear to depart from this standard model and are capable of utilizing alternative pathways. For instance, the angiotensin II 1A and N-formyl peptide receptors, although able to interact with β-arrestins, can be internalized through a process independent of β-arrestin and dynamin (13Zhang J.

Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The internalization of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor appears to proceed through an atypical pathway that is independent of clathrin (18Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 739-746PubMed Google Scholar). It has been previously established that the activated C5aR is phosphorylated on the 6 serine residues located in the C-terminal tail at positions 314, 317, 327, 332, 334, and 338 (19Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19166-19172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutants with combined amino acid replacements exhibit different capacities to incorporate phosphate on the remaining serine residues (20Naik N. Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Combined mutations at positions 332 and 334, at positions 334 and 338, or at all 3 positions yield phosphorylation-deficient mutants, whereas mutants for which the serine pairs Ser327/Ser338 or Ser334/Ser338 are conserved retain the capacity to be phosphorylated (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation step plays a key role in the attenuation of the cellular response since phosphorylation-deficient mutants trigger sustained intracellular signaling events that result in a significant increase in C5a-mediated superoxide production by neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the first membrane proximal serine residue is dispensable for receptor desensitization, and agonist sequestration is apparently independent of desensitization (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used confocal microscopy and the green fluorescent protein conjugate of β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2, and the dominant negative mutant β-arrestin 1-(319–418) to examine the cellular trafficking of a series of C5aR mutants in response to C5a. Our results demonstrate that a minimal level of phosphorylation is required for internalization through a dynamin-, arrestin-, and clathrin-dependent internalization pathway. Moreover, β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 were found to have differential abilities to associate with the activated receptor. In contrast to β-arrestin 1, β-arrestin 2 redistributed to the plasma membrane regardless of whether C5aR was phosphorylated provided it was activated. DISCUSSIONFor most GPCRs, the primary effect of agonist binding is to bring about a conformational change that triggers the coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and promotes the phosphorylation of the receptor and its interaction with the β-arrestin scaffolding proteins. In the present work, by using green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin 1 and 2, we find that C5a stimulated a striking and rapid redistribution of β-arrestin 1 and 2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane followed by the formation of a long-lasting complex between wild-type C5aR and both β-arrestins as evidenced by the co-localization of C5aR and β-arrestins on the same endosomal compartments. Similar agonist-mediated translocation and association to endosomes have been previously described with a variety of GPCRs (6Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G.J. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 23Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The co-trafficking of β-arrestins and C5aR to perinuclear vesicles was consistently best observed with β-arrestin 2, suggesting that this isoform has a higher affinity for the activated wild-type receptor. The persistent association of β-arrestins with intracellular vesicular compartments that contain internalized GPCRs is not a general rule. The stability of β-arrestin-receptor interactions seems to differ from receptor to receptor. For instance, although “class B” receptors, such as the angiotensin II type 1A and the neurokinin 1 receptors, colocalize with β-arrestin 2 on endosomal compartments, “class A” receptors including the β2-adrenergic, dopamine D1A, and endothelin type A receptors rapidly dissociate from β-arrestins, which remain confined to the plasma membrane (14Zhang J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this respect, C5aR behaves as a “class B” receptor. The significance of this prolonged colocalization is not known, but it is likely to regulate the dephosphorylation and recycling of C5aR.Judging from the persistent association of β-arrestins to agonist-occupied C5aR and from the observation that co-expression of β-arrestin 1 increases by 1.4-fold the rate of C5aR internalization, 2L. Braun and F. Boulay, unpublished results. it is likely that β-arrestins play an important role in C5aR internalization. In the present study, we provide strong evidence that β-arrestins target the activated C5aR to clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner. First, confocal microscopy experiments with RINm5F cells clearly show that activated C5aR remains at the periphery of cells expressing the clathrin-interacting domain of β-arrestin 1. Second, the co-expression of C5aR with either the dominant negative mutant K44E of dynamin or β-arr 1-(319–418)-EGFP results in a severe reduction of internalization/sequestration of radiolabeled C5a in HEK-293 cells. Thus, similarly to the interleukin 8 receptor (35Barlic J. Khandaker M.H. Mahon E. Andrews J. DeVries M.E. Mitchell G.B. Rahimpour R. Tan C.M. Ferguson S.S. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16287-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the C5aR appears to be internalized via clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner. The role of β-arrestins and dynamin in the endocytosis of GPCRs is not a general rule since it has been reported that the internalization of several GPCRs, including the M2 muscarinic and angiotensin II type A receptors, is independent of β-arrestin and dynamin (13Zhang J.

As C5aR, the leukocyte chemoattractant receptors N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) appear to behave as “class B” receptors since they also form a persistent complex with β-arrestin 1.2 Our conclusions strikingly contrast with recent studies suggesting that C5aR and FPR are internalized through a β-arrestin-, clathrin-, and dynamin-independent pathway (15Gilbert T.L.

The co-trafficking of β-arrestins and C5aR to perinuclear vesicles was consistently best observed with β-arrestin 2, suggesting that this isoform has a higher affinity for the activated wild-type receptor. The persistent association of β-arrestins with intracellular vesicular compartments that contain internalized GPCRs is not a general rule. The stability of β-arrestin-receptor interactions seems to differ from receptor to receptor. For instance, although “class B” receptors, such as the angiotensin II type 1A and the neurokinin 1 receptors, colocalize with β-arrestin 2 on endosomal compartments, “class A” receptors including the β2-adrenergic, dopamine D1A, and endothelin type A receptors rapidly dissociate from β-arrestins, which remain confined to the plasma membrane (14Zhang J.

The significance of this prolonged colocalization is not known, but it is likely to regulate the dephosphorylation and recycling of C5aR. Judging from the persistent association of β-arrestins to agonist-occupied C5aR and from the observation that co-expression of β-arrestin 1 increases by 1.4-fold the rate of C5aR internalization, 2L. Braun and F. Boulay, unpublished results. it is likely that β-arrestins play an important role in C5aR internalization. In the present study, we provide strong evidence that β-arrestins target the activated C5aR to clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner. First, confocal microscopy experiments with RINm5F cells clearly show that activated C5aR remains at the periphery of cells expressing the clathrin-interacting domain of β-arrestin 1. Second, the co-expression of C5aR with either the dominant negative mutant K44E of dynamin or β-arr 1-(319–418)-EGFP results in a severe reduction of internalization/sequestration of radiolabeled C5a in HEK-293 cells. Thus, similarly to the interleukin 8 receptor (35Barlic J. Khandaker M.H. Mahon E. Andrews J. DeVries M.E. Mitchell G.B. Rahimpour R. Tan C.M. Ferguson S.S. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16287-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the C5aR appears to be internalized via clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner. The role of β-arrestins and dynamin in the endocytosis of GPCRs is not a general rule since it has been reported that the internalization of several GPCRs, including the M2 muscarinic and angiotensin II type A receptors, is independent of β-arrestin and dynamin (13Zhang J.

As C5aR, the leukocyte chemoattractant receptors N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) appear to behave as “class B” receptors since they also form a persistent complex with β-arrestin 1.2 Our conclusions strikingly contrast with recent studies suggesting that C5aR and FPR are internalized through a β-arrestin-, clathrin-, and dynamin-independent pathway (15Gilbert T.L. Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24590-24594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These divergent results might possibly be due to differences in the methods used to assess receptor internalization. In the study by Bennett et al. (16Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24590-24594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), C5aR internalization was detected by flow cytometry with an antibody directed to the receptor N-terminal domain, whereas our conclusions are based on confocal microscopy and the uptake of radiolabeled C5a. Our results do not, however, exclude the possibility that, under certain experimental conditions, the internalization of C5aR could proceed through an alternative pathway. In a previous study, we have shown that the phosphorylation of C5aR occurs through a hierarchical process on serine residues located in the C-terminal domain (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The two most distal serine residues (i.e. Ser334 and Ser338) serve as primary phosphorylation sites. This step is strictly required for the phosphorylation of the other residues. Partial phosphorylation on Ser327/Ser338 as well as Ser334/Ser338 is sufficient to confer a wild-type phenotype of desensitization (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we show by confocal microscopy that the phosphorylation of either two-serine pair is sufficient to allow the co-trafficking of β-arrestins with the receptor to intracellular vesicles. Whether β-arrestin binding is required to inhibit the association of C5aR with the G protein is presently not known. In the case of the FPR it has been shown by an elegant in vitro reconstitution assay that a partial phosphorylation is sufficient to inhibit FPR-G protein interactions independently of arrestin binding (38Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49195-49203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the observation by confocal microscopy that β-arrestins are recruited to the plasma membrane by phosphorylation-deficient mutant. The agonist-dependent recruitment of β-arr 2-EGFP but not β-arr 1-EGFP by C5aR-A332,334,338 provides additional support to the notion that β-arrestin 2 is the preferred isoform for targeting wild-type C5aR to clathrin-coated pits. Although the affinity of β-arrestins for these mutant receptors is most likely low, it may be sufficient to impose structural constraints that result in the sequestration of C5a in its binding site. This could explain previous results where radiolabeled C5a has been found to be significantly sequestered by phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors (20Naik N. Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition to their role as clathrin adapters, β-arrestins function as scaffolding proteins for several signaling pathways. Although β-arrestin 1 has been shown to recruit and activate c-Src kinase to the plasma membrane, thereby allowing the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1 and Erk2) (26Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), β-arrestin 2 forms a complex with and target c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) to specific subcellular compartments and/or specific substrates (39McDonald P.H.

Recently, β-arrestin 2 has been shown to be essential, presumably through its binding to phosphorylated receptors, for the directed migration of mouse lymphocyte in a gradient of stromal-derived factor 1 (40Fong A.M. Premont R.T. Richardson R.M., Yu, Y.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Patel D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our data indicating that β-arrestins can be recruited to the plasma membrane in the absence of receptor phosphorylation suggest that β-arrestin-mediated signaling is still possible in the absence of receptor internalization. With other chemoattractant receptors, the agonist-dependent recruitment of β-arrestin 2 by phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptors may also occur to variable levels, depending on the receptor and the sets of residues that are mutated. This could explain why chemotaxis and the activation of MAP kinase mediated by phosphorylation-deficient mutants of chemoattractant receptors are variably affected (41Arai H. Monteclaro F.S.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that C5a induces a marked redistribution of β-arrestins to the plasma membrane, where they participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of C5aR. Moreover, we further establish that phosphorylation of two serine pairs, namely Ser327/Ser338 or Ser332/Ser338, is sufficient to stabilize the interaction between β-arrestins and C5aR. In these serine pairs, the phosphorylation of Ser338 is likely to play a key role since its replacement by an alanine yields a mutant with a better ability to transduce signal (21Christophe T. Rabiet M.-J. Tardif M. Milcent M.-D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting a weaker interaction with β-arrestins and, thereby, a slightly prolonged interaction with the G protein."

Punicic acid (or trichosanic acid) is a conjugated linolenic acid isomer containingcis-Δ9, trans-Δ11, cis-Δ13 double bonds in the C18 carbon chain. Here we report cDNAs, TkFac and PgFac, isolated from Trichosanthes kirilowii and Punica granatum, that encode a class of conjugases associated with the formation of trans-Δ11,cis-Δ13 double bonds. Expression of TkFac and PgFac inArabidopsis seeds under transcriptional control of the seed-specific napin promoter resulted in accumulation of punicic acid up to ∼10% (w/w) of the total seed oils. In contrast, no punicic acid was found in lipids from leaves even when the conjugases were driven under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. In yeast cells grown without exogenous fatty acids in the culture medium, TkFac and PgFac expression resulted in punicic acid accumulation accompanied by 16:2Δ9cis, 12cisand 18:2Δ9cis, 12cis production. Thus, TkFac and PgFac are defined as bifunctional enzymes having both conjugase and Δ12-oleate desaturase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 16:2Δ9cis, 12cis and 18:3Δ9cis, 12cis, 15cisas well as 18:2Δ9cis, 12cis are potential substrates for the conjugases to form trans-Δ11 and cis-Δ13 double bonds.

A large number of fatty acid species have been found in plant seed oils. Typically, plant seeds contain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1Δ9cis), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1Δ9cis), linoleic (18:2Δ9cis, 12cis), and α-linolenic (18:3Δ9cis, 12cis, 15cis) acids. These are typical fatty acids with all other fatty acids regarded as unusual. Typically, polyunsaturation of fatty acids is methylene (-CH2-)-interrupted and occurs incis-configuration as found in linoleic and linolenic acids. In contrast, conjugated (non-methylene-interrupted) fatty acids contain double bonds in cis- or trans-configuration. The conjugated fatty acids occur as diene, triene, and tetraene in which the most common conjugated polyenoic acids are octadecatrienoic acids, termed CLNAs. 1The abbreviations used are: CLNA, conjugated linolenic acid; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; FAD2, Δ12-oleate desaturase; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; CLA, conjugated linoleic acid 1The abbreviations used are: CLNA, conjugated linolenic acid; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; FAD2, Δ12-oleate desaturase; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; FAME, fatty acid methyl ester; CLA, conjugated linoleic acid Positional and geometrical isomers of CLNA, three 8,10,12-trienes and four 9,11,13-trienes, have been reported to occur naturally (1Smith Jr., C.R. Prog. Chem. Fats Other Lipids. 1970; 11: 137-177Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Five CLNA isomers occur as major seed oils of several plants: α-eleostearic (cis-Δ9, trans-Δ11, trans-Δ13), calendic (trans-Δ8, trans-Δ10,cis-Δ12), punicic (cis-Δ9,trans-Δ11, cis-Δ13), jacaric (cis-Δ8, trans-Δ10, cis-Δ12), and catalpic (trans-Δ9, trans-Δ11,cis-Δ13) acids (1Smith Jr., C.R. Prog. Chem. Fats Other Lipids. 1970; 11: 137-177Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These isomers have closely related structure; for example, α-eleostearic and jacaric acids are geometrical isomers of punicic and calendic acids, respectively. CLNAs are major seed oils in plants such as tung (Aleurites fordii), karela (Momordica charantia), marigold (Calendula officinalis), and pomegranate (Punica granatum). Tung oil contains high levels of 9,11,13-triene (α-eleostearic acid) and is used mainly in quick-drying enamels and varnishes. There also is growing evidence showing that supplementation with CLNA has cytotoxic effects on tumor cells and that uptake of CLNA has an effect on lipid metabolism (2Igarashi M. Miyazawa T. Cancer Lett. 2000; 148: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Suzuki R. Noguchi R. Ota T. Abe M. Miyashita K. Kawada T. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 2001; 36: 477-482Google Scholar, 4Koba K. Akahoshi A. Yamasaki M. Tanaka K. Yamada K. Iwata T. Kamegai T. Tsutsumi K. Sugano M. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 2002; 37: 343-350Google Scholar). Conjugated eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids with conjugated trienoic structure also exhibit cytotoxic effects on tumor cells (5Igarashi M. Miyazawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been further suggested that the biological action of each conjugated fatty acid may not be equivalent (3Suzuki R. Noguchi R. Ota T. Abe M. Miyashita K. Kawada T. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 2001; 36: 477-482Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that linoleic acid is the acyl precursor of α-eleostearic acid and linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine is the precursor of α-eleostearoyl phosphatidylcholine (6Liu L. Hammond G. Nikolau B.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently cDNAs encoding enzymes that catalyze the formation of the conjugated double bonds in CLNA have been identified. These enzymes were termed conjugases and were shown to be divergent forms of Δ12-oleate desaturase (FAD2). Two types of conjugases associated with the formation of conjugated double bonds intrans-configuration have been identified: one catalyzes the conversion of a cis-Δ12 double bond into the conjugatedtrans-Δ11, trans-Δ13 double bonds found in α-eleostearic acid (7Cahoon E.B. Carlson T.J. Ripp K.G. Schweiger B.J. Cook G.A. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12935-12940Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the other modifies a cis-Δ9 double bond into the trans-Δ8, trans-Δ10 double bonds of calendic acid (8Cahoon E.B. Ripp K.G. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2637-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Qiu X. Reed D.W. Hong H. MacKenzie S.L. Covello P.S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Very recently a class of conjugase associated with the formation of cis-Δ11,trans-Δ13 double bonds of punicic acid was identified (10Hornung E. Pernstich C. Feussner I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the primary structures of these conjugases are similar, each enzyme specifically catalyzes the formation of α-eleostearic, punicic, or calendic acids. Other classes of conjugases associated with the formation of conjugated double bonds in jacaric and catalpic acids have not been reported. It is known that Trichosanthes kirilowii and P. granatum accumulate punicic acid specifically in seeds up to ∼40 and ∼80% (w/w) of the total seed oil, respectively (11Joh Y.-G. Kim S.-J. Christie W. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1995; 72: 1037-1042Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Takagi T. Itabashi Y. Lipids. 1981; 16: 546-551Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The biochemical process resulting in high punicic acid accumulation in the seeds of these plants, however, has not been clear. In this study, for the first step in understanding CLNA accumulation in plant seed oils, we isolated cDNAs that encode enzymes associated with the formation of punicic acid from T. kirilowii andP. granatum and expressed them in Arabidopsisplants. We also analyzed the function of these enzymes in yeast cells. Interestingly the enzymes were demonstrated to possess both Δ12-oleate desaturase and conjugase activities. The finding supports the idea that conjugases have diverged from Δ12-oleate desaturase. The growing number of identified primary structures of fatty acid-modifying enzymes provides valuable information to understand the functional divergence of these enzymes. Total RNA was isolated from maturing seeds of T. kirilowii and P. granatum by the methods of Carpenter et al. (13Carpenter C.D. Simon A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 82: 85-89PubMed Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo-dT primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from the total RNA and used for PCR amplification. To isolate cDNA fragments, degenerate primers were designed to target conserved amino acid sequences in FAD2-related enzymes. For T. kirilowii, a set of degenerate primers, 5′-TGYGGNCAYCAYGCNTTYAGYGAYTAYCART-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GGRTGNGTRTGYTGNARNKMNGT-3′ (reverse primer) were used to target the amino acid sequences CGHHAFSDYQ and T(Y/A)LQHTHP, respectively. For P. granatum, 5′-TGYGGNCAYMRNGCNTTYWSNGAYTAYCAR-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-KYNCCNCKNARCCARTYCCAYTC-3′ (reverse primer) were used to target the amino acids CGH(H/R)AFSDYQ and EW(D/N)WLRG(A/N), respectively. PCR amplification was performed with TaKaRa Ex Taq (Takara Shuzo) with 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C followed by an extension step for 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified products (∼0.5 kb) were cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega) and sequenced using a PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Applied Biosystems). The sequence analysis revealed that two types of cDNA fragments closely related to FAD2 were isolated in each experiment forT. kirilowii (TkFac and TkFad2) and P. granatum (PgFac and PgFad2). The second strand cDNA was synthesized with a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech). Adaptor ligation to the double strand cDNAs and 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA fragments containing 5′ and 3′ regions were cloned into pGEM-T Easy and sequenced. Finally, full-length cDNAs of four FAD2-related cDNAs were isolated by PCR amplification with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) using a set of primers corresponding to the sequences in 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. The PCR amplification consisted of 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C followed by an extension step for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was incubated with TaKaRa Ex TaqDNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) for 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products from four independent amplifications for a set of primers were cloned into pGEM-T Easy and sequenced as described above. The coding regions of TkFac and PgFac were amplified by PCR using Pyrobest DNA polymerase. For amplification of TkFac, the forward primer was designed with a flanking BamHI site (5′-taggatccATGGGAGGTTGGTGAAGGAATAG-3′), and the reverse primer corresponded to the sequence 5–27 bp downstream from the stop codon of TkFac with a flanking SacI site (5′-atgagctcGATGATATCATGAAACCAAGAGG-3′). For amplification of PgFac, the forward primer was designed with flankingEcoRV/XbaI sites (5′-tagatatctagaATGGGAGCTGATGGAACAATGTCTC-3′), and the reverse primer corresponded to the sequence 7–33 bp downstream from the stop codon of PgFac with a flanking SacI site (5′-atgagctcGATATTAGGTTCGATTCTAATAAC-3′). The PCR amplification and cloning into pGEM-T Easy were as described above. pGEM-T Easy/TkFac was digested with BamHI and SacI and ligated at theBamHI/SacI site of the pGEM-3Z plasmid vector (Promega). To generate plant expression vectors with the CaMV 35S promoter and nos terminator (pKS-TkFac and pKS-PgFac), the cDNA sequences were released from pGEM-3Z/TkFac and from pGEM-T Easy/PgFac with XbaHI/SacI digestion and then cloned into the corresponding sites of a binary vector pLAN421 (14Uematsu C.

Plants were dipped withAgrobacterium suspension diluted toA 600 = 0.8 in dipping solution containing 0.02% Silwet L-77 and 0.044 μm 6-benzylaminopurine for 15 min under vacuum and then placed in a covered tray. The next day the plants were uncovered, set upright, and allowed to grow for ∼4 weeks in a growth chamber under the conditions described above. When the siliques were matured, seeds were harvested and planted for selection of positive transformants. Seeds were surface-sterilized by immersion for 2 min in 70% ethanol followed by 15 min in 5% bleach solution containing 1% SDS and then rinsed five times with sterile water. Transformants were selected for by survival on Murashige-Skoog medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 250 μg/ml carbenicillin. The BamHI-SacI fragment of TkFac cDNA released from pGEM-3Z/TkFac as described above was cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2 with the galactose-inducibleGAL1 promoter (Invitrogen) to generate pYES2/TkFac. pGEM-T Easy/PgFac was digested with EcoRV/SacI and cloned into the plasmid vector pBluescript II (Stratagene), and then the PgFac cDNA was released withHindIII/SacI digestion and cloned into pYES2 to generate pYES2/PgFac. The coding regions of TkFad2 and PgFad2 were amplified by PCR using Pyrobest DNA polymerase and cloned into pGEM-T Easy as described above. For amplification of TkFad2, the forward primer was designed with a flanking SmaI site (5′-atcccgggATGGAAAAGGGCGTTCAAGAGC-3′), and the reverse primer corresponded to the sequence 1–24 bp downstream from the stop codon of TkFad2 with a flanking SacI site (5′-atgagctcCAATTTTGACTCAAGACAGAC-3′). For amplification of PgFad2, the forward primer was designed with flankingHindIII/XbaI sites (5′-taaagctctagaATGGGAGCCGGTGGAAGAATGACGG-3′), and the reverse primer corresponded to the sequence 4–29 bp downstream from the stop codon of PgFad2 with a flanking KpnI site (5′-atggtaccTTGCGACCAGCAATGTGGTAAATGG-3′). pGEM-T Easy/TkFad2 was digested with SmaI/SacI, and the released cDNA fragment was cloned into the corresponding site of pBluescript II. The TkFad2 cDNA was then released withHindIII/SacI digestion and cloned into pYES2. The PgFad2 cDNA fragment was released from pGEM-T Easy byHindIII/KpnI digestion and cloned into pYES2. The resulting plasmids as well as pYES2 were introduced into S. cerevisiae D452-2 cells (19Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using an S. c.EasyComp Transformation kit (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were selected for on yeast synthetic minimal medium plates lacking uracil (SC-URA) (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, NY1995Google Scholar). Individual colonies of the transformed cells were grown in glucose culture medium (SC-URA/2% glucose) for 1 day at 28 °C with shaking. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed in sterilized water, and dissolved in galactose culture medium (SC-URA/2% galactose). The cell suspension was diluted toA 600 = 0.2 in galactose culture medium containing 0.1% (w/v) Tergitol-type Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and grown at 20 °C for 3 days followed by 15 °C for 3 days with shaking in the presence or absence of 0.3 mm linoleic, α-linolenic, or 11,14-eicosadienoic acid (20:2Δ11cis, 14cis). Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation and then washed twice in 1% (w/v) Tergitol solution and three times in distilled water. The washed cells were aliquoted into glass tubes and freeze-dried under vacuum. The dried cell pellets were then incubated with 0.5 m sodium methoxide in methanol at 50 °C for 1 h. After the tubes were cooled to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with hexane. The pooled extracts were dried under vacuum and then dissolved in a small volume of hexane, and 1 μl was used for gas chromatography (GC) or GC-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. For fatty acid analysis of Arabidopsis materials, seeds (2 mg) were ground with a mortar and pestle and then added to 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium methoxide in methanol. Leaf tissues (4 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium methoxide in methanol. For T. kirilowii and P. granatum, 2 mg of seeds without seed coats were used for fatty acid extraction. The homogenates were transferred to glass tubes and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. After the tubes were cooled to room temperature, 1.5 ml of 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride was added to the samples, and fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with 1 ml of hexane. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the hexane layer was transferred to a new tube and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were dissolved in a small volume of hexane, and 1 μl was used for GC or GC-MS analysis. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed and quantified using a gas chromatograph (GC18A, Shimadzu) equipped with a TC-70 fused silica column (60 m × 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-mm film thickness; GL Science). The oven temperature was programmed to rise from 150 °C to 240 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min and then hold for 6 min. GC-MS analysis was performed in standard EI mode using a JMS-600H MSroute mass spectrometer (JEOL) coupled to a 6890 Series gas chromatograph (Agilent). Samples were separated under conditions as described above. Total fatty acids extracted from maturing seeds of T. kirilowiiand P. granatum were analyzed by GC. Both seeds contained punicic acid at levels of more than ∼40% (w/w) (T. kirilowii) and ∼70% (w/w) (P. granatum) of total fatty acids (see Figs. 2 D and 4 D). We prepared RNA from these materials and isolated four cDNAs from T. kirilowii (TkFad2 and TkFac) and P. granatum (PgFad2 and PgFac) that encode polypeptides related to FAD2. These polypeptides contain three clusters of histidine residues that are thought to act as ligands to the catalytic iron atoms that have been proposed to form a di-iron oxo group (21Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acid sequences of FAD2-related fatty acid-modifying enzymes (GenBankTMaccession numbers: hydroxylase, T09839 and AAC32755; epoxygenase,CAA76156; acetylenase, CAA76158; and conjugase, AAF05915, AAF05916,AAG42259, AAG42260, and AAK26632) with Δ12-oleate desaturases (GenBankTM accession numbers: P46313, T14269, CAA76157,AAK26633, and AAF78778) revealed that several amino acids at certain positions were strictly conserved in Δ12-oleate desaturases from a number of plant species. As these amino acids were conserved in TkFad2 and PgFad2, we supposed that these were Δ12-oleate desaturases (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that TkFac and PgFac were grouped within a conjugase branch (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that they were conjugases. TkFad2 and PgFad2 encode 369 and 387 amino acids and share 63–68 and 68–71% amino acid identity, respectively, with the Δ12-oleate desaturases. On the other hand, TkFac and PgFac encode 387 and 395 amino acids and share 59–62 and 55–58% amino acid identity to Δ12-oleate desaturases, respectively. PgFac shares 42–54% identity to other conjugases (MomoFadX from M. charantia(7Cahoon E.B. Carlson T.J. Ripp K.G. Schweiger B.J. Cook G.A. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The higher sequence identity between TkFac and MomoFadX may reflect that the two species belong to the same family (Cucurbitaceae).Figure 4Gas chromatographic analyses of FAMEs from yeast cells expressing TkFac and PgFac that were grown in the presence of exogenous linoleic acid. FAMEs from pYES2-transformed (A), TkFac-transformed (B), and PgFac-transformed cells (C) were analyzed by GC. Similarly, FAMEs fromP. granatum seeds were analyzed for reference (D).

Transformants (T1) were selected by drug resistance and by PCR, and then fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from leaves of T1 plants were analyzed by gas chromatography. Although there was no difference in the fatty acid composition of vegetative tissues between transgenic and untransformed plants (data not shown), a prominent peak of FAME (Fig. 2,B and C, arrows), which was not present in seeds from untransformed plant, was found in seeds of transgenic plants. The peak displayed a gas chromatographic retention time identical to that of the methyl ester of punicic acid fromT. kirilowii (Fig. 2 D) and different from those of α-eleostearic and calendic acids extracted from M. charantia and C. officinalis seeds, respectively (data not shown). The mass spectrum of this FAME was identical to that of the methyl punicic acid from T. kirilowii: the molecular ion wasm/z = 292, which was identified as a methyl ester of an isomer of octadecatrienoic acid (18:3), and other diagnostic ions were clearly observed (data not shown). From these results, we concluded that TkFac and PgFac are “conjugases” associated with the formation of the conjugated trans-Δ11,cis-Δ13 double bonds of punicic acid. In addition to the peak of methyl punicic acid, an additional small peak of FAME (Fig. 2,B and C, arrowheads), which was not found in seeds from untransformed plants, was detected in those from transgenic plants. The mass spectrum of this FAME was characterized by an abundant molecular ion at m/z = 320 and other diagnostic ions, which was identified as a methyl ester of an isomer of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3). This peak displayed a gas chromatographic retention time different from that of the methyl 20:3Δ11cis, 14cis, 17cispresent in both untransformed and transformed Arabidopsisseeds (Fig. 2). We analyzed FAMEs of yeast cells fed with 20:2Δ11cis, 14cis to test whether this fatty acid was utilized as a substrate of TkFac and PgFac to produce conjugated 20:3 isomer. However, we could not find a peak corresponding to the methyl 20:3 isomer found in Arabidopsisseeds (data not shown). We supposed that a part of punicic acid was elongated to form the conjugated 20:3 (20:3Δ11cis, 13trans, 15cis) as Arabidopsis seeds possess microsomal fatty acid elongase activity (22James D.W. Lim E. Keller J. Plooy I. Ralston E. Dooner H.K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 23Millar A.A. Kunst L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In all transgenic plants, punicic acid was detected in seeds but not in vegetative tissues (data not shown). We compared the fatty acid composition of seed oils in transgenic and untransformed plants (Table I). Maximal concentration of punicic acid in seed oils was 10.2% (w/w) in pKN-TkFac transformants and 4.4% (w/w) in pKN-PgFac transformants (data not shown). The average concentration of punicic acid was higher in seeds from pKN-TkFac and pKN-PgFac transformants carrying the napin promoter, 3.5 and 2.3% (w/w), respectively. In contrast, concentrations in pKS-TkFac and pKS-PgFac transformants were ∼0.4% (w/w). The concentration of the fatty acid tentatively identified as 20:3Δ11cis, 13trans, 15ciswas in proportion to that of punicic acid (Table I) and accumulated to as much as 1% (w/w) of seed oils in the T2 seeds accumulating 10.2% (w/w) punicic acid (data not shown). Punicic acid accumulation inArabidopsis seeds was accompanied by changes in relative amounts of other fatty acids (Table I). The change was remarkable in seeds of transformants with cDNAs driven by the napin promoter. Relative amounts of linoleic (18:2Δ9cis, 12cis) and linolenic acids (18:3Δ9cis, 12cis, 15cis), which were 30% (w/w) and 19% (w/w) in untransformed seeds, were significantly lower in T2 seeds, at 23–24 and 12–15% (w/w), respectively. In contrast, the concentration of oleic acid was higher in seeds of transgenic plants (23–26% (w/w)) than in those of untransformed plants (15% (w/w)).Table IFatty acid composition of Arabidopsis seeds from untransformed plants and from transgenic plants expressing TkFac and PgFacFatty acidUntransformed (n = 6)TkFacPgFac35S (n = 6)Napin (n = 6)35S (n = 9)Napin (n = 9)16:07.6 ± 0.57.6 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.37.3 ± 0.36.9 ± 0.318:02.6 ± 0.42.9 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.118:1Δ9cis15.2 ± 1.516.2 ± 1.922.8 ± 3.719.1 ± 1.826.4 ± 4.218:2Δ9 cis, 12cis30.3 ± 1.028.4 ± 1.323.3 ± 2.528.9 ± 1.224.2 ± 2.918:3Δ9cis, 12cis, 15cis19.4 ± 1.520.0 ± 1.014.6 ± 3.616.1 ± 1.411.5 ± 2.420:01.8 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.120:1Δ11cis16.8 ± 0.917.8 ± 0.618.7 ± 0.817.0 ± 0.917.3 ± 1.020:2Δ11cis, 14cis1.8 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.220:3Δ11cis, 14cis, 17cis0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.122:1Δ13cis1.7 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.2Punicic acidND0.4 ± 0.43.5 ± 3.30.4 ± 0.32.3 ± 1.120:31-aTentatively identified as 20:3Δ11cis, 13trans, 15cis.ND0.1 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.30.1 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1Other1-bIncludes 18:1Δ11cis, 20:1Δ13cis, and 22:0.<3.0<2.0<2.0<4.0<5.0Values are represented as weight % of the total fatty acids ofArabidopsis seeds.

https://openalex.org/W2018432221,"In thick dielectrics, electrical breakdown is caused by the generation of spatially and temporally correlated defects that are produced — as in lightning1 — by feedback between defect formation and local stress2. New defects are created in the vicinity of existing defects, leading to rapid and correlated propagation of field-induced defect chains that cause breakdown. By contrast, we show here that defects formed in ultrathin films subjected to realistic electrical stress remain spatially and temporally uncorrelated, even when multiple 'shorts' (chains of defects) begin to bridge the thickness of the films. Besides their relevance to different applications of thin dielectric films, our results have positive implications for the scalability of modern integrated circuits3,4,5,6."

The xenobiotic transporters MexB and MexY preferentially export β-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics, respectively. When two large extramembrane loops of MexY were replaced by the corresponding loops of MexB, the hybrid protein exhibited β-lactam selectivity (MexB-type), but failed to recognize aminoglycoside. As the transmembrane segment of MexB was replaced with a corresponding transmembrane segment of MexY, one-by-one for all 12 segments, all the hybrid proteins showed MexB-type antibiotic selectivity. These results clearly demonstrated that the resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux pump inP. aeruginosa selects and transports substrates via the domains that largely protrude over the cytoplasmic membrane. The transmembrane segments were unlikely to have been involved in substrate selectivity.

J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar). These transporters consist of the inner membrane spanning the proton-antibiotic antiporter (MexB or MexY), the membrane fusion proteins that are assumed to connect the inner and outer membranes (MexA or MexX) and the outer membrane-associated lipoprotein OprM common to both transporters (3Poole K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar). The inner membrane spanning subunit (RND transporter) has been found to traverse the cytoplasmic membrane 12 times leaving amino and carboxyl termini in the cytoplasm and the TMSs connected by extra membrane loops (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 6Guan L. Ehrmann M. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol.

Although most loops are short, the loops connecting TMS-1 and TMS-2 (loop-1/2) and TMS-7 and TMS-8 (loop-7/8) were found to consist of over 300 amino acid residues largely protruding toward the periplasmic space. Of five charged amino acid residues in the TMSs of MexB, three in TMS-4 and TMS-10 were shown to be essential for the transporter function probably forming a proton pathway (8Guan L. Nakae T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 185: 1734-1739Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MexB and MexY preferentially export β-lactams and aminoglycosides, respectively, although both transporters export agents such as chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline as well (9Masuda N. Sakagawa E. Ohya S. Gotoh N. Tsujimoto H. Nishino T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3322-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these transporters appeared to be about 47% identical (see Supplemental Fig. 1).Most active transporter proteins recognize the specific stereochemical structure of substrates, while many xenobiotic efflux pumps export structurally dissimilar molecules. Analysis of mutant transporters that altered the substrate selectivity suggested that the mutations were mainly located in TMS. We assessed the question for the substrate recognition site in the RND-type xenobiotic efflux pump by means of domain swapping experiments, and the results let us to propose a novel mechanism of bacterial self-protection against xenobiotics.DISCUSSIONStudies on the substrate recognition site of xenobiotic transporters in mammalian and prokaryote cells showed the following results. Mutations, which altered the substrate specificity of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistant proteins, were scattered in TMSs and cytoplasmic loops. Thus, it has been assumed that these transporters select substrates from either cytoplasmic and exoplasmic leaflets of the membrane, which are mechanisms proposed as the “vacuum cleaner model” and “flippase model,” respectively (10Raviv Y.

Substrate recognition in the xenobiotic transporters of the prokaryote have been investigated in Bmr, LmrP, MfdA, QuacA, and EmrE, revealing that most, if not all, mutations affecting substrate recognition have been identified in the TMS(s) (13Schuldiner S.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Recently, the x-ray crystallographic structure of AcrB, anEscherichia coli homologue of MexB, has been solved showing the presence of three major domains: a cluster of 12 TMSs, a pore-forming domain, and a TolC-docking domain (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The pore domains formed a central cavity, designated as a vestibule, that connected with three channel openings toward the periplasm, and a funnel-like TolC-docking domain. The authors predicted that these vestibules are likely candidates for the substrate-collecting ducts. Since the amino acid identity of AcrB and MexB appeared to be about 70%, it is likely that the three-dimensional structure of MexB was much like that of AcrB. In fact, the x-ray crystallographic analysis of AcrB confirmed our previous results that TMS-4 and -10 of MexB are close to each other (8Guan L. Nakae T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 185: 1734-1739Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar).This raises the question of which part of the RND transporters collects the substrates. It has been proposed that the substrate-collecting site(s) of the RND transporters are located at both the inner membrane and the cytoplasm (2Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 17Ocaktan A. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21964-21969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since the results presented in this paper clearly demonstrated that membrane insoluble substrates were selected in the periplasmic domains, it is highly likely that the substrate-collecting ducts in MexB and MexY are located in the periplasmic domain. If this proposal is valid, one can answer the following interesting questions: (i) how do the cells protect the cytoplasmic membrane from membrane deteriorating surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and bile salts? (ii) How are lipid-insoluble antibiotics such as β-lactams and aminoglycosides efficiently transported? (iii) How do these low substrate-selective transporters prevent leakage of cytoplasmic materials?The following model plausibly explains the mechanism by which the RND transporters might collect, recognize, and transport xenobiotics. Substrates that have diffused into the periplasmic space across the outer membrane are sucked up into the periplasmic pore inlets before diffusing into the inner membrane. They are then subjected to filtration by the substrate-recognizing site probably located in the pore domains and subsequently transported to the extracellular milieu (Fig. 3). The xenobiotics may not penetrate the cytoplasm of cells with a tight outer membrane barrier and powerful xenobiotic transporters, which protect the interior of the cells from potential hazards. This is an elegant and efficient means of safeguard. However, this new model is not mutually exclusive of the hypothesis that the transporters collect substrates from the inner membrane. During the course of this manuscript preparation, we learned that MexD mutations with altered substrate selectivity were mapped in the large periplasmic domains (18Mao W. Warren M.S. Black D.S. Satou T. Murata T. Nishino T. Gotoh N. Lomovskaya O. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and that domain-swapping experiments have been carried out with different combinations of the transporters (19Elkins C.A. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6490-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The results are partially consistent with the present results and, therefore, can be regarded as supporting the new model proposed in this report. Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows intrinsic and mutational resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and this resistance is mainly attributable to a synergy of expression of the xenobiotic efflux transporters and a tight outer membrane barrier (1Nakae T. Yoshihara E. Yoneyama H. J. Infect. Chemother. 1997; 3: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Nikaido H.

Multiantibiotic resistance in this organism is a major cause of mortality of hospital patients whose immune activity was lowered by some other factors.P. aeruginosa encodes several RND1 family efflux pumps including MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM (3Poole K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar). These transporters consist of the inner membrane spanning the proton-antibiotic antiporter (MexB or MexY), the membrane fusion proteins that are assumed to connect the inner and outer membranes (MexA or MexX) and the outer membrane-associated lipoprotein OprM common to both transporters (3Poole K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 255-264PubMed Google Scholar). The inner membrane spanning subunit (RND transporter) has been found to traverse the cytoplasmic membrane 12 times leaving amino and carboxyl termini in the cytoplasm and the TMSs connected by extra membrane loops (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 6Guan L. Ehrmann M. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although most loops are short, the loops connecting TMS-1 and TMS-2 (loop-1/2) and TMS-7 and TMS-8 (loop-7/8) were found to consist of over 300 amino acid residues largely protruding toward the periplasmic space. Of five charged amino acid residues in the TMSs of MexB, three in TMS-4 and TMS-10 were shown to be essential for the transporter function probably forming a proton pathway (8Guan L. Nakae T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 185: 1734-1739Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MexB and MexY preferentially export β-lactams and aminoglycosides, respectively, although both transporters export agents such as chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline as well (9Masuda N. Sakagawa E. Ohya S. Gotoh N. Tsujimoto H. Nishino T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3322-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these transporters appeared to be about 47% identical (see Supplemental Fig. 1). Most active transporter proteins recognize the specific stereochemical structure of substrates, while many xenobiotic efflux pumps export structurally dissimilar molecules. Analysis of mutant transporters that altered the substrate selectivity suggested that the mutations were mainly located in TMS. We assessed the question for the substrate recognition site in the RND-type xenobiotic efflux pump by means of domain swapping experiments, and the results let us to propose a novel mechanism of bacterial self-protection against xenobiotics. DISCUSSIONStudies on the substrate recognition site of xenobiotic transporters in mammalian and prokaryote cells showed the following results. Mutations, which altered the substrate specificity of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistant proteins, were scattered in TMSs and cytoplasmic loops. Thus, it has been assumed that these transporters select substrates from either cytoplasmic and exoplasmic leaflets of the membrane, which are mechanisms proposed as the “vacuum cleaner model” and “flippase model,” respectively (10Raviv Y.

Substrate recognition in the xenobiotic transporters of the prokaryote have been investigated in Bmr, LmrP, MfdA, QuacA, and EmrE, revealing that most, if not all, mutations affecting substrate recognition have been identified in the TMS(s) (13Schuldiner S.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Recently, the x-ray crystallographic structure of AcrB, anEscherichia coli homologue of MexB, has been solved showing the presence of three major domains: a cluster of 12 TMSs, a pore-forming domain, and a TolC-docking domain (5Murakami S. Nakashima R. Yamashita E. Yamaguchi A. Nature. 2002; 419: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The pore domains formed a central cavity, designated as a vestibule, that connected with three channel openings toward the periplasm, and a funnel-like TolC-docking domain. The authors predicted that these vestibules are likely candidates for the substrate-collecting ducts. Since the amino acid identity of AcrB and MexB appeared to be about 70%, it is likely that the three-dimensional structure of MexB was much like that of AcrB. In fact, the x-ray crystallographic analysis of AcrB confirmed our previous results that TMS-4 and -10 of MexB are close to each other (8Guan L. Nakae T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 185: 1734-1739Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar).This raises the question of which part of the RND transporters collects the substrates. It has been proposed that the substrate-collecting site(s) of the RND transporters are located at both the inner membrane and the cytoplasm (2Nikaido H.

Because focal adhesion kinase activation and an intact cytoskeleton are critical links for integrin-mediated signaling to MAPK, we explored the role of integrin αIIbβ3 in this signaling using Chinese hamster ovary and human kidney 293 cell lines expressing either the Leu33 or Pro33 isoform of β3. Compared with Leu33 cells, Pro33 cells demonstrated substantially greater activation of ERK2 (but not MAPK family members JNK and p38) upon adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen (but not fibronectin) and upon integrin cross-linking. ERK2 activation was mediated through MAPK kinase and required phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling and an intact actin cytoskeleton. Human platelets and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the Pro33 isoform showed enhanced activation of the ERK2 substrate myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) upon adhering to fibrinogen. Furthermore, compared with platelets and cells expressing the Leu33 isoform, the Pro33 variant showed greater α-granule release, clot retraction, and adhesion to fibrinogen under shear stress, and these functional differences were abolished by MLCK and MAPK kinase inhibition. Post-integrin occupancy signaling through MAPK and MLCK after αIIbβ3 cross-linking may explain in part the increased adhesive properties of the Pro33 variant of integrin β3.

These signals promote secretion of α- and dense granules, the secondary wave of aggregation, filamentous actin formation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and the formation of platelet membrane vesicles with procoagulant activities (1Phillips D.R. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Prasad K.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Defects in outside-in signaling through αIIbβ3 cause abnormal platelet-mediated clot retraction and aggregation and excessive bleeding in the hereditary disorder Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (2Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Rosa J.P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wang R. Shattil S.J. Ambruso D.R. Newman P.J. J. Clin.

DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A number of molecules and pathways have been identified to be involved in the earliest integrin-mediated outside-in signaling events (5Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several downstream effects and mediators have also been identified, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and myosin light chain kinases (MLCKs). MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases activated by diverse extracellular stimuli like growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and other stress factors (6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPK cascade consists of a three-kinase module; MAPK is the most distal, being activated by MEK, which, in turn, is activated by a MEK kinase. Activation of MAPK requires dual phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residue in a Thr-X-Tyr motif. There are four known members of the MAPK family: 1) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p44ERK1and p42ERK2), 2) c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (p46JNK1 and p55JNK2), 3) the p38 kinase, and 4) ERK5/big MAPK (BMK1). ERK1 and ERK2 are involved in cell growth, proliferation, and adhesion, whereas ERK5 is important for angiogenesis (6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Regan C.P., Li, W. Boucher D.M. Spatz S., Su, M.S. Kuida K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9248-9253Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 have a role in apoptosis (6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the MAPK family members except BMK1 have been identified in human platelets, but their function is inadequately understood. MLCK is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that phosphorylates Thr18 and Ser19 on the regulatory light chain of myosin (8Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MLCK contains multiple MAPK consensus phosphorylation sites (PX(S/T)P) (9Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is directly phosphorylated by ERK2 (10Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLCs) by MLCK is a critical regulatory step in myosin function and regulates cell migration, cytoskeletal clustering of integrins, and shape change and secretion in platelets (11Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Integrin β3 is polymorphic at residue 33 (Leu33 or Pro33; also known as PlA1or PlA2, respectively), and the Pro33 form has been associated with an enhanced adhesive phenotype in cell lines and platelets (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and with acute coronary syndromes in some studies (14Williams M.S. Bray P.F. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This polymorphism is not rare, and 25% of individuals of Northern European descent express Pro33 isoforms on their platelets. Compared with Leu33, Pro33 cells exhibit enhanced integrin αIIbβ3-mediated outside-in signaling to focal adhesion kinase and cytoskeletal-dependent cellular functions like fibrin clot retraction and cell adhesion (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that compared with Leu33 cells, Pro33 cells can provide more efficient αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Evidence supporting a role for focal adhesion kinase and the cytoskeleton in integrin-mediated MAPK activation (15Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 16Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led us to explore whether the Leu-to-Pro substitution at amino acid 33 could modulate αIIbβ3 signaling through MAPK. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and 293 cell lines overexpressing equivalent levels of the two isoforms of αIIbβ3 and human platelets, we found that compared with the Leu33 isoform, the Pro33variant of β3 induced greater outside-in activation of ERK2 and/or MLCK. Inhibition of MLCK and ERK2 activation abolished the increased adhesion to fibrinogen and clot retraction associated with Pro33 cells, and MLCK inhibition abolished the increased P-selectin secretion in Pro33 platelets. Human fibronectin was obtained from Invitrogen. Human fibrinogen was from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). Cytochalasin, wortmannin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), phosphatase inhibitor mixture, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and sorbitol were from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-αIIbβ3 (P2) and anti-P-selectin antibodies were from Immunotech (Marseilles, France). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibody was from Pierce. Anti-αvβ3 antibody (LM609) was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of ERK, JNK, and p38; anti-ERK1/2; and inhibitors PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) and U0126 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibody specific for diphosphorylated MLC was a generous gift from Dr. James Staddon (Eisai London Research, London). Antibodies to JNK and MLC were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-p38 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibody LIBS6 was a gift from Dr. Mark Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA), and antibodies 10E5 and c7E3 were gifts from Dr. Barry Coller (Rockefeller University, New York). Stable cell lines overexpressing αIIbβ3 were generated by flow cytometric sorting using monoclonal antibody specific for αIIbβ3 as previously described (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These included the “vector-only” control CHO cells (designated LK) and CHO cells overexpressing the Leu33 and Pro33isoforms of αIIbβ3 (designated Leu33 and Pro33, respectively). To address concerns about clonal variation that may have occurred in the CHO cell lines, a second set of cell lines was also generated in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line: line PC/Z, vector-only control; line 293Leu33, stably expressing the Leu33 isoform of αIIbβ3; and line 293Pro33, stably expressing the Pro33 isoform of αIIbβ3. Cell-surface expression of αIIbβ3 on and 293 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using antibody P2, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibody (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mean channel number corresponding to cell fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of αIIbβ3 surface expression. Assessment of αIIbβ3 expression levels was performed within 24 h of each experiment to assure equivalent expression between the Leu33 and Pro33 cell lines. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and detached using 0.05% trypsin. After neutralization, the cells were suspended in Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, 0.36 mmNa2HPO4, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 0.49 mm MgCl2 for adhesion studies with fibrinogen. For studies with fibronectin, cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (136 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) with 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 0.49 mmMgCl2. 24-well tissue culture plates were coated with 12.5 μg/ml fibrinogen, 12.5 μg/ml fibronectin, 10 μg/ml anti-αIIbβ3 antibody P2, 10 μg/ml anti-αvβ3 antibody LM609, or 2.5 mg/ml heat-treated BSA. 200 μl of 5 × 105 cells/ml were added to each well and incubated for various time points (2.5, 5, and 10 min) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In some experiments, cells were incubated for 30 min with 10 μm cytochalasin D, 100 nm wortmannin, 20 μm PD98059, 10 μm U0216, or Me2SO (control) prior to the adhesion experiments. The unbound cells were removed by washing, and the cells bound to fibrinogen or fibronectin were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 145 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 250 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml protease inhibitors (chymostatin, antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin), and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) as previously described (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The non-adherent cells from the BSA-coated wells were collected, diluted 1:1 in Tyrode's buffer, and centrifuged at 100 ×g for 5 min; and the pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer. The lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 3750 × g for 30 min, and the protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Cells incubated with 0.5 m sorbitol or 100 nm PMA served as a positive control for MAPK activation. In some experiments, MAPK activation was assessed after monoclonal antibody clustering of the αIIbβ3 receptor. 5 × 105cells suspended in 50 μl of Tyrode's buffer containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 0.49 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, were first incubated with 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragment from antibody 10E5 or c7E3 for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by a 1:200 dilution of Fab-specific goat anti-mouse IgG for 20 min at 37 °C as described in other systems (17Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone M.A., Jr. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The cells were washed once with 200 μl of Tyrode's buffer and lysed. Blood was obtained in acid/citrate/dextrose from normal, healthy, and fasting donors of known PlA genotype. Washed platelets were prepared as described (13Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), suspended in Tyrode's buffer, and allowed to recover for 2 h at 37 °C. Fibrinogen (12.5 μg/ml) or heat-denatured BSA was immobilized on six-well plates as described above. 1 ml containing 1 × 108 platelets was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The fibrinogen-bound platelets and the non-adherent platelets from the BSA-coated well were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, and the protein content was determined. MAPK activation was assessed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for the active (dual tyrosine- and threonine-phosphorylated) forms of activated p44/42, p38, and JNK. MLC activation was determined by immunoblotting using antibody specific for diphosphorylated (Thr18 and Ser19) MLC. For these studies, 20–50 μg of protein obtained from the lysates described above were separated by 7–10% reducing SDS-PAGE; transferred to nitrocellulose membrane; blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) overnight at 4°C; and incubated with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:5000 dilution), anti-phospho-JNK antibody (1:5000 dilution), anti-phospho-p38 antibody (1:1000), or anti-diphosphorylated MLC antibody (1:500) for 2.5 h at room temperature. The blots were washed with TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000) for 1 h, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm equal loading of MAPK, the membrane was stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50°C and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. The blots were reprobed with antibody to ERK1/2 (1:5000), JNK (1:3000), p38 (1:1000), or MLC (1:1000) as described above. The signals were scanned using Photoshop Version 5.5 software, and densitometric quantitation was performed using NIH Image software (Scion Image beta Version 4.0.2, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Glass coverslips were coated with 200 μl of 12.5 μg/ml fibrinogen and incubated for 3 h in a humidified chamber. Before using each coverslip, excess fibrinogen was rinsed with Tyrode's buffer, and then the parallel plate flow chamber was assembled with the coverslip forming the base of the chamber. Measurements of cell adhesion under flow conditions were as we have previously described (18Fredrickson B.J. Dong J.-F. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the experiments, the parallel plate flow chamber was mounted on an inverted-stage microscope (Eclipse TE300, Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a ×20 phase objective and a high-speed camera (Quantix Photometrics, Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) connected to a computer terminal. In most experiments, 5 × 105 cells were perfused through the chamber for 5 min at a constant flow rate of 25 s−1, which produces a constant wall shear stress. In some cases, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 20 μmMAPK inhibitor PD98059 or 10 μg/ml ML-7 and control Me2SO before perfusion. Four fixed fields of observation were identified, and the number of cells adhering to these regions in each experiment was counted using the Metamorph imaging system. Clot retraction was measured as we have previously described (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells (4 × 106) were pretreated with either Me2SO or 20 μm PD98059 for 1 h. Cells were washed once with Tyrode's buffer; resuspended in 300 μl of α-minimal essential medium containing 28 mm CaCl2 and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; and mixed with 200 μl of fibronectin-depleted plasma, 250 μg of fibrinogen, and 5 μg of aprotinin. Clot formation was initiated by the addition of 2.5 units of thrombin. After incubation at 37 °C for varying time periods, the volume of liquid not incorporated into the clot was measured. Secretion of α-granules was studied by assaying for P-selectin expression using a modification of our previously described whole blood flow cytometric assay (13Michelson A.D. Furman M.I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Mascelli M.A. Hendrix C. Coleman L. Hamlington J. Barnard M.R. Kickler T. Christie D.J. Kundu S. Bray P.F. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of washed platelets (2 × 106) of known PlA genotype were incubated with 10 μl of 0.2 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-P-selectin antibody in a total of 40 μl of Tyrode's buffer containing 10 mm HEPES and activated using varying concentrations of thrombin for 2 min. Samples were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde and analyzed for P-selectin expression by flow cytometry. In some experiments, platelets were incubated with Me2SO or 10 μg/ml ML-7 before thrombin stimulation. To determine whether integrin αIIbβ3 can induce outside-in signaling to MAPK, CHO cells overexpressing αIIbβ3 were allowed to adhere to immobilized fibrinogen or maintained in suspension over a BSA substrate. Substantially greater levels of phosphorylated ERK2 were detected in adherent Pro33 cells compared with Leu33 cells at 2.5, 5, and 10 min (Fig. 1 A, lane 3 versus lane 2). Compared with Leu33 cells, Pro33 cells exhibited an ∼10-fold increase in phosphorylated ERK2 at 2.5 min and an ∼5-fold increase at 5 and 10 min (Fig. 1 B). The levels of total ERK in Leu33and Pro33 cells were equivalent and could not account for the signaling differences (Fig. 1 A). ERK2 signaling was dependent upon αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen because 1) no phosphorylated ERK2 was detected in the vector control LK cells not expressing αIIbβ3 (Fig. 1 A, lane 1); 2) cells maintained in suspension over the BSA substrate did not trigger activation of ERK2 (lanes 4–6); and 3) adhesion to fibrinogen under these conditions is completely inhibited with integrelin and αIIbβ3-specific function-blocking antibody 10E5 (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A 2.5-fold increase in ERK2 phosphorylation was observed in Pro33 cells compared with Leu33 cells in response to soluble fibrinogen binding (data not shown). Although CHO cell lines were generated by cell sorting and should not have been subject to clonal variation, we generated a second set of 293 cell lines to confirm the effects of the substitution of Leu with Pro at amino acid 33. Essentially the same results were obtained with the 293 cells as with the CHO cells (Fig. 1, C andD). Densitometry revealed that compared with 293Leu33 cells, 293Pro33 cells demonstrated 7-fold greater phosphorylation of ERK2 at 2.5 min (data not shown). Relative to CHO cells, in 293 cells, the Pro33-dependent difference in ERK2 activation appeared to lessen over time (data not shown), perhaps reflecting cell-type specificities. Nevertheless, at early time points in both cell lines, the β3 Pro33 substitution exhibited greater activation of ERK2. For the data shown in the rest of this report, we show studies with CHO cells, although similar results were obtained in 293 cells. Under similar conditions, adhesion of Leu33 and Pro33 cells to fibronectin did not cause activation of ERK2 (Fig. 2 A), indicating that the differential signaling due to the Pro33 polymorphism of integrin β3 is ligand-specific. The cells used in these experiments were fully capable of activating ERK2 because PMA and sorbitol caused robust activation in all three cell lines (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–6). The absence of ERK signaling on fibronectin might reflect trans-dominant inhibition of integrin signaling, perhaps due to the cross-talk between the overexpressed αIIbβ3 and the endogenous α5β1 integrins. To determine whether the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK2 was mediated primarily through αIIbβ3, ERK2 activation was examined in cells adhering to wells coated with anti-αIIbβ3 antibody P2, anti-αvβ3 antibody LM609, or BSA. There was an ∼10-fold greater phosphorylation of ERK2 in Pro33cells compared with Leu33 cells that adhered to antibody P2 (Fig. 3, A and B). No ERK2 activation was detected in LK cells (Fig. 3 A,lane 4) and in cells maintained in suspension over BSA substrate (lanes 7–9). Adhesion to LM609-coated wells did not trigger activation of ERK2 in either Leu33 or Pro33 cells (Fig. 3 A), indicating that low levels of chimeric hamster-human αvβ3expressed in these cell lines did not contribute to ERK2 signaling. We next examined whether other related MAPK members are activated by the integrin αIIbβ3-fibrinogen interaction. In contrast to ERK2 activation, no phosphorylated JNK or phosphorylated p38 was observed in response to cell adhesion to fibrinogen at 2.5, 5, and 10 min (Fig. 4, A andB). However, JNK and p38 in these cells were fully activated in response to 0.5 m sorbitol treatment (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes 7–9). These studies indicate that 1) integrin αIIbβ3 is capable of inducing outside-in signaling to ERK2, but not to JNK or p38; and 2) compared with the Leu33 isoform, the Pro33variant of αIIbβ3 confers early and efficient ERK2 signaling.Figure 4Activation of JNK and p38 in CHO cells adhering to immobilized fibrinogen. CHO cells were studied, and lysates were processed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and immunoblotted for active and total JNK (A) and p38 (B). A, immunoblot probed with anti-phospho-JNK antibody (pJNK2/pJNK1) recognizing activated JNK1 (p46) and JNK2 (p54). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-JNK1 antibody. Cells treated with 0.5 m sorbitol (lanes 7–9) was included in every experiment to confirm the ability to detect phospho-JNK and to demonstrate that JNK can be activated in these cells. Data shown are representative of three experiments.B, immunoblot probed with anti-phospho-p38 (pP38) and anti-p38 antibodies. Lanes 7–9 show cells treated with 0.5 m sorbitol.

We used antibody-mediated cross-linking to further assess the role of this mechanism in the Pro33 signaling effect. Antibody cross-linking of αIIbβ3 resulted in greater activation of ERK2 in Pro33 cells compared with Leu33 cells (Fig. 5 A, lane 3 versus lane 2), whereas incubation with either antibody 10E5 or the secondary antibody alone did not cause activation in either cell line (lanes 4–9). Similar results were obtained in both CHO cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 3 versus lane 2) and 293 cells (data not shown) using anti-β3 antibody c7E3. Cross-linking with antibody c7E3 showed a small basal level of ERK2 phosphorylation even in vector-only (LK) cells (Fig. 5 B), perhaps due to the ability of the Fab fragment from antibody c7E3 to bind other endogenous integrins on CHO cells. In these cross-linking studies, densitometry showed 1.5–3.1-fold greater ERK2 phosphorylation in Pro33 cells compared with Leu33 cells (data not shown). Sequential activation of the Ras GTPase and the kinases Raf and MEK is the best characterized pathway for activation of the ERKs (15Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of ERK2 in CHO cells adherent to fibrinogen was mediated through MEK, we preincubated cells in the presence and absence of the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0216 and studied cell interactions with fibrinogen. Adhesion of Me2SO-treated (control) cells to immobilized fibrinogen caused greater activation of ERK2 in Pro33 cells than in Leu33 cells (Fig. 6,A, lane 3 versus lane 2; andB, lane 5 versus lane 3). In contrast, treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 6 A) or U0216 (Fig. 6 B) completely prevented the induction of ERK2 activity in both Leu33 and Pro33 cells. Because PD98059 binds to inactive MEK and prevents Raf from phosphorylating MEK, these data demonstrate that activation of ERK in Leu33 and Pro33 cells is mediated through upstream MEK/Raf. To examine whether cytoskeleton assembly has a role in ERK2 activation, cells were preincubated with cytochalasin D. Cytochalasin D completely prevented the induction of ERK2 activity in both Leu33 and Pro33 cells (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2 and3 versus lanes 5 and 6). Cytoskeletal reorganization in response to integrin activation is activated by lipid kinases like phosphoinositide 3-kinase (19Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we used the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin to examine the possible effect of phosphoinositide 3-kinase on the αIIbβ3-mediated activation of ERK2. Induction of ERK2 activity in both Leu33 and Pro33 cells was ablated by wortmannin (Fig. 6 C,lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 8 and9). These results indicate that activation of ERK2 is dependent on post-ligand binding events such as actin polymerization and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. Compared with Leu33-expressing CHO cells, Pro33 cells show a dramatically increased reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton when bound to immobilized fibrinogen (12Vijayan K.V. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Roos C. Bray P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because myosin and MLCK are critical for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and MLCK is a cytoplasmic substrate of ERK2 (10Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), we examined outside-in signaling in CHO cells and human platelets to MLCK. MLCK phosphorylates Thr18 and Ser19 on MLC, and diphosphorylated MLC can be detected by a specific antibody (20Ratcliffe M.J. Smales C. Staddon J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen caused greater phosphorylation of MLC in Pro33 cells than in Leu33 cells (Fig. 7 A, lane 3 versus lane 2). Compared with Leu33 cells, Pro33 cells exhibited an ∼1.8-fold increase in the levels of diphosphorylated MLC. Because MLCK activation is required for MLC phosphorylation at Thr18 and Ser19, we interpret the data in Fig. 7 to mean that MLCK has been differentially activated in the Pro33 and Leu33 cell lines. The difference in MLCK activation between Leu33- and Pro33-expressing CHO cells was largely transient and appeared to lessen at later time points (data not shown). The above studies were conducted ex"

Although it is now clear that tail-anchored proteins are inserted into the membrane at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the molecular basis for their integration is poorly understood. We have used a cross-linking approach to identify ER components that may be involved in the membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins. We find that several newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins are transiently associated with a defined subset of cellular components. Among these, we identify several ER proteins, including subunits of the Sec61 translocon, Sec62p, Sec63p, and the 25-kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex. When we analyze the cotranslational membrane insertion of a comparable signal-anchored protein we find the nascent polypeptide associated with a similar set of ER components. We conclude that the pathways for the integration of tail-anchored and signal-anchored membrane proteins at the ER exhibit a substantial degree of overlap, and we propose that this reflects similarities between co- and post-translational membrane insertion.

We conclude that the pathways for the integration of tail-anchored and signal-anchored membrane proteins at the ER exhibit a substantial degree of overlap, and we propose that this reflects similarities between co- and post-translational membrane insertion. Membrane protein insertion at the mammalian ER occurs most commonly via the cotranslational pathway, in which a hydrophobic signal sequence emerges from the ribosome and is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; BMH, bismaleimidohexane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ii, invariant chain; SPC25, 25-kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex; Syb2, synaptobrevin 2; Syb2cm, cysteine mutant of synaptobrevin 2; Syn1A, syntaxin 1A 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; BMH, bismaleimidohexane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ii, invariant chain; SPC25, 25-kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex; Syb2, synaptobrevin 2; Syb2cm, cysteine mutant of synaptobrevin 2; Syn1A, syntaxin 1A(1Meacock S.L. Greenfield J.J.A. High S. Essays Biochem. 2000; 36: 1-13Google Scholar). The ribosome-nascent chain-SRP complex is then targeted to the ER membrane via an association with a cognate receptor complex (1Meacock S.L. Greenfield J.J.A. High S. Essays Biochem. 2000; 36: 1-13Google Scholar, 2Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Google Scholar). Upon its arrival at the ER, the nascent membrane protein is delivered to the Sec61 translocon. This comprises multiple Sec61 heterotrimers, composed of α, β, and γ subunits, and it functions as the ER membrane insertion site for precursors delivered via the SRP-dependent targeting route (1Meacock S.L. Greenfield J.J.A. High S. Essays Biochem. 2000; 36: 1-13Google Scholar, 2Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Google Scholar, 3High S. Laird V. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 206-210Google Scholar, 4Matlack K.E. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in higher eukaryotes, the membrane insertion of proteins targeted via the SRP-dependent pathway appears to be principally cotranslational, with the ribosome remaining closely associated with the Sec61 translocon during membrane integration (5Menetret J.F. Neuhof A. Morgan D.G. Plath K. Radermacher M. Rapoport T.A. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1219-1232Google Scholar, 6Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Google Scholar). In contrast to higher eukaryotes, SRP-independent, post-translational translocation plays a significant role in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Zheng N. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 849-852Google Scholar, 8Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Google Scholar). In this instance the precursors use cytosolic chaperones to maintain translocation competence (9Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Google Scholar), and signal sequence recognition occurs at the Sec complex of the ER membrane (10Brodsky J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 122-126Google Scholar,11Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Google Scholar). This Sec complex is made up of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex together with four other membrane-associated components, namely Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p and Sec72p, as well as the ER luminal chaperone Kar2p (the S. cerevisiae equivalent of BiP) (12Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Google Scholar, 13Lyman S.K. Schekman R. Cell. 1997; 88: 85-96Google Scholar, 14Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Google Scholar). It has become apparent that Sec62p and Sec63p are not restricted to S. cerevisiae, and similar proteins have been identified in mammals, although their precise function is unknown (15Meyer H.A. Grau H. Kraft R. Kostka S. Prehn S. Kalies K.U. Hartmann E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14550-14557Google Scholar, 16Tyedmers J. Lerner M. Bies C. Dudek J. Skowronek M.H. Haas I.G. Heim N. Nastainczyk W. Volkmer J. Zimmermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7214-7219Google Scholar). Specific examples of post-translational translocation have been identified in higher eukaryotes, although these tend to be the exception rather than the rule. In the case of very short presecretory proteins, such as prepromelittin, the N-terminal signal sequence does not have an opportunity to interact with SRP before translation is terminated (17Schlenstedt G. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 699-703Google Scholar,18Müller G. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2099-2107Google Scholar). Hence, prepromelittin translocation is independent of SRP but dependent upon cytosolic component(s) and ATP, presumably to maintain the polypeptide in a “translocation-competent” state (18Müller G. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2099-2107Google Scholar). Tail-anchored proteins form a distinct class of integral membrane proteins, possessing a single membrane insertion sequence at their C terminus and displaying their remaining N-terminal portion in the cytosol. The majority of tail-anchored proteins become integrated at the ER membrane (19–21, but see also Ref. 22Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2482-2496Google Scholar), and members of this class carry out a range of important cellular functions, such as ER translocation (Sec61β and Sec61γ), vesicle recognition (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, or SNARE proteins), and electron transfer (cytochromeb 5) (for reviews, see Refs. 23Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Google Scholar and 24Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Google Scholar). In the case of synaptobrevin 2 (Syb2), the authentic membrane insertion sequence can be replaced by a polyleucine span with a minimum length of 12 residues, demonstrating the lack of any specific sequence requirements for this region (25Whitley P. Grahn E. Kutay U. Rapoport T.A. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7583-7586Google Scholar). The membrane insertion sequence of tail-anchored proteins acts as an ER targeting signal, and its relative position dictates that membrane insertion is post-translational and hence likely to be SRP-independent (9Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Google Scholar, 26Anderson D.J. Mostov K.E. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7249-7253Google Scholar). To date, only general characteristics regarding the targeting and membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins are known. The process is ATP-dependent, consistent with a role for cytosolic chaperones in maintaining the polypeptides in an integration-competent state (19Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar, 20Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Google Scholar, 21Behrens T.W. Kearns G.M. Rivard J.J. Bernstein H.D. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23528-23534Google Scholar, 27Zimmermann R. Sagstetter M.

Hollerbach C. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36876-36882Google Scholar). Furthermore, the membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins includes a membrane binding step that is saturable (29Kim P.K. Hollerbach C. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36876-36882Google Scholar), and this process is also sensitive to prior treatment of the membranes with protease (19Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar). Although both of these observations suggest that the membrane insertion of tail-anchored polypeptides is mediated by proteins, the ER components responsible for this process have remained unidentified. We set out to identify ER components that may mediate the membrane insertion of tail-anchored proteins using a defined cross-linking approach to identify proteins that are transiently associated with the newly membrane-integrated polypeptides. We report a defined sequence of associations between newly made tail-anchored proteins and both the Sec61 translocon and Sec61 translocon-associated components. Most significantly, we observe a similar sequence of events with a comparable, cotranslationally inserted, signal-anchored protein. We conclude that the biosynthesis of tail-anchored and signal-anchored proteins is mediated by a similar complement of ER components. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against specific peptides representing Sec61α, Sec61β (from B. Dobberstein), SPC25, Sec62p, and Sec63p. The anti-Syb2 antibody was a mouse monoclonal recognizing an epitope at the N terminus of Syb2 (from R. Jahn). An NcoI fragment incorporating the coding region of the human Sec61β cDNA (30Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pSPUTK vector (Stratagene). The DNA template for its transcription was made by cleavage of the Sec61β pSPUTK plasmid with EcoRI. The cDNA for rat Syb2 in pBluescript was a gift from R. Scheller (Stanford University). The cysteine mutant of synaptobrevin (Syb2cm) was created by changing a leucine (Leu-63) to a cysteine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following sense primer was used: 5′-GACCAGAAGCTATCGGAATGCGATGATCGCGCAGATGCCC-3′, and the resulting plasmid was linearized for transcription usingXbaI. The cDNA for rat Syn1A was a gift from Dr. Sabine Hilfiker (University of Manchester). The coding region was amplified by PCR, introducing a BglII site 1 base 5′ to the initiation codon using primer 5′-ACTTTGGCAGATCTACCATGAAGGACCGAACCCAGG-3′ and anXbaI site after the termination codon using primer 5′-CACCATCGGGGGCATCTTTGGATAGTCTAGATATA-3′. This PCR product was cut with BglII and ligated into the BglII andHpaI sites of pSPUTK (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was linearized for transcription using XbaI. The coding region of invariant chain (Ii) was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-ACTTTGGCAGATCTACCATGGATGACCAGCGCGACC-3′ to introduceBglII and NcoI sites around the initiation codon and replace the asparagine residue at position 3 of the coding region with a cysteine. An XbaI site was introduced after the termination codon by using the reverse primer 5′-TATATCTAGATCACATGGGGACTGGGCC-3′. This PCR product was cut withBglII and ligated into the BglII andHpaI sites of pSPUTK (Stratagene). The natural cysteine (Cys-28) was changed to a methionine using the QuikChange kit with the sense primer 5′-CCGGAGAGCAAGATGAGTCGCGGAGCCCTG-3′. Transcription templates for Ii derivatives were prepared by PCR using this variant of Ii as a template. The 5′-primer recognized a region 150 bp 5′ to the SP6 promoter 5′-CCAGAAACTCAGAAGGTTCG-3′, whereas the 3′ primers were 5′-TATATCAGTACAGGAAGTAGGCGGTGG-3′ for Ii81 and 5′-CATGGGGACTGGGCCCAG-3′ for IiTA. The authenticity of all PCR-derived constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transcripts were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase for Syb2cm, or SP6 RNA polymerase for all the other templates, according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Proteins were synthesized using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) that had been prespun at 200,000 × g for 10 min to remove any contaminating membranes. Incubations were performed at 30 °C in the presence of both [35S]methionine and canine pancreatic microsomes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microsomes were prepared from canine pancreas as described by Walter and Blobel (31Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Google Scholar) and added to in vitro translations at 1.5–2.0A 280/ml. A time course was performed to establish the amount of Sec61β that was integrated into canine pancreatic microsomes under the experimental conditions that we were using. This analysis was carried out across a 60-min period, and the percentage integration was defined as the proportion of the total protein synthesized at a particular time point which was found to be membrane-associated and resistant to extraction with alkaline sodium carbonate solution (23Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Google Scholar, 32Knight B.C. High S. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 161-167Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that in the absence of added microsomes, or when using a protein that lacked its tail anchor sequence, less than 2% of the total protein synthesized in 30 min was recovered by this assay (data not shown). In contrast, >30% of authentic Sec61β was recovered in the membrane fraction using the same assay (see Fig.2 A). On the basis of this analysis, translation reactions were initially carried out for 30 min by which point significant membrane integration was observed (see Fig. 2 A). In some subsequent experiments, shorter incubation periods were used to optimize transient associations. In these cases, specific details are indicated in the accompanying figure legend. All puromycin treatments were performed by the addition of 1 mm puromycin and subsequent incubation at 30 °C for 5 min. Microsomes were isolated for cross-linking analysis by layering them over HSC buffer (250 mm sucrose, 500 mm KOAc, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.9) and spinning at 100,000 × g for 10 min to yield a membrane pellet. Membrane pellets were resuspended in LSC buffer (250 mmsucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm(MgOAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH pH 7.9) and normally incubated immediately at 30 °C for 10 min with either bismaleimidohexane (BMH) (0.5 mm final concentration unless otherwise stated), diluted from a 20 mm stock dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, or an equivalent dimethyl sulfoxide control. Where time course experiments were carried out, the sample was resuspended in LSC buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 0–120 min before cross-linking as above. In one case a parallel sample was incubated at 0 °C for 60 min before adding BMH. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to quench any unreacted maleimide groups, and a fraction of the sample was removed for direct analysis. The remainder of the samples were denatured at 70 °C for 10 min in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS and diluted with 4 volumes of Triton X-100 immunoprecipitation buffer (1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Samples were precleared by the addition of 10% volume Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the addition of antisera at 1:100 (v/v) and incubation at 4 °C for 16 h with mixing. Protein A-Sepharose was added to 10% volume, and the incubation continued at 4 °C for a further 2 h. The protein A-Sepharose beads and bound material were pelleted in a microfuge and washed several times with Triton X-100 immunoprecipitation buffer. The resulting beads were heated to 70 °C for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and unless otherwise stated, the solubilized material was resolved on 16% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels run under denaturing conditions. We chose to investigate the association of newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins with ER components using the bifunctional cross-linking reagent BMH, which is highly specific for cysteine residues. This approach had proven very efficient in previous studies of cotranslational membrane protein biosynthesis (32Knight B.C. High S. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 161-167Google Scholar, 33Laird V. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1983-1989Google Scholar). Furthermore, our preliminary analysis had shown that the membrane insertion of the tail-anchored proteins into ER-derived microsomes could be prevented by prior treatment of the membranes withN-ethylmaleimide, which modifies the free sulfydryl groups of cysteine residues (data not shown). Hence, BMH was ideally suited to cross-link newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins containing one or more cysteine residues (see Fig. 1) to the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive, cysteine-containing ER proteins that facilitate their membrane insertion. Given our interest in the biogenesis of the ER translocon (32Knight B.C. High S. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 161-167Google Scholar), we chose Sec61β, one of the tail-anchored subunits of the Sec61 complex, for our initial studies. The β and γ subunits of the Sec61 complex both have amino acid sequences that are characteristic of tail-anchored proteins (30Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Google Scholar) and, like Syb2 (19Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar), are capable of authentic post-translational membrane integration (data not shown). A preliminary time course experiment with Sec61β showed that during a 30-min incubation in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes, more than 30% of the total protein synthesized was both membrane-associated and resistant to extraction with alkaline sodium carbonate solution, indicating that it was fully integrated (Fig.2 A; see also “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 23Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Google Scholar and 32Knight B.C. High S. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 161-167Google Scholar). We then went on to compare samples of in vitro synthesized, membrane-integrated Sec61β incubated in the presence and absence of BMH and discovered a number of specific cross-linking products (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 2). In particular, prominent adducts of ∼22, ∼34, ∼40, and ∼50 kDa were seen (Fig.2 B, lane 2), suggesting the cross-linking of the ∼12-kDa Sec61β polypeptide chain to cellular components of ∼10, ∼22, ∼28, and ∼38 kDa, respectively. It should be noted that the apparent mobility of cross-linking products on SDS-PAGE might not accurately reflect the sum of the molecular masses of the cross-linked components. Hence, in the absence of additional information the predicted sizes of the cross-linking partners must be treated with caution. We analyzed the Sec61β cross-linking products by immunoprecipitation using a variety of antisera to ER components and were able to identify two of the major adducts unambiguously. Thus, newly synthesized membrane-integrated Sec61β was found to be cross-linked to the α subunit of the Sec61 complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) and SPC25, the 25-kDa subunit of the signal peptidase complex (Fig.2 B, lane 5). As expected, all of the adducts were immunoprecipitated by an antiserum recognizing Sec61β (Fig.2 B, lane 4). Furthermore, cross-linking of Sec61β to both Sec62p and Sec63p was also observed (Fig.2 B, lanes 6 and 7, respectively), although these did not appear to be major adducts (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2 and 4). Given that Sec61β forms part of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex, we reasoned that newly synthesized, membrane-inserted Sec61β would probably display two types of associations with endogenous ER components. These would most likely be transient associations, indicative of a biosynthetic pathway, and stable associations, indicative of assembly into the Sec61 complex. We therefore carried out a time course experiment where membrane-associated Sec61β was isolated from the translation reaction and incubated for increasing periods of time before cross-linking was initiated. From this time course experiment, it was immediately obvious that all of the major cross-linking products except the Sec61α adduct reflected a transient association between the newly synthesized Sec61β polypeptides and ER-associated components (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1–5; cf. Fig. 2 B, lane 3). Thus, the pattern of BMH-dependent cross-linking products was the same as observed previously when cross-linking was carried out immediately after the isolation of the membrane fraction (Fig. 2 B, lane 2, and Fig. 2 C,lane 1). In contrast, when the membrane fraction was incubated for 10 min at the translation temperature before cross-linking, only the prominent Sec61α adduct remained (Fig.2 C, lane 2, product indicated by the filled circle in lane 6). The sample could be incubated at 30 °C for up to 120 min before adding the cross-linking reagent, and a strong adduct with Sec61α was still observed, whereas none of the other major products seen at the zero time point was detected (Fig.2 C, lanes 1–5). Interestingly, the “release” of newly synthesized Sec61β from its transient association with a discrete set of cellular components could be prevented by incubating the samples on ice rather than at 30 °C (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4 and 6). This observation indicates that the release of Sec61β from these transient associations is prevented at low temperature. We found that adduct formation with Sec61α was largely unaffected by prolonged incubation before initiating BMH-dependent cross-linking, confirming the stability of reduced thiol groups under the experimental conditions we have used. The prolonged association of Sec61β with Sec61α which we can detect by cross-linking presumably reflects the in vitro formation of Sec61-derived complexes. We did observe some reduction in the overall intensity of the Sec61β/Sec61α adduct across a 120-min time course, although the radiolabeled Sec61β chains were stable during this period (Fig.2 C, lanes 1–5). In contrast, the Sec61β/Sec61α adduct was unaffected by a 60-min incubation at 0 °C (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4 and 6). We believe that Sec61β can be cross-linked to Sec61α both during its biosynthesis, where the association is transient, and during subsequent complex formation, where the association is stable. In the case of complex formation, the radiolabeled Sec61β synthesized in vitro must compete for binding with endogenous unlabeled Sec61β present in the canine pancreatic microsomes. Such competition would limit the proportion of radiolabeled Sec61β that could be cross-linked to Sec61α, and presumably a “steady state” is reached. This is also consistent with our observation that between 30 and 120 min the efficiency of cross-linking to Sec61α is relatively constant (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3–5). On the basis of our cross-linking analysis with Sec61β, we concluded that BMH-dependent cross-linking could be exploited successfully to reveal transient associations between newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins and cellular components. To focus our analysis on potential biosynthetic interactions, we next analyzed a tail-anchored protein that would not be expected to form any stable complexes with endogenous ER components. For this reason we chose Syb2 as a previously well characterized tail-anchored protein that is membrane-integrated at the ER and then transported to post-ER vesicular structures (19Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar). When wild type Syb2 was analyzed no BMH-dependent adducts were observed, indicating that the single naturally occurring cysteine residue present within the transmembrane domain of Syb2 (see Fig. 1) is insufficient to generate BMH-dependent adducts (data not shown). A number of previous studies have underlined the importance of the relative position of a cross-linking probe within a precursor upon its capacity for adduct formation (34Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 142-147Google Scholar). Given our success with the cross-linking analysis of Sec61β, we prepared a mutant form of Syb2 with a cysteine residue at an equivalent location within its cytosolic domain (Syb2cm, see Fig. 1). We confirmed that Syb2cm behaved as an authentic tail-anchored protein by showing that it could integrate post-translationally into canine pancreatic microsomes in the same way as the wild type protein (cf. Ref. 19Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar and data not shown). As we had seen previously with Sec61β (Fig. 2, B andC), Syb2cm yielded several BMH-dependent cross-linking products when synthesized in the presence of ER-derived microsomal membranes (see Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). A parallel control experiment showed that no such BMH-dependent adducts were obtained with a version of Syb2cm which lacked its transmembrane domain (data not shown). All of the BMH-dependent adducts could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-Syb2 antibody confirming their origin (Fig. 3 A,lane 3). By screening a number of antisera recognizing known ER components, we were able to identify specific cross-linking of Syb2cm with Sec61β (∼10-kDa partner, Fig. 3 A, lane 5, *) and SPC25 (∼22-kDa partner, Fig. 3 A, lane 6, †). The ∼38-kDa product observed in the absence of BMH (Fig.3 A, lane 1, thin arrow) is distinct from the SPC25 adduct (Fig. 3 A, lane 6) and is most likely an SDS-resistant dimer of Syb2cm. A weaker ∼80 kDa adduct with Sec62p (Fig. 3 A, cf. lanes 7 and8) could also be observed after immunoprecipitation. All three of these components are known to be either a part of, or closely associated with, the Sec61 translocon. Despite this, we could detect no cross-linking of Syb2cm to Sec61α, the core subunit of the Sec61 translocon (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). This is in contrast to the behavior of newly synthesized Sec61β, which exhibited strong cross-linking to Sec61α which generated a discrete ∼50-kDa adduct (see Fig. 2 B). The identity of at least three other major Syb2cm cross-linking products remains to be determined (see “Discussion”). To assess how general the associations of newly synthesized Sec61β and Syb2cm with specific ER components were, we repeated a similar experiment using a third tail-anchored protein. Syn1A has only one cysteine present in its cytosolic domain, and this is located 121 residues from the presumptive transmembrane region (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, like the other two proteins analyzed, Syn1A also yielded multiple BMH- dependent cross-linking products (Fig.3 B, lane 1). As with Syb2cm, specific adducts of Syn1A with Sec61β (Fig. 3 B, lane 3, *), SPC25 (Fig. 3 B, lane 4, †), and Sec62p (Fig.3 B, lane 5, ∼90 kDa product) were identified. At least two other major adducts were detected (Fig.3 B, lane 1; Fig. 4,lane 7), but these could not be identified by immunoprecipitation (see “Discussion”). An additional product was brought down nonspecifically during the immunoisolation of the Sec61β, SPC25, and Sec62p adducts (Fig.3 B, lanes 3, 4 and 5,open arrowhead). However, in other experiments this product was not associated with these adducts after immunoprecipitation (cf. Fig. 4.). Once again, Syn1A showed no evidence of cross-linking to Sec61α (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). The authenticity of the Syn1A adducts with Sec61β, SPC25, and Sec62p was confirmed further by showing that no such products could be detected when control immunoprecipitations were carried out in the absence of BMH-dependent cross-linking (data not shown). On the basis of the data outlined above, we concluded that newly synthesized tail-anchored proteins associate with several generic ER components including the β subunit of the Sec61 complex and two Sec61 associated components (SPC25 and Sec62p). In contrast to many previous studies that had investigated cotranslationally inserted membrane proteins (see Ref. 2Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Google Scholar and references therein), no cross-linking of the tail-anchored"

Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins cause nonspecific lethal lesions (holes) of the host cytoplasmic membrane, which allow the passage of the murein hydrolase to the periplasm for proteoglycan degradation (1Young R.

Despite the increasing number of holin family members described by genetic analysis and their promising use in biotechnology, their structure and molecular mechanism of action are still unknown (2Young R.

Thus, N- and C-terminal solvent-exposed regions have been proposed as lysis timing regulators, their positive charge content being directly correlated with the onset retardation (8Steiner M.

On the other hand, the hydrophobic segments have been suggested to be responsible for the permeation event, because they contain most of the inactivating mutations (10Raab R. Neal G. Garrett J.

In contrast to λS holin, the EJh polypeptide chain lacks a defined dual start, and its sequence analysis only allows the prediction of two transmembrane regions of higher hydrophobicity. To gain insight into the molecular and structural basis of EJh membrane lesions, we have undertaken a fragment approach to the polypeptide chain. The synthetic peptides were conformationally characterized, both in aqueous and in membrane environments, and their capacity to induce membrane leakage was assayed. The body of results revealed the predicted N-terminal transmembrane helix as the potential active region of the holin molecule. When synthesized as a peptide, including the charged N terminus (1–32 sequence segment), this region folded into a transmembrane helix displaying self-assembly properties that permit membrane permeation to dextrans of various sizes. Finally, the study of peptide-induced bilayer lesions by atomic force microscopy has allowed the visualization of polydisperse defects as holes. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the nature of lytic domain and the bilayer lesions carried out by holins.DISCUSSIONGenetic studies have provided evidence for the existence of a growing family of phage-encoded small hydrophobic proteins named holins, which are tailored for causing nonspecific membrane lesions (3Wang I.N. Smith D.L. Young R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 799-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar,7Bläsi U. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Young R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 21-36PubMed Google Scholar). These lesions have always been thought as membrane holes but their nature was unknown. The simple constitution of holins as either two or three potential transmembrane helical segments, and the exchangeability of those segments in chimeric molecules, prompted the elaboration of a model in which a protein oligomer is fully responsible for the formation of a membrane pore (7Bläsi U. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This in-membrane oligomerization process is particularly important, because it has been correlated with the requirement of a critical mass action pool of protein in the membrane that it is achieved along the lysis timing period (39Young R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 21-36PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gründling A. Bläsi A. Young R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 769-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).EJh, the holin of the temperate pneumococcal EJ-1 phage is one of the best conserved members of the type-II holin group (7Bläsi U.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to λS, the EJh sequence does not allow the existence of two translation initiation sites (two-start motif) and the consequent activity regulation by the polypeptide chain length (7Bläsi U. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Dı́az E. Munthali M. Lünsdorf H. Höltje J.-V. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, EJh sequence contains only two hydrophobic regions, whereas λS displays three (7Bläsi U. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Dı́az E. Munthali M. Lünsdorf H. Höltje J.-V. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This apparent simplicity makes EJh an adequate candidate to approach holins in molecular terms.Theoretical analysis of the EJh sequence predicts the existence of two hydrophobic segments with a length compatible with transmembrane helices separated by a putative turn that permits a minimal helix-turn-helix folding with both chain ends projected into the cytoplasmic side of an imaginary inner membrane (14Dı́az E. Munthali M. Lünsdorf H. Höltje J.-V. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All these topological regions, when synthesized as individual peptides and studied by CD and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies, in both aqueous and membrane environments, essentially reproduced the predicted tendencies except in three aspects. First, EJh-L1 (the 11-amino acid N-terminal region) displays an environment-sensitive secondary structure characterized by the stabilization of an extended conformation in the presence of acidic lipids that can be explained on the basis of its sequence amphipathicity. Second, the second predicted transmembrane helix, EJh-M2, collapses into extended aggregates even in the presence of SDS micelles. Extending the chain length with four or five N- and/or C-terminal flanking residues from the protein sequence, and changing the acyl chain of the target membrane has no impact on the observed behavior, thus excluding hydrophobic mismatching effects and solubility impairments. This discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental secondary structure propensity of the isolated EJh-M2 might arise from the dependence of folding on long range interactions, as suggested for other membrane-spanning sequences (33Aggeli A. Boden N. Chen Y.L. Findlay J.B. Knowles P.F. Kovatchev P. Turnbull P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16213-16221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Hunt J.F. Earnest T.N. Bousché O.

Third, the transbilayer disposition of the first transmembrane region is achieved only in a longer form containing charged amino acids. Therefore, we can conclude that, with the limitations imposed by the absence of long range interaction and the sequential amphiphilicity, the EJh molecule might fold essentially as predicted.In the quest for finding the polypeptide region responsible for the membrane-damaging activity we tested the previous peptides in a conventional leakage assay. Among them, only those peptides containing the N-terminal hydrophobic region, namely EJh-M1 and EJh-L1M1, permeabilized the membranes to solutes with Stokes radii of about 6 Å (36Bohrer M.P. Deen W.M. Robertson C.R. Troy J.L. Brenner B.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 74: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Parente R.A. Nir S. Szoka F.C., Jr. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8720-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) in a lipid composition-independent fashion. This assay allows the assignment of the membrane lesion activity to the N-terminal hydrophobic region but does not rule out the cooperation of EJh-M2 in the entire EJh molecule. In terms of the alternative models for the active oligomer displayed in Fig. 1 B, the present data support a holin oligomer structure in which the pore lining is formed by EJh-M1 units (top view b). Interestingly, EJh-M1 does contain a proportion of polar amino acids large enough to be considered amphipathic, but its N terminus contains a cluster of aromatic residues that have been referred to as functional ion sinks (42Ladhokin A.S. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 794-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Corbin J. Methot N. Wang H.H. Baezinger J.E. Blanton M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adoption of this model requires also the verification of the capacity of EJh-M1 to oligomerize. In this sense, the relief of the self-quenching of fluorescein-labeled EJh-L1M1 upon co-incorporation into membranes with non-fluorescent peptide verifies this hypothesis. In this context, it is worth emphasizing the low stability displayed by the oligomers, because both β-octyl glucoside and SDS treatments reversed their association.To investigate the nature of the membrane lesions produced by holins, the conventional leakage used in activity screening is probably an inadequate model. On a conceptual basis, holins are believed to generate membrane discontinuities large enough to allow the passage of a peptidoglycan hydrolase, which for EJ-1 phage is a 36-kDa amidase exhibiting a monomer-to-dimer equilibrium (44Saı́z J.L. López-Zumel C. Monterroso B. Varea J. Arrondo J.L. Iloro I. Garcı́a J.L. Laynez J. Menéndez M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1788-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 45Fernández-Tornero C. Garcı́a E. López R. Jiménez-Gallego G. Romero A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both pore sizing using encapsulation relief strategies and the topographic analysis by atomic force microscopy of lipid-peptide assemblies evidenced membrane lesions large enough to allow the passage of the amidase partner across the bilayer. Interestingly, the large lesions that concur with biological activity seem to result from the enlargement of smaller holes upon the dynamic bilayer deformations required for the attachment to the mica. Probably the treatment used in these in vitroexperiments would not be operative enough in a cellular environment, but the differences in composition between prokaryote cytoplasm and periplasm ensures a variety of ways to accomplish the needed bilayer stress. The observed slit enlargement implies the generation of peptide-naked lipid edges as shown in the nascent pores made by streptolysin O (46Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and, consequently, their contemplation in the original model of holin action. In this sense, transbilayer holin oligomers could be considered as seeds for membrane deformation events. Holin refers to a family of bacteriophage-encoded small hydrophobic proteins (60–145 amino acid residues) that make up the two-component lysis system used by most double-stranded DNA phages to accomplish the release of the progeny at the last stage of the infection (1Young R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins cause nonspecific lethal lesions (holes) of the host cytoplasmic membrane, which allow the passage of the murein hydrolase to the periplasm for proteoglycan degradation (1Young R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 430-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Young R. Bläsi U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Wang I.N. Smith D.L. Young R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 799-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This ability makes holins the regulators of both the timing of host lysis and the yield of the phage progeny. Despite the increasing number of holin family members described by genetic analysis and their promising use in biotechnology, their structure and molecular mechanism of action are still unknown (2Young R. Bläsi U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Wang I.N. Smith D.L. Young R. Annu. Rev.

Lonvaud-Funel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 171: 231-238PubMed Google Scholar). Most, if not all, of the current knowledge on holins is based on the λ phage S protein, a type I holin characterized by a dual start motif and three potential transmembrane segments (3Wang I.N. Smith D.L. Young R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 799-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 7Bläsi U. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have provided the evidences for essential residues and the basis for function regulation. Thus, N- and C-terminal solvent-exposed regions have been proposed as lysis timing regulators, their positive charge content being directly correlated with the onset retardation (8Steiner M. Bläsi U. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Bläsi U. Fraisl P. Chang C.-Y. Zhang N. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hydrophobic segments have been suggested to be responsible for the permeation event, because they contain most of the inactivating mutations (10Raab R. Neal G. Garrett J. Grimaila R. Fusselman R. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Johnson-Boaz R. Chang C.-Y. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, biochemical studies have determined the location of the protein at the inner membrane, verified its predicted helical structure in detergent micelles, and evidenced its permeating properties in model membranes (12Zagotta M.T. Wilson D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 191-205Crossref Google Scholar, 13Smith D.L. Struck D.K. Scholtz J.M. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these data have set the basis for a model in which a homo- or hetero-oligomer of transmembrane helices forms a functional pore (2Young R. Bläsi U. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Smith D.L. Struck D.K. Scholtz J.M. Young R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EJh,1 the holin of the temperate pneumococcal EJ-1 phage, is an 85-amino acid polypeptide chain ascribed to the type II holin subgroup (14Dı́az E. Munthali M. Lünsdorf H. Höltje J.-V. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown for λS holin, EJh expression is lethal for the host cell (14Dı́az E. Munthali M. Lünsdorf H. Höltje J.-V.

First, EJh-L1 (the 11-amino acid N-terminal region) displays an environment-sensitive secondary structure characterized by the stabilization of an extended conformation in the presence of acidic lipids that can be explained on the basis of its sequence amphipathicity. Second, the second predicted transmembrane helix, EJh-M2, collapses into extended aggregates even in the presence of SDS micelles. Extending the chain length with four or five N- and/or C-terminal flanking residues from the protein sequence, and changing the acyl chain of the target membrane has no impact on the observed behavior, thus excluding hydrophobic mismatching effects and solubility impairments. This discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental secondary structure propensity of the isolated EJh-M2 might arise from the dependence of folding on long range interactions, as suggested for other membrane-spanning sequences (33Aggeli A.

Third, the transbilayer disposition of the first transmembrane region is achieved only in a longer form containing charged amino acids. Therefore, we can conclude that, with the limitations imposed by the absence of long range interaction and the sequential amphiphilicity, the EJh molecule might fold essentially as predicted. In the quest for finding the polypeptide region responsible for the membrane-damaging activity we tested the previous peptides in a conventional leakage assay. Among them, only those peptides containing the N-terminal hydrophobic region, namely EJh-M1 and EJh-L1M1, permeabilized the membranes to solutes with Stokes radii of about 6 Å (36Bohrer M.P. Deen W.M. Robertson C.R. Troy J.L. Brenner B.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 74: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Parente R.A. Nir S. Szoka F.C., Jr. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8720-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) in a lipid composition-independent fashion. This assay allows the assignment of the membrane lesion activity to the N-terminal hydrophobic region but does not rule out the cooperation of EJh-M2 in the entire EJh molecule. In terms of the alternative models for the active oligomer displayed in Fig. 1 B, the present data support a holin oligomer structure in which the pore lining is formed by EJh-M1 units (top view b). Interestingly, EJh-M1 does contain a proportion of polar amino acids large enough to be considered amphipathic, but its N terminus contains a cluster of aromatic residues that have been referred to as functional ion sinks (42Ladhokin A.S. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 794-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Corbin J. Methot N. Wang H.H. Baezinger J.E. Blanton M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adoption of this model requires also the verification of the capacity of EJh-M1 to oligomerize. In this sense, the relief of the self-quenching of fluorescein-labeled EJh-L1M1 upon co-incorporation into membranes with non-fluorescent peptide verifies this hypothesis. In this context, it is worth emphasizing the low stability displayed by the oligomers, because both β-octyl glucoside and SDS treatments reversed their association. To investigate the nature of the membrane lesions produced by holins, the conventional leakage used in activity screening is probably an inadequate model. On a conceptual basis, holins are believed to generate membrane discontinuities large enough to allow the passage of a peptidoglycan hydrolase, which for EJ-1 phage is a 36-kDa amidase exhibiting a monomer-to-dimer equilibrium (44Saı́z J.L. López-Zumel C. Monterroso B. Varea J. Arrondo J.L. Iloro I. Garcı́a J.L. Laynez J. Menéndez M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1788-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 45Fernández-Tornero C.

Both pore sizing using encapsulation relief strategies and the topographic analysis by atomic force microscopy of lipid-peptide assemblies evidenced membrane lesions large enough to allow the passage of the amidase partner across the bilayer. Interestingly, the large lesions that concur with biological activity seem to result from the enlargement of smaller holes upon the dynamic bilayer deformations required for the attachment to the mica. Probably the treatment used in these in vitroexperiments would not be operative enough in a cellular environment, but the differences in composition between prokaryote cytoplasm and periplasm ensures a variety of ways to accomplish the needed bilayer stress. The observed slit enlargement implies the generation of peptide-naked lipid edges as shown in the nascent pores made by streptolysin O (46Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and, consequently, their contemplation in the original model of holin action. In this sense, transbilayer holin oligomers could be considered as seeds for membrane deformation events. We thank E. Dı́az, J. L. Garcı́a, and P. Garcı́a for advice and helpful discussions.

In this study, a novel transcriptional regulatory element was identified in the 5′-untranslated region of the cyclin D1 gene. We show that this element differentially suppresses cyclin D1 expression in young versus senescent fibroblasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed abundant complexes forming with young cell nuclear extracts compared with senescent cell nuclear extracts. Binding was maintained in young quiescent cells, showing that loss of this activity was specific to senescent cells and not an effect of cell cycle arrest. Site-directed mutagenesis within this cyclin D1 inhibitory element (DIE) abolished binding activity and selectively increased cyclin D1 promoter activity in young but not in senescent cells. Sequences with homology to the DIE were found in the 5′-untranslated regions of other genes known to be up-regulated during cellular aging, suggesting that protein(s) that bind the DIE might be responsible for the coordinate increase in transcription of many genes during cellular aging. This study provides evidence that loss of transcriptional repressor activity contributes to the up-regulation of cyclin D1, and possibly additional age-regulated genes, during cellular senescence.

These cells have a finite proliferative life span, at the end of which they are unable to enter the S phase in response to mitogenic stimuli, but they remain metabolically active for long periods of time (3Goldstein S.

Furthermore, senescent cells arrest with a DNA content characteristic of the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle; yet the expression and activity of many cell cycle regulatory proteins during G0, G1, and senescence are distinct, implying that senescent cells exist in a unique, nonproliferative state that we have termed GS (13Parr E. Toyama T. Hull C. Meyyappan M. Bestilny L. Wheaton K. Riabowol K. Curr. Sci. 1998; 74: 878-883Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is a member of the d-type family of cyclins that associates with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (14Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

However, cyclin D1 knockouts are rescued by cyclin E expression, whereas the reverse does not hold, suggesting that cyclin D1 does not play a central role in regulating the cell cycle, which is further suggested by the phenotype of cyclin D1 knockout mice (17Geng Y.

Normal human diploid fibroblasts that have reached the end of their in vitro life span (senescent cells) express 3-fold higher levels of cyclin D1 protein than low passage cells. Individual cells in mass culture that fail to initiate DNA synthesis in response to serum addition have severalfold higher levels of this cyclin than proliferation competent cells (7Atadja P. Wong H. Veillete C. Riabowol K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cyclin D1 overexpression may inhibit this entry into S phase through binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (7Atadja P. Wong H. Veillete C. Riabowol K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Pagano M. Theodoras A.M. Tam S.W. Draetta G.R.

Schuuring E. Brookes S. Michalides R. Dickson C. Arnold A. Peters G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 439-444PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that deregulated expression of cyclin D1 contributes to abnormal cell proliferation. Ectopic overexpression of cyclin D1 in normal HDFs, the mammary epithelial cell line MCF-7, Dami megakaryotic cells, and rat embryo fibroblasts inhibits DNA synthesis and cell growth (7Atadja P.

Cyclin D1 has also been shown to be up-regulated in numerous nonproliferative differentiated cell types (26Burger C. Wick M. Muller R. J.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), lending further mass to the idea that it may also provide growth suppressive functions. In senescent fibroblasts, the cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels are constitutively up-regulated by ∼3–5-fold compared with serum-stimulated young cells (6Dulic V. Drulliger L.F. Lies E. Reed S.I. Stein F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Atadja P. Wong H. Veillete C. Riabowol K. Exp.

Ueda K. Takahashi T. Ide T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 81: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 5′-regulatory region of the cyclin D1 gene has been well characterized, and the regions responsible for serum-inducible transcription have been identified (32Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2105-2107PubMed Google Scholar, 33Motokura T. Arnold A. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993; 7: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of cyclin D1 gene expression is not well understood under conditions of senescence-associated growth arrest where induction is at least as great as seen in response to serum. The increased expression of cyclin D1 is specific for senescence-associated growth inhibition in HDFs and is not apparent in contact-inhibited or serum-deprived cells arrested at a similar place in the cell cycle (24Meyyappan M. Wong H. Hull C. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3163-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the closely related cyclin D2 where expression is increased in senescent, quiescent and contact-inhibited cells (24Meyyappan M. Wong H. Hull C. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3163-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, unique transcriptional mechanism(s) may strongly contribute to cyclin D1 expression during senescence. In this report, we examine potential 5′-regulatory regions and mechanisms that may be responsible for the up-regulation of cyclin D1 seen in aging HDFs. Analysis of the cyclin D1 promoter via transient transfections of nested promoter deletions into young and old fibroblasts has identified a 15-bp cyclin D1 inhibitory element (DIE). This element is located in the 5′-UTR of cyclin D1 and has been shown to bind a low molecular mass protein more avidly in young cells compared with senescent cells, suggesting that loss of binding to this element in senescent cells contributes to the increased expression of cyclin D1 seen during cellular senescence. Consistent with a role in cell aging, it was noted that several other genes that are up-regulated during cell aging were found to have DIE-like elements in their 5′-UTRs, strongly supporting the idea that this element may bind a common regulatory protein that contributes to senescence-specific gene expression. HDFs (Hs68: ATCC CRL 1635 from newborn foreskin, reaches 85 mean population doublings (MPDs) in culture; WI-38: CCL 75, from embryonic lung, reaches 56 MPDs under our culture conditions) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. In all experiments, low passage (young) cells were between 28–32 MPDs and high passage (senescent) cells were used at 82–86 MPDs (Hs68) or 53–56 MPDs (WI-38). Senescence was defined as a state in which less than 10% (typically 3–5%) of cells enter DNA synthesis in response to mitogens in a 36-h period. Senescent cells used in this study did not reach confluence within 2 weeks after subculturing at a 1:2 split ratio, demonstrated a characteristic large, flattened senescent cell morphology, and were positive for senescence-associated β-gal activity. In vitrosenescence-associated β-gal activity was detected as described (5Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M.

The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 3–5 min at room temperature, washed several times with PBS (pH 6.0), and stained for 16–24 h at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactoside (X-gal) in PBS (pH 6.0) containing 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferriccyanide, and 1 mmMgCl2. The 1.3-kb human cyclin D1 promoter in pUC118 vector was a generous gift from Yue Xiong (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The vector was digested with SacI/PvuII to release the 1291-bp promoter containing 138 bp of the 5′-UTR. The ends of the fragment were filled in with Klenow polymerase (Invitrogen), and the fragment was subcloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II KS. Nested deletions were performed with a double-stranded nested deletion kit (Pharmacia Corp.). For 5′ nested deletions, the cyclin D1 promoter in pBluescript was digested with HindIII, filled in with thionucleotides, and redigested with EcoRV at the 5′ end. The deletions were made by exonuclease III digestion for various time points followed by S1 nuclease treatment. The deleted constructs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated, and transformed to obtain clones, which were screened and sequenced for the desired deletions. Deleted clones in pBluescript were digested withSalI/BamHI and subcloned into theSalI/BamHI site of the pBLCAT3 vector. The clones were designated as −1154 (full length), −858, −580, −459, −425, −198, −85, −23, and +26 relative to the transcriptional start site. For 3′ deletions of the 5′-UTR, the −23 clone in pBluescript was cut with SpeI, filled in with thionucleotides, and redigested with BamHI at the 3′ end. After exonuclease III/S1 nuclease treatment, the deleted clones were ligated, screened, and sequenced. Clones with 3′ deletions were digested withSalI/XbaI and subcloned into theSalI/XbaI sites of the pBLCLAT3 vector. Two clones with the 3′ end deleted were designated as −23 to +74 and −23 to +24. 5 × 105 log phase young and senescent Hs68 fibroblasts were seeded in 150-mm plates and harvested when ∼80% confluent. The cells were trypsinized, suspended in 400 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and transferred to 4-mm gap cuvettes (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). Cyclin D1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid (30 μg) was added to 5 μg of a cytomegalovirus-driven β-galactosidase expression construct and 15 μg of salmon sperm DNA to make a total DNA content of 50 μg/cuvette. Electroporations were done using a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 250 V and 960 microfarad, and following transfection, the samples were transferred to 10-cm plates. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed for CAT activity. 5 × 103 log phase (unsynchronized) young and senescent (arrested) Hs68 fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates and treated when ∼95% confluent. The cells were washed in PBS (pH 7.2), and the medium was replaced with OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen). LipofectAMINE 2000/OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) solution (250 μl) was incubated for 20 min with DNA/OPTI-MEM solution (250 μl). Immediately after incubation 500 μl was added to each well of the 6-well plate. Approximately 6 h later, the medium was replaced with l-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested 48 h later using passive lysis buffer (Invitrogen) and assayed for luciferase expression using an EG & G Berthold luminometer. Electroporated cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and centrifuged. The cell pellet was washed with PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.8), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen with rigorous vortexing between each step. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants containing the cell extract were used for β-galactosidase assays as previously described (5Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, 10 μl of cell extract was added to a tube containing 90 μl of lysis buffer, 350 μl of LacZ buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and 50 μl of chlorophenolred-β-d-galactopyranoside (30 μg/μl) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 574 nm was determined. Activity resulting from the co-transfected cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid was determined by subtraction of endogenous basal activity values obtained from mock-transfected young and old fibroblasts. Extracts corresponding to equal units of β-galactosidase activity were used for CAT assays as described previously (35Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The proportion of acetylated product was determined by liquid scintillation counting of excised thin layer chromatography spots. Nuclear extracts from young and old Hs68 HDFs were prepared as described previously (36Atadja P.W. Stringer K.F. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell.

A double-stranded 64-bp oligonucleotide spanning nucleotides +75 to + 138 and the overlapping oligonucleotides (both wild type and mutant) were synthesized with 5′ overhangs, end-labeled with Klenow enzyme (0.5 unit; Invitrogen) and 50 μCi of [α32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and gel-purified. 20,000 cpm of labeled probe (0.1–0.5 ng) was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts from young or old cells in binding reactions that contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as described previously (36Atadja P.W. Stringer K.F. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, electrophoresed through 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 150 V at room temperature, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) and binding conditions for this element have been described previously (36Atadja P.W. Stringer K.F. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20,000 cpm (0.1–0.5 ng) of gel-purified [α32P]dCTP-labeled probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear protein extract in a buffer that contained 20 mmTris (pH 7.6), 4% Ficoll, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 μg of partially denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl for 30 min at room temperature. Unlabeled wild type and mutant competitor DNA was added at a 100-fold excess and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of hot probe. A total of 8 bp between +117 and +131 of the 5′-UTR were mutated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A mutagenic primer (46-mer) was synthesized and annealed to the double-stranded pBLCAT3 construct containing the full-length cyclin D1 promoter. Pfu DNA polymerase was used to synthesize the mutagenic promoters followed by digestion of the parental plasmid by DpnI as per the manufacturer's instructions. The mutated plasmid was transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells, and the resulting plasmid was isolated and sequenced to confirm the mutations. To estimate the relative molecular mass of the DNA-binding proteins, binding reactions using various oligonucleotides as described for the band shift assays were performed. Twice the amount of labeled probe (40,000 cpm) and nuclear extract (10 μg) were used. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the binding reaction was subjected to UV light, and unprotected DNA was digested. The samples were irradiated by a 305-nm inverted UV transilluminator at 7 mW/cm2 for 5 min. The cross-linked reactions were electrophoresed through 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. All of the sequence analyses were performed using the Wisconsin Package™ (version 9.1) from the Genetics Computer Group available through the Canadian Bioinformatics Resources website. Promoter sequences in the GenBankTM DNA sequence data base were obtained from the NCBI. The accession numbers identifying particular sequences are listed under “Results.” The sequences were searched for the 15-bp DIE using the FINDPATTERNS program, allowing for 33.3% (5 of 15) random mismatch. Further DIE-like element comparison was done using the PRETTY program to find those elements with highest sequence similarity to the DIE. Constructs containing wild type and mutant DIE elements were made using pGL3 Control reporter plasmids (Promega). The 15-bp high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were cloned into theHindIII site found between the SV40 promoter and the luc+ reporter gene. This cloning site is found outside of the pGL3 control multi-cloning site and was chosen because of its proximity to the functional gene (i.e. the in vivo DIE is located in the 5′-UTR of the cyclin D1 gene). Therefore, the DIE was cloned upstream of the luc+ start codon but downstream of the SV40 promoter (see Fig. 8 A). These constructs were then co-transfected into young and old HDFs with aRenilla luciferase construct (pRL-TK) as a transfection efficiency control. Firefly luciferase expression was measured using an EG & G Berthold luminometer and normalized based on pRL-TK expression. To determine the basal activity of the cyclin D1 promoter in young and old cells, a 1.3-kb cyclin D1 promoter fused to a CAT reporter gene (Fig.1 A) was used in transient transfection studies. Various 5′ deleted cyclin D1 promoter-CAT reporter constructs were also generated (Fig. 1 B) and transiently co-transfected with a cytomegalovirus-driven β-galactosidase construct (as internal control) into young and old cells. CAT activity caused by the full-length cyclin D1 promoter was 4–5-fold greater in old than in young cells (Fig. 1 B), consistent with endogenous levels of cyclin D1 expression in those cells (7Atadja P. Wong H. Veillete C. Riabowol K. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Deletion of segments from the 5′ end from −1154 to −85 progressively reduced the expression difference between young and old cells to levels observed with the promoterless pBLCAT3 vector (Fig.1 B). However, the smallest deletion construct containing −23 to +138 of the cyclin D1 promoter retained 3–4-fold higher expression levels in old compared with young cells, indicating that this region is sufficient to confer increased expression in old cells. We then generated further 5′ and 3′ nested deletions of the −23 to +138 region to further define the region involved in the differential regulation of cyclin D1. As shown in Fig.2 A, removal of the transcription initiation site resulted in approximately equivalent levels of inhibition of CAT activity in young and old cells. However, when 64 bp (+75 to +138) of the 5′-UTR were deleted, it resulted in a further 44% decrease in old cells, but the CAT activity in young cells remained relatively unchanged, thus reducing the fold difference in CAT activity to levels observed with the control vector (Fig.2 B, compare −23 to +138 with −23 to +74). Further removal of the 5′-UTR did not have any differential effect on CAT activity because it resulted in an approximately 77% decrease in young and an 82% decrease in old cells. These results indicate that together, other regions of the promoter are likely to contribute as strongly to the differential expression of cyclin D1 in young and old cells. The 64-bp sequence between +75 and +138 appeared to be a potential binding site for a transcriptional repressor in young cells and/or a transcriptional activator in old cells. To determine whether any proteins could be detected binding to this 64-bp region, electrophoretic mobility shift assays with young and old cell nuclear extracts were performed. Specific complexes were formed with young cell extracts, whereas the levels were dramatically reduced with old cell extracts (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3). Specificity of the complexes was confirmed by incubation with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide, which effectively competed with the labeled probe (Fig. 3 A,lanes 4 and 5), whereas a 100-fold excess of unlabeled, unrelated CRE oligonucleotide did not compete efficiently (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7). To rule out the possibility that the nuclear extracts from old Hs68 fibroblasts were deficient in their ability to bind DNA through some nonspecific mechanism, we performed gel shift studies using the same extracts with an oligonucleotide containing the CRE present in the c-fos promoter (36Atadja P.W. Stringer K.F. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, CRE binding activity was actually about 50% higher in old cell extracts than in young (lanes 2 and 3). As expected, 100-fold competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide bearing the same CRE sequence competed with the complexes formed on the labeled CRE (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and 5), whereas mutant sequences did not (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6 and7). Given previous reports that CRE binding activity is about equal in young and old cells, specific binding activity of the complex in Fig. 3 A may actually be even more dramatically reduced in extracts from old compared with young cells (36Atadja P.W. Stringer K.F. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although extracts from young cells showed more binding activity than extracts from old cells, it was possible that reduced binding in old cells was due to cells exiting the cell cycle when senescent rather than to a senescence-specific event per se. For example, a clear passage-related up-regulation of cyclin D2 is seen in all strains of primary HDFs examined, but increased expression is also seen upon serum withdrawal or contact inhibition-induced cell cycle arrest (24Meyyappan M. Wong H. Hull C. Riabowol K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3163-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test whether the loss of binding was senescence-specific, we incubated the 64-bp element with extracts from young proliferating cells, young quiescent cells, and subconfluent old cells. As shown in Fig. 3 C, reduced binding was not seen in young quiescent cells (lanes Q) with either the 64-bp element or with subdomains (see below) of this element, indicating that the loss of binding is senescence-dependent rather than growth-dependent. DNase I footprinting assays were attempted but did not prove useful in identifying sequences within the 64-bp region that were differentially protected using young and old cell nuclear extracts (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2091302576,"The effect of ADP and phosphorylation upon the actin binding properties of heavy meromyosin was investigated using three fluorescence methods that monitor the number of heavy meromyosin heads that bind to pyrene-actin: (i) amplitudes of ATP-induced dissociation, (ii) amplitudes of ADP-induced dissociation of the pyrene-actin-heavy meromyosin complex, and (iii) amplitudes of the association of heavy meromyosin with pyrene-actin. Both heads bound to pyrene-actin, irrespective of regulatory light chain phosphorylation or the presence of ADP. This behavior was found for native regulated heavy meromyosin prepared by proteolytic digestion of chicken gizzard myosin with between 5 and 95% heavy chain cleavage at the actin-binding loop, showing that two-head binding is a property of heavy meromyosin with uncleaved heavy chains. These data are in contrast to a previous study using an uncleaved expressed preparation (Berger, C. E., Fagnant, P. M., Heizmann, S., Trybus, K. M., and Geeves, M. A. (2001) J. Biol.

Possible explanations for the differences between the two studies are discussed. We have shown that unphosphorylated heavy meromyosin appears to adopt a special state in the presence of ADP based upon analysis of actin-heavy meromyosin association rate constants.

Non-muscle HMM IIB is also regulated by phosphorylation, and constructs lacking one motor domain have been shown to be unregulated (9Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, two motor domains are required for regulation.Structural differences between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated HMM have been demonstrated by a number of studies. Reconstruction of images of expressed unphosphorylated HMM in the presence of ATP in two-dimensional crystalline arrays (10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) shows an asymmetrical structure with the converter domain of one head bound to the actin-binding site of the other head. No interaction was seen between the motor domains of phosphorylated HMM. This model is supported by data from Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that only one of the heads of an unphosphorylated expressed smooth muscle HMM-ADP complex binds to actin. Either the binding of the first head prevented the binding of the second head or the second head bound weakly such that no signal was observed for its binding. Both heads bound to actin in the phosphorylated state. These data are inconsistent with two studies of the effect of ADP and phosphorylation in intact gizzard muscle, which are consistent with binding of both heads of myosin to actin irrespective of ADP or phosphorylation (13Gollub J. Cremo C.R. Cooke R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10107-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Dantzig J.A. Barsotti R.J. Manz S. Sweeney H.L. Goldman Y.E. Biophys.

Digestion of SMM by Staphylococcus aureusV8 protease or chymotrypsin generates HMM with varying degrees of internal cleavage at loop 2 (the actin-binding loop), but the cleavage products remain associated under non-denaturing conditions (6Ikebe M.

Based upon the model discussed previously, it was possible that the extent of internal heavy chain cleavage at the actin-binding loop could alter the actin binding behavior. Therefore, we produced HMM with between 5 and 95% heavy chain cleavage for this study. Measurements of the fluorescence changes upon binding of HMM to pyrene-actin and upon ATP-induced dissociation from pyrene-actin were used to determine the stoichiometry of HMM binding to actin in the unphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated states. We show that both heads of tissue-derived HMM bind to actin. This two-headed binding was observed irrespective of the extent of internal heavy chain cleavage, the presence or absence of ADP, or the phosphorylation state of the RLC. These experiments were consistent with the fact that ADP did not induce dissociation of the pyrene-actin HMM complex irrespective of the phosphorylation state. As these data contrast those for an expressed HMM construct (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), explanations for the differences between the two protein preparations are presented.We also measured the actin-activated ATPase activity of unphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated HMM by single turnover assays with both ATP and FTP. All HMM preparations used in this study were found to be fully regulated as defined by a slow turnover rate in the presence of actin for the unphosphorylated protein. Therefore, we have shown that the native tissue-derived unphosphorylated HMM-ADP complex binds to actin with two heads. The one-headed actin binding mode of an unphosphorylated HMM-ADP complex predicted by the model of Wendtet al. (10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) is not a property required for down-regulation.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that both heads of tissue-derived HMM and HMM-ADP bind to actin, irrespective of the phosphorylation state of the RLC. These findings are consistent with the effects of ADP and phosphorylation upon measurements of RLC mobility (13Gollub J. Cremo C.R. Cooke R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10107-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and tension (14Dantzig J.A. Barsotti R.J. Manz S. Sweeney H.L. Goldman Y.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in intact smooth muscle. In contrast, Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found that only one head of expressed smooth muscle u-HMM-ADP bound to actin, whereas tp-HMM, tp-HMM-ADP, and u-HMM bound with two heads. The buffer conditions and protein concentrations used in this study and the Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) study were similar. Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) used the same ATP-induced dissociation method that we used here. Therefore, it appears that the HMM preparations used in the two studies are different.One obvious difference between the HMM preparations is the presence of internal heavy chain cleavage at the actin-binding loop in tissue-derived HMM. In our HMM preparation with 5% heavy chain cleavage, a maximum of 10% of all molecules would contain at least one cleaved head with at least 90% of all molecules containing two uncleaved heads. If these uncleaved u-HMM-ADP molecules behaved in a manner similar to the expressed u-HMM-ADP, the ΔF max/F final (Table I) or ΔF max/F initial(Table II) for u-HMM-ADP would be 45% lower than that for u-HMM. Our data for u-HMM with 5% heavy chain cleavage show no significant differences between maximal fluorescence amplitude changes obtained in the presence or absence of ADP using two different methods (Fig. 3 and Table I, Fig. 5 and Table II). We conclude that the extent of heavy chain cleavage at the actin-binding loop is not the reason for the differences between expressed and tissue-derived HMM.In addition to the actin-binding loop cleavage, chymotrypsin and V8 protease cleave a small number of residues from the N terminus of the heavy chain. The V8 protease preparation was missing only 9 residues and is unlikely to explain the different actin binding behavior. For 5% cleaved chymotryptic HMM, 27 residues are cleaved, but we estimated that only 5–10% of the N terminus is cleaved. This suggests that N-terminal cleavage is not likely to explain the differences in actin binding behavior by the same reasoning described above for the actin-binding loop.Our tissue-derived HMM was not frozen at any stage of the preparation, whereas the expressed HMM was frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of sucrose and stored at −80 °C. We have found that freezing tissue-derived HMM in this manner causes loss of regulation. However, both Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and this study (Figs. 6 and 7) showed that HMM preparations were regulated using single turnover approaches.Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) found that dissociation of u-HMM heads from pyrene-actin by ATP resulted in a ΔF max/F final of ∼0.4 in the absence of ADP and ∼0.2 in the presence of ADP. We wondered why they did not observe a ΔF max/F final of ∼0.8 in the absence of ADP, as would be expected from previous studies with tissue-derived smooth muscle S1 (28Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and consequently ∼0.4 in the presence of ADP. A lower than expected pyrene-actin quenching by expressed HMM might be due to the following. First, it could be an inherent property of the molecule, although the amino acid sequence of the expressed HMM is identical to that of tissue-derived HMM except for a FLAG tag at the C terminus. Second, it is possible that there are unknown post-translational modifications specific to the tissue-derived HMM. Third, a significant population of “dead heads” or “rigor heads” (heads that bind irreversibly to actin) (21Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Dash P.K. Hackney D.D. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 1013-1022PubMed Google Scholar) would lower the ΔF max/F finalwithout altering the observed stoichiometry. Berger et al.(12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that ADP could dissociate ∼40% of the heads from an acto-u-HMM complex but not from an acto-tp-HMM complex. The rate of this process for the acto-u-HMM complex was much slower than the rate of ADP binding and thus was consistent with a rearrangement. This suggested that these ADP heads initially bound to actin but eventually found a thermodynamically more stable place to bind or somehow lost their normal tight actin binding properties (K d < 40 nm). This result would be obtained if dead heads were abundant, as we suggested previously, and if the surface of dead heads had an extremely tight binding site for the actin-binding site of a functional partner ADP head (perhaps in a structure similar to that proposed by Wendt et al. (10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,11Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar)). Formation of this nonphysiological structure might be expected to be slow, as Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) observed, as it would involve dissociation of a functional ADP head from actin followed by binding (nearly irreversibly) to the partner dead head. The lack of such a motor-motor domain interaction in a tp-HMM-ADP preparation containing dead heads would be compatible with the structural data of Wendt et al. (10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), showed that ADP could not dissociate heads from the acto-HMM complex regardless of the phosphorylation state (Table I). Therefore, the results from both studies are internally consistent, suggesting that the HMM preparations are different.Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that ∼25% of u-HMM heads bound ADP with an affinity of 2 μm, ∼25% bound ADP with a much weaker affinity, and the remaining ∼50% did not respond to ATP at maximal ADP concentrations. These nonresponsive heads may be attributed to dead heads behaving as described above. Nevertheless, their data strongly suggest that functional HMM binds to ADP with two different affinities. We are currently characterizing the ADP binding properties of our preparations.A test for the presence of dead heads is to compare the ΔF max/F initial and ΔF max/F final values for association and dissociation experiments, respectively. These values should be the same in the absence of dead heads. The ΔF max/F initial from an association experiment should not be affected by the presence of dead heads, whereas the ΔF max/F final from a dissociation experiment would be lowered. In our study, both dissociation (Table I) and association (Table II) of HMM heads from/to pyrene-actin resulted in maximal fluorescence changes consistent with earlier studies with tissue-derived smooth S1 (28Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This agreement between dissociation and association data is strong evidence that our preparations do not contain a significant fraction of dead heads. Furthermore, the single turnover measurements in Fig. 6 are consistent with previous steady-state measurements from our laboratory (21Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dash and Hackney (31Dash P.K. Hackney D.D. Biochem. Int. 1991; 25: 1013-1022PubMed Google Scholar) estimated that the V8-cleaved tissue-derived preparation contains ∼8% dead heads, consistent with the study of Ellison et al. (21Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Our data do not rule out the possibility that the tissue-derived u-HMM-ADP complex can adopt a conformation like that described by Wendtet al. (10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Indeed, our association rate data are consistent with the idea that the heads interact in some manner in the presence of ADP but not in its absence. Our association rate data are in agreement with a previous study by Rosenfeld et al. (32Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Kar S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). They measured the rates of pyrene-actin binding of tissue-derived u-HMM and tp-HMM with and without ADP at high actin/HMM ratios. The binding was monophasic except for the u-HMM-ADP complex, which bound in a biphasic manner with two phases of similar amplitude. They interpreted these results to indicate that both heads of the u-HMM-ADP complex bound to actin but that an interaction between the heads slowed the binding of the second head. Under conditions similar to theirs (at the highest actin/HMM ratios of Fig. 5), we made the same observations. Therefore, our data, like those of Rosenfeld et al. (32Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Kar S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), are consistent with an interaction between the two heads of the u-HMM-ADP complex, which must be broken to allow the second head to bind to actin. It is possible that this interaction is between the two motor domains, as described in the model of Wendt et al.(10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Wendt T. Taylor D. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), but our data do not address this structural issue. Our data suggest that for tissue-derived HMM, if such an interaction is occurring, it is not strong enough to compete with actin to prevent binding of both heads to actin. We have also shown that one-headed actin binding behavior for u-HMM-ADP is not a requirement for down-regulation of smooth muscle myosin and that two-headed actin binding in the presence of ADP is a property of the native, undamaged, fully regulated molecule.

SMM and the double-headed subfragment HMM are regulated by phosphorylation of the two regulatory light chains, one on each head (1Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin.

Non-muscle HMM IIB is also regulated by phosphorylation, and constructs lacking one motor domain have been shown to be unregulated (9Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, two motor domains are required for regulation. Structural differences between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated HMM have been demonstrated by a number of studies. Reconstruction of images of expressed unphosphorylated HMM in the presence of ATP in two-dimensional crystalline arrays (10Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J.

A. 2001; 98: 4361-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) shows an asymmetrical structure with the converter domain of one head bound to the actin-binding site of the other head. No interaction was seen between the motor domains of phosphorylated HMM. This model is supported by data from Berger et al. (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23240-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that only one of the heads of an unphosphorylated expressed smooth muscle HMM-ADP complex binds to actin. Either the binding of the first head prevented the binding of the second head or the second head bound weakly such that no signal was observed for its binding. Both heads bound to actin in the phosphorylated state. These data are inconsistent with two studies of the effect of ADP and phosphorylation in intact gizzard muscle, which are consistent with binding of both heads of myosin to actin irrespective of ADP or phosphorylation (13Gollub J. Cremo C.R. Cooke R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10107-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Dantzig J.A. Barsotti R.J. Manz S. Sweeney H.L. Goldman Y.E. Biophys.

Digestion of SMM by Staphylococcus aureusV8 protease or chymotrypsin generates HMM with varying degrees of internal cleavage at loop 2 (the actin-binding loop), but the cleavage products remain associated under non-denaturing conditions (6Ikebe M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25948-25951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the model discussed previously, it was possible that the extent of internal heavy chain cleavage at the actin-binding loop could alter the actin binding behavior. Therefore, we produced HMM with between 5 and 95% heavy chain cleavage for this study. Measurements of the fluorescence changes upon binding of HMM to pyrene-actin and upon ATP-induced dissociation from pyrene-actin were used to determine the stoichiometry of HMM binding to actin in the unphosphorylated and thiophosphorylated states. We show that both heads of tissue-derived HMM bind to actin. This two-headed binding was observed irrespective of the extent of internal heavy chain cleavage, the presence or absence of ADP, or the phosphorylation state of the RLC. These experiments were consistent with the fact that ADP did not induce dissociation of the pyrene-actin HMM complex irrespective of the phosphorylation state. As these data contrast those for an expressed HMM construct (12Berger C.E. Fagnant P.M. Heizmann S. Trybus K.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol.
