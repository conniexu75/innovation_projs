https://openalex.org/W2001370941,"A noninvasive computer imaging technique allows three-dimensional images of fossil skulls to be generated from two-dimensional serial computerized tomographic scan data. The computer programs can ""dissect"" the skull in different planes by making portions of it and any obstructing matrix transparent in order to reveal intracranial morphology. The computer image is geometrically precise so that linear distances, angles, areas, volumes, and evaluations of symmetry can be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2062608651,"A moderate iridium anomaly, about 20 times the local background, has been found in Upper Devonian rocks in the Canning Basin. It occurs at or near the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, which is known to be associated with a major massextinction event of global extent. The anomaly occurs in an extremely condensed limestone sequence laid down under quiet deepwater conditions. Its occurrence suggests a causal link with some form of meteoroid impact. Moreover, carbon isotope data indicate that a large reduction in biomass could have occurred at this level. However, the anomaly coincides with a stromatolite bed containing the fossil cyanobacterium Frutexites; iridium, platinum, iron, manganese, cobalt, arsenic, antimony, and cerium are preferentially concentrated in filaments of this organism, with concentrations ranging from two to five times that of the matrix. It is possible that Frutexites extracted these elements directly from seawater, without the need for their derivation from an extraterrestrial source."

By using lasers, the kinetic energy of the ions can be cooled to millikelvin temperatures, thereby suppressing Doppler frequency shifts. Potential accuracies of frequency standards and clocks based on such experiments are anticipated to be better than one part in 1015."
https://openalex.org/W2000900726,"Recent paleontological investigations of six sections fringing the Deccan volcanic outcrops of the Indian peninsula indicate that terrestrial faunas during the Cretaceous-Paleocene transition lacked the endemism predicted by geophysical models of an oceanically isolated Indian subcontinent. At the generic and familial level there is a close correspondence between the Cretaceous vertebrates of peninsular India, Africa, and Madagascar. This suggests that a dispersal corridor, consisting of presently submerged aseismic elements (the Mascarene Plateau and the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge), existed between these landmasses about 80 million years ago as India drifted close to eastern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2079898139,"Fossil pollen grains from Paleocene-Eocene rocks of the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming allow important sequences of terrestrial vertebrate fossils to be correlated with standard marine microfossil zonations. The Paleocene/Eocene boundary as based on pollen evidence falls within the Wasatchian land mammal age, much higher than the boundary used by some fossil mammal workers. This discrepancy partly results from multiple definitions of the Paleocene/Eocene boundary but may also indicate faulty mammal-based correlations to the type Sparnacian of France."

https://openalex.org/W1970395739,"The efficiency of a mercury-rare gas electrical discharge, which forms the basis of a fluorescent lamp, can be increased about 5 percent simply by increasing the concentration of mercury-196 from 0.146 percent (natural) to about 3 percent. These findings can be implemented immediately without any significant change in the process of manufacturing of this widely used source of illumination, provided that mercury-196 can be obtained economically. The potential energy savings for the United States are estimated to be worth in excess of $200 million per year."
https://openalex.org/W1973436616,"Photographs of galaxy M82 obtained in blue light show the existence of a previously unknown system of large-scale filaments extending 4000 parsec (1.2 X 10(22) cm) above and below the fundamental plane of the galaxy along the minor axis. These filaments emit continuous radiation that is highly polarized, with the electric vector predominately perpendicular to the filamentary structure. A plausible interpretation is that the radiation is optical synchrotron emission caused by relativistic electrons spiraling in a large-scale magnetic field. To produce radiation in visual wavelengths, the electron energies must be in the range 10(3) to 10(4) Bev if the magnetic field is between 10(-5) and 10(-6) gauss."

https://openalex.org/W1978712805,"Fission damage induced in calcite is shown by etch pits developed with weak acid at the damage sites. The damage can be differentiated from dislocations by annealing. By this method we have observed fossil fission damage in natural samples. Thus, some etch pits previously attributed to dislocations actually result from such damage. Annealing studies indicate that the damage should persist for about 4 x 10(7) years at 50 degrees C, and direct evidence suggests that the fission damage has persisted for at least 10(4) years in one specimen."
