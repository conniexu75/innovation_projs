https://openalex.org/W1989533590,"Cbfa1 is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. We investigated functional differences among three isoforms of Cbfa1: Type I (originally reported as Pebp2αA by Ogawa et al. (Ogawa, E., Maruyama, M., Kagoshima, H., Inuzuka, M., Lu, J., Satake, M., Shigesada, K., and Ito, Y. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 6859–6863), Type II (originally reported astil-1 by Stewart et al. (Stewart, M., Terry, A., Hu, M., O'Hara, M., Blyth, K., Baxter, E., Cameron, E., Onions, D. E., and Neil, J. C. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 8646–8651), and Type III (originally reported asOsf2/Cbfa1 by Ducy et al. (Ducy, P., Zhang, R., Geoffroy, V., Ridall, A. L., and Karsenty, G. (1997)Cell 89, 747–754). A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that these isoforms were expressed in adult mouse bones. The transient transfection of Type I or Type IICbfa1 in a mouse fibroblastic cell line, C3H10T1/2, induced the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. This induction was synergistically enhanced by the co-introduction ofXenopus BMP-4 cDNA. In contrast, the transient transfection of Type III cDNA induced no ALP activity. In C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with each isoform ofCbfa1, the gene expression of ALP was also strongly induced in cells transfected with Type I and Type IICbfa1 but not in cells with Type III Cbfa1. Osteocalcin, osteopontin,and type I collagen gene expressions were induced or up-regulated in all of the cells stably transfected with each isoform of Cbfa1, and Type II transfected cells exhibited the highest expression level ofosteocalcin gene. A luciferase reporter gene assay using a 6XOSE2-SV40 promoter (6 tandem binding elements for Cbfa1 ligated in front of the SV40 promoter sequence), a mouse osteocalcinpromoter, and a mouse osteopontin promoter revealed the differences in the transcriptional induction of target genes by eachCbfa1 isoform with or without its β-subunit. These results suggest that all three of the Cbfa1 isoforms used in the present study are involved in the stimulatory action of osteoblast differentiation, but they exert different functions in the process of osteoblast differentiation. Cbfa1 is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.

The transfection of Cbfa1gene into non-osteogenic cells such as C3H10T1/2 cells and primary skin fibroblasts directed the differentiation pathway of these cells toward the osteoblast lineage (10Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). These results indicated that Cbfa1 is one of the essential transcription factors that regulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (11Komori T. Kishimoto T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), one of the most potent stimulatory factors for osteoblast differentiation, induced or stimulated the expression of Cbfa1 mRNA (10Ducy P. Zhang R.

Bone. 1998; 22: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that Cbfa1 is involved in the signaling pathway of BMP action. Three subtypes of the α-subunit of Cbf (Cbfa1, Cbfa2, and Cbfa3) and one subtype of the β-subunit (Cbfβ) have been reported (13Bae S.C. Takahashi E. Zhang Y.W. Ogawa E. Shigesada K. Namba Y.

Virology. 1993; 194: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The α-subunits of Cbf family transcription factors acquire enhanced DNA binding activity when they heterodimerize with the β-subunit (1Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several isoforms of Cbfa1 have been identified by differential promoter usage or differential splicing (16Stewart M. Terry A. Hu M. O'Hara M. Blyth K. Baxter E. Cameron E. Onions D.E. Neil J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8646-8651Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,17Geoffroy V. Corral D.A. Zhou L. Lee B. Karsenty G. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One isoform, originally cloned from ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, was named Pebp2αA (referred to as Type ICbfa1 hereafter). Recently, three groups of investigators independently identified two other isoforms of Cbfa1, from osteoblasts and lymphoblasts (5Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S.

Although Ducy et al. (10Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the transfection of Type III Cbfa1 into non-osteogenic cells induced gene expression related to osteoblast differentiation, functional differences among the isoforms ofCbfa1 have not been clarified. We investigated the functional differences among three isoforms ofCbfa1 (Type I, II, and III) by the generation of stably transfected cells with each Cbfa1 isoform and a transient transcriptional assay using Cbfa1 target gene promoter-driven luciferase reporter genes. We demonstrate here that these three isoforms of Cbfa1 have different functions in osteoblast differentiation. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, C3H10T1/2, was purchased from Riken Cellbank (Saitama, Japan). This cell line was maintained in BME medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was detected histochemically using an Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit IV (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The ALP activity of the cell lysates was determined usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate as described previously (29Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D.

A reporter plasmid containing 6 repeats of the consensus Cbfa1 binding site (6XOSE2) was constructed to insert a blunt-ended PCR fragment containing AACCACA-based direct repeats (21Ducy P.

An expression plasmid of each Cbfa1 isoform was generated to insert the entire coding sequence with the Kozak sequence into the BamHI (Type I) or BglII (Type II and III) site of the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Since our expression plasmids for Type II and IIICbfa1 were constructed using Type I as the template, they have one glutamine deletion in the Q-stretch region compared with the originally reported Osf2/Cbfa1 (1Ogawa E.

Xenopus BMP-4 (xBMP-4) cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. N. Ueno (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan), and the expression plasmid of xBMP-4 cDNA was generated to insert the entire coding sequence with the Kozak sequence into the EcoRI site of pSG5. C3H10T1/2 cells grown to 40–60% confluence in a 9-cm Petri dish were transfected with a total of 25 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (23Sasaki H. Harada H. Handa Y. Morino H. Suzawa M.

Each Cbfa1 expression plasmid or mock pSG5 (24 μg/dish) was co-transfected with 1 μg of pSV2neo (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cells were treated with 450–500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) from 2 days after the transfection. C3H10T1/2 cells grown to 40–60% confluence in a 12-well multiplate were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA, using the transfection reagent LT-1 (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI). The reporter plasmid (0.2 μg/well) was co-transfected with the indicated amount of each expression vector for each type of Cbfa1, with or without its β-subunit (0.1 or 0.2 μg), and 0.3 μg of the reference plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Bluescribe M13+ (Stratagene) was used as the carrier to adjust the DNA amount to 1 μg. After 48 h, the luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (ML-3000, Dynatec Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA). Relative luciferase activity was calculated after normalizing the transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase activity expressed by pCH110 (23Sasaki H. Harada H. Handa Y. Morino H. Suzawa M. Shimpo E.

Bone Miner. 1994; 26: 109-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We first examined whether Cbfa1isoforms (Type I and Type II/III) are expressed in bone by RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for each isoform (Fig. 1a) because both Type II and Type III Cbfa1 isoforms are suggested to be translated from the same mRNA (28Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1b, both types of transcripts were expressed in adult mouse bone. Note that the duplicate signals were detected by Type II/III-specific primers because of alternative splicing in this region, as reported by Xiao et al. (29Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. Gene (Amst .). 1998; 214: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (insertion of 33 bp compared with the reportedOsf2/Cbfa1 sequence, data not shown). Since ALP is one of the early differentiation markers for osteoblasts (30Yamaguchi A. Katagiri T. Ikeda T. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Kahn A.J. Suda T. Yoshiki S. J.

No ALP-positive cells were found in C3H10T1/2 cells without transfection. Six days after transfection with Cbfa1 isoforms, many ALP-positive cells appeared in the cells transfected with Type I or Type II Cbfa1 (Fig. 2,a-1). Transfection with xBMP-4 also induced ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells. The co-introduction of Type ICbfa1 and xBMP-4 synergistically increased the number of ALP-positive cells and activity (Fig. 2, b-1 and b-2), suggesting some functional linkage between Cbfa1 and BMP-4. No ALP-positive cells were induced by transfection with Type IIICbfa1 or by transfection with mock pSG5 (Fig. 2,a-1 and b-1). The effect of the transient transfection of Cbfa1 and/or xBMP4 onALP mRNA expression was also verified by RT-PCR (Fig. 2,a-2 and b-2). To further investigate functional differences in the effects of Cbfa1isoforms on osteoblast differentiation, we examined gene expressions related to osteoblast differentiation using stably transfected C3H10T1/2 cells with the three isoforms (Type I, II, and III) ofCbfa1. The expression of each exogenous Cbfa1isoform was ensured by Northern hybridization (Fig. 3a). C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with Type I or Type II Cbfa1 exhibited the expression of ALP mRNA, but no ALP mRNA was detected in the cells transfected with Type III Cbfa1(Fig. 3a). These results were consistent with those observed in the transient transfection experiments. OSC,OPN, and ColI gene expressions were induced or up-regulated in all cell types transfected with respective isoforms ofCbfa1. The highest induction of ALP gene expression was observed in Type I Cbfa1-transfected cells, and the highest induction of OSC gene expression was observed in the Type II Cbfa1-transfected cells, when each expression level was normalized by that of the corresponding transfected isoform of Cbfa1 (Fig. 3b). There were no apparent changes in the expression levels of OPN and ColI among isoforms of Cbfa1 (Fig. 3,a and b). Cbfa1 has the ability to enhance the expression of target genes by binding to its target sequence in the promoter and/or enhancer region (7Craig A.M. Denhardt D.T.

Thus, we next examined whether the difference of the ability to enhance target gene expression (Figs. 2 and 3) is caused at the transcriptional level, using a luciferase reporter gene assay system. When p6XOSE2-luc was used as a reporter plasmid (10Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

The dose-response analysis of Cbfa1 plasmid revealed that Type II Cbfa1 induced the highest luciferase activity among the Cbfa1 isoforms (Fig. 5a). The co-introduction of each Cbfa1 isoform and its β-subunit induced no synergistic increase in the reporter gene activity, even in the presence of different amounts of their β-subunits (Figs.4a and 5a). When the reporter plasmid used was pOSC(−147/+13)-luc (10Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

When pOPN(−253/+28)-luc (which includes the mouse OPN promoter region having one functional Cbfa1 binding site near the Ets-1 binding site (7Craig A.M. Denhardt D.T.

In vitro data have demonstrated that NO inhibits the activity of caspase-3 byS-nitrosation of the enzyme. Here we present evidence for the in vivo occurrence and functional relevance of this novel antiapoptotic mechanism. To demonstrate that the cysteine residue Cys-163 of caspase-3 is S-nitrosated, cells were transfected with the Myc-tagged p17 subunit of caspase-3. After incubation of the transfected cells with different NO donors, Myc-tagged p17 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody.S-Nitrosothiol was detected in the immunoprecipitate by electron spin resonance spectroscopy after liberation and spin trapping of NO byN-methyl-d-glucamine-dithiocarbamate-iron complex. Transfection of cells with a p17 mutant, where the essential Cys-163 was mutated into alanine, completely preventedS-nitrosation of the enzyme. As a functional correlate, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells the NO donors sodium nitroprusside or PAPA NONOate (50 μm) significantly reduced the increase in caspase-3-like activity induced by overexpressing caspase-3 by 75 and 70%, respectively. When human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase, morphological analysis of stained cells revealed that cell death induction by overexpression of caspase-3 was completely suppressed in the presence of sodium nitroprusside, PAPA NONOate, or S-nitroso-l-cysteine (50 μm). Thus, NO supplied by exogenous NO donors serves in vivo as an antiapoptotic regulator of caspase activity viaS-nitrosation of the Cys-163 residue of caspase-3.

Thus, NO supplied by exogenous NO donors serves in vivo as an antiapoptotic regulator of caspase activity viaS-nitrosation of the Cys-163 residue of caspase-3. Apoptosis is central to the regulation of tissue homeostasis but also contributes to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammation. Morphologically, the programmed form of cell death is characterized by cytoplasmic membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation into apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic process is under control of a highly conserved signaling network mainly discovered inCaenorhabditis elegans, with at least three families of genes being involved termed ced-3(C . e legans death gene3), ced-4, and ced-9 (1White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of ced-3 encode for the family of cysteine proteases, caspases, that constitute an enzyme cascade culminating in activation of caspase-3 (2Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Thus, caspase-3 represents the execution enzyme of the caspase cascade that cleaves the DNase inhibitor ICAD (inhibitor ofcaspase-activateddeoxyribonuclease) to activate DNA-degrading DNases (3Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). Within the molecular structure of caspase-3, the catalytic cysteine group that accounts for the proteolytic activity of the enzyme is located at position 163 of the p17 subunit (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). NO has been implicated to be involved in regulating apoptosis in a variety of tissues (5Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Nicotera P. Brune B. Bagetta G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the well established proapoptotic effects of NO (6Nicotera P. Brune B.

J. 1996; 319: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), a growing body of evidence indicates that low levels of NO function as an important inhibitor of apoptosis by interference with signal transduction pathways that control apoptotic cell death (9Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 10Mannick J.B. Miao X.Q. Stamler J.S. J. Biol.

Several studies suggested that NO may inhibit apoptosis via interacting with the caspase cysteine proteases (13Haendeler J. Weiland U. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Kim Y.-M. de Vera M.E. Watkins S.C. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). As a general feature of its biochemical properties, NO is known to be capable of modifying proteins that contain cysteine residues by S-nitrosation of the thiol group of the respective cysteine (15Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 16Stamler J.S.

Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Indeed, the decrease in caspase-3-like enzyme activity by in vitro incubation of purified enzyme with NO donors could be specifically assigned toS-nitrosation of the essential cysteine residue at the active site of caspase-3 (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 18Li J. Billiar T.R. Talanian R.V. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). This could represent a potential molecular mechanism underlying the functional relationship between NO and inhibition of apoptosis signaling observed in cell culture. However, taking into account that NO could also interfere with upstream cell death signals that result in caspase activation (19Shen Y.H. Wang X.L. Wilcken D.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Estevez A.G. Spear N. Thompson J.A. Cornwell T.L. Radi R. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. J.

Med. 1998; 187: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it still has to be proven whether caspases are directly targeted by NO in intact cells and whether an S-nitrosation-mediated inhibitory effect of NO on caspase-3-driven apoptosis does occur in vivo. Thus, in the present study we sought to demonstrate that intracellular caspase-3 is subjected to S-nitrosation of cysteine residue 163 following incubation of cells with NO donors, and we determined the functional impact of exogenous NO on caspase-3-like activity and caspase-3-induced apoptotic cell death in vivo. SNP was bought from Sigma (Munich, Germany), PAPA NONOate was from Alexis (Läufeling, Switzerland), and S-nitrosopenicillamine was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Cell Systems/Clonetics, Solingen, Germany) 1The abbreviations used are: HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BCS, bathocuproine-disulfonic acid; DTPA, diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid; MGD, N-methyl-d-glucamine-dithiocarbamate; ESR, electron spin resonance; AMC, 7-amino-4-coumarin; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; Cys-NO, S-nitroso-l-cysteine were cultured in endothelial basal medium (Cell Cystems/Clonetics) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 μg/ml), bovine brain extract (3 μg/ml), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), amphotericin B (50 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Berlin, Germany) until the third passage. After detachment with trypsin, cells were grown in culture dishes for 18 h before experiments were performed. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with glutamine (40 mm), penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Caspase-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides, which were synthesized to contain BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites and subsequently cloned into the respective sites of the pcDNA3.1-MycHis vector (InVitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). The catalytically active p17 subunit of caspase-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to contain BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites and then was cloned into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1-MycHis vector. The p17 mutant, where Cys-163 was replaced by alanine (p17-C163A), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Transient transfection of HUVEC was performed by incubation of 3.0 × 105 cells/6-cm well with 3 μg of plasmid as described previously (22Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For cotransfection experiments, HUVEC were incubated with pcDNA3.1-lacZ (1 μg) and either pcDNA3.1-caspase-3 (2 μg) or the pcDNA3.1 control vector (2 μg), followed by β-galactosidase staining of cotransfected cells according to our previously published method (22Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To transiently transfect COS-7 cells, 7 μg/3.0 × 105 cells of pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the respective insert were employed using the Superfect method (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Transfected cells were grown for 36 h to allow for protein expression before cell lysis by incubation with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm BCS, and 1 mmDTPA (Sigma). To isolate Myc-tagged protein, whole cell lysates of COS-7 cells (10 mg of protein) overexpressing p17-wt-Myc or the p17-C163A mutant were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)/mg protein for 1.5 h at 4 °C, the p17-Myc-anti-Myc immunocomplexes attached to beads were washed extensively in a modified lysis buffer with reduced concentrations of BCS (50 μm) and DTPA (50 μm) to remove contaminating S-nitrosothiols and other low molecular mass NO donors. To probe immunoprecipitates for Myc-tagged protein, 30 μl of SDS sample dye were added to agarose beads, and the precipitated protein was released into the supernatant by 5 min of incubation at 100 °C, followed by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 5 min). Then samples were run on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, which were blocked in 5% milk powder for 2 h and probed with mouse anti-Myc antibody, 1:200, 1% milk powder followed by an incubation with anti-mouse antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. The washed beads were resuspended in 400 μl of modified washing buffer lacking metal chelators (BCS and DTPA) and N-ethylmaleimide. A freshly prepared aqueous solution (20 μl) of FeSO4/sodium citrate (final concentration, 0.1 mm/0.4 mm) was added to the samples, followed 1 min later by an aqueous solution (20 μl) of N-methyl-d-glucamine-dithiocarbamate (MGD; final concentration, 24 mm). MGD served to release NO fromS-nitrosothiol (23Arnelle D.R. Day B. Stamler J.S. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to generate the water-soluble NO trapping agent Fe(MGD)2, which avidly binds NO to form a paramagnetic mononitros-iron complex (NOFe(MGD)2) (24Lai C.S. Komarov A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). After 5 min, the samples were centrifuged (200 rpm, 5 min), and Na2S2O4 was added to the supernatant (final concentration, 200 mm) to prevent oxidation of the spin adduct (25Tsuchiya K. Takasugi M. Minakuchi K. Fukuzawa K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Mikoyan V.D. Kubrina L.N. Serezhenkov V.A. Stukan R.A. Vanin A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and to convert all nitrite eventually formed during decomposition of S-nitrosothiol into NO. The solution was then filled into teflon tubes (5-mm inner diameter; 40-mm length) and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were expelled from the teflon tubes by means of a glass rod and inserted into the finger of a fingertip-shaped quartz Dewar, which was filled with liquid nitrogen. The concentration of the NOFe(MGD)2 complex was assessed by cryogenic X-band ESR spectroscopy. In frozen state, this paramagnetic complex exhibits an anisotropic triplet signal with axial symmetry at g⊥ = 2.035, g∥ = 2.02 (24Lai C.S. Komarov A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The mononitros-iron complex with diethyldithiocarbamate (NOFe(DETC)2) (12 μm; dissolved in Me2SO) served as a standard. ESR spectra were recorded at 77 K on a BRUKER ESR 300E at a microwave frequency of 9.47 GHz, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, a modulation amplitude of 0.5 millitesla, microwave power of 20 mW, and a time constant of 655 ms. Each spectrum was collected over 160 s with 1024 points resolution. HUVEC transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmid were lysed in 200 μl of buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.32m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8) for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (20,000 ×g for 10 min), caspase-3-like activity of the supernatant was detected by measuring the proteolytic cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate 7-amino-4-coumarin (AMC)-DEVD and AMC as a standard using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Protein content was analyzed, and enzyme activity was calculated as mol AMC released × mg protein−1 × s−1(11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). To assess cell death induction, HUVEC were cotransfected as described previously (22Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and incubated for 6–18 h. The transfected cells were identified by β-galactosidase staining. Viable versus dead stained cells were counted by two blinded investigators, and results were expressed as dead/viable cells × 100. In addition, potential differences in cell death rate due to necrosis were excluded by measuring LDH release to indicate that death induction was apoptotic in nature. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (variance: LSD test). To demonstrate the in vivo occurrence of caspase-3-S-nitrosation by exogenous NO donors, a vector encoding the Myc-tagged p17 subunit of caspase-3 (pcDNA3.1-p17wt-Myc) was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. Cells were incubated for 36 h to allow for protein expression and subsequently treated with Cys-NO (1 mm) for 10 min. Then p17wt-Myc was isolated by immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody and protein A/G-agarose beads. To remove contaminatingS-nitrosothiols and other low molecular mass NO donors, the p17-Myc-anti-Myc immunocomplexes attached to the beads were extensively washed. NO bound to the free thiol group (Cys-163) available on p17 was then detected by a newly developed procedure that makes use of the catalytic decomposition of S-nitrosothiols by dithiocarbamates and subsequent spin trapping of released NO by a water-soluble dithiocarbamate-iron complex (Fe(MGD)2) (cf. “Experimental Procedures”). The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing spin trapped NO was assessed by cryogenic ESR spectroscopy (27Mülsch A. Mordvintcev P. Bassenge E. Jung F. Clement B. Busse R. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The efficiency of this procedure was verified using bovine S-nitroso-albumin as a standard. The recovery of NO from 100 to 1000 nm S-nitroso-albumin kept overnight in immunoprecipitation buffer amounted to 50 ± 5% (n = 3), and the lower limit for ESR detection (signal to noise = 2:1) was 30 nm NOFe(MGD)2 complex (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, ESR spectra typical for NOFe(MGD)2 were clearly visible in samples prepared from immunoprecipitates of Cys-NO exposed p17-Myc-transfected COS cells (middle trace). For comparison, the ESR signal of a standard is shown in Fig. 1A (bottom trace). This signal was absent in samples prepared from immunoprecipitates of control cells not exposed to Cys-NO (Fig. 1A, top trace). The concentration of spin trapped NO present in the ESR probe of Cys-NO-exposed cells was 150 ± 20 nm. Considering the recovery of NO from S-nitrosothiol after the washing and trapping procedure, it can be estimated that 300 nm NO would account for the total amount of NO initially released from the immunprecipitates, equivalent to 150 pmol NO in 0.5 ml of sample volume. As a control, one fraction of the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by Western blot with an antibody against Myc to demonstrate equal expression of Myc-tagged wild type p17 (p17wt-Myc, data not shown). To test whether S-nitrosation still occurs under exposure to low concentrations of NO donors, which have been shown to efficiently inhibit apoptotic cell death, COS-7 cells expressing the Myc-tagged p17 subunit were incubated for 1 h with 50 μm SNP. As shown in Fig. 1B, a significant NO release could be detected by ESR in immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged p17. Calculated NO in the immunoprecipitate derived from SNP-treated COS-7 cells expressing p17wt-Myc was 70 nm. Moreover, the S-nitrosation of caspase-3 was detectable for at least 12 h after stimulation with 50 μm SNP (data not shown). The essential cysteine residue of caspase-3 is located in the active center of the p17 subunit of caspase-3 at position Cys-163. To specifically assign the S-nitrosation of caspase-3 to the thiol group of Cys-163, Cys-163 was mutated into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (p17mt-Myc). COS-7 cells expressing p17mt-Myc underwent the same incubation procedure with SNP as control cells transfected with p17 wild type (50 μm SNP, 1 h). As shown in Fig. 1B, mutation of Cys-163 completely preventedS-nitrosation of the p17 subunit, thus excluding that other cysteine residues within the molecular structure of p17 may serve as acceptor amino acids for the S-nitrosation. Again, Western blot analysis confirmed that similar amounts of p17 protein were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1B, inset). To explore the functional impact of caspase-3-S-nitrosation by exogenous NO in vivo, HUVEC were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing full-length caspase-3 (pcDNA3.1Casp-3) or with the control vector (pcDNA3.1). During protein expression, cells were treated with exogenous NO donated by SNP (50 μm) or PAPA NONOate (50 μm) or were kept in the absence of an NO donor as a control. As shown in Fig. 2, the increase in caspase-3-like activity induced by caspase-3 overexpression is significantly reduced by 75 and 70% in the presence of SNP and PAPA NONOate, respectively (vector, 100%; *, p < 0.001). Because transfection efficiency in HUVEC was 30% on average, the increase in caspase-3-like activity is likely to be even higher in those cells that were actually subjected to transfection by caspase-3 compared with the mean value of all cells. To test whether NO also affects apoptotic cell death induced by caspase-3 overexpression, HUVEC were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-lacZ and pcDNA3.1-caspase-3, and cell death was detected at different time points (Fig. 3, A–C). A maximal increase in cell death rate of positively stained cells was observed after 12 h (Fig. 3A). Dead cells were characterized by membrane blebs and/or a general cell shrinkage (Fig. 3C). No significant differences in LDH release as an indicator for cell necrosis were observed, when measured at time points in analogy with the determination of cell death (Fig. 3B). This indicates that cell death observed following transfection of HUVEC with full-length caspase-3 is likely due to apoptosis rather than cell necrosis. To assess the sensitivity to exogenous NO of the key apoptosis execution step driven by caspase-3, HUVEC overexpressing caspase-3 were incubated in the presence of the NO donor SNP (50 μm). As displayed in Fig. 3A, the induction of cell death by caspase-3 was abolished by NO treatment (*,p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained when PAPA NONOate or S-nitrosopenicillamine were used as NO donors (Fig. 3D). In contrast, LDH activity was not affected by coincubation with NO donors (Fig. 3B), suggesting that exogenous NO at concentrations used here has no impact on necrotic cell death. Taken together the present results demonstrate that exogenous NO donors induce S-nitrosation of caspase-3 in intact cells.S-Nitrosation was still detected to a considerable extent, even when cells were exposed to low concentrations of NO donors, which resemble native endothelial NO production (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In addition to the short term effect of exogenous NO on cellular caspase-3, when the NO donor was applied 1 h before protein isolation,S-nitrosation of caspase-3 was also detectable after 12 h of incubation of cells in the presence of an NO donor (data not shown). These data support the observed long lasting inhibition of caspases following the addition of exogenous NO (11Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The observed modification of cellular caspase-3 by NO leading to the inhibition of the key signal to regulate apoptosis might be of major importance in endothelial physiology where NO has been described as a major protective factor (28Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5742) Google Scholar, 29Moroi M. Zhang L. Yasuda T. Virmani R. Gold H.K. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Disturbances in endothelial cell integrity are known to be involved in the early pathophysiological changes leading to atherosclerosis, and increased endothelial apoptosis was suggested to contribute to the initial stages of atherogenesis and plaque erosion (30Geng Y.J. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 251-266PubMed Google Scholar, 31Haunstetter A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1111-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) that eventually can cause heart attack and stroke. One may hypothesize that the vasoprotective potencies of NO could at least partially be based on its apoptosis-suppressive effects in the vascular endothelium. In a more general point of view, the in vivo inhibition of caspase-3 by NO reported here could represent a universal mechanism by which cell death rates of a whole variety of tissues are fine tuned by NO via controlling the execution step of the caspase cascade, where the main apoptosis signal machinery converges. In such a model, the susceptibility of the cell to death signals transmitted by caspases is prone to an additional regulatory influence dependent on the cellular and exogenous NO levels. In view of the ambivalent capabilities of NO to act either in a proapoptotic or in an antiapoptotic fashion depending on cell type and NO dosage (5Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), a complex spectrum of NO-mediated control of apoptosis is conceivable. Thus, corresponding to the activation status of the cellular NO synthases and to the cytosolic redox balance of the individual cell type in a certain physiological scenario, NO may either function as an apoptosis inhibitor to stabilize tissue integrity by the above mechanism or, at higher concentrations, may exert toxic effects by direct degradation of DNA (32Burney S.

A genuine physiological function for clusterin has not yet been established. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that clusterin has chaperone-like activity. At physiological concentrations, clusterin potently protected glutathione S-transferase and catalase from heat-induced precipitation and α-lactalbumin and bovine serum albumin from precipitation induced by reduction with dithiothreitol. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data showed that clusterin bound preferentially to heat-stressed glutathione S-transferase and to dithiothreitol-treated bovine serum albumin and α-lactalbumin. Size exclusion chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses showed that clusterin formed high molecular weight complexes (HMW) with all four proteins tested. Small heat shock proteins (sHSP) also act in this way to prevent protein precipitation and protect cells from heat and other stresses. The stoichiometric subunit molar ratios of clusterin:stressed protein during formation of HMW complexes (which for the four proteins tested ranged from 1.0:1.3 to 1.0:11) is less than the reported ratios for sHSP-mediated formation of HMW complexes (1.0:1.0 or greater), indicating that clusterin is a very efficient chaperone. Our results suggest that clusterin may play a sHSP-like role in cytoprotection.

Our results suggest that clusterin may play a sHSP-like role in cytoprotection. Clusterin was first described in 1983 as a major secretory glycoprotein produced by ram Sertoli cells (1Blaschuk O. Burdzy K. Fritz I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7714-7720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a 75–80-kDa disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein with about 30% of the mass of the molecule comprised of N-linked carbohydrate which is branched, complex, and rich in sialic acid (2Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P.R. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2120-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Clusterin is transcribed from a single structural gene as a full-length mRNA of 1.6–2.1 kilobases (depending on the length of the poly(A) tail) and the translated product is internally cleaved to produce the two subunits prior to secretion from the cell. Clusterin is translated with a typical hydrophobic signal peptide, 21 amino acids in length, which is proteolytically removed during translocation of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although clusterin is usually secreted from cells, it has been reported that treatment of HepG2 and CCL64 cells with transforming growth factor β induces translation of a truncated form of clusterin (lacking the signal peptide) which remains intracellular (4Reddy K.B. Jin G. Karode M.C. Harmony J.A.K. Howe P.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One of the most striking things about clusterin is the breadth of its biological distribution. In animal tissues clusterin mRNA is near ubiquitous, with reports describing its occurrence in locales as diverse as the rat prostate gland, the velvet antler from red deer, and quail neuroretinal cells. Across this broad species range clusterin maintains a remarkably high level of sequence homology, comparisons between mammalian species typically being in the range of 70–80% (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The wide distribution and sequence conservation of clusterin suggest that the protein performs a function of fundamental biological importance. Furthermore, increased clusterin expression is found in a variety of disease states and experimental models of pathological stress (5Silkensen J.R. Schwochau G.B. Rosenberg M.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), including heat shock (6Kimura K. Asami K. Yamamoto M. Cell Biochem.

Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that the biological function(s) of clusterin may have immediate relevance to disease states and stress conditions. Many binding interactions between clusterin and other biological molecules have been described. We have shown that clusterin binds to immunoglobulins (8Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochim.

Each description of a new clusterin-binding interaction has led to a proposal that clusterin is involved with the specific biological function of the binding partner. Consequently, functions proposed for clusterin are as diverse as its reported binding partners. Thus, it has been suggested that clusterin acts as a phagocyte recruitment signal (18Buttyan R.

Smith W.R. Harmony J.A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of these has been established as a genuine physiological function. Sequence analysis predicts that clusterin has three putative amphipathic α-helical regions, a type of secondary structure thought to be important in mediating interactions with hydrophobic molecules (26de Silva H.V. Harmony J.A.K. Stuart W.D. Gil C.M. Robbins J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5380-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 27Tsuruta J.K. Wong K. Fritz I.B. Griswold M.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Many of the reported biological ligands of clusterin are significantly hydrophobic. Therefore, we reasoned that interactions of these molecules with clusterin may reflect a general propensity of clusterin to bind to hydrophobic regions of molecules, regardless of their biological function. In this context, the recent demonstration that a highly conserved 14-base pair elements, shared by all vertebrate clusterin proximal promoters, specifically recognizes the heat shock factor 1 transcription factor is of significant interest. This 14-base pair element was shown to be capable of mediating heat shock-induced transcription (28Michel D. Chatelain G. North S. Brun G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that this heat-responsive element provides an explanation for the high sensitivity of clusterin expression to environmental changes and proposed that clusterin may function as an extracellular heat shock protein (28Michel D. Chatelain G. North S. Brun G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the function of clusterin expressed during cellular stress, like the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), may be to act in a chaperone-like manner and bind to hydrophobic regions of partly unfolded, stressed proteins, thereby “solubilizing” them and protecting cells from the cytotoxic consequences of protein precipitation. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, we examined the ability of clusterin to protect a variety of proteins from stress-induced precipitation in vitro. Our results indicate that clusterin has chaperone-like activity and in vitro is a potent inhibitor of stress-induced protein precipitation. We report that, like the sHSPs, this protective effect results from the binding of clusterin to partly unfolded proteins to produce a solubilized high molecular weight (HMW) complex. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), catalase, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, glutathione (GSH), H2O2, iodoacetamide, and α-lactalbumin were all obtained from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim (Sydney, Australia). All buffer salts were obtained from Ajax (Sydney, Australia). GST from Schistosoma japonicum was prepared by thrombin cleavage of recombinant Jun leucine zipper-GST fusion protein and purified by GSH-agarose affinity chromatography as described (29Heuer K.H. Mackay J.P. Podzebenko P. Bains N.P. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9069-9075Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Clusterin was purified from human serum by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (8Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Individual solutions of clusterin (10–200 μg/ml), catalase (200 μg/ml), or GST (200 μg/ml), or mixtures of clusterin with catalase or GST at the same final concentrations, were prepared in 0.7 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and heated at 60 °C. The light scattering of the solution at 360 nm was measured every 30 s for a total of 25 min in an automated 7-chambered diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard GMBH, Germany). Individual solutions of clusterin (10–200 μg/ml), α-lactalbumin (2.5 mg/ml), or BSA (2.5 mg/ml), or mixtures of clusterin with α-lactalbumin or BSA at the same final concentrations, were prepared in 0.3 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 0.1 m NaCl and incubated at 37 °C with or without 20 mm DTT. During this period absorbance readings at 360 nm were acquired every 5 min for a total of 5 h in a Spectramax 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Catalase was prepared at a concentration of 200 μg/ml in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) with or without clusterin (100 μg/ml). Mixtures were heated at 37 or 55 °C for 30 min. 1.0 μl of the catalase/clusterin mixture was incubated with 1.0 ml of H2O2 substrate solution (0.12% (v/v) H2O2 in 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.0) at 37 °C for 5 min before the reaction was stopped with 150 μl of 4 m NaOH. The absorbance of H2O2 was measured at 250 nm on a Spectramax 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Enzyme activity was measured as a decrease in absorbance. GST was prepared at a concentration of 200 μg/ml in 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.0, with or without clusterin (100 μg/ml). Mixtures were heated at 37 or 50 °C for 30 min. GST was then diluted into substrate solution (1 mm GSH, 2 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in 0.1 mphosphate, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 4.5 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before measuring the absorbance at 350 nm. Enzyme activity was measured as an increase in absorbance, corresponding to the appearance of 1-S-glutathionyl-2,4-dinitrobenzene. GST and catalase, at 20 μg/ml in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4), were adsorbed onto ELISA trays (Disposable Products, Adelaide, Australia) for 1 h at 37 °C. In some cases, after the coating step, the trays were heated to 60 °C for 30 min to stress the adsorbed proteins. BSA and α-lactalbumin were applied to ELISA trays in PBS at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, with or without 20 mm DTT, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Plates were then blocked with 1% (w/v) heat-denatured casein prepared in PBS, pH 7.4 (i.e. 1% heat-denatured casein). Plate-bound DTT-treated proteins were then incubated with 5 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 37 °C, in order to exclude the possibility of subsequent formation of disulfide bonds between clusterin and the other proteins. Clusterin, initially at 10 μg/ml, was then serially diluted in binary steps across the ELISA tray, using 1% heat-denatured casein as diluent, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To minimize nonspecific binding of clusterin to the ELISA plates, three washes were then performed with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. A mixture of G7, 78E, and 41D anti-clusterin monoclonal antibodies was used to detect bound clusterin, and DNP-9 was used as an isotype control. All antibodies were used in the form of unpurified hybridoma culture supernatants. The cell line secreting the IgG1κ anti-clusterin mAb G7 was a gift from Dr. B. Murphy (St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia). 78E and 41D, IgG1κ anti-clusterin mAbs, and DNP-9, an IgG1κ mAb that binds specifically to the 2,4-dinitrophenyl group, have been described (30Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Humphreys D. Hochgrebe T.T. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Tenniswood M.P. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15233-15243Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibodies were detected with sheep anti-mouse Ig-HRP (Silenus, Sydney, Australia) using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (2.5 mg/ml in 0.05 m citric acid, 0.1 mNa2HPO4, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% (v/v) H2O2) as substrate. Individual solutions of clusterin, GST, catalase, BSA, or α-lactalbumin, and mixtures of clusterin with one of the other proteins (1 mg/ml clusterin with 2 mg/ml GST or catalase; 0.75 mg/ml clusterin with 2.5 mg/ml BSA or α-lactalbumin) were left untreated or treated with heat (60 °C for 30 min; all solutions in 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.0) or DTT (20 mm at 37 °C for 5 h; all solutions in 50 mmNa2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0) and then centrifuged (1 min at 10,000 rpm in a benchtop Microfuge) to remove precipitated protein. 50 μl of each solution was loaded onto a 25 × 1-cm column of Sephacryl 300 (Pharmacia Biotech, Melbourne, Australia) equilibrated in PBS containing 3 mm azide. Separations were performed at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using a low pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with a 280-nm flow cell (Econosystem; Bio-Rad, Sydney, Australia). Proteins collected in the exclusion volume peaks from size exclusion chromatography were analyzed using standard methods by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). A Hoefer “Tall Mighty Small” apparatus (Australian Chromatography Co., Sydney) was used at a constant current of 30 mA. Gels were stained with standard Coomassie Blue reagent. Heating GST or catalase at 60 °C produced extensive protein precipitation within 30 min, shown by an increase in absorbance at 360 nm (Fig. 1, A and B). Likewise, reduction of BSA or α-lactalbumin with DTT resulted in extensive protein precipitation within 4 h (Fig. 1,C and D). In contrast, clusterin did not precipitate when heated at 60 °C for 30 min or when treated with DTT for 5 h (data not shown). When co-incubated with any of the proteins subjected to heat or DTT-mediated reduction, clusterin potently inhibited protein precipitation (Fig. 1, A-D). Since many chaperones (and also clusterin) exist in solution as aggregates of an ill-defined number of monomers, a convention that has been adopted when dealing with the interactions between chaperones and other proteins is to define stoichiometry in relation to the individual subunits of the chaperone and the protein with which it interacts. For these calculations we have assumed a molecular mass for intact clusterin of 80 kDa and a subunit mass of 40 kDa. An approximate subunit molar ratio (SMR) of clusterin:GST of 1.0:3.2 was the minimum required to virtually abolish reduction-induced precipitation (Fig. 1A). Corresponding SMRs for the stabilizing effects of clusterin on the other proteins tested were 1.0:1.3 (catalase), 1.0:2.3 (BSA), and 1.0:11 (α-lactalbumin) (Fig. 1, B, C, and D, respectively). In contrast, even at corresponding SMRs as high as 1.4:1.0, a control protein (ovalbumin) had only a small effect on the stress-induced precipitation of any of the proteins tested (data not shown). To investigate whether clusterin is also capable of protecting enzymes from stress-induced loss of function, we tested the enzyme activity of GST and catalase before and after exposure to 60 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of clusterin. The presence of clusterin (at sufficient concentration to provide protection against precipitation; Fig. 1, A and B) had no effect on the loss of enzyme activity in either case (Fig. 2). Overall, these results indicate that clusterin has potent heat- and reduction-stable chaperone-like properties which are capable of protecting stressed proteins from precipitation but which cannot protect GST or catalase from heat-induced loss of enzyme activity. In ELISA, clusterin did not bind significantly to any of the non-stressed proteins tested, with the exception of GST (Fig. 3). Binding of clusterin to unstressed GST had been previously noted.2 Clusterin showed significantly increased binding to heat-stressed GST (Fig. 3A) and significant binding to DTT-treated BSA and α-lactalbumin (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, our ELISA results indicate that, comparing untreated versusstressed GST, BSA, and α-lactalbumin, clusterin binds preferentially to the stressed form of each protein. In the ELISA configuration tested, there was minimal interaction of clusterin with either untreated or heat-stressed catalase bound to the plate (Fig. 3B). However, the binding of clusterin to solid-phase, heat-stressed GST was significantly inhibited by solution-phase heat-stressed catalase (Fig. 3B, inset). Chaperones such as the sHSPs are known to form HMW complexes with partly unfolded proteins under stress conditions (32Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler J.S. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,33Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We investigated whether clusterin forms complexes with stressed proteins by size exclusion chromatography. It is well known that clusterin aggregates in aqueous solution (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); at physiological pH, clusterin exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomers, dimers, and higher aggregation states.2 There was no significant difference between the elution profiles of untreated versusheat-treated clusterin (data not shown), indicating that there was no change in the aggregation state of clusterin in solution in response to heat. The α and β chains of clusterin are covalently joined by five disulfide bonds (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Following treatment with DTT, there was a modest decrease in the proportion of clusterin oligomers eluting at a position approaching that of the exclusion limit of the column (compare traces for clusterin + DTT in Fig. 4,C and D, with traces for clusterin alone inA and B). The resolution of the Sephacryl S-300 column used is limited in the range <100 kDa, however, there was no evidence of the appearance of 40-kDa species which would indicate physical dissociation of the α and β chains (Fig. 4, Cand D, striped arrows indicate the approximate position at which a 40-kDa species would be found). Thus, disruption of the interchain disulfide bonds by DTT resulted in partial dissociation of large clusterin aggregates to form monomers (80 kDa species) or lower order clusterin oligomers but did not appear to cause substantial dissociation of the α and β chains. In all cases, when clusterin was added to proteins undergoing heat- or DTT-mediated stress, analysis of the mixtures by size exclusion chromatography indicated pronounced formation of HMW species (Fig. 4,A-D, indicated by solid arrows). The HMW species were not detected in analyses of clusterin alone or any of the individual proteins, whether these molecules were stressed or not. Nor were they detected in mixtures of clusterin and any of the other proteins in the absence of experimental stress (Fig. 4,A-D). In each case, SDS-PAGE analysis of the HMW species in the exclusion volume peaks indicated the presence of both clusterin and the stressed protein under test (Fig. 5). Thus, these results indicate that clusterin, like the sHSPs, binds to stressed proteins to form HMW complexes. The only other possible explanation for these results is that, in each of four different cases, when clusterin and the “target” protein are present together in solution, but not when either protein is present alone in solution, clusterin and the target protein each undergo stress-induced homo-oligomerization. This latter explanation seems implausible, particularly in light of the demonstrations that (i) clusterin inhibits stress-induced protein precipitation (Fig. 1) and (ii) clusterin binds to stressed proteins in ELISA (Fig. 3). We also analyzed the protein mixtures produced for size exclusion chromatography by native gel electrophoresis (at pH 7.0). When mixtures of clusterin and either GST or BSA were exposed to heat or DTT, respectively, but not in the absence of experimental stress, these analyses demonstrated the formation of a new stress-induced species of unique electrophoretic mobility (data not shown). Similar analyses of catalase or α-lactalbumin exposed to heat or DTT, respectively, showed, in each case, stress-induced changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the target protein only when it was co-incubated with clusterin during stress. However, in these cases, under the conditions tested, the putative complexes formed had similar electrophoretic mobilities to clusterin alone (data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that clusterin binds to stressed proteins to form a HMW complex. It was previously shown that clusterin reduced the aggregation of a synthetic amyloid β-peptide in aqueous solution (15Oda T. Wals P. Osterburg H.H. Johnson S.A. Pasinetti G.M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 136: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, effects of clusterin on the aggregation of stressed proteins have not been reported before. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that clusterin has chaperone-like activity. Clusterin potently protects GST and catalase from heat-induced precipitation and α-lactalbumin and BSA from precipitation induced by reduction. Preliminary experiments indicate that clusterin also protects IgG and ovotransferrin from heat-induced precipitation. 3D. Humphreys and S. Poon, unpublished results. Thus, clusterin has the ability to protect many different proteins from stress-induced precipitation. However, in the case of two enzymes tested, GST and catalase, clusterin was unable to protect against heat-induced loss of activity. The sHSPs, HSP25, and α-crystallin, also protect catalase from thermally induced precipitation but, interestingly, α-crystallin is capable of protecting against enzyme inactivation while HSP25 is not (34Hook D.W.A. Harding J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have not yet determined if clusterin has any effects on the recovery of enzyme activity following a heat shock. When tested in ELISA for binding to the native form of the four proteins tested in this study, clusterin bound only to GST. However, clusterin bound more strongly to heat-treated than to untreated GST and also bound significantly to reduced α-lactalbumin and BSA. Thus, in the case of GST, α-lactalbumin, and BSA, these results are compatible with a model in which stress caused partial unfolding of these proteins to expose binding site(s) for clusterin. For all four proteins examined, when clusterin was present in solutions of stressed proteins and these mixtures analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, a HMW fraction (of mass greater than the exclusion limit of the column, 1.5 × 106 Da) was detected. In each case, SDS-PAGE analysis of this HMW fraction indicated that it was comprised of both clusterin and the target protein. It was concluded that clusterin formed HMW complexes (of mass greater than 1.5 × 106Da) with each of the stressed proteins tested. This conclusion was further supported by native gel electrophoretic analysis of mixtures of clusterin and stressed proteins (data not shown). The results discussed above clearly indicate that clusterin binds to heat-stressed catalase to form a HMW complex. This was further confirmed by demonstrating by SDS-PAGE analysis that the G7 (anti-clusterin) mAb immunoprecipitates a complex of clusterin and catalase from heat-stressed mixtures of the two proteins (data not shown). Yet, clusterin failed to bind to heat-stressed catalase in ELISA (Fig. 3B). One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that steric constraints imposed by the solid phase adsorption of catalase may have interfered with binding interactions between the two proteins in this assay format. This hypothesis is consistent with the demonstration that solution phase, heat-stressed catalase inhibited the binding of clusterin to solid phase-adsorbed, heat-stressed GST (Fig. 3B, inset). Presumably, this resulted from clusterin complexing with catalase in the solution-phase, leading to less clusterin available for interaction with the solid-phase GST. No crystal structure is available for clusterin and very limited experimental data are available concerning the secondary or tertiary structure of the protein. However, sequence analysis indicates that clusterin has three putative amphipathic α-helical regions, secondary structures thought to be important in interactions with hydrophobic molecules (26de Silva H.V. Harmony J.A.K. Stuart W.D. Gil C.M. Robbins J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5380-5389Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence analysis predicts a number of short regions of hydrophobicity outside those defined by the putative amphipathic α-helical regions (Fig. 6). Since clusterin is known to bind to a variety of native proteins with hydrophobic domains, it is likely that clusterin exerts its chaperone-like activity by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions of stressed proteins. As appears likely for clusterin, sHSPs are known to bind to exposed hydrophobic regions on stressed proteins to form HMW complexes (35Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The formation of these complexes “solubilizes” stressed proteins, preventing their precipitation. It is also known that, generally, when acting alone, sHSPs are unable to protect enzymes from heat-induced loss of function (33Carver J.A. Aquilina J.A. Cooper P.G. Williams G.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). These characteristics appear to be shared with clusterin. The low SMRs of interaction between clusterin and the four proteins tested (ranging from 1.0:1.3 to 1.0:11) indicate that clusterin is a very efficient chaperone. In comparison, the sHSPs are less efficient in their interactions with stressed proteins; the available data suggest that sHSPs bind stressed proteins at a SMR of one or more subunits of sHSP to one partially folded protein subunit (i.e. at best, SMR = 1.0:1.0 (37Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 509-516Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 38Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Mariani M. Titmuss S.J. Carver J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Comparing catalase and GST, the catalase subunit (catalase is a homotetramer of 59.7-kDa subunits) is greater in mass than GST (a 25.5-kDa monomer) by approximately a factor of 2.3. The SMRs corresponding to the minimum amounts of clusterin required to inhibit heat-induced precipitation of catalase and GST were 1.0:1.3 and 1.0:3.2, respectively. Thus on a molar subunit basis, approximately 2.5-fold more clusterin was required to prevent heat-induced precipitation of catalase versusGST, a factor that is very similar to the ratio of their subunit masses (Table I). A similar analysis reveals that the subunit molecular mass of BSA is approximately 4.9-fold greater than that of α-lactalbumin and, relative to α-lactalbumin, on a molar basis, BSA requires 4.8 times more clusterin to effect comparable inhibition of reduction-induced precipitation (Table I).Table IComparisons between proteins stressed by either heat or DTT-mediated reduction with respect to (i) their subunit molecular masses, and (ii) the minimum SMRs (clusterin:target protein) required to inhibit stress-induced protein precipitationProtein(s)Subunit molecular massMinimum SMRaRequired to inhibit stress-induced protein precipitation.

Open table in a new tab In the case of proteins stressed by heat (i.e., GST and catalase) or by reduction (i.e., BSA and α-lactalbumin), the data support an inverse relationship between subunit molecular mass and the efficiency of clusterin chaperone-like action (see text). These data suggest that (i) for heat-stressed proteins, the efficiency of the chaperone-like action of clusterin is inversely proportional to the subunit molecular mass of the target protein, and (ii) a similar relationship applies to proteins stressed by reduction. However, there is not a simple uniform relationship (for all the proteins tested, regardless of the type of stress) between mass and the efficiency of clusterin chaperone-like action. This is apparent by making comparisons between heat-stressed proteins and those stressed by reduction (see Table I). This suggests that there may be a fundamental difference in the mechanism by which clusterin exerts its chaperone-like action under conditions of stress induced by heat versus reduction. Despite this, regardless of the nature of the stress, the data suggest that steric constraints influence the interaction of stressed proteins with clusterin. When considering proteins stressed by heat, or those stressed by reduction, in each case clusterin was able to interact with and stabilize a greater number of smaller versus larger stressed protein molecules. Interestingly, when a similar comparison is made for the interaction of three reduced proteins (α-lactalbumin, BSA, and ovotransferrin) with the sHSP, α-crystallin, a similar relationship is found (38Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Mariani M. Titmuss S.J. Carver J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that clusterin can act to protect cells from environmental stresses. We recently reported that overexpression of clusterin protected murine L929 cells from the cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor α (31Humphreys D. Hochgrebe T.T. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Tenniswood M.P. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15233-15243Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was earlier reported that inhibition of clusterin synthesis by treatment of LNCaP cells with an antisense oligonucleotide enhanced the cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor α and that overexpression of clusterin in these cells protected them from tumor necrosis factor α-mediated death (39Sensibar J.A. Sutkowski D.M. Raffo A. Buttyan R. Griswold M.D. Sylvester S.R. Kozlowski J.M. Lee C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2431-2437PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of sHSPs has also been shown to protect cells from the cytotoxicity of tumor necrosis factor α (40Arrigo A.P. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, following the exposure of U937 cells to UV-B irradiation, in situhybridization detected clusterin mRNA in surviving cells but not in those that had undergone apoptosis (a control mRNA was detected in both live and dead cells) (41French L.E. Wolhwend A. Sappino A.-P. Tschopp J. Schifferli J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, increased clusterin mRNA expression was not detected in murine olfactory neurons induced to undergo apoptosis but was detected in surviving glial cells that surrounded the neurons (42Michel D. Moyse E. Trembleau A. Jourdan F. Brun G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1635-1645PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that clusterin expression is associated with cell survival. To summarize, clusterin is a “stress-stable,” amphipathic molecule induced in a variety of disease states and instances of cell stress.In vitro, clusterin potently inhibits stress-induced protein precipitation and, in vivo, clusterin expression appears to be associated with cell survival. We speculate that clusterin expression is up-regulated in cells undergoing stress so that clusterin may bind to partly unfolded proteins within and/or outside cells to prevent their precipitation. Similar up-regulated expression of, and an intracellular action by, sHSPs protects cells from stresses and promotes cell viability (43Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Gaestel M. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins, Structure, Function and Mode of Action. Marcel Dekker, New York1997Google Scholar). The concentration of clusterin shown here to protect stressed proteins from precipitation is within the range normally found in some extracellular fluids in mammalian systems (e.g. 50–370 μg/ml in human serum and 2.1–15.0 mg/ml in human seminal fluid (44O'Bryan M.K. Baker H.W.G. Saunders J.R. Kirszbaum L. Walker I.D. Hudson P. Liu D.Y. Glew M.D. Apice A.J.F. Murphy B.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), raising the possibility that in these environments clusterin may act as a constitutively expressed chaperone. On the basis of the available evidence, we propose that the chaperone-like activity of clusterin may act to protect cells from heat and other stresses by a mechanism comparable to that of the sHSPs.

Before determining Lf function in brain tissue, we investigated its origin and demonstrate here that it crosses the blood-brain barrier. An in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier was used to examine the mechanism of Lf transport to the brain. We report that differentiated bovine brain capillary endothelial cells exhibited specific high (K d = 37.5 nm; n = 90,000/cell) and low (K d = 2 μm;n = 900,000 sites/cell) affinity binding sites. Only the latter were present on nondifferentiated cells. The surface-bound Lf was internalized only by the differentiated cell population leading to the conclusion that Lf receptors were acquired during cell differentiation. A specific unidirectional transport then occurred via a receptor-mediated process with no apparent intraendothelial degradation. We further report that iron may cross the bovine brain capillary endothelial cells as a complex with Lf. Finally, we show that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein might be involved in this process because its specific antagonist, the receptor-associated protein, inhibits 70% of Lf transport.

Despite some striking differences, mainly in the glycan moiety, there are marked sequence and conformational homologies among Lfs from different species, as well as similar general functions (for review, see Ref. 2Spik G. Legrand D. Leveugle B. Mazurier J. Mikogami T. Montreuil J. Pierce A. Rochard E. Renner B. Sawatzki G. New Perspectives in Infant Nutrition.

Many physiological roles have been ascribed to Lf, particularly in the host defense against infection and severe inflammation (for review, see Ref. 3Nuijens J.H. van Berkel P.H.C. Schanbacher F.L. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplas. 1996; 1: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This broad spectrum of biological functions relies on the interaction of Lf with numerous cells. The binding of Lf to cells is independent of its degree of iron saturation and is mediated mainly via interaction of the cluster of basic amino acids at its NH2 terminus with sulfated molecules (4Legrand D. van Berkel P.H.C.

However, Lf is also targeted to specific cell receptors, and only a few of these involved in its uptake have been clearly identified. The 105-kDa Lf receptor characterized on activated human T-cells (6Mazurier J. Legrand D. Hu W.L. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) is expressed at the cell surface of platelets (7Leveugle B. Mazurier J. Legrand D. Mazurier C. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J.

Lf receptor internalizes Lf, which is subsequently degraded (30–40%), whereas the remaining fraction is recycled (10Bi B.Y. Lui J.L. Legrand D. Roche A.C. Capron M. Spik G. Mazurier J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 288-296PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) displays a high affinity for Lf and is responsible for its clearance (11Hüttinger M. Retzer H. Hermann M. Goldenberg H. J.

Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcytosis of Lf was described for HT29 cells (16Mikogami T. Heyman M. Spik G. Desjeux J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: 308-315PubMed Google Scholar) and was a minor pathway, up-regulated during iron deprivation (17Mikogami T. Marianne T. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lf is produced by exocrine glands (1Montreuil J. Tonnelat J. Mullet S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 45: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Masson P.L. Masson P.L. La Lactoferrine. Arscia, Bruxelles, 1970: 93-165Google Scholar) and is widely distributed in the body fluids. It is stored in specific granules of neutrophilic leukocytes (19Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. Schönne E. J. Exp. Med. 1969; 130: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and is released during the inflammatory process. In addition, the concentration of Lf present in cerebrospinal fluids is enhanced in cases of acute cerebrovascular lesions (20Terent A. Hällgren R. Venge P. Bergstöm K. Stroke. 1981; 12: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Hällgren R. Terent A. Venge P. Inflammation. 1982; 6: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, as an iron-binding protein, Lf has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain lesions. Although practically absent from the normal human cerebral cortex (22Leveugle B. Spik G. Perl D.P. Bouras C. Fillit H.M. Hof P.R. Brain Res. 1994; 650: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), Lf was found in brains associated with aging and, more importantly, in increased amounts in the specific regions adversely affected in neurodegenerative disorders (22Leveugle B. Spik G. Perl D.P. Bouras C. Fillit H.M. Hof P.R. Brain Res. 1994; 650: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Osmand A.P. Switzer III, R.C. Iqbal K. McLachlan D.R.C. Winblad B.

McGeer P.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1574-1585PubMed Google Scholar). In the mesencephalon, Lf is concentrated mainly in the dopaminergic neurons; in the case of Parkinson's disease (25Leveugle B. Faucheux B.A. Bouras C. Nillesse N. Spik G. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Hof P.R. Acta Neuropathol. 1996; 91: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the surviving neurons accumulate higher concentrations of Lf. The origin and function of Lf within either the normal or pathological brain are as yet uncharted. In situ synthesis of Lf occurs in brain, and Lf transcripts were found in human (26Siebert P.D. Huang B.C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2198-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and mouse brain tissues (27Fillebeen C. Dexter D. Mitchell V. Benaı̈ssa M. Beauvillain J.C. Spik G. Pierce A. Spik G. Legrand D. Mazurier J. Perraudin J.P. Pierce A. Advances in Lactoferrin Research. Plenum Press, New York1998: 296-300Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that Lf expression was up-regulated in mouse brain tissues treated with the neurotoxic agent 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which is used as a model for Parkinson's disease (27Fillebeen C. Dexter D. Mitchell V. Benaı̈ssa M. Beauvillain J.C. Spik G. Pierce A. Spik G. Legrand D. Mazurier J. Perraudin J.P. Pierce A. Advances in Lactoferrin Research. Plenum Press, New York1998: 296-300Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this up-regulation was slight and might not explain the large increase of Lf observed in the case of neurodegenerative disorders (22Leveugle B. Spik G. Perl D.P. Bouras C. Fillit H.M. Hof P.R. Brain Res. 1994; 650: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Leveugle B. Faucheux B.A. Bouras C. Nillesse N. Spik G. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Hof P.R. Acta Neuropathol. 1996; 91: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of Lf on the cerebral microvessels and its distribution in the vicinity of the inflammatory foci led us to investigate whether Lf may cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is formed from specialized endothelial cells (ECs) that are sealed together by continuous complex tight junctions to form a polarized barrier that restricts the free exchange of most solutes between plasma and the extracellular fluid of the brain. Furthermore, even though brain capillary ECs contain no direct transendothelial passageways such as fenestrations or channels, specific transport mechanisms located in the cerebral ECs ensure that the central nervous system receives an adequate supply of nutrients. Such receptors have already been identified for proteins (28Descamps L. Dehouck M.P. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 1149-1158PubMed Google Scholar, 29King G.L. Johnson S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We have used an in vitro model of the BBB which imitates the in vivo situation by means of the co-culture of bovine brain capillary ECs (BBCECs) on one side of a porous filter and astrocytes plated at the bottom of six-well dish (32Méresse S. Dehouck M.P. Delorme P. Bensaı̈d M. Tauber J.P. Delbart C. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1363-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Dehouck M.P. Méresse S. Delorme P. Torpier G. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. Circ. Metab. Cerveau. 1990; 7: 151-162Google Scholar) to provide direct evidence that after binding to BBCECs, Lf crosses the endothelial monolayer from the apical to the abluminal surface. Lf transcytosis is receptor-mediated, and our results indicate that LRP might be involved in this transcellular transport across the brain endothelium. BBCECs isolated and characterized as described previously (32Méresse S. Dehouck M.P. Delorme P. Bensaı̈d M. Tauber J.P. Delbart C. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1363-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Dehouck M.P. Méresse S. Delorme P. Torpier G. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. Circ. Metab. Cerveau. 1990; 7: 151-162Google Scholar) were cloned, allowing us to obtain a pure EC population uncontaminated by pericytes. The cells were cultured in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, added every other day. Nondifferentiated cells were obtained by growing BBCECs in the absence of astrocytes. Primary cultures of mixed astrocytes were prepared from newborn rat cerebral cortex. After removing the meninges, the brain tissue was forced gently through a nylon sieve (34Booher J. Sensenbrenner M. Neurobiology. 1972; 2: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). Astrocytes were plated on six-well dishes (Nunclon; Nunc A/S) at a concentration of 1.2 × 105 cells/ml in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). The medium was changed twice a week. 3 weeks after the seeding was completed, the purity of the astrocyte population was checked (33Dehouck M.P. Méresse S. Delorme P. Torpier G. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. Circ. Metab. Cerveau. 1990; 7: 151-162Google Scholar). Stabilized cultures contained more than 95% astrocytes that were glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive and were used for co-culture. Establishing the in vitro model of BBB was performed using a co-culture of BBCECs and astrocytes. Prior to cell culture, plate inserts (Millicell-CM 0.4 μm; 30-mm diameter; Millipore Corp.) were coated on the upper side with rat tail collagen (35Borstein M.B. Lab. Invest. 1958; 7: 134-139PubMed Google Scholar). They were then set in the six-multiwell dishes containing the astrocytes prepared as described above, and BBCECs were plated at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml on the upper side of the filters in 1.5 ml of co-culture medium. This BBCEC medium was changed every other day. Under these conditions, differentiated BBCECs formed a confluent monolayer 7 days later (400,000 cells/cm2). Experiments were performed 5 days after confluence was reached. To be certain that differentiated BBCECs are a legitimate model for the BBB in vitro, the BBCEC phenotype was characterized and the tight junction network vizualized. Cells were stained with a filamentous actin probe (28Descamps L. Dehouck M.P. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 1149-1158PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dehouck B. Fenart L. Dehouck M.P. Pierce A. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and the localization to the plasma membrane of the tight junction-associated protein ZO-1 was carried out as described (31Dehouck B. Fenart L. Dehouck M.P. Pierce A. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Endothelial permeability was checked in each experiment and the permeability coefficient (Pe, in cm/min) calculated as described previously (33Dehouck M.P. Méresse S. Delorme P. Torpier G. Fruchart J.C. Cecchelli R. Circ. Metab. Cerveau. 1990; 7: 151-162Google Scholar). bLf was purified from bovine colostrum by ion-exchange chromatography as partially saturated bLf (36Chéron A. Mazurier J. Fournet B. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1977; 284: 585-588Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of bLf on the glycan moiety was carried out by coupling 5-((2-(carbhydrazino)methyl)-thio)acetyl)aminofluorescein (Hyf) on aldehyde groups resulting from the mild periodate oxidation ofN-acetylneuraminic acid residues (7Leveugle B. Mazurier J. Legrand D. Mazurier C. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Iodination of bLf was performed using the IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce). bLf (500 μg) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 0.2 mCi of Na125I (carrier-free, 100 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 4 °C. Free iodine was removed on a Sephadex G-50 column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific activity range was 0.35–0.5 μCi/μg of protein; to avoid radiolysis, the iodinated protein was stored at 4 °C and used the same day. Prior to 59Fe labeling, bLf was fully desaturated in formiate buffer (0.2 m formic acid-sodium formiate; containing 0.5 m NaH2PO4 and 25 mm EDTA) at pH 3.8 to give apobLf. 59Fe (18 nmol) (3–25 mCi/mg Fe, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was mixed with a solution containing 0.4 mm nitriloacetic acid and 0.05m NaOH for 5 min at room temperature, and then the pH was adjusted to 8.2 with NaOH. ApobLf (37 nmol) dissolved in 0.1m Tris-bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.6) was added to the iron solution and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Unbound59Fe was captured mainly by adding 50 μl of Chelex 100 (Sigma) preequilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-bicarbonate buffer, and the remaining free 59Fe was further removed on a PD-10 column. This method gave an average specific activity of 5 μCi/mg protein and a yield of iron saturation equal to 99%. For dual labeling of bLf, protein was first labeled with59Fe and further iodinated with 0.05 mCi of Na125I for 500 μg of 59Fe-bLf, giving a specific activity of 0.1 μCi/μg protein for 125I and 4 μCi/mg protein for 59Fe. All of these studies were performed only with BBCECs to avoid any interference from the astrocyte population. Moreover, to eliminate endogenous bLf, BBCECs were always incubated before each experiment for 2 h in medium without serum. Because Tf has been described as an effective blocking component, able to prevent high levels of nonspecific Lf binding (37Goavec M. Mazurier J. Montreuil J. Spik G. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1985; 301: 689-694PubMed Google Scholar), all buffers contained 0.2% bTf (Sigma). Each point was done in triplicate, and the data are represented as the means ± S.E. Nonspecific controls were carried out with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled protein. Equilibrium binding was performed on differentiated and nondifferentiated BBCECs in Ringer-HEPES-bTf for 2 h at 4 °C, with a 125I-bLf concentration ranging from 0.2 to 200 μg/ml (2.5–2500 nm). The cells were washed carefully, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by removing the membrane of the culture insert and counting it in a gamma counter. The results were analyzed using the Enzfitter nonlinear regression data analysis program (Elsevier-BIOSOFT, Cambridge, U. K.). Scatchard plots and kinetic analyses were performed using the same software. Determination of the luminal uptake of Hyf-bLf was performed before cell fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The luminal compartment of the differentiated BBCECs was exposed to Hyf-bLf (50 μg/ml; 625 nm) in Ringer-HEPES-bTf and left in contact with the cells for 45 min at 37 or 4 °C. Fluorescence microscopy experiments were carried out as already described (28Descamps L. Dehouck M.P. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 1149-1158PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of internalization of 125I-bLf by differentiated BBCECs was measured using 125I-bLf (30 μg/ml; 375 nm) which was presented to the luminal surface for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the experiment. After washing off the unbound bLf, filters covered with cells were incubated in prewarmed medium at 37 °C. At various times, filters were removed, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The medium compartments were collected, and cells were treated with 0.1% Pronase E (Merck) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C. The surface-bound, internalized, released, and transported 125I-bLf was counted in the Pronase-sensitive eluate, the cell extract, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fractions of incubation media of the upper and lower compartments, respectively. Transcytosis experiments were performed as follows. One insert covered with BBCECs was set into a six-well dish with 2 ml of Ringer-HEPES-bTf added to each well at 37 °C. 125I-bLf (30 μg/ml),59Fe-bLf (50 μg/ml), and 125I-59Fe-double-labeled bLf (50 μg/ml) were added to the upper side of the filter covered with cells. At various times, the insert was transferred to another well to avoid a possible reendocytosis of bLf by the abluminal side of the BBCECs. At the end of each experiment, intact bLf was assessed using trichloroacetic acid precipitation of lower media, and protein degradation was assessed with AgNO3 precipitation. For 125I-bLf studies, all results were expressed as 125I-bLf equivalent flux (ng/cm2), which represents trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity recovered in the lower compartments. The 59Fe equivalent flux (pg/cm2) corresponds to the total iron radioactivity found in the lower compartment. The influence of temperature on the transport of 125I-bLf (30 μg/ml) was studied with the monolayers kept at 4 °C. In parallel, the paracellular passage of sucrose (0.1 μCi of [14C]sucrose) was assayed at 4 °C and 37 °C in the same conditions. To demonstrate whether Lf transendothelial transport was directional,125I-bLf (30 μg/ml) was added to the lower compartment of the wells, and the transcytosis experiment was conducted as above. The effect of RAP on the transendothelial transport of 125I-bLf across BBCECs was determined by adding 100 nm recombinant RAP to the upper side of the filter covered with cells for 1 h at 37 °C before experiments. Recombinant RAP was prepared in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein that contains the entire coding sequence of the 39-kDa protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (38Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13364-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were then performed with 125I-bLf as described above. After 2 h of transcytosis, the apical and basolateral compartment solutions were collected and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography 2 h at −80 °C (Kodak X-Omat AR film). Binding experiments were performed both on differentiated and nondifferentiated BBCECs (cultured in the absence of astrocytes) using radioiodinated ligand. Only the binding data of differentiated cells are represented in Fig. 1. The binding was found to be concentration-dependent, saturable, and inhibited by approximately 85% in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled bLf, suggesting that it was reversible and specific. The binding data, analyzed by the method of Scatchard, were consistent with a two-component binding curve. Fig. 1 shows the Scatchard analysis of data from a single typical experiment (of five carried out). At a low range of 125I-bLf concentrations, binding is determined primarily by high affinity sites (Fig. 1A). At a high range of 125I-bLf concentrations (Fig. 1B), low affinity sites account for most of the binding. At intermediate concentrations, binding is effected by both high and low affinity sites. These data, summarized in Table I, are in agreement with the presence of two binding sites on differentiated BBCECs: a high affinity binding site with aK d of about 37.5 nm and 90,000 sites/cell and a low affinity binding site with a K dof about 1,900 nm and 890,000 sites/cell. Both sites were specific for bLf. bLf binding to nondifferentiated BBCECs was also investigated (Table I). Scatchard analysis revealed that the affinity of bLf for these cells (K d = 2, 100 nm) and the number of bLf binding sites (920,000/cell) were comparable to the low affinity binding site parameters found on the differentiated cells. These results suggest that only differentiated BBCECs are able to express high affinity binding sites for bLf.Table IDissociation constants (Kd) and numbers of bLf binding sites/cell on BBCECsCellsKdSites/cellnmDifferentiated BBCECsSite 137.5 ± 790,000 ± 16,000Site 21,900 ± 160890,000 ± 70,000Nondifferentiated BBCECs2,100 ± 310920,000 ± 65,000Values are means ± S.E. for two separate experiments conducted in triplicate. Open table in a new tab Values are means ± S.E. for two separate experiments conducted in triplicate. To determine whether bLf was internalized from the luminal surface of the BBCECs, Hyf-bLf was first used as a probe. Staining visualized with a fluorescent microscope is shown in Fig. 2A. Hyf-bLf was found as small, individual vesicles throughout the differentiated cells. This uptake was completely inhibited at 4 °C (Fig. 2B). The endocytosis process was then monitored using radiolabeled bLf. Cells were first incubated at 4 °C for 1 h until the binding site occupancy reached a steady state. After washing off the unbound ligand, cells were incubated at 37 °C and the distribution of surface-bound, internalized, released, and transported radioactivities was counted at various times. As shown in Fig. 3, the Pronase-resistant fraction increased rapidly and reached a maximum of 18% of the initially bound 125I-bLf, 3 min after the start of the incubation. The Pronase-resistant fraction decreased slowly thereafter, as 125I-bLf started to appear in the lower compartment a few minutes later, showing that transcytosis occurs. During the experiment, the Pronase-sensitive fraction decreased, and 125I-bLf appeared in the upper compartment, suggesting a marked dissociation from the cell surface or a release of125I-bLf by the cells.Figure 3Internalization kinetics of125I-bLf in BBCECs. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of bLf (30 μg/ml125I-bLf, 3 mg/ml unlabeled bLf). After washing off the unbound ligand, cells were incubated with 125I-bLf at 37 °C. At the indicated times, filters were removed, and the amounts of surface-bound, internalized, released, and transcytosed radioactivity were counted. Ordinates represent the percentage of the total radioactivity initially bound to BBCECs at 4 °C, which was segregated within the cells (●) and released into the lower incubation medium (▪) or into the upper incubation medium (▴) or associated with membranes (♦). The data are expressed as ng of125I-bLf transported/cm2, which refers to the surface area of the cells. Each point is a mean of three different filters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 125I-bLf was added to the luminal chamber of the culture, and its progressive transfer across the cell monolayer was followed for 90 min. A range of different bLf concentrations (10–100 μg/ml) was assayed, and no evidence of saturation was detected at concentrations lower than 100 μg/ml (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the total, nonspecific and calculated specific bLf flux values as a function of time with a luminal concentration of 30 μg/ml bLf. Our results demonstrate that differentiated BBCECs are not a barrier for the passage of bLf. The transport of labeled bLf from the luminal to the abluminal compartment was reduced severely by an excess of unlabeled bLf, suggesting that bLf transport from the apical to the basal side of the cells was effected by specific receptor-mediated transport. The rate of transcytosis was evaluated, and about three to four bLf molecules were transported via one high affinity binding site in 1 h, suggesting that one bLf molecule crosses the BBCEC monolayer in 15–20 min. The possible toxicity of a high concentration of bLf (3 mg/ml) for the integrity of the BBCEC monolayer was assessed by calculating the permeability to sucrose. No leakiness in the barrier function occurred (Pe = (0.65 ± 0.02) × 10−3and (0.67 ± 0.03) × 10−3 cm/min for the control and in the presence of 3 mg/ml of bLf, respectively). The effect of temperature on bLf transport from the apical to basal surfaces of BBCECs is shown in Fig. 5. A decrease in the incubation temperature from 37 °C to 4 °C slightly affected the paracellular passage of sucrose (Fig. 5A), whereas a dramatic decrease in the bLf transport through the monolayer was observed (Fig. 5B), indicating that bLf is directed to the abluminal compartment by a transcellular route and that this transport system requires active mechanisms such as receptor-mediated transcytosis. Abluminal to luminal transport of bLf was assayed by added125I-bLf to the lower chamber of the culture. No specific transport of bLf was detected across the cell monolayer in these conditions (data not shown), showing that the transport of bLf across BBCECs is unidirectional. To determine whether LRP might be involved in the receptor-mediated transport of bLf, transcytosis exper"

To investigate the in vivo effects of liver-specific SR-BI overexpression on lipid metabolism, we created several lines of SR-BI transgenic mice with an SR-BI genomic construct where the SR-BI promoter region had been replaced by the apolipoprotein (apo)A-I promoter. The effect of constitutively increased SR-BI expression on plasma HDL and non-HDL lipoproteins and apolipoproteins was characterized. There was an inverse correlation between SR-BI expression and apoA-I and HDL cholesterol levels in transgenic mice fed either mouse chow or a diet high in fat and cholesterol. An unexpected finding in the SR-BI transgenic mice was the dramatic impact of the SR-BI transgene on non-HDL cholesterol and apoB whose levels were also inversely correlated with SR-BI expression. Consistent with the decrease in plasma HDL and non-HDL cholesterol was an accelerated clearance of HDL, non-HDL, and their major associated apolipoproteins in the transgenics compared with control animals. These in vivo studies of the effect of SR-BI overexpression on plasma lipoproteins support the previously proposed hypothesis that SR-BI accelerates the metabolism of HDL and also highlight the capacity of this receptor to participate in the metabolism of non-HDL lipoproteins.

Similarly, the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin also causes an increase in SR-BI expression in the steroidogenic Lydig cells of rat testis (15Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the SR-BI expression may be regulated in response to the supply and demand for cholesterol by some tissues. Some of the most convincing studies suggesting a role for SR-BI in HDL metabolism come from the characterization of mice with genetically manipulated SR-BI expression. Two studies have examined mice with marked reductions in SR-BI expression caused by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (8Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 9Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Gosselin M.L. Dixon K.L. Deeds J.D. Acton S.L. Tall A.R. Huszar D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Increased HDL cholesterol levels in animals deficient in SR-BI suggest the importance of SR-BI in the clearance of HDL cholesterol. The in vivo effect of transient increases in SR-BI expression was studied in mice after adenovirus-mediated SR-BI gene transfer (7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This was associated with a marked decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol and an increase in biliary cholesterol. The adenoviral study, although supporting the hypothesis that increased SR-BI expression results in accelerated clearance of HDL cholesterol, is complicated by the massive short term increase in the expression of SR-BI and the hepatotoxicity that accompanies murine adenoviral infections. To investigate the effect of steady-state increases in SR-BI expression on HDL metabolism we created several lines of SR-BI transgenic mice. One of the transgenes was a mouse BAC clone containing the SR-BI gene with the promoter region replaced by human liver-specific apoA-I promoter. With this transgene two lines of SR-BI transgenic animals were studied, one with a 10-fold increase in SR-BI transcripts compared with control mice and a second line with a 2-fold increase. To determine the effect of SR-BI on lipoprotein metabolism and plasma cholesterol homeostasis we examined the impact of the increased levels of SR-BI on HDL and non-HDL lipoproteins and associated apolipoproteins with regard to plasma levels and clearance rates. A mouse BAC clone, BACM16, containing the full length of the SR-BI gene, was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis). The multiple steps involved in creating the apoA-I promoter SR-BI construct are outlined in Fig. 1a. The human apoA-I promoter region from nucleotides −1613 to +72 of the transcription start site was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR. The forward primer contained a KpnI site at the 5′-end, and the reverse primer contained SR-BI cDNA sequence +1 to +50. The PCR product was cloned into the vector pCR21, using a TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego) to construct pCRAISRBI5′. The 4-kbEcoRI fragment of BACM16 containing the first exon of the SR-BI gene was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) to construct pBSSRBI5′. The SR-BI promoter-replacing vector pBSAISRBI5′cm was constructed by sequential insertion into pBluescript SK+ of a 1.7-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment of pCRAISRBI5′, a 3.2-kb EcoRI-BssHII fragment of pBSSRBI5′ and a 0.5-kb NotI-EcoRI fragment of the chloramphenicol gene of the BAC vector, pBELOBAC11. BACM16 was fragmented at EcoRI sites in the first intron of the SR-BI gene and in the chloramphenicol gene in the vector sequence by recA-protected restriction enzyme (RARE) cleavage as described previously with some modification (17Boren J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). pBSAISRBI5′cm was digested withEcoRI and ligated into the 65-kb EcoRI RARE fragment of BACM16 separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis. The BAC clone pBACAISRBI was screened by positive selection on LB plates supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol and then by PCR with the forward primer within the apoA-I promoter sequence (apoA-I-620f) and the reverse primer within the first exon of SR-BI (SR-BI r 176). BAC DNAs were prepared for microinjection by modified alkaline lysis methods followed by phenol-chloroform extraction, and then an overnight dialysis against the injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) through Millipore type VS membrane (0.025-μm pore size; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The SR-BI transgenic mice in the inbred FVB background were generated by standard microinjection methods (18Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 217-250Google Scholar). Mice were screened by PCR with a primer set, apoA-I-620f and SR-BI r 176. Mice were fed Purina mouse chow (no. 5001) until 6 weeks of age when blood samples were collected from the tail vein after an overnight fast. The animals were then fed an atherogenic diet high in fat and cholesterol (1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid, and 15% fat) (19Nishina P.M. Verstuyft J. Paigen B. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected again at 4 weeks after initiation of the atherogenic diet. Total cholesterol was determined by the standard enzyme method (Wako, Osaka, Japan). HDL cholesterol was measured after selective precipitation of non-HDL lipoproteins by dextran sulfate and magnesium chloride. Plasma levels of mouse apoA-I and apoB were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as described previously (20Francone O.L. Haghpassand M. Bennett J.A. Royer L. McNeish J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse apoB levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared from an immunized animal injected with mouse LDL. Antiserum was purified by ligand immunoaffinity chromatography to isolate those antibodies reactive against apoB. Antibodies were purified on a HiTrap protein A affinity column and biotinylated. Plasma samples of five to seven animals of each group were combined and subjected to FPLC fractionation analysis with two tandem Superose 6 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (21Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The size distribution of the d ≤ 1.21 g/ml lipoprotein fractions were obtained by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis essentially as described by Nichols et al.(22Nichols A.V. Krauss R.M. Musliner T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation of plasma pooled from five to seven animals of each group. Total RNA was isolated from brain, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, adrenal glands, and ovary or testis of the animals using RNA Stat 60 (Teltest Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNase protection assay was run by RPAII kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with labeled probes overnight at 45 °C and then digested with RNase A/T1 mix. The protected fragments were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide and 8m urea gel and were detected by autoradiography. To identify the transgene expression from that of the endogenous gene we designed a riboprobe on the 5′-end of the SR-BI gene expanding from the 5′-untranslated region to the first exon; the probe on the 3′-end of the gene recognized both the transgene and endogenous gene. Primer sets were generated to amplify the probes for SR-BI and a probe for mouse LDL receptor from wild type FVB mouse liver cDNA as a template by PCR with T7 promoter sequence supplemented on the 5′-upstream of the reverse primers. The probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a MAXiscript kit (Ambion). Immunoblot analysis was carried out with liver membrane proteins solubilized with Triton X-100. The indicated amounts of reduced protein samples were electrophoresed on pre-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–20% acrylamide; Novex, San Diego) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Mouse SR-BI was detected by rabbit anti-mouse SR-BI antiserum directed to residues 405–509 for mouse SR-BI after blocking with 3% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. The primary antibody was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) followed by ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vivoturnover studies were carried out as described previously (7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated from human plasma and HDL (d = 1.063–1.210 g/ml) from FVB mouse plasma by standard sequential ultracentrifugation and then subjected to iodination with 125I using IODO-BEADS (Pierce). The labeled lipoproteins (10–15 μg of protein, 50–100 cpm/ng) were injected into the tail vein of each animal. The injected lipoprotein was less than 0.5% of the mouse LDL or HDL pool size. Blood (50 μl) was withdrawn from the retroorbital plexus into heparinized capillary tubes at the indicated time points after injection. The apolipoprotein retention was measured by the radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid precipitate of the plasma. The radioactivity of the precipitate at 2 min after injection was defined as 100%. A 120-kilobase pair BAC clone, BACM16, containing the entire SR-BI gene was injected into FVB mouse embryos as was a second DNA preparation containing a construct engineered from this clone, BACAISRBI, whose SR-BI promoter was replaced with the human apoA-I promoter (Fig. 1a). Two BACM16 transgenic founder mice and seven transgenic founder mice containing BACAISRBI were created (TableI). No detectable effect on plasma HDL levels was observed in the two founder mice with the BACM16, whereas four of the seven founder mice of BACAISRBI transgenics had significantly lower HDL cholesterol levels. Among the BACAISRBI transgenic lines B2611 (referred to as low SR-BI) and B2614 (referred to as high SR-BI) with moderate and profound decreases in HDL cholesterol, respectively, were chosen for further analysis.Table IPlasma total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) of transgenic miceGenderTransgeneTCHDL-cmg/mlmg/mlA3268FBACM16100.670.3A3270MBACM16102.177.6B2610MBACAISRBI120.794.9B2611FBACAISRBI58.626.1B2614FBACAISRBI3.22.9B2628MBACAISRBI73.651.1B2899FBACAISRBI72.962.7C2501FBACAISRBI97.170.2C2510FBACAISRBI107.479.3Control FVB (n = 9)104.7 ± 6.976.8 ± 7.0 Open table in a new tab To examine tissue specificity of expression of the transgene and to differentiate it from that of the endogenous SR-BI gene, we performed RNase protection assays. The riboprobe at the 5′-end of the SR-BI cDNA used for these studies distinguishes the two SR-BI transcripts in the transgenic mice generating a 176-base pair band for the transgene and a 248-base pair band for the endogenous SR-BI gene. The expression of the transgene is prominent in the liver of transgenic mice as expected from previous studies (23Schultz J.R. Gong E.L. McCall M.R. Nichols A.V. Clift S.M. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21630-21636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). In agreement with previous studies in mice, the endogenous SR-BI expression though detectable in the liver, ovary, and lung, was highest in the adrenal gland (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). The liver expression of the SR-BI transgene did not alter the pattern or levels of the endogenous SR-BI gene. Analyses of SR-BI expression in these mice indicate that the expression levels of SR-BI in the liver of low and high SR-BI transgenic mouse lines are 2-fold and >10-fold higher than those of control FVB mice, respectively (Fig. 2a). To examine the SR-BI protein product in the liver of transgenic mice, cell membrane proteins were collected by ultracentrifugation, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted using an antibody against mouse SR-BI. In both transgenic lines studied, the SR-BI protein levels reflected the results of the RNase protection studies (Fig. 2b) and were about 2- and 10-fold higher than endogenous levels in the low and high SR-BI transgenics, respectively. The increases in SR-BI expression levels observed in the low and high SR-BI transgenic mice livers correlated inversely with plasma cholesterol concentrations. The total cholesterol levels of the transgenics were 5.9% of control FVB in the high SR-BI Tg line and 58.5% of control FVB in the low SR-BI Tg line (Fig. 3a). The HDL cholesterol levels of the high and low SR-BI transgenics were 4.0 and 61.6% of control FVB mice, respectively (Fig. 3b). To determine whether the decrease in HDL cholesterol is accompanied by a parallel decrease in apoA-I concentration, murine apoA-I levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentration of apoA-I was 1.0 and 69.2% of non-transgenic controls in high SR-BI transgenics and low SR-BI transgenics, respectively (Fig. 3d), suggesting that increased expression of SR-BI decreases not only HDL cholesterol levels but also HDL particle number. An unexpected result in the analysis of the SR-BI transgenics was that the decrease in plasma cholesterol was not exclusively in the HDL fraction but was also present in non-HDL fractions. The decrease in non-HDL cholesterol, though not as great as the decrease in HDL cholesterol, was significant in the high and low SR-BI transgenics, 90 and 45% lower, respectively, than that of the non-transgenic mice (Fig. 3c). Plasma apoB levels were also decreased in mice with elevated hepatic SR-BI expression (Fig. 3e). Compared with non-transgenic controls, apoB was decreased by 35 and 26% in the high and low transgenic mice, respectively. FPLC gel filtration analysis using pooled plasma confirmed that there were dose-dependent decreases in HDL and non-HDL cholesterol in mice expressing SR-BI, compared with non-transgenic controls (Fig. 4a). To examine the impact of SR-BI on the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels of mice fed an atherogenic diet, we determined HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, non-HDL cholesterol, and apoB levels in SR-BI transgenics and non-transgenic littermates fed this diet for 4 weeks. Total plasma cholesterol was increased significantly in all genotypes (Fig. 3a), and these changes were primarily the result of increases in non-HDL cholesterol (Fig. 3c). Comparisons of the transgenics and control animals demonstrate that the level of SR-BI expression was roughly associated with a dose-dependent decrease in total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol. Plasma apoB levels of high and low SR-BI transgenics were 36 and 19% lower, respectively, than those of non-transgenic controls (Fig. 3e). As a consequence, the markedly decreased ratio of non-HDL cholesterol to apoB (98.9 ± 54 in high SR-BI, 647 ± 85 in low SR-BI, and 778.3 ± 248 in FVB) could be used as an indication of a decreased particle size in mice overexpressing SR-BI. Taken together, these findings indicate that moderate increases in SR-BI levels are associated with significant changes in lipoprotein particle size and suggest that SR-BI is also able to promote selective cholesteryl ester uptake from non-HDL as well as HDL particles. The effects of diet and the SR-BI transgene on the expression of LDL receptor and endogenous SR-BI gene were studied. RNase protection assays of total liver RNA isolated from mice before and after high fat diet treatment were performed and qualitatively compared (Fig. 2c). Expression of the SR-BI transgene and the SR-BI endogenous gene was not influenced by the diet. In contrast, LDLr was down-regulated after high fat diet treatment in the control and low SR-BI transgenic mice, whereas in the high SR-BI transgenics LDLr expression was not effected by diet. The lipoprotein size distribution of control and SR-BI transgenic mice is shown in Fig. 4,b and c. In agreement with previous studies (24Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), HDL isolated from wild type mice is shown as a monodisperse population of particles with a peak diameter of 10.2 nm. HDL isolated from low SR-BI mice also consisted of a unimodal distribution, but its peak diameter is decreased markedly, suggesting a denser, less lipid-rich particle (Fig. 4b). Surprisingly, the same phenomenon was observed in apoB-containing lipoprotein fractions (Fig. 4c). The peak diameter of the VLDL fraction in high SR-BI shows a striking decrease, 35.5 nm compared with 37.3 nm in FVB mice. The peak size of the LDL/IDL fraction also shows a remarkable and dose-dependent reduction in SR-BI transgenics: 27.4 nm in high SR-BI, 29.4 nm in low SR-BI, and 30.8 nm in FVB mice. These observations support the hypothesis that SR-BI promotes the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from apoB-containing lipoproteins leading to the formation of smaller particles. To evaluate the effect of SR-BI overexpression on the metabolism of lipoproteinsin vivo, 125I-labeled human LDL and mouse HDL were injected into mice of different genotypes. The disappearance of radioactivity from plasma was followed for 24 h. The plasma clearance rate of labeled HDL was increased significantly in the high SR-BI and low SR-BI transgenics compared with control mice: 0.36, 0.19, and 0.12 pools of protein/h, respectively (Fig. 5a). This suggests that SR-BI determines, at least in part, the rate of metabolism of HDL and that the decrease in the plasma HDL pool size observed in mice expressing SR-BI may be attributable to a dose-dependent increase in the clearance of HDL. To examine whether SR-BI participates in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins and thus contributes to the decrease in plasma non-HDL cholesterol and apoB levels observed in SR-BI transgenic mice, human LDL clearance rates were determined in SR-BI transgenic and control mice. Labeled human LDL was used instead of autologous LDL because human apoB binds less efficiently to the mouse LDLr. Thus changes in the rate of LDL clearance would more likely be attributable to SR-BI transgenes and not to the endogenous murine LDL receptor. Mice with increased levels of SR-BI in the liver have an accelerated rate of clearance of human LDL (Fig. 5b): 0.361 pools of apoB/h in high SR-BI, 0.354 in low SR-BI, and 0.215 in FVB. These findings in the SR-BI transgenics further suggest that SR-BI plays a part in non-HDL metabolism. The transgenic mice created for these studies with increased hepatic levels of SR-BI have enabled us to determine the effect of steady-state overexpression of this gene on lipoprotein metabolism. The inverse correlation between SR-BI expression and HDL turnover rates suggests that the increased expression of SR-BI and its mediated clearance of HDL result in lower plasma concentrations of this lipoprotein. These findings are consistent with prior in vitro as well as in vivo characterizations of SR-BI (3Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and add further support to the hypothesis that SR-BI is an important participant in HDL metabolism. HDL cholesterol uptake by the adrenal gland and liver is believed to occur in part by the selective uptake pathway, a process whereby cholesteryl esters are selectively removed from the particles. This selective removal of cholesteryl esters would be predicted to result in changes in HDL composition and particle size. The presence of the smaller denser HDL particles in the SR-BI transgenics, demonstrated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is thus consistent with increased selective uptake of HDL cholesterol in the SR-BI-overexpressing mice. The accelerated clearance of apoA-I in the SR-BI transgenics may in part be a result of the changes in the HDL particle size accelerating the metabolism of this apoA-I-containing particle by the kidney (25Glass C.K. Pittman R.C. Keller G.A. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7161-7167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as has been noted previously in mice with increased SR-BI expression caused by adenoviral gene transfer (7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The LDL turnover results, although not as dramatic as the HDL turnover results, indicate faster clearance of labeled LDL in SR-BI transgenics and suggest the involvement of SR-BI in LDL metabolism. The decreased size of non-HDL lipoproteins coupled with their reduced concentrations in mice overexpressing SR-BI suggests the possibility that the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters via SR-BI is not restricted to HDL but also includes non-HDL lipoproteins. Another possible explanation for the reduced concentrations of non-HDL lipoproteins in the SR-BI transgenics is that SR-BI overexpression may impact on the production and secretion of VLDL in the liver or the uptake of cholesterol-rich non-HDL particles. Although stimulated VLDL secretion was observed in the recovery phase after adenovirus-mediated short term overexpression of SR-BI (7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), the persistent overexpression of SR-BI obtained in the present study would be predicted to suppress this secretion, which is regulated by pooled intracellular cholesterol. The sensitive and quantitative RNase protection assays enabled assessment of the effect of SR-BI activity and diet on the expression of the endogenous murine SR-BI and LDLr. Although prior studies demonstrated that adrenal SR-BI expression is affected by apoA-I (13Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), hepatic lipase (13Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (14Ng D.S. Francone O.L. Forte T.M. Zhang J. Haghpassand M. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15777-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the expression of the endogenous hepatic SR-BI gene was not affected by SR-BI transgene activity or diet in the present study. LDLr expression was unchanged in the SR-BI transgenics when the animals were fed mouse chow; however, the expression of LDLr was diminished in the low SR-BI transgenics and nontransgenic control mice when fed the high fat high cholesterol diet. This effect of diet on LDLr expression was not detected in high SR-BI high expressors, possibly suggesting that intracellular cholesterol pools and their effect on LDLr expression may be dependent upon the route by which cholesterol enters the cell. In summary, although it is not clear how the mechanism of SR-BI overexpression impacts on LDLr expression, our studies clearly indicate that the regulation of SR-BI and LDLr are in many ways distinctly different. An important but yet unanswered question concerning SR-BI is its effect on an organism's susceptibility to diet-induced atherogenesis. The predicted acceleration of reverse cholesterol transport, a process whereby excess cholesterol accumulating in the peripheral tissues such as the vasculature is mobilized, in the SR-BI overexpression transgenics would at first suggest that increasing the activity of SR-BI should have an anti-atherogenic effect. An alternative perspective also consistent with the results of the present study would suggest that increased expression of SR-BI should increase an organism's susceptibility to atherosclerosis by decreasing both apoA-I and HDL plasma concentration. This relates to the multiple in vitro and in vivo studies that have attributed antiatherogenic properties to the HDL particle itself, such as acting as an antioxidant and preventing LDL modification (26Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Fong L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 27Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J. Berliner J.A. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogel J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), effects that would be diminished at reduced plasma concentrations of this lipoprotein. The eventual analysis of atherosclerosis susceptibility in the SR-BI transgenics, created in the inbred genetic background described in this study, may offer an important vista into the role of SR-BI as a potentially manipulable atherosclerosis susceptibility factor. The present characterization of SR-BI-overexpressing mice has revealed several sites where SR-BI may be involved in lipoprotein metabolism. This includes its previously studied role in HDL metabolism as well as a largely uncharacterized role in the metabolism of non-HDL lipoproteins. This latter property might be viewed as having been predicted by the fact that SR-BI was first identified by its ability to bind native LDL as well as modified LDL (10Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major findings of the present study that increased SR-BI expression in transgenic mice dramatically lowers plasma levels and accelerates clearance of both HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, highlights the potential major role of this molecule in lipoprotein metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2021607480,"Arrestin proteins play a key role in the desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recently we proposed a molecular mechanism whereby arrestin preferentially binds to the activated and phosphorylated form of its cognate GPCR. To test the model, we introduced two different types of mutations into β-arrestin that were expected to disrupt two crucial elements that make β-arrestin binding to receptors phosphorylation-dependent. We found that two β-arrestin mutants (Arg169→ Glu and Asp383 → Ter) (Ter, stop codon) are indeed “constitutively active.” In vitro these mutants bind to the agonist-activated β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) regardless of its phosphorylation status. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes these β-arrestin mutants effectively desensitize β2AR in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Constitutively active β-arrestin mutants also effectively desensitize δ opioid receptor (DOR) and restore the agonist-induced desensitization of a truncated DOR lacking the critical G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation sites. The kinetics of the desensitization induced by phosphorylation-independent mutants in the absence of receptor phosphorylation appears identical to that induced by wild type β-arrestin + GRK3. Either of the mutations could have occurred naturally and made receptor kinases redundant, raising the question of why a more complex two-step mechanism (receptor phosphorylation followed by arrestin binding) is universally used.

Constitutively active β-arrestin mutants also effectively desensitize δ opioid receptor (DOR) and restore the agonist-induced desensitization of a truncated DOR lacking the critical G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation sites. The kinetics of the desensitization induced by phosphorylation-independent mutants in the absence of receptor phosphorylation appears identical to that induced by wild type β-arrestin + GRK3. Either of the mutations could have occurred naturally and made receptor kinases redundant, raising the question of why a more complex two-step mechanism (receptor phosphorylation followed by arrestin binding) is universally used. The decrease of a response to a persistent stimulus (desensitization) is a widespread biological phenomenon. Signaling by diverse G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; βARK2, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 (GRK3); Kir3, G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; P-β2AR, phosphorylated β2AR; DOR, δ opioid receptor; Rh*, light-activated rhodopsin; P-Rh*, phosphorylated Rh*; HAC, high agonist affinity complex; Ter, stop codon is believed to be terminated by a uniform two-step mechanism (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). According to the model, activated receptor is first phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK). An arrestin protein binds to the activated phosphoreceptor, thereby blocking G protein interaction. Arrestin-receptor complex is then internalized, whereupon receptor is either dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma membrane (resensitization) or sorted to lysosomes and destroyed (down-regulation). Thus, the formation of the arrestin-receptor complex appears to be the final step of desensitization and the first step of resensitization and/or receptor down-regulation, which puts it at the crucial cross-roads of the processes regulating cellular responsiveness. The tremendously diverse superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with more than 1000 members is the largest known group of proteins that translate a wide variety of external stimuli into intracellular “language.” In contrast, the repertoire of receptor kinases and arrestins involved in the desensitization of these receptors is rather limited: only six GRKs and four arrestins have thus far been found in mammals (reviewed in Ref. 1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that at least some of the kinases and arrestins regulate numerous receptors. Thus, these proteins are attractive targets for research designed to delineate common molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of GPCR signaling in cells (and to create fairly universal tools for the experimental and/or therapeutic intervention in the process).

Recently we have proposed a molecular mechanism that explains an amazing selectivity of arrestins for the activated phosphorylated forms of GPCRs (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

A potent secondary receptor-binding site is mobilized for the interaction only when both primary sites are simultaneously engaged, i.e. when an arrestin encounters activated and phosphorylated receptor (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J.

In this model, arrestin is kept in its basal conformation by several intramolecular interactions in which certain residues in the primary binding sites (“trigger” residues) are involved. One of these triggers is pulled by binding to an activated form of the receptor, the other, by the interaction of arrestin with phosphate(s) introduced by GRK. Thus, arrestin works like a coincidence detector, assuming its high-affinity receptor-binding conformation when both triggers are simultaneously pulled.

Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) set the stage for the targeted construction of arrestin mutants in which one of the triggers is constitutively pulled by an appropriate mutation. In order to test the validity of the model we constructed three β-arrestin mutants: 1) Arg169 → Glu, that reverses the charge of the putative phosphorylation-sensitive trigger (Arg169 → Glu is homologous to the Arg175 → Glu mutation in visual arrestin, that makes its binding to rhodopsin phosphorylation-independent (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)); 2) Gln394 → Ter; and 3) Asp383 → Ter, that delete a part or all of the regulatory arrestin COOH terminus, which keeps arrestin in a basal conformation and suppresses an untimely mobilization of the secondary binding site (6Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). First, we tested the ability of these mutants to interact with purified β2AR reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles by performing direct binding studies (3Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and agonist affinity shift assays (7Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in vitro. Wild type β-arrestin and β-arrestin-(1–393) bind poorly to activated unphosphorylated receptor (Fig. 1A). In contrast, β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu) and β-arrestin-(1–382) demonstrate significantly higher binding to activated unphosphorylated receptor (Fig. 1A). Wild type β-arrestin and all three mutants readily bind to activated and phosphorylated β2AR (Fig. 1A). Thus, β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu) and β-arrestin-(1–382) bind to activated β2AR in a phosphorylation-independent fashion. Recently (7Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) we found that arrestin-receptor complex is similar to G protein-receptor complex in two respects: agonists have higher affinity for arrestin-receptor complex than for receptor alone, and only a fraction of the receptors forms such a high agonist affinity complex (HAC) even at saturating concentrations of arrestin. The maximum percentage of the receptor in HAC gives a good estimate of the propensity of a given arrestin protein to bind tightly to the receptor (arrestin competency) (7Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Consistent with the direct binding data (Fig. 1A), β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu) and β-arrestin-(1–382) induced the formation of HAC by unphosphorylated β2AR (22 ± 4% in both cases) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, all forms of β-arrestin induced the formation of HAC by phosphorylated β2AR (P-β2AR) (Fig. 2B). The percentage of HAC formed by P-β2AR in the presence of saturating (1 μm) concentration of β-arrestin, β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu), β-arrestin-(1–382), and β-arrestin-(1–393) was 31 ± 6, 52 ± 3, 41 ± 3, and 20 ± 4%, respectively (Fig. 2B). In summary, in bothin vitro assays β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu) and β-arrestin-(1–382) demonstrate constitutive activity (phosphorylation-independent receptor binding). Next we tested whether these β-arrestin species can functionally desensitize unphosphorylated β2AR in living cells. To this end GPCRs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the activation of coexpressed G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir3 was used as a measure of receptor function. Under these conditions, the application of receptor agonists produced a large increase in inwardly rectifying potassium conductance (8Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Undetectable levels of endogenous arrestins and GRKs are expressed in these cells (data not shown). As a result, only a very slow response desensitization was evident during prolonged agonist treatment when β2AR (or another GPCR) is expressed alone. The rate of desensitization was not significantly increased when the receptor is coexpressed with either GRK alone or arrestin alone. However, a dramatic increase in desensitization rate was observed when both GRK and arrestin were coexpressed with a receptor (8Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the relative activity of different forms of β-arrestin, we expressed β2AR with or without GRK3 (also called β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 or βARK2) in the presence or absence of different forms of β-arrestin. As shown on Fig. 3(A and C), both wild type and β-arrestin-(1–393) facilitated β2AR desensitization only when βARK2 was present. In contrast, β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu) and β-arrestin-(1–382) in the absence of βARK2 produced high rates of desensitization similar to that produced by wild type β-arrestin in the presence of βARK2, suggesting that these mutants did induce phosphorylation-independent desensitization of β2AR in the cell. In order to test whether the constitutively active forms of β-arrestin retain the characteristic broad receptor specificity of wild type nonvisual arrestins (9Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar, 10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we performed similar series of experiments with δ opioid receptor (DOR) (Fig. 3, B and D), which was previously shown to be desensitized following agonist activation in oocytes coexpressing wild type β-arrestin and βARK2 (8Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Again, the constitutively active mutants induced DOR desensitization, even in the absence of βARK2, suggesting that these mutations do not appreciably change receptor specificity of β-arrestin (or, rather, lack thereof). It should be noted that wild type visual and β-arrestin, visual arrestin mutant (Arg175 → Glu), and β-arrestin mutants (Arg169 → Glu), (1–382), and (1–393), readily bind to activated phosphorylated forms of both rhodopsin and β2AR (Fig. 1). Visual arrestin mutant (Arg175 → Glu) also binds to unphosphorylated activated rhodopsin, while β-arrestin mutants (Arg169 → Glu) and (1–382) bind to unphosphorylated activated β2AR. However, phosphorylation-independent visual arrestin mutant does not bind to unphosphorylated activated β2AR and phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin mutants do not bind to unphosphorylated activated rhodopsin (Fig. 1). Thus, the preference of β-arrestin for β2AR over rhodopsin and that of visual arrestin for rhodopsin over β2AR (3Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) appears, if anything, enhanced by these mutations. Interestingly, in the presence of βARK2 both of the phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin mutants induced a more rapid receptor desensitization than wild type β-arrestin (Fig. 3), although the expression levels of all forms of β-arrestin in oocytes were virtually the same (0.72 ± 0.34, 0.90 ± 0.27, 0.85 ± 0.32, and 1.44 ± 0.87 ng/μg of total protein for wild type, (Arg169 → Glu), (1–382), and (1–393) forms, respectively). Apparently, faster desensitization in the presence of βARK2 reflects stronger binding of the mutants to phosphorylated receptor (Figs. 1, 2). Because the peak agonist-induced β2AR and DOR responses were not significantly different in oocytes expressing constitutively active β-arrestins (compared with oocytes expressing no β-arrestin or wild type β-arrestin; data not shown), the mutants do not appear to be prebound to the receptor before agonist application. Our previous studies demonstrated that the crucial GRK phosphorylation sites are localized on the carboxyl-terminal part of DOR, and that the truncation of the receptor yielding DOR-(1–339) blocked homologous desensitization mediated by β-arrestin + βARK2 (8Kovoor A. Nappey V. Kieffer B.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27605-27611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We tested whether constitutively active β-arrestin mutants can rescue the desensitization of DOR-(1–339). Both phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin mutants induced the desensitization of truncated DOR with virtually the same kinetics as evident for the full-length DOR (Fig. 4). These data suggest that constitutively active β-arrestins are equally capable of tight binding to (and blocking the signaling of) a receptor without phosphates on the COOH terminus and without the COOH terminus itself. An important implication of this finding is that the major role of the GRK-phosphorylated elements of the receptor is to pull the phosphorylation-sensitive trigger on the arrestin molecule; they do not appear to be required for tight arrestin binding to the receptorper se. Thus, the binding of β-arrestin-(Arg169 → Glu) and β-arrestin-(1–382) to unphosphorylated receptor detectable in bothin vitro assays (Figs. 1 and 2) translates into the ability of these mutants to induce phosphorylation-independent receptor desensitization in the living cell (Figs. 3 and 4). Taken together, the data corroborate the model of sequential multisite arrestin-receptor interaction (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Recent studies suggest that arrestin binding targets the receptors for internalization (10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation-independent arrestins are likely to prove valuable tools for the experimental manipulation of the efficiency of signaling by different GPCRs.

https://openalex.org/W2037548154,"The androgen-independent human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line DU-145 proliferates in serum-free medium and produces insulin-like growth factors (IGF)-I, IGF-II, and the IGF type-1 receptor (IGF-1R). They also secrete three IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP), IGFBP-2, -3, and -4. Of these, immunoblot analysis revealed selective proteolysis of IGFBP-3, yielding fragments of 31 and 19 kDa. By using an anti-IGF-I-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), we detect surface receptor-bound IGF-I on serum-starved DU-145 cells, which activates IGF-1R and triggers a mitogenic signal. Incubation of DU-145 cells with blocking anti-IGF-I, anti-IGF-II, or anti-IGF-I plus anti-IGF-II mAb does not, however, inhibit serum-free growth of DU-145. Conversely, anti-IGF-1R mAb and IGFBP-3 inhibit DNA synthesis. IGFBP-3 also modifies the DU-145 cell cycle, decreases p34cdc2 levels, and IGF-1R autophosphorylation. The antiproliferative IGFBP-3 activity is not IGF-independent, since des-(1–3)IGF-I, which does not bind to IGFBP-3, reverses its inhibitory effect. DU-145 also secretes the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, which can be detected in both a soluble and a membrane-bound form. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, but not serpins, abrogate DNA synthesis in DU-145 associated with the blocking of IGFBP-3 proteolysis. Overexpression of an antisense cDNA for MMP-9 inhibits 80% of DU-145 cell proliferation that can be reversed by IGF-I in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of MMP-9 expression is also associated with a decrease in IGFBP-3 proteolysis and with reduced signaling through the IGF-1R. Our data indicate an IGF autocrine loop operating in DU-145 cells, specifically modulated by IGFBP-3, whose activity may in turn be regulated by IGFBP-3 proteases such as MMP-9."
https://openalex.org/W2050524167,"The highly conserved non-structural protein 2C of picornaviruses is involved in viral genome replication and encapsidation and in the rearrangement of intracellular structures. 2C binds RNA, has nucleoside triphosphatase activity, and shares three motifs with superfamily III helicases. Motifs “A” and “B” are involved in nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) binding and hydrolysis, whereas a function for motif “C” has not yet been demonstrated. Poliovirus RNA replication is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Resistance and dependence to GdnHCl map to 2C. To characterize the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of 2C, we purified poliovirus recombinant 2C fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST-2C) from Escherichia coli. GST-2C hydrolyzed ATP with a K m of 0.7 mm. Other NTPs, including GTP, competed with ATP for binding to 2C but were poor substrates for hydrolysis. Mutation of conserved residues in motif A and B abolished ATPase activity, as did mutation of the conserved asparagine residue in motif C, an observation indicating the involvement of this motif in ATP hydrolysis. GdnHCl at millimolar concentrations inhibited ATP hydrolysis. Mutations in 2C that confer poliovirus resistant to or dependent on GdnHCl increased the tolerance to GdnHCl up to 100-fold. The highly conserved non-structural protein 2C of picornaviruses is involved in viral genome replication and encapsidation and in the rearrangement of intracellular structures. 2C binds RNA, has nucleoside triphosphatase activity, and shares three motifs with superfamily III helicases. Motifs “A” and “B” are involved in nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) binding and hydrolysis, whereas a function for motif “C” has not yet been demonstrated. Poliovirus RNA replication is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Resistance and dependence to GdnHCl map to 2C.

Poliovirus is the prototypical member of the genusEnterovirus which is one of six genera ofPicornaviridae, a family of small, icosahedral, positive strand RNA viruses. The genome is typically 7.5 kilobases in length and codes for one polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally processed to give rise to functional proteins. During processing, precursor polyproteins arise that have functions which are distinct from their final cleavage products. In addition, many proteins have been shown to carry out several functions. These features allow picornaviruses to make maximal use of the genetic information stored in their small RNA genome but they make it difficult to address the roles and functions of a particular protein. A key event in the picornavirus life cycle is the replication of the RNA genome. This process requires all non-structural proteins (1Wimmer E. Hellen C.U.T. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 353-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and is confined within cytoplasmic replication complexes (RCs) 1The abbreviations used are: RC, replication complex; MBP, maltose-binding protein; NTP, nucleoside triphosphate; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; gr, guanidine-resistant; gd, guanidine-dependent; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTPase, nucleoside triphosphatase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (2Caliguiri L.A.

Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Membranes appear to be crucial constituents of the RCs since detergents inhibit several steps of RNA replication (5Etchison D.

It appears that many viral, non-structural proteins are membrane associated and are abundant constituents of the RC (4Takegami T. Semler B.L. Anderson C.W. Wimmer E. Virology. 1983; 128: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,8Bienz K. Egger D. Pasamontes L. Virology. 1987; 160: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Egger D. Pasamontes L.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6576-6588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, 2BC has been shown to induce membrane proliferation from cytoplasmic membranes (11Aldabe R. Carrasco L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Bienz K. Egger D. Rasser Y. Bossart W. Virology. 1983; 131: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Cho M.W. Tererina N. Egger D. Bienz K. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1994; 202: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) leading to an enormous mass of virus-induced vesicles to which the RCs are attached (14Caliguiri L.A. Tamm I. Virology. 1970; 42: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Dales S. Eggers H.J. Tamm I. Palade G.E. Virology. 1965; 26: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 16Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes I. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2BC and its cleavage product 2B, but not 2C, block protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and increase the permeability of the cell membrane (17Aldabe R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). 2C, a protein of 38 kDa and 329 amino acid residues in length, is also an abundant constituent of the RC, and it contains determinants for membrane association and vesicle induction (13Cho M.W. Tererina N. Egger D. Bienz K. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1994; 202: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Echeverri A.C. Dasgupta A. Virology. 1995; 208: 540-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Expression of a fragment encompassing residues 1–274 is sufficient to induce the formation of vesicles morphologically similar to those induced by 2BC and those observed in poliovirus-infected cells (21Teterina N.L. Gorbalenya A.E. Egger D. Bienz K. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8962-8972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2C has RNA binding properties. UV irradiation of membrane fractions containing RCs revealed that 2C and 2BC can be cross-linked to RNA (16Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes I. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northwestern blotting with 2C fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-2C) that was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli, identified amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences required for RNA binding (22Rodrı́guez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10105-10112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that 2C binds to the 3′ end of negative strand RNA (23Banerjee R. Echeverri A. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an intermediate during RNA replication (24Roy P. Bishop D. J. Virol. 1970; 6: 604-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although protein 2C is highly conserved among picornaviruses, little sequence similarity between 2C and non-picornaviral proteins exists. Similarities are restricted to three small motifs, called “A,” “B,” and “C” (Fig. 1). Motifs A and B belong to the well known “Walker” NTP binding motifs that appear in a variety of ATP- and GTP-binding proteins with a broad range of functions (25Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V.

EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). Motif C has been found in members of the helicase superfamily III, the most prominent members being the DNA helicases SV40 large T antigen and papillomavirus protein E1 (28Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Motif C consists of an invariant Asn residue preceded by a stretch of moderately hydrophobic residues and is located downstream at a distinct distance from motif B (28Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The function of motif C is not known. ATPase (29Mirzayan C.M. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Rodrı́guez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8105-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GTPase (30Rodrı́guez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8105-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activities of protein 2C have been reported, whereas helicase activity was not detectable (30Rodrı́guez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8105-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the co-localization of protein 2C with the RC and its RNA binding activities, genetic evidence has implicated 2C in RNA replication. Millimolar concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) efficiently inhibit poliovirus replication at the level of RNA synthesis (31Rightsel W. Dice J. McAlpine R. Timm E. McLean I. Dixon G. Schabel F. Science. 1961; 134: 558-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Baltimore D. Franklin R. Eggers H. Tamm I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 49: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In an in vitro system that allowsde novo synthesis of poliovirus (33Molla A. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Science. 1991; 254: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), GdnHCl was reported to prevent the initiation of minus strand RNA synthesis (34Barton D.J. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8482-8489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Guanidine-resistant (gr) and -dependent (gd) mutants of poliovirus carry mutations in protein 2C indicating that GdnHCl inhibits RNA replication through an adverse effect on 2C (35Pincus S.E. Rohl H. Wimmer E. Virology. 1987; 157: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Pincus S.E. Diamond D.C. Emini E.A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 638-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Gmyl A.P. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1310-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because the mutations found in gr and gd mutants were located in the vicinity of motifs A, B, and C of the NTP-binding motif, GdnHCl was suspected to interfere with the NTP binding and/or hydrolysis activity (37Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Gmyl A.P. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1310-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, 2 mmGdnHCl did not appear to inhibit the NTPase activity of MBP-2C (30Rodrı́guez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8105-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or baculovirus-expressed 2C (29Mirzayan C.M. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutations directed to the coding region of 2C affected RNA replication of the mutant viruses. Mutation of conserved residues in motifs A and B resulted in quasi-infectious and lethal phenotypes (38Teterina N.L. Kean K.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. Girard M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Mirzayan C.M. Wimmer E. Virology. 1992; 189: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar phenotypes were obtained when mutations were introduced within a predicted amphipathic helical region near the amino terminus (40Paul A.V. Molla A. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Insertion of additional amino acid residues at positions 255 or 263, downstream of motif C yielded temperature-sensitive mutants that appeared to be defective in RNA replication at the non-permissive temperature (41Li J.P. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4016-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study lead to the discovery of a revertant virus, carrying two additional mutations in 2C and exhibiting an uncoating defect (42Li J.-P. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in 2C were discovered that resulted in a virus resistant to 5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)methylhydantoin, an antiviral drug that interferes with RNA encapsidation (43Vance L.M. Moscufo N. Chow M. Heinz B.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8759-8765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate a role for 2C in RNA replication and in subsequent RNA encapsidation. The multiple roles of 2C in virus replication are complex as they may depend on specific interactions not only with cellular membranes, but also with viral RNA, and with viral and cellular proteins. Oligomerization of 2C has been suggested based on complementation experiments with guanidine mutants (37Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Gmyl A.P. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1310-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A physical interaction of 2C with 2C, 2B, and 2BC has been demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid system and in a GST pull-down assay (44Cuconati A. Xiang W. Lahser F. Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein 2C has also been shown to be part of a detergent-resistant complex containing 2B and 2BC, as well as 3AB (the precursor of the genome-linked protein VPg) and capsid proteins (9Egger D. Pasamontes L. Bolten R. Boyko V. Bienz K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8675-8683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the simultaneous membrane and RNA binding activities, 2C and/or 2BC may contribute to the structural integrity of the RC (6Bienz K. Egger D. Pfister T. Troxler M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2740-2747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes I. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model has been substantiated by the observation that the association of the RC with the virus-induced membranes was weakened in the presence of GdnHCl in vivo(16Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes I. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ability of 2C to associate with membranes was not affected by GdnHCl in the absence of other viral proteins (20Echeverri A.C. Dasgupta A. Virology. 1995; 208: 540-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of the observations described above, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms by which protein 2C engages in virus replication. In particular, the NTPase activity has been only poorly characterized biochemically and its role in 2C functioning is not understood. In this study, the biochemical characterization of the NTPase activity of protein 2C has been addressed to better understand the functioning of this protein. We have purified soluble recombinant 2C fused to GST from E. coli lysate and characterized the NTPase activity of the protein. GST-2C hydrolyzed ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Other NTPs including GTP, were very poor substrates but competed with ATP at the NTP-binding site. We found that the ATPase activity required all three motifs A, B, and C. Moreover, the ATPase activity was found to be a target of the anti-poliovirus drug GdnHCl. The latter observation provides for the first time an explanation for the inhibitory activity of low concentrations (≤2 mm) of GdnHCl on poliovirus replication and that of many other picornaviruses by inference. The coding sequence of poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) 2C was amplified from plasmid pT7PVM (45Cao X. Kuhn R.J. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequence of the 5′ oligonucleotide was 5′-GGAATTCTAGAAGCGCTGTTCCAAGGTGACAGTTGGTTG-3′, and that of the 3′ oligo was 5′-GCGCAAGCTTACTATTGAAACAAAGCCTCCATAC-3′. The latter contained two stop codons that resulted in an authentic COOH terminus of the encoded protein. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and HinDIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pGEX-KG (46Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The plasmid was named pGEX-2C and propagated in E. coli DH5α. The 2C coding sequence was confirmed by sequencing (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Mutants pGEX-2C mA3 and mB4 were constructed by replacing the XhoI-MluI fragment in pGEX-2C with the XhoI-MluI fragment of pT7XL2C-M3 and pT7XL2C-M4, respectively (39Mirzayan C.M. Wimmer E. Virology. 1992; 189: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutants pGEX-2C mC1, mC2, and R111 were constructed by the mega-primer method (47Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutant oligonucleotides were 5′-GCATCCACAGACTCAAGCAG-3′ for mC1, 5′-GCATCCACAGGCTCAAGCAG-3′ for mC2, and 5′-GGTGCGGACCTCAAGCTGTTCTG-3′ for R111. Mutant pGEX-2C GR1 was constructed by replacing the XhoI-MluI fragment in pGEX-2C with the XhoI-MluI fragment of pT7PVMgr (48Duggal R. Cuconati A. Gromeier M. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13786-13791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutant pGEX-2C GD1 was generated by the mega-primer method using the mutant primer 5′-CTCAAGCAGAATGTCCCCCC-3′ with pGEX-2C GR1 as a template. All sequences derived from polymerase chain reaction were verified by sequencing.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pGEX-2C and its derivatives were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). A single colony was picked and grown in 250 ml of 2 × YT media (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C until OD600 was between 0.6 and 0.7. The culture was cooled to 20 °C and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and ampicillin were added to final concentrations of 0.1 mm and 100 mg/liter, respectively. The culture was kept shaking at 20 °C for 7–8 h. The pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C. After thawing at room temperature, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A (Boehringer-Mannheim)). Cells were lysed by two cycles in a French Press at a pressure of 15,000 psi for 40 s each. The lysate was solubilized in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min and subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. GST-2C was batch-immobilized on 125 μl (bed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in wash buffer I (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 45 min. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 12.5 ml of wash buffer I each and once with 12.5 ml of wash buffer II (wash buffer I containing 10 mm NaCl). GST-2C was eluted by incubating the Sepharose in 125 μl of elution buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.2, 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100) at 4 °C on a rotating device for 10 min. Elution was repeated three times: once for 10 min and twice for 1 h. Glycerol was added to the pooled eluates at a final concentration of 50%. Such GST-2C preparations were used in the experiments described below. Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Total protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Relative amounts of proteins were measured by laser scanning densitometry (Ultrascan XL, LKB, Bromma, Sweden) of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. GST-2C was identified by Western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against GST or 2C. Anti-2C antibodies were produced in our laboratory. 2Q. Liu and E. Wimmer, unpublished data. Anti-GST is commercially available from Pharmacia Biotech. ATPase reaction mixtures of 20 μl contained 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm cold ATP (Pharmacia Biotech), 10 μm [α-33P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA), and 0.67 μg of protein. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped on ice by the addition of 1 μl of 0.1 m EDTA. 2 μl of the reaction mixture were applied on polyethyleneimine cellulose-coated TLC plastic sheets (EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ). The chromatogram was developed in 0.75 m NaH2PO4, dried under an infrared lamp, and exposed to Biomax MR radiography film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). NTPase reaction mixtures of 60 μl contained 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 6.8, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of NTP, magnesium acetate, and protein as well as the reaction time and temperature varied among different experiments (cf. “Results” and figure legends). Reactions were stopped on ice and by the addition of 60 μl of ice-cold 16% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were left on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. This trichloroacetic acid precipitation step removed protein that otherwise may have precipitated in the subsequent color reaction rendering optical density measurements inaccurate. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) released during the NTPase reaction was measured by a colorimetric assay as described previously (50Noble S. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of the supernatant from the trichloroacetic acid-precipitation step was added to 100 μl of colorimetric reagent (3 volumes of 0.8% ammonium molybdate, 1 volume of 6 n sulfuric acid, 1 volume of 10% (w/v) ascorbic acid) in a microtiter plate on ice. The color reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30–40 min and subsequently measured in a microplate reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) at a wavelength of 630 nm. The measurements were blanked with NTPase reactions that were run in parallel and contained identical amounts of ingredients except that protein was replaced by an equal volume of 50% elution buffer in glycerol. Each microtiter plate included a dilution series of K2HPO4 that allowed quantitation of the amount of phosphate released in the NTPase reactions. Poliovirus 2C was expressed inE. coli as a fusion polypeptide containing GST at the amino-terminal (46Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of GST-2C was monitored on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2A). GST-2C was expressed to high yields and was reasonably soluble in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. GST-2C was batch purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The eluate contained two discrete bands that migrated with apparent molecular masses of 64 and 28 kDa presumably representing GST-2C and GST, respectively. Besides these strong bands, a few weak bands were visible as well. Western blot analysis revealed that the majority of protein bands that could be stained with India ink were recognized by anti-2C or anti-GST monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2B). The additional proteins present in the GST-2C preparation are therefore related to GST-2C, most likely resulting from proteolytic degradation of GST-2C or premature termination of translation. These phenomena have been observed earlier when 2C was expressed in E. coli (51Lama J. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15932-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or insect cells (29Mirzayan C.M. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A fast migrating band could not be stained with either antibody. The identity of this protein is unknown but could be a truncation of GST-2C that is devoid of the epitopes recognized by the antibodies. Laser scanning densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels showed that typically 55% of the total protein present in the eluate was full-length GST-2C (not shown). The GST band represented approximately 25% of total protein content. Our data do not exclude the presence of bacterial proteins in the GST-2C preparation, although all evidence suggests that the amount of such contaminants would be small. Incubation of GST-2C with ATP at 37 °C in the presence of buffer and magnesium acetate led to an increase in the concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi). This result indicated that GST-2C had ATPase activity. The release of phosphate was dependent on magnesium ions (Fig. 3A). A concentration of 2 mm magnesium acetate appeared to be optimal for ATP hydrolysis at an ATP concentration of 1 mm. ATP hydrolysis was also observed in the presence of manganese acetate, although less phosphate was released than in the presence of magnesium acetate (Fig. 3A). Zn2+ and Ca2+ did not serve as cofactors for the hydrolysis of ATP (not shown). The optimal pH for ATP hydrolysis was found to be 6.8 (Fig. 3B). NaCl, even at low concentrations, inhibited the hydrolysis of ATP (Fig. 3C). These initial experiments showed that the GST-2C preparation contained an ATPase activity that was strongest in the presence of magnesium as a cofactor, in the absence of salt, and at pH 6.8. It has been shown that poliovirus 2C catalyzes the reaction of ATP → ADP + Pi (29Mirzayan C.M. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Rodrı́guez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8105-8110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The colorimetric assay used does not distinguish between Pi and pyrophosphate (PPi). Therefore, we used α-labeled [33P]ATP as substrate and separated the products by TLC. As can be seen in Fig. 4, lane 4, the only product of GST-2C mediated ATP hydrolysis was [α-33P]ADP indicating that the unlabeled γ-phosphate has been cleaved off. [α-33P]ADP was not observed in a reaction containing no protein (lane 2) or GST that has been expressed and purified the same way as GST-2C (lane 3). Therefore, the co-purification of an E. coli ATPase is highly unlikely. This is strongly supported by the observation that mutations in the three conserved motifs A (lane 5), B (lane 6), and C (lanes 7 and 8) of 2C (for the precise definition of mutations see Table I) abolished ATP hydrolysis nearly completely. The same mutations also prevented the release of Pi as assessed by the colorimetric phosphate detection assay (Table II). Therefore, all three conserved motifs in 2C are involved in either binding of the NTP or its hydrolysis. These data provide the first evidence that motif C, the hallmark of superfamily III helicases (28Gorb"

In human plasma, PAF acetylhydrolase (EC 3.1.1.47) circulates in a complex with low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL).

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); HDL, high density lipoprotein(s); DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; apo, apolipoprotein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid is a phospholipid messenger synthesized by a variety of cells involved in host defense, such as endothelial cells, neutrophils, and monocytes (1Prescott S.M.

PAF is inactivated by hydrolysis of the sn-2 acetyl group, a reaction catalyzed by PAF acetylhydrolases (12Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The secreted form of PAF acetylhydrolase circulates in human plasma as a hydrophobic protein complexed with low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) (14Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4223-4230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to defining the physical state of PAF acetylhydrolase in the plasma compartment, the association of this enzyme with lipoproteins has important implications for catalysis. The association of the enzyme with LDL is a major determinant of its catalytic efficiency in vivo; when the substrate concentration is limiting, the LDL-associated activity accounts for virtually all of the PAF hydrolysis in plasma (16Stafforini D.M. Carter M.E. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2393-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of PAF acetylhydrolase to bind to LDL would be predicted to block the physiological function of the enzyme, even if its intrinsic catalytic activity remained intact. In addition, the association of PAF acetylhydrolase with lipoproteins allows this relatively hydrophobic enzyme to circulate in blood and gain unfettered access to sites of inflammation and cellular activation. Finally, it is possible that the lipoprotein lipids might facilitate access of hydrophobic lipid substrates to the active site of the enzyme, which may account for the efficiency of substrate hydrolysis when the enzyme is bound to lipoproteins. Therefore, identifying the factors that define PAF acetylhydrolase's association with lipoproteins is an important issue with clear cut physiologic consequences. In this study, we characterized the molecular basis for the interaction between PAF acetylhydrolase and LDL. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two domains of PAF acetylhydrolase that are important for its interaction with LDL. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the principal protein component of LDL, apolipoprotein (apo) B100, is important for the PAF acetylhydrolase–LDL interaction by analyzing the binding of PAF acetylhydrolase to lipoproteins containing truncated forms of human apoB. Our data indicate that the carboxyl terminus of human apoB100 plays a key role in the association of PAF acetylhydrolase with LDL. PAF(1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). A polyclonal antibody against PAF acetylhydrolase was prepared by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the purified recombinant protein (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). [acetyl- 3H]PAF was from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of various sites within PAF acetylhydrolase was performed as described (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The presence of the desired mutations or deletions was confirmed by automated analysis of DNA sequences. All mutants were expressed in a pUC vector to which the tryptophan promoter was added to allow expression of PAF acetylhydrolase in Escherichia coli (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The promoter was derepressed by depletion of tryptophan during overnight incubation at 37 °C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in buffer A (100 mm succinate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm CHAPS, pH 6.0), lysed by sonication, and allowed to incubate on ice for 60 min. The soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was discarded. Supernatant fluids were assayed for PAF acetylhydrolase activity as described below and subjected to immunoblot analysis (11Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase was detected with a polyclonal anti–PAF acetylhydrolase antiserum (diluted 1:2000) as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase–labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted 1:5000) from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). The blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human LDL were isolated from the plasma of healthy subjects by a single spin ultracentrifugation technique (15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous PAF acetylhydrolase activity in the LDL fraction was irreversibly inactivated by treatment with 5.0 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP, Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. The ability of mutant and wild-type PAF acetylhydrolase proteins to associate with LDL was assessed by incubating DFP-treated LDL (DFP-LDL) with 5 μg of solubilized extract from E. coli for 2 h at 37 °C. In control experiments, the amount of CHAPS carried over to the assay had no effect on the association of endogenous PAF acetylhydrolase activity with LDL or the ability of exogenously added PAF acetylhydrolase to bind to DFP-LDL. After the incubation, the mixtures of DFP-LDL and E. coli extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation, as above. The LDL fraction and the lipoprotein-free “bottom fraction” were collected and assayed for PAF acetylhydrolase activity by incubation with [acetyl- 3H]PAF and separation of the reaction products by reverse phase liquid chromatography, as described by Stafforini et al. (17Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 344-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A unit was defined as a μmol of substrate hydrolyzed per h at 37 °C. LDL binding was assessed by calculating the fractional area in the LDL peak with Matlab software. The generation and characterization of transgenic mice expressing the full-length human apoB100 have been reported (18Chiesa G. Johnson D.F. Yao Z. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Young S.G. Hammer R.H.

Transgenic mice expressing truncated versions of apoB (apoB80 (apo B amino acids 1–3619; Ref. 19Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin.

Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 703-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma from these mice was isolated and stored at 4 °C. Endogenous PAF acetylhydrolase in the plasma was inactivated with DFP (5.0 mm, 60 min at 37 °C). The samples then were dialyzed on Centricon 50 microconcentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and incubated with recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase or with 5 μg of a solubilized extract of E. coli that had been transformed with the wild-type PAF acetylhydrolase cDNA. Our initial studies were aimed at establishing the minimal segment of the PAF acetylhydrolase molecule required for specific binding to LDL. We tested several deletion constructs for their ability to associate with LDL in human plasma or with purified LDL fractions that had been pretreated with DFP to inhibit endogenous PAF acetylhydrolase activity. Deletion of up to 60 amino acids from the amino terminus and 21 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of PAF acetylhydrolase had no effect on the ability of these constructs to bind to LDL (>80% of the total activity was associated with LDL in both cases). Further deletions abolished enzymatic activity (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Therefore, we did not use the deletion approach to test other domains in the PAF acetylhydrolase molecule. Next, we systematically mutated all tyrosine residues in the PAF acetylhydrolase molecule to phenylalanines. Tyrosines were analyzed because they are important in the interaction of proteins with macromolecules in other systems (23Hortin G.L. Farries T.C. Graham J.P. Atkinson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 8: 1338-1342Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 440 was not analyzed because it lies within the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of the protein, which has no effect on LDL binding. Mutation of tyrosine residues 20, 26, 63, 84, 85, 103, 144, 160, 188, 189, 307, 321, 324, and 335 had no effect on enzymatic activity or immunoreactivity (data not shown). All but one of the tyrosine mutants bound to purified, DFP-treated human LDL in a manner similar to the wild-type protein (>75%). Mutant Y205F had decreased binding (59%, Fig. 1), suggesting that residue 205 might be important for the interaction. A mutant with alanine at this position (Y205A) did not bind to LDL (Fig. 1). To determine if other residues in the region are also important for the interaction, we generated alanine mutants of the six adjacent amino acid residues. Changing residues 202–204 and 206–208 to alanines had no effect on enzymatic activity or on the association with LDL (not shown). Therefore, a conformational change resulting from the replacement of tyrosine at position 205 with alanine is unlikely to account for altered binding to LDL. Tyrosine 205 is present in all species examined to date, including human, bovine, dog, chicken, and mouse (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). When we tested the ability of the dog and mouse recombinant PAF acetylhydrolases to bind human LDL, the dog protein associated with LDL in a normal fashion, but the mouse protein did not (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that tyrosine 205 is necessary but not sufficient for binding to LDL and that an additional region or regions are involved in the interaction of the enzyme with LDL. Next, we tested the possibility that histidine residues in PAF acetylhydrolase are important for binding to LDL. We previously observed that the association of this enzyme with LDL is dependent on pH and that its pH profile is consistent with the notion that a histidine residue plays a role in the process (15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All histidines (residues 7, 32, 74, 114, 152, 170, 179, 216, 241, 272, 367, 395, 399, and 428) were changed to alanines (except histidine 351, which is part of the catalytic triad in PAF acetylhydrolase (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)), and the resulting mutants were tested for binding to LDL. In general, mutation of histidines to alanines had no effect on the enzymatic activity of the recombinant products. However, changing histidine 272 to alanine abolished enzymatic activity. Histidine 272 is next to serine 273, which is part of a catalytic triad that is characteristic of lipases (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is not surprising that the H272A mutant expressed no enzymatic activity, because altering the conformation of the protein in this region would be likely to disrupt the three-dimensional structure near the active site. Western blot analysis of the histidine mutants showed expression of protein at levels corresponding to the activity in the samples (not shown). In LDL binding assays, all of the histidine mutants had normal binding except for H114A, which had altered binding to LDL (Fig. 3). Replacement of histidine 114 with glutamate or glutamine also abolished binding to LDL (Fig. 3), suggesting that the effect was independent of charge. Further analysis indicated that a residue or residues important for binding to LDL exist near histidine 114, and several findings suggest that histidine 114 is not directly involved. First, a deletion mutant lacking histidine 114 was enzymatically active and bound normally to LDL (Fig. 3). Second, the dog homolog, which has a proline at position 114, also bound normally to LDL (Fig. 2). Third, the mouse PAF acetylhydrolase protein, which has a proline residue at position 113 (equivalent to histidine 114 in the human molecule), did not associate with human LDL (Fig. 2B); however, mutation of proline 113 in the mouse sequence to histidine did not result in binding (Fig. 3). Thus, while histidine 114 in human PAF acetylhydrolase is near a region that is important for binding, it is not required for the association with LDL. To identify the residue or residues near histidine 114 that are key for binding of PAF acetylhydrolase to LDL, we mutated the neighboring residues to alanines and expressed the mutant constructs in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were expressed at levels comparable with those of the wild-type construct (Fig. 4A). Mutation of residues on the amino-terminal side of histidine 114 had little effect on binding (Fig. 4). In contrast, replacement of tryptophan 115, leucine 116, and methionine 117 with alanine altered the association with LDL (Fig. 4B). Mutation of tryptophan 115 had the greatest effect, but changing leucine 116 and methionine 117 also altered binding. We next generated additional constructs in which tryptophan 115, leucine 116, and methionine 117 were individually deleted (Fig. 4C). We found that these deletion mutants retained expression of enzymatic activity, but binding to LDL was severely reduced (Fig. 4C). Thus, in contrast to histidine 114 (Fig. 3), the deletion of tryptophan 115, leucine 116, and, to a lesser extent, methionine 117 resulted in molecules that lacked the ability to associate with LDL, indicating that these residues are necessary for binding to the lipoprotein. The role played by tryptophan 115 and leucine 116 in the binding of PAF acetylhydrolase to LDL was confirmed in the following experiment. We made use of the fact that the primary sequence of the mouse PAF acetylhydrolase in the region of residues 114–117 is quite different from the human sequence (Fig. 5). We systematically mutated the residues in the mouse PAF acetylhydrolase to mimic the domain present in the human molecule. As the homology in this region was increased to match that of the human PAF acetylhydrolase, binding to LDL was restored (Fig. 5). Changing proline 113 to histidine did not significantly affect binding (1% for the wild-typeversus 7.5% for the P113H mutant). Replacing proline 113 and serine 114 to histidine and tryptophan, respectively, increased binding to LDL to 40.9%. When proline 113, serine 114, and isoleucine 115 of the mouse enzyme were converted to histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, respectively, binding to LDL increased to 64.4%. Notably, the dog PAF acetylhydrolase (which binds to human LDL) is identical to human PAF acetylhydrolase in this region. Thus, site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses showed that residues 115 and 116 are critical for binding of PAF acetylhydrolase to LDL. Moreover, the introduction of these residues into the mouse sequence yielded an enzyme that was capable of binding to LDL (unlike the wild-type mouse enzyme). Methionine 117 was not essential for binding to LDL (Fig. 5). The full-length PAF acetylhydrolase cDNA encodes eight cysteines (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but the mature form of the enzyme is predicted to contain only five cysteines (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol.

Therefore, the mature protein is likely to contain at least one unpaired sulfhydryl group, which might be involved in binding to LDL. In addition, PAF acetylhydrolase has been reported to have lower affinity for LDL than for lipoprotein(a) (24Blencowe C. Hermetter A. Kostner G.M. Deigner H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31151-31157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which differs from LDL by the covalent attachment of apo(a), a glycoprotein that is highly homologous to plasminogen (25Utermann G. Science. 1989; 246: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Apo(a) associates with apoB by a disulfide bond (26Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sommer A. Gorges R. Kostner G.M. Paltauf F. Hermetter A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11245-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that PAF acetylhydrolase and LDL interact through a disulfide bond, we tested the effect of reducing agents on the distribution of PAF acetylhydrolase in lipoproteins. Relatively high concentrations of dithiothreitol (1, 5, and 10 mm) had no effect on enzymatic activity or association with LDL (not shown). The failure of dithiothreitol to dissociate PAF acetylhydrolase and LDL makes it very unlikely that their interaction depends on a disulfide bond. However, to further explore this issue, we generated five mutants in which the cysteine residues were converted to serines. Cysteine residues 11, 13, and 15 were not examined, because they lie within a region of the amino terminus shown by the deletion studies to be unimportant for binding to LDL. We tested the ability of C67S, C229S, C291S, C334S, and C407S to bind LDL. The mutants retained enzymatic activity and associated with LDL in a manner identical to that of the wild-type construct (data not shown). There is some evidence that apoB100 is the protein component that mediates the binding of PAF acetylhydrolase to LDL. First, our early studies on the purification of PAF acetylhydrolase showed that a carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoB100 (including residues 4119–4536) co-purified with PAF acetylhydrolase through numerous purification steps, strongly suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal portion of apoB100 and PAF acetylhydrolase interact with each other (28Yamada Y. Stafforini D.M. Imaizumi T. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10320-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Second, apoB100 is the major protein component of LDL. Third, in human subjects who are deficient in apoB100, PAF acetylhydrolase associates entirely with HDL (16Stafforini D.M. Carter M.E. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2393-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine which domains in apoB100 are involved in the interaction of LDL with PAF acetylhydrolase, we analyzed plasma from transgenic mice expressing human apoB100, apoB90, or apoB80. The endogenous mouse PAF acetylhydrolase associated exclusively with HDL in wild-type mouse plasma. Wild-type mouse plasma contains very low levels of LDL (29Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the “HDL distribution” of mouse PAF acetylhydrolase was also observed with plasma samples from all of the human apoB transgenic mice (which have high levels of LDL), indicating that the endogenous PAF acetylhydrolase does not bind to LDL particles containing either full-length human apoB100 or the truncated human apoB proteins. This result is consistent with our in vitro studies on the association of mouse PAF acetylhydrolase with human LDL (Fig. 2). To evaluate binding of human PAF acetylhydrolase to LDL produced by transgenic mice, we inactivated the endogenous, HDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase activity in the plasma samples by pretreatment with DFP. The pretreated plasma samples were then combined with purified recombinant human PAF acetylhydrolase or with solubilized extracts from bacteria overexpressing the human enzyme. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the lipoproteins were fractionated by ultracentrifugation, and each fraction was assayed for enzymatic activity. Human plasma pretreated with DFP served as the control source of acceptor lipid particles. When plasma derived from transgenic mice overexpressing human apoB100 was used as the acceptor, PAF acetylhydrolase associated with LDL and HDL (Fig. 6B) in a manner virtually identical to that observed with human plasma (Fig. 6A). In contrast, when samples from control mice (not shown) or mice expressing human apoB90 or human apoB80 were used as the source of lipoprotein acceptor particles, PAF acetylhydrolase associated exclusively with HDL (Fig. 6, C and D, respectively). Identical results were obtained when the plasma lipoproteins were separated by chromatography on Superose 6 columns (not shown). These results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal portion of apoB100 is required for binding of PAF acetylhydrolase to LDL. This study demonstrates that the interaction between human PAF acetylhydrolase and human LDL is likely to involve protein–protein interactions between specific residues in the plasma PAF acetylhydrolase molecule and residues in apoB100, the principal apolipoprotein of LDL. Mutation of tyrosine 205, which is completely conserved among species (22Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), abolished binding to LDL. None of the other tyrosine residues seem to be required for binding, because replacing them with alanines did not affect the ability of the recombinant proteins to associate with LDL. The fact that mutating residues near tyrosine 205 did not affect binding to LDL suggests that the effect observed is specific to tyrosine 205 and not simply a consequence of conformational changes in that region of the PAF acetylhydrolase molecule. It is also possible that tyrosine 205 interacts with a distal site within PAF acetylhydrolase, inducing or stabilizing a conformation necessary for binding to LDL. The inability of mouse PAF acetylhydrolase to bind human LDL despite the presence of tyrosine 205 is supportive of this possibility. Several findings suggest that a region centered on tryptophan 115 and leucine 116 is also involved in the interaction between PAF acetylhydrolase and LDL. First, replacement of these residues with alanines abolished binding to LDL. Second, deletion of these residues also prevented association with the lipoprotein. Third, introduction of these residues into the wild-type mouse PAF acetylhydrolase (which normally does not associate with LDL) resulted in a mutant mouse enzyme that bound to LDL almost as efficiently as the wild-type human enzyme. The observation that tyrosine 205 as well as tryptophan 115 and leucine 116 are necessary for binding to LDL suggests that these two domains might have adjacent locations within the three-dimensional structure of the plasma form of PAF acetylhydrolase. However, an x-ray crystallographic analysis of secreted PAF acetylhydrolase is not yet available, and there is no homology of these domains to other PAF acetylhydrolases or lipases whose three-dimensional structure is known (30Wei Y. Swenson L. Castro C. Derewenda U. Minor W. Arai H. Aoki J. Inoue K. Servin-Gonzalez L. Derewenda Z.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Derewenda Z.S. Derewenda U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our findings also suggest that the carboxyl terminus of human apoB100 is involved in binding to PAF acetylhydrolase. ApoB90 and apoB80 lacked the ability to bind to PAF acetylhydrolase, consistent with participation of the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 in the interaction with the enzyme. Our results, however, do not completely exclude the possibility that the structural features for the interaction with PAF acetylhydrolase are present within apoB80 and apoB90 but are not in the proper conformation for the interaction. For example, altered composition of apoB90-containing lipoproteins might change the conformation on the surface of the lipoprotein, affecting its ability to interact with PAF acetylhydrolase. However, additional evidence suggests that the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 and PAF acetylhydrolase interact directly (i.e. without the involvement of lipid components). In our early studies on the purification of PAF acetylhydrolase, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoB100 (including apoB100 residues 4119–4536) co-purified with PAF acetylhydrolase, suggesting that a tight interaction exists between the enzyme and this domain of apoB100 (28Yamada Y. Stafforini D.M. Imaizumi T. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10320-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Also, we have very recently analyzed the ability of PAF acetylhydrolase to bind to mutant human LDL particles (isolated from the plasma of transgenic mice) in which amino acids 4279–4536 of the human apoB100 sequence were replaced by the corresponding sequences from mouse apoB100. Interestingly, the mutant LDL containing the human–mouse hybrid apoB bound to PAF acetylhydrolase normally, suggesting that apoB100 residues 4279–4536 may not be critical for the interaction between PAF acetylhydrolase and human apoB100. 2D. Stafforini, unpublished observations. These results, taken together with our earlier studies (28Yamada Y. Stafforini D.M. Imaizumi T. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10320-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the current studies on human apoB90 and human apoB80, suggest the possibility that human apoB100 amino acids 4119–4279 could be important for binding to PAF acetylhydrolase. That possibility will be tested in future studies. It is interesting that mice, which have very low plasma concentrations of LDL, also synthesize a PAF acetylhydrolase that is intrinsically defective in its ability to bind to LDL. It is tempting to speculate that these two features (low LDL levels and a “nonbinding” PAF acetylhydrolase) may have arisen together during mammalian evolution; it seems possible that the extremely low levels of LDL in mouse plasma may have obviated any selective pressure to have a PAF acetylhydrolase that binds to apoB100. In any case, the nonbinding mouse PAF acetylhydrolase has provided us with a useful experimental tool, the ability to analyze the binding of human PAF acetylhydrolase to human apoB proteins without having to worry about interference from the endogenous mouse protein. In humans, LDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase plays a key role in the clearance of PAF and PAF analogs from the plasma, while the HDL-associated enzyme is less important (15Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, the absence of LDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase activity appears to be compensated for by the HDL-associated enzyme; this could explain why the total serum PAF acetylhydrolase activity is approximately 5 times higher in mice than in humans (32Tsaoussis V. Vakirtzi-Lemonias C. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 301-315PubMed Google Scholar). We are indebted to Dr. Guy A. Zimmerman for insightful comments and critical review of this manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W1999916629,"Abstract Serum amyloid A isoforms, apoSAA1 and apoSAA2, are apolipoproteins of unknown function that become major components of high density lipoprotein (HDL) during the acute phase of an inflammatory response. ApoSAA is also the precursor of inflammation-associated amyloid, and there is strong evidence that the formation of inflammation-associated and other types of amyloid is promoted by heparan sulfate (HS). Data presented herein demonstrate that both mouse and human apoSAA contain binding sites that are specific for heparin and HS, with no binding for the other major glycosaminoglycans detected. Cyanogen bromide-generated peptides of mouse apoSAA1 and apoSAA2 were screened for heparin binding activity. Two peptides, an apoSAA1-derived 80-mer (residues 24–103) and a smaller carboxyl-terminal 27-mer peptide of apoSAA2 (residues 77–103), were retained by a heparin column. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the CNBr-generated 27-mer also bound heparin, and by substituting or deleting one or more of its six basic residues (Arg-83, His-84, Arg-86, Lys-89, Arg-95, and Lys-102), their relative importance for heparin and HS binding was determined. The Lys-102 residue appeared to be required only for HS binding. The residues Arg-86, Lys-89, Arg-95, and Lys-102 are phylogenetically conserved suggesting that the heparin/HS binding activity may be an important aspect of the function of apoSAA. HS linked by its carboxyl groups to an Affi-Gel column or treated with carbodiimide to block its carboxyl groups lost the ability to bind apoSAA. HDL-apoSAA did not bind to heparin; however, it did bind to HS, an interaction to which apoA-I contributed. Results from binding experiments with Congo Red-Sepharose 4B columns support the conclusions of a recent structural study which found that heparin binding domains have a common spatial distance of about 20 A between their two outer basic residues. Our present work provides direct evidence that apoSAA can associate with HS (and heparin) and that the occupation of its binding site by HS, and HS analogs, likely caused the previously reported increase in amyloidogenic conformation (β-sheet) of apoSAA2 (McCubbin, W. D., Kay, C. M., Narindrasorasak, S., and Kisilevsky, R. (1988) Biochem. J. 256, 775–783) and their amyloid-suppressing effects in vivo (Kisilevsky, R., Lemieux, L. J., Fraser, P. E., Kong, X., Hultin, P. G., and Szarek, W. A. (1995) Nat. Med. 1, 143–147), respectively."

Below a free Ca2+concentration of 0.2 μm, no Ca2+-calmodulin is detectable.

Knowledge of the physiological free concentrations of (Ca2+)4-CaM is crucial if we are to evaluate whether a putative target activity may be regulated by CaM in the cell. In this study we have investigated the global relationship between the concentrations of free Ca2+ and (Ca2+)4-CaM in intact cells using stably expressed indicator proteins. Indicators were expressed under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer using the pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA6 vectors supplied by InvitroGen (Carslbad, CA). HEK-293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg. MD). Mixed-clonal populations of stably transfected cells used in experiments were grown under drug selection (G418 or Zeocin) for at least 6 weeks. The CaM-binding sequences in the indicators are altered versions of the avian smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase sequence: R1RKWQKTGHA10VRAIGRL (17Guerriero Jr., V. Russo M.A. Olson N.J. Putkey J.A. Means A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8372-8381Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). According to this numbering scheme, the sequences in the indicators have the following changes: FIP-CBSM-38 and FIP-CA37, R1Q, R2Q; FIP-CBSM-39, R12Q, R16Q; and FIP-CBSM-41, R2Q. In vitro cooperativity coefficients and K d values for the indicators were determined in buffered saline as described previously (18Persechini A. Lynch J.A. Romoser V.A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Values for the Ca2+ indicator were also determined in cells; the lack of a reliable buffering system for CaM precluded doing this with the CaM indicators. Indicator responses were monitored in individual cells using a standard microscope photometry system with dual photomultiplier tubes (Photon Technology Int., Monmouth Junction, NJ). The emitted light from single cells was isolated using an adjustable diaphragm, and emission intensities were determined by photon counting using 200 msec integration times. Excitation light at 430 nm was supplied by a monochromator. A 455DCLP microscope dichroic was used, and emitted light was distributed to the two photomultipliers using a 510DCLP dichroic cube fitted with D535/25 and D480/40 bandpass filters. Dichroics and filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies (Brattleboro, VT). All measurements were made in cells expressing n5 μm indicator as assessed by comparing the fluorescence intensities of cells with the intensities of indicator standards. Cells were incubated in a buffered saline solution containing 141 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and added CaCl2 and/or Ca2+-chelators as indicated. Free (Ca2+)4-CaM and Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from indicator emission ratios using an equation of the form, [L]free=Kd′(R−RminRmax−R)1/n(Eq. 1) where L is Ca2+ or (Ca2+)4-CaM, Kd′is the ligand concentration when the emission ratio (R) is midway between its maximum (Rmax) and minimum (Rmin) possible values and n is the cooperativity coefficient for the response.Kd′ is related to the true titration midpoint (K d) according to the following equation, Kd′=Kdsf,2sb,21/n(Eq. 2) where sf,2 and sb,2 are the indicator emission intensities at 535 nm when ligand-free or ligand-saturated, respectively. The sf,2/sb,2 value is 1.8 for FIP-CBs and 1.5 for FIP-CAs. The indicator proteins used in this study are similar to those we have described previously (18Persechini A. Lynch J.A. Romoser V.A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The main difference is in the green fluorescent protein variants used to generate ligand-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which have been replaced by the ECFP and EYFP variants described by Miyawaki et al. (20Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). The advantages of these are that FRET can be monitored as the 480/535 emission ratio, and the ECFP donor fluorophore can be excited at a longer wavelength of 430 nm. To estimate physiological (Ca2+)4-CaM values, we have made measurements in cells expressing indicators with different affinities, which were generated by varying the CaM-binding linker sequence between the GFP variants. The Ca2+-indicator protein used in some experiments is similar to the CaM indicators, but incorporation of the complete amino acid sequence of CaM renders it directly responsive to changes in the free Ca2+concentration (18Persechini A. Lynch J.A. Romoser V.A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were produced that express one of three different CaM indicators, FIP-CBSM-41(K d = 2 nm), FIP-CBSM-38(K d = 45 nm), and FIP-CBSM-39 (K d = 400 nm), or the Ca2+ indicator, FIP-CA37(K d = 0.6 μm). The CaM indicators are freely distributed but FIP-CA37 is confined to the cytoplasm, probably because of its higher molecular weight (data not shown). The morphology and growth kinetics are similar for control and indicator-expressing HEK-293 cells. To determine Rmax, the 480/535 emission ratio for fully liganded indicator, in cells expressing the CaM indicators, the cells were permeabilized with 50 μm β-escin, followed by addition of 10 μm CaM, which diffuses into the cells producing the maximum possible indicator response. The indicator response is specific to Ca2+-liganded CaM and is reversed by a high-affinity CaM-binding peptide (Fig. 1A). To determineRperm, the emission ratio corresponding to the free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration produced at a saturating free Ca2+ concentration, cells were permeabilized with 15 μg/ml α-toxin (α-hemolysin) in a buffered saline solution containing 1.3 mm added CaCl2(Fig. 1B). There is no loss of indicator fluorescence from α-toxin permeabilized cells, and addition of 20 μm CaM or 50 μm CaM-binding peptide has no effect on the indicator response, demonstrating that the cells are not permeable to proteins or even small peptides. Indicator emission ratios identical toRperm are produced in cells incubated with 5 μm ionomycin and 5 mm CaCl2. Because the FIP-CA37 response is CaM-independent,Rperm is equivalent toRmax, and we refer only to the latter value (Fig. 1B). To determine Rmin, the emission ratio for ligand-free indicator, cells were permeabilized with α-toxin in 3 mm BAPTA (Fig. 1B). Indicator emission ratios identical to Rmin are observed in intact resting cells.Rmax/Rmin values are consistently 2 for the CaM indicators and 1.6 for the Ca2+indicator. This difference is because of a higherRmin value for the Ca2+ indicator (Fig. 1B), which is expected based on a comparison of the in vitro emission spectra for the two types of indicator (data not shown). The free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations produced in cells expressing each CaM indicator were calculated fromRperm values as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A value of 2.3 ± 0.5 nm was determined for cells expressing FIPCBSM-41, and values of 23 ± 2 nm and 45 ± 4 nm were determined for cells expressing FIP-CBSM-38 and FIP-CBSM-39. A plot of these values versus the apparentK d values for the corresponding indicators suggests that the physiological global maximum free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration is ∼45 nm (Fig. 1B, inset). We have found that Rperm corresponds to only 60% of the full indicator response in cells expressing FIP-CBSM-41, which has a 2 nm K d value, and is significantly less than this in cells expressing the lower-affinity indicators (Fig. 1B). If we assume that the native CaM-binding proteins in the cell have K d values for (Ca2+)4-CaM that are ≥2 nm, this observation suggests that on a molar basis CaM-binding proteins outnumber CaM by a factor of ∼2. To define the relationship between the intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+ and (Ca2+)4-CaM in greater detail, we used dibromo-BAPTA to control the free Ca2+ concentration in α-toxin permeabilized cells (21Bers D. Patton C. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Effective control of intracellular free Ca2+ is demonstrated by the FIP-CA37 responses in cells incubated at different calculated free Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2A). A cooperativity coefficient of 1.7 and an apparent K d value of 0.9 μm were derived from these data; respective in vitro values obtained with the same Ca2+ buffering system are 1.8 and 0.6 μm. The FIP-CBSM-41 or FIP-CBSM-38 responses and corresponding free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations are presented in Fig. 2, B and C, respectively. Data for the two indictors are fit by binding curves with cooperativity coefficients of 2.6 and apparent K d values of 1 and 1.1 μm, respectively. Because these indicators bind (Ca2+)4-CaM, not Ca2+, the apparentK d values are actually the free concentrations of Ca2+ producing half-maximal free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations. Despite the 20-fold difference in the affinities of the two indicators, the apparentK d values determined in cells expressing them are similar, which points to a physiological value of ∼1 μmfor this parameter (Fig. 2C). Based on the observation that Ca2+ is bound more tightly to the C-terminal EF hand pair in CaM than to the N-terminal pair, it has been proposed that CaM targets might be associated with (Ca2+)2-CaM at resting free Ca2+concentrations (22Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Binding of a tryptic fragment of CaM containing only the C-terminal EF hand pair produces about half the maximal indicator response in vitro seen with intact CaM (data not shown). Hence, if there were significant levels of indicator complexes involving just the C-terminal EF hand pair of CaM in resting cells, they would have been detected. To investigate the relationship between the free concentrations of Ca2+ and (Ca2+)4-CaM under more physiological conditions, we stably expressed FIP-CBSM-38or FIP-CA37 in HEK-293 cell line expressing the receptor for thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which exhibits reproducible transients in intracellular free Ca2+ in response to this agonist (19Romoser V.A. Hinkle P.M. Persechini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13270-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 23Shupnik M.A. Weck J. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 90-99PubMed Google Scholar). We determined time courses for the concentrations of free Ca2+ and free (Ca2+)4-CaM produced after addition of TRH (Fig. 3B), and combined the time-aligned transients to produce the relationship in Fig. 3A. The cooperativity coefficient and apparentK d values derived from these data are 2.7 and 0.9 μm, essentially identical to the values derived from data measured in α-toxin-permeabilized cells expressing the CaM indicator. The maximum free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration of 16 nm is slightly less than the value determined in permeabilized cells. This may reflect a lack of spatial alignment in the indicator signals, because FIP-CA37 is cytoplasmic and FIP-CBSM-38 is freely distributed in the cell. These studies represent the first quantitative evaluations of the relationship between the concentrations of free Ca2+ and (Ca2+)4-CaM in cells. We find that no detectable Ca2+-liganded CaM is produced in the cell below a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.2 μm. A maximum free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration of ∼45 nm is produced at a free Ca2+ concentration of 3 μm, and a half-maximal concentration is produced when the free Ca2+ concentration is 1 μm. The total concentration of CaM-binding sites appears to exceed the total concentration of CaM by a factor of ∼2, consistent with investigations of the mobility of labeled CaM that suggest its concentration in the cell is matched or exceeded by the concentration of CaM-binding sites (24Gough A.H. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given a total CaM concentration of ∼10 μm (25Tansey M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kakiuchi S. Yasuda S. Yamazaki R. Teshima Y. Kanda K. Kakiuchi R. Sobue K. J.

Cell. 1982; 28: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), only a minute fraction of the (Ca2+)4-CaM produced is free in the cell. This underscores the importance of directly determining the free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration, as it clearly cannot be deduced from the total CaM concentration. The free Ca2+concentration producing a half-maximal free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentration in the cell is 20-fold less than the concentration required to half-saturate pure CaMin vitro (28Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Ohashi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32217-32225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that thermodynamic coupling between Ca2+ and target binding in CaM-target complexes is of crucial importance in the cell as it keeps free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations low and shifts their dependence on free Ca2+ into the physiological concentration range (29Mamar-Bachi A. Cox J.A. Cell Calcium. 1987; 8: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Olwin B.B. Edelman A.M. Krebs E.G. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, our results suggest that, if resting global intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations are maintained below 0.2 μm little or no global activation of CaM targets should occur. Our observations indicate that high-affinity calmodulin targets (K d ≤ 10 nm) are efficiently activated throughout the cell, but efficient activation of low-affinity targets (K d ≥ 100 nm) occurs only where free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations can be locally enhanced. Interestingly, most low-affinity CaM targets that have been identified are permanently or transiently associated with the plasma membrane, including the CaM-dependent adenylate cyclases (15Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Xia Z. Storm D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that there are at least two mechanisms that could produce a local enhancement in the free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations in this region: 1) diffusional recruitment of CaM because of local increases in free Ca2+, and 2) concentration of CaM by plasma membrane-associated CaM-binding proteins like neuromodulin or neurogranin, which have been proposed to function as CaM sinks (33Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26698-26705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22420-22426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that store-operated Ca2+entry, which appears to produce local elevations in the free Ca2+ concentration at the plasma membrane, is necessary to activate expressed CaM-dependent adenylate cyclase activities in HEK-293 cells, consistent with a requirement for diffusional recruitment of CaM (36Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K. Gonzales E. Guillou J.L. Cooper D.M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). And CaM-dependent cyclases in neurons are associated with neurogranin and/or neuromodulin, implying that the putative CaM sink proteins may help to produce the free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations needed to activate cyclase activity (15Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Mons N. Harry A. Dubourg P. Premont R.T. Iyengar R. Cooper D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mechanisms similar to these may operate in other regions of the cell. For example, Deisserothet al. (40Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) have recently reported that translocation of CaM into the nucleus correlates with Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of CREB in hippocampal neurons, suggesting that enhanced free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations may be required to activate a necessary protein kinase activity in the nucleus. Our observations suggest that spatial variations in the free (Ca2+)4-CaM concentrations that can be produced in different regions of the cell may play an important role in shaping the functional response to a Ca2+-mediated signal. We acknowledge Dr. Shey-Shing Sheu, in our department, for generously allowing us the use of his microscope photometry system for this study, and Dr. Margaret Shupnick (University of Virginia), for supplying the HEK-293 cell line stably expressing the receptor for thyrotropin releasing hormone."

Here we report a detailed study of the kinetics of base pair breathing in tracts of GC base pairs in DNA duplexes derived from 1H NMR measurements of the imino proton exchange rates upon titration with the exchange catalyst ammonia. In the limit of infinite exchange catalyst concentration, the exchange times of the guanine imino protons of the GC tracts extrapolate to much shorter base pair lifetimes than commonly observed for isolated GC base pairs. The base pair lifetimes in the GC tracts are below 5 ms for almost all of the base pairs. The unusually rapid base pair opening dynamics of GC tracts are in striking contrast to the behavior of AT tracts, where very long base pair lifetimes are observed. The implication of these findings for the structural principles governing spontaneous helix opening as well as the DNA-binding specificity of the cytosine-5-methyltransferases, where flipping of the cytosine base has been observed, are discussed.

The implication of these findings for the structural principles governing spontaneous helix opening as well as the DNA-binding specificity of the cytosine-5-methyltransferases, where flipping of the cytosine base has been observed, are discussed. Many DNA-binding proteins are highly selective in their recognition of particular DNA sequences. Besides sequence-specific hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, sequence-dependent structure and dynamics of DNA are likely to play an important role in DNA-protein interaction. In addition, the adaptability of a DNA sequence element to structural changes necessary for sequence-specific interaction is important in recognition (1Steitz T.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 205-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Base pair opening is required in many fundamental processes in the cell, for example, transcription and recombination. Recently, base pair opening was found to participate in a novel mode of protein-DNA interaction. The crystal structures of the M.HhaI 1The abbreviations used are: M.HhaI, M.HaeIII, and M.EcoRI, methyltranferases; 5mC, 5-methylcytosine; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; PNA, peptide nucleic acid and M.HaeIII cytosine-5-methyltransferases in complex with their DNA recognition sequences showed the target base completely flipped out from the helix (2Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 3Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Cytosine-5-methyltransferases usually recognize a sequence of four GC base pairs (4Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). M.HhaI and M.HaeIII recognize 5′-GCGC-3′ and 5′-GGCC-3′, respectively. A pertinent question is whether these enzymes actively expel the target base from the helix stack or capture a transient spontaneous opening. It has been shown that M.HhaI binds more tightly when a mismatch is created in the recognition sequence by replacing the target cytosine by any other base or an abasic site but not 5mC (5Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Yang A.S. Shen J.C. Zingg J.M. Mi S. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The enhanced binding was attributed to the lower energy required for opening a mismatched base pair upon formation of the binary complex. Hence, the base pair dynamics at the cytosine target site seems to contribute to the specificity of the cytosine-5-methyltransferases. These findings prompted us to investigate the base pair dynamics of tracts of GC base pairs. Measurements of base pair dynamics yield information about stability and structure of the double helix. Furthermore, studies of base pair opening in DNA interacting with drugs (7Leroy J.L. Gao X.L. Guéron M. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Leroy J.L. Gao X.L. Misra V. Guéron M. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and hybridized with uncharged PNA (peptide nucleic acids) (9Leijon M. Sehlstedt U. Nielsen P.E. Gräslund A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 438-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have provided new clues to the mechanisms of spontaneous helix breathing. Another important finding is that tracts of AT base pairs exhibit anomalously long base pair lifetimes. Although the origin of this effect is uncertain, it seems likely that AT tracts form a particularly stable structure cooperatively, a so-called B′-DNA helix (10Nelson H.C. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Hence, increased base pair lifetimes are indicative of this type of structure. In general AT base pair lifetimes have been found to be in the range 1–5 ms at 15 °C, except for AT tracts where lifetimes longer than 100 ms have been observed (11Leroy J.L. Charretier E. Kochoyan M. Guéron M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For GC base pairs, lifetimes about 10 times longer than for AT base pairs usually have been observed (12Guéron M. Leroy J.L. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 6. Springer Verlag, Berlin1992: 1-22Google Scholar), as one might expect from the presence of an additional hydrogen bond in the GC base pair. However, most studies have concerned isolated GC base pairs (9Leijon M. Sehlstedt U. Nielsen P.E. Gräslund A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 438-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Leroy J.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), one would not expect base pair dynamics to contribute to the specificity of the cytosine-5-methyltransferases in view of the hitherto observed higher stability of GC base pairs. However, in the present study it is shown that tracts of GC base pair have unusually rapid base pair dynamics contrary to isolated GC base pairs and in striking contrast to AT tracts. All oligonucleotides were either synthesized by using automated phosphoramidite chemistry on a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 394) or purchased from Cybergene Inc. (Sweden). The oligonucleotides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and desalted by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography. The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the oligonucleotides in a 3 mm borate buffer at pH 8.8 containing 100 mmNaCl (90% H2O and 10% D2O). The duplex concentrations were in the range 1.1–1.8 mm. Ammonia was added in appropriate amounts from a 6.6 m stock solution at pH 8.8. Two separate titrations were carried out for each duplex and the exchange-time (τex) data were combined and linearly fitversus the inverse base-concentration (1/[B]) via Equation1 (13Guéron M. Leroy J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). τex=τop+1αKdki[B](Eq. 1) τop is the base pair lifetime, α is an accessibility parameter, K d is the dissociation constant for the base pair, and ki is the proton transfer rate from the mononucleoside, taken to be 2 × 108 s−1m−1 at 15 °C (17Guéron M. Charretier E. Hagerhorst J. Kochoyan M. Leroy J.L. Moraillon A. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure and Methods. 3. Adenine Press, Guilderland, NY1990: 113-137Google Scholar). The base pairs of the duplexes are numbered according to Scheme 1, where the dodecamer numbering is shown on top and the decamer numbering on the bottom. Symmetry-related base pairs are denoted byunderlined numbers. The duplexes are referred to by their Roman numerals. The imino protons were assigned from sequential imino-imino connectivities in two-dimensional NOESY experiments in H2O solution (18Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Dijkstra K. Kaptein R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 62: 378-386Google Scholar) using either the WATERGATE (19Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol.

Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) observe pulse for water suppression. The experiments were performed with a mixing time of 200–250 ms at 5–15 °C. Inversion recovery experiments were performed using a 0.633-ms Gaussian (21Bauer C. Freeman R. Frenkiel T. Keeler J. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 442-457Google Scholar) or a 1-ms iBURP (22Geen H. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 93: 93-141Google Scholar) pulse for inversion followed by a variable delay and a 1-ms Gaussian observe pulse. Right shift and linear prediction of the free induction decay were employed to correct for magnetization evolution during the observe pulse. The spectral width varied between 1500 and 2000 Hz, depending on the NMR spectrometer (500 or 600 MHz) used. The carrier frequency was centered in the imino proton region. The exchange time at a particular base concentration [B], τex[B], was obtained from the recovery time Trec[B] as described (9Leijon M. Sehlstedt U. Nielsen P.E. Gräslund A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 438-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Guéron M. Leroy J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Saturation transfer experiments utilized a rapid removal of the water magnetization by a 1–1.2-ms Gaussian 90°-pulse followed by a pulsed field gradient. This was repeated in a loop 1–10 times. In each loop element the gradient strength and length was randomly varied with 10% around 10 Gauss/cm and 1 ms, respectively, yielding an effective solvent suppression without refocusing effects. Each loop contained a 1-ms gradient recovery delay. The initial loop was followed by a presaturation period of variable length and finally a jump-return observe pulse. 2M. Leijon, manuscript in preparation. The decay of the imino proton resonances was fitted to a single exponential function to yield the exchange time and the magnetic spin-lattice relaxation time according to published procedures (23Leijon M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The infrared spectra in H2O and D2O were measured with 6 mm oligomer duplex concentration at pH 8.8 and 20 °C as described previously (24Sarkar M. Dornberger U. Rozners E. Fritzsche H. Strömberg R. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15463-15471Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Dornberger U. Behlke J. Birch-Hirschfeld E. Fritzsche H.

In the following, GC tracts is synonymous for sequences of GC base pairs with no particular order of guanine and cytosine bases and with a length of at least four base pairs. G tracts are sequences of the type 5′-GnCn-3′. Isolated GC base pairs will mean at most two consecutive GC base pairs. The studied DNA sequences are shown in Scheme 1. Imino proton spectra of the five DNA duplexes at 15 °C are displayed in Fig. 1, without addition of exchange catalyzing base (left) and in presence of 0.1 mammonia (right). The assignment of the imino proton resonances is based on two-dimensional 1H NOESY experiments (data not shown). All thymine and guanine imino proton resonances can be observed except those of the terminal base pairs and, notably, I:T2 and II:T2. The second AT base pairs from the ends of the decamers, III:T2, IV:T2, and V:T2 are clearly visible. As is seen from the right panels of Fig. 1, the three outermost base pairs of all duplexes have vanished at 0.1 m ammonia, displaying the typical higher mobility of terminal base pairs, the so-called end-fraying. The larger broadening observed for III, IV:T2 and III, IV:T3 as compared with V:T2 and V:T3 indicates that the 5′-T3G4-3′ step exerts a destabilizing effect on the ends. This is consistent with the reduced stacking and higher flexibility suggested for this step from the NMR solution structure of sequence III (26Dornberger U. Flemming J. Fritzsche H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The effect becomes even larger in the dodecamer sequences I and II, where the T2 imino proton resonances have completely disappeared by exchange broadening. This may indicate a cooperative formation of a homogenous G tract type of structure promoted by a flexible 5′-TG-3′ step at the G tract ends. The infrared spectra in D2O and H2O of duplex III in the absence of added catalyst and at the ammonia concentration reached at the end point of the titration are shown in Fig. 2. The difference between the two spectra is very small, indicating that no structural alterations occur in course of the titration even at the high duplex concentration used in the IR experiments. The influence of the strong buffer conditions during the titrations was further investigated by performing NOESY experiments on sequence V at an ammonia base concentration of 20 mm and 0.9 m, which corresponds to the titration range. Only minor differences are observed in the chemical shifts and the relative intensity of the cross-peaks in the two spectra (data not shown). The exchange times of the imino protons were obtained from inversion recovery times of the NMR resonances as described previously (9Leijon M. Sehlstedt U. Nielsen P.E. Gräslund A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 438-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Addition of an exchange catalyst yields in the limit of infinite catalyst concentration the kinetic parameters for the base pair opening (Equation 1). In Fig. 3, the exchange times of the guanine imino protons of the five GC tracts are displayed as a function of the inverse ammonia concentration at 15 °C. The exchange times display the linear dependence on the inverse base-concentration expected from Eq. 1. The base pair lifetime τop, as well as the apparent dissociation constant αK d, obtained from the linear fits, are given in Table II. Unexpectedly, the base pair lifetimes are below 15 ms for all GC base pairs in the GC tracts. The general pattern is that the lifetimes are much smaller than observed for isolated GC base pair (cf. TableI), and the lifetimes decrease even further when the tract are of the type GnCn. On the average, base pair lifetimes in GC tracts are about 10 times shorter than for isolated GC base pairs (Tables I and II).Table IIBase pair lifetimes (τop) and apparent dissociation constants αkd of GC tract GC base pair at 15 °CBase pairτopαK d × 107msI:G43.9 ± 0.314.0 ± 0.1I:G5/G6aThe two imino proton resonances merge in the course of the catalyst titration.

Open table in a new tab The base pair lifetimes evaluated from inversion recovery measurements. The errors have been obtained by propagating the standard deviations in the primary data. Only the averaged lifetimes of the G5 and G6 imino protons of duplex I and the G4 and G5 imino protons of duplex II could be determined due to spectral overlap at high ammonia base concentration (i.e.the last three titration steps). However, at low and intermediate catalyst concentration, it is clear that the exchange properties are very similar for these base pairs (data not shown). Several sequence-dependent characteristics of the base pair dynamics of the tracts are apparent. In all sequences the outermost GC base pairs display similar behavior with base pair lifetimes around 4 ms and a relatively high base pair dissociation constant in the range 5–14×10−7 (Fig. 3, left panel). Notably, from Fig. 3 (A and C), it is seen that the dissociation constant increase with the length of the tract (TableII). In duplex II the central GC step of duplex I has been reversed to a CG step. This leads to an increase of the base pair lifetime and a decrease of the dissociation constant for this base pair as compared with sequence I with roughly a factor of 2 (Fig. 3, A and B; Table II). This is consistent with GnCn-type tracts having unique properties leading to higher base pair dissociation constants (see below). Although the dissociation constants and base pair lifetimes of the outermost GC base pairs in the decamer duplexes are similar (Fig. 3C), the innermost GC base pairs display different kinetics in the three decamers. The central base pairs of the alternating tract 5′-GCGC-3′ of duplex IV and 5′-CGCG-3′ of duplex V are more stable than any other base pairs, with dissociation constants 3.3 × 10−7 and 2.3 × 10−7, respectively. These values are close to what is commonly observed for isolated GC base pairs (12Guéron M. Leroy J.L. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 6. Springer Verlag, Berlin1992: 1-22Google Scholar). The central base pair of sequence III retains the typical properties observed for the longer G tracts with a high dissociation constant (Fig. 3, C and D; Table II). In principle, the increased recovery rates of the imino proton resonances upon addition of the catalyst could be due to an increase of the magnetic relaxation rates as well as increased exchange rates. The former could be the result of aggregation induced by the high ionic strength present at the high buffer concentrations necessary to reach near opening-limited exchange conditions in the course of the titration. In most studies of base pair dynamics, it has been implicitly assumed that any changes in the magnetic relaxation during a catalyst titration remain so small that they can be neglected. Indeed, this holds true in most cases (15Leijon M. Leroy J.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the unexpected rapid dynamics inferred from the observed exchange behavior of the guanine imino-protons in the G tracts prompted us to investigate this possibility by carrying out saturation transfer experiments on sequence V. In this type of experiment, the exchange and the magnetic relaxation contributions are separated and the exchange is directly measured (23Leijon M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, the exchange times derived from the inversion recovery experiments and those derived from the saturation transfer experiments display a close similarity, strongly indicating that changes in magnetic relaxation do not significantly influence the results of the inversion recovery experiments. Sequence-dependent structural features of the DNA double helix have a strong influence on the base pair opening dynamics. For instance, the base pair lifetime of the central GC base pairs of the self-complementary duplex d(CCTTTCGAAAGG)2 is 40 ms, while that of the reverse sequence is only 7 ms (Table I). This difference was interpreted as caused by a kink in the center of the helix in the latter case (14Kochoyan M. Leroy J.L. Guéron M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the DNA dodecamer duplex d(CGCACATGTGCG)2, the base pair opening rates in the CACA/GTGT motif were 3–8 times higher than in a same dodecamer with the central CG base pair reversed to a GC base pair (16Folta-Stogniew E. Russu I.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11016-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, GC base pair lifetimes below 5 ms at 15 °C have to our knowledge never been observed in the interior of DNA oligomers where end-fraying effects are negligible. In the present study, base pair lifetimes below 5 ms are observed in almost all of the GC tracts. Structural properties specific for G/GC tracts have been proposed to originate from stacking effects (26Dornberger U. Flemming J. Fritzsche H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Dickerson R.E. Goodsell D. Kopka M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 108-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the unmethylated state of the major groove (28Heinemann U. Alings C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Heinemann U. Hahn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7332-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the pattern of hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups in the major groove (30Timsit Y. Vilbois E. Moras D. Nature. 1991; 354: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By comparative studies of different DNA oligomer crystal structures, Dickerson and co-workers (27Dickerson R.E. Goodsell D. Kopka M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 108-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) concluded that guanine bases prefer to stack flat atop one another, without the helix-following roll observed in A tracts. To maintain hydrogen-bonding with the complementary strand, it becomes necessary to break the stack after a certain distance. Hence, a competing situation occurs where the hydrogen-bonding may be compromised for the benefit of optimized stacking. The reason for the difference in stacking properties was suggested to be the presence of a “projecting” N2 amine in guanine (27Dickerson R.E. Goodsell D. Kopka M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 108-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the GC base pair decamer d(CCGGCGCCGG)2 display an unusually deep and wide minor groove and a shallow and accessible major groove (31Heinemann U. Alings C. Bansal M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was implied that shallowness may be a characteristic feature of a major groove devoid of methyl groups. A further manifestation of the accessibility of the major groove in G tract is the unusual groove-backbone interactions observed in the crystal packing of G tract containing oligomers (31Heinemann U. Alings C. Bansal M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Timsit Y. Westhof E. Fuchs R.P. Moras D. Nature. 1989; 341: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In fact, A tracts and G tracts exhibit a striking reciprocity with respect to groove dimensions, hydration and base pair dynamics (10Nelson H.C. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 28Heinemann U. Alings C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Heinemann U. Alings C. Bansal M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These features have been summarized in Table III.Table IIIProperties of A and G tract DNAA tractG tractNarrow minor grooveWide and deep minor grooveWide and deep major grooveShallow major grooveMethylated major grooveUnmethylated major grooveNo amino group in the minor grooveAmino group in the minor grooveHydration spine in the minor groovePoor hydration of the minor grooveVery slow base pair dynamicsVery rapid base pair dynamics Open table in a new tab It seems probable that one or several of the structural properties listed in Table III are responsible for the very different base pair dynamics observed in A tracts and G tracts. For example, an accessible major groove where the stacking properties of the guanine bases leads to a tendency to transiently break the hydrogen bonding with the complementary strand can give rise to a more rapid base pair dynamics observed in G tracts. The base pair dissociation constant is higher for G tracts than GC tracts and increases with the length of the G tract. In addition, upon increasing the length of the G tract, the ends of the helix become more labile. A possible explanation is a cooperative formation of a structure in the G tract part with bifurcated hydrogen bonds between the cytosine amino group and the guanine carbonyl group but with poor stacking with the ends. This may lead to a base-pairing shift in the major groove, as has been observed in crystal structures of DNA oligomers with similar sequences (30Timsit Y. Vilbois E. Moras D. Nature. 1991; 354: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which may stabilize the open state of the base pair leading to a higher base pair dissociation constant. On the basis of the similarity of the NMR relaxation of the 19F resonances of 5-fluorocytosine at the target site of the cytosine-5-methyltransferase M.HhaI and at a reference position unaffected by protein binding, it was suggested that the protein does not accelerate base pair opening (33Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, fluorination at the 5-position of uridine leads to an increase of the imino proton exchange by almost a factor of 60 (34Gmeiner W.H. Sahasrabudhe P. Pon R.T. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1995; 33: 449-452Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), indicating a substantial increase in the base pair opening rate. A similar effect by fluorination of cytosine at the same position could potentially be the dominating contribution to the dynamic behavior in both the absence and presence of the protein. In the present study, we have shown that tracts of four or more GC base pairs exhibit a unique rapid opening dynamics that may contribute to the specificity of the cytosine-5-methyltransferases. It should be noted that it is the guanine base that carries the solvent exchangeable imino proton that is used in deriving the base pair dynamics. In case the fluctuations of the two bases in the GC base pair are independent, i.e. the opening is asymmetric, no information is provided on the fluctuations of the cytosine base. However, no evidence exists that base pair opening is asymmetric in the DNA double helix, although this appears to be the case in PNA-DNA hybrid (9Leijon M. Sehlstedt U. Nielsen P.E. Gräslund A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 438-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cytosine base is not recognized itself by the methyltransferases. For example, M.HhaI binds with higher affinity to an abasic site than to the cognate sequence (5Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, M.HhaI and M.HaeIII cause only quite modest deformation of the DNA helix, whereas adenine-N 6-methyltransferase (M.EcoRI) with the recognition sequence 5′-GAATTC-3′ causes a severe 52° bend of the DNA helix (35Garcı́a R.A. Bustamante C.J. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is possible that this reflects the intrinsic tendency for the G tract base pair to open. On the other hand, the stable, A tract type of recognition sequence of M.EcoRI may require larger deformations of the helix to facilitate the base pair opening."
https://openalex.org/W2132509717,"Snake venom and mammalian secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) have been associated with toxic (neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, etc.), pathological (inflammation, cancer, etc.), and physiological (proliferation, contraction, secretion, etc.) processes. Specific membrane receptors (M and N types) for sPLA2s have been initially identified with snake venom sPLA2s as ligands, and the M-type 180-kDa receptor was cloned from different animal species. This paper addresses the problem of the endogenous ligands of the M-type receptor. Recombinant group IB and group IIA sPLA2s from human and mouse species have been prepared and analyzed for their binding properties to M-type receptors from different animal species. Both mouse group IB and group IIA sPLA2s are high affinity ligands (in the 1-10 nM range) for the mouse M-type receptor. These two sPLA2s are expressed in the mouse tissues where the M-type receptor is also expressed, making it likely that both types of sPLA2s are physiological ligands of the mouse M-type receptor. This conclusion does not hold for human group IB and IIA sPLA2s and the cloned human M-type receptor. The two mouse sPLA2s have relatively high affinities for the mouse M-type receptor, but they can have much lower affinities for receptors from other animal species, indicating that species specificity exists for sPLA2 binding to M-type receptors. Caution should thus be exerted in avoiding mixing sPLA2s, cells, or tissues from different animal species in studies of the biological roles of mammalian sPLA2s associated with an action through their membrane receptors."

No acute (within minutes) ceramide production can be detected. When cells were stimulated with NO donors in the presence of phorbol ester, a direct activator of protein kinase C, both ceramide production and DNA fragmentation are completely abolished. Furthermore, addition of exogenous ceramide partially reversed the inhibitory effect of phorbol ester on apoptosis, thus suggesting a negative regulation of protein kinase C on ceramide formation and apoptosis. In contrast to exogenous NO, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulates a very rapid and transient increase in ceramide levels within minutes but fails to induce the late-phase ceramide formation. Moreover, TNF fails to induce apoptosis in mesangial cells.Interestingly, NO and TNFα cause a chronic activation of acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases, the ceramide-generating enzymes, whereas acidic and neutral ceramidases, the ceramide-metabolizing enzymes, are inhibited by NO, but potently stimulated by TNFα. Furthermore, in the presence of an acidic ceramidase inhibitor,N-oleoylethanolamine, TNFα leads to a sustained accumulation of ceramide and in parallel induces DNA fragmentation.In summary, our data demonstrate that exogenous NO causes a chronic up-regulation of ceramide levels in mesangial cells by activating sphingomyelinases and concomitantly inhibiting ceramidases, and that particularly the late-phase of ceramide generation may be responsible for the further processing of a proapoptotic signal.

NO is a well known mediator of blood vessel relaxation that helps to maintain blood pressure. In the central nervous system NO acts as a nonconventional type of neurotransmitter contributing to long term potentiation. In addition NO is responsible for parts of the cytotoxic activity of macrophages that helps to defeat microbes and tumor cells. Excessive and uncontrolled production of NO is associated with severe diseases like septic shock, stroke, neurodegeneration, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and other forms of acute and chronic inflammation (1Nathan C.

In this context, another molecule, the sphingolipid ceramide, has attracted attention as a candidate regulator of apoptosis.

For the experiments in this study passages 10–23 were used. Confluent mesangial cells in 30-mm diameter dishes were labeled for 24 h with [14C]serine (0.2 μCi/ml) and stimulated as indicated. The reaction was stopped by extraction of lipids (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1953; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43084) Google Scholar), and ceramide was resolved by sequential one-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/ammonia (65:35:7.5; v/v) followed by chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (9:1:1; v/v). Spots corresponding to ceramide were analyzed and quantitated using a Berthold (Nashua, NH) LB 2842 automatic TLC scanner. Confluent mesangial cells in 60-mm diameter dishes were incubated with the indicated stimuli in DMEM containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for the indicated time periods. Thereafter, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a characteristic biochemical feature of apoptotic cell death, was measured using a nucleosome DNA-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Boehringer), which quantitatively records histone-associated DNA fragments. Confluent mesangial cells in 60-mm diameter dishes were incubated with the indicated stimuli in DMEM containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for the indicated time periods. Thereafter cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA for the acidic sphingomyelinase, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol for the neutral sphingomyelinase. Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for an in vitro assay. 100 μg of protein in a total volume of 100 μl was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 nCi of [14C]sphingomyelin. Thereafter, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of water and 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). After phase separation, the radioactivity in the upper phase containing the phosphocholine was counted in a β-counter. Confluent mesangial cells were stimulated as described above and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, and 5 mmd-galactonic acid-γ-lactone for the acidic ceramidase, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mmd-galactonic acid-γ-lactone for the neutral ceramidase. Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for anin vitro assay. 100 μg of protein in a total volume of 100 μl was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with 20 nCi of [14C]ceramide. Thereafter, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of water, and lipid extraction was performed by addition of 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). The lower phase was concentrated and lipids were resolved by TLC using chloroform/methanol/ammonia (90:20:0.5; v/v) as a solvent. Spots corresponding to ceramide and sphingosine were analyzed and quantitated using a Berthold (Nashua, NH) LB 2842 automatic TLC scanner. It is well documented from our previous studies that glomerular mesangial cells and endothelial cells are able to undergo apoptosis upon stimulation with exogenous NO donors (9Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Mühl H. Sandau K. Brüne B. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However the exact mechanism by which the short-lived gas NO mediates its apogenic effect is still poorly understood. In this study we evaluated the effect of exogenously delivered NO on the stress-signaling molecule ceramide in mesangial cells. Fig. 1 shows that long term treatment of mesangial cells for 24 h with different NO donors like MAHMA-NO, spermine-NO, SNAP, and GS-NO stimulates a dose-dependent increase in ceramide levels. Time course studies reveal no acute increase of ceramide within the first 60 min of NO stimulation (Fig. 2A). However, significant increases of ceramide levels occur after 2–4 h of stimulation and reach maximal levels (3–4-fold increase) after 24 h of stimulation with GS-NO (Fig. 2B). In contrast, TNFα causes a very rapid and transient increase in ceramide formation (Fig. 2A) but fails to induce a late-phase increase of ceramide as it is seen for NO (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Time course of NO- and TNFα-induced ceramide formation in mesangial cells. [14C]Serine-labeled mesangial cells were stimulated with either vehicle (●), GS-NO (2 mm; ▾), or TNFα (1 nm; ○) for short term (A) or long term (B) periods as indicated. Thereafter lipids were extracted, separated by TLC as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the spots corresponding to ceramide were quantitated on a TLC scanner. Data are expressed as percentage of control values and are means ± S.D., n = 3–4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NO-induced ceramide production is independent of cGMP formation as the membrane-permeant cGMP analog dibutyryl cGMP (10 μm-–1 mm) does not cause an increased ceramide generation (data not shown). To further elucidate the mechanism of NO-induced ceramide production we treated cells with a phorbol ester, a direct activator of protein kinase C. Phorbol esters have been reported to block the proapoptotic activity of NO in several cell types (25Messmer U.K. Lapetina E.G. Brüne B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 757-765PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lucas M. Sanchez-Margalet V. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fig. 3Ashows that the phorbol ester TPA causes a dose-dependent inhibition of NO-induced ceramide formation. In parallel, NO-induced DNA fragmentation is also blocked by increasing concentrations of TPA (Fig. 3B), thus suggesting a negative regulatory role for PKC on NO-stimulated ceramide formation and apoptosis. To examine whether ceramide elevations are required for NO to trigger apoptosis we added exogenous C6-ceramide to the cells exposed to spermine-NO in the presence of TPA. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3C exogenous ceramide at least partially bypassed the suppression of NO-induced apoptosis by TPA. To elucidate the differential effects of NO and TNFα on ceramide formation, we analyzed the activities of the ceramide-generating and metabolizing enzymes, i.e. the acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases and the acidic and neutral ceramidases, respectively. Treatment of mesangial cells with GS-NO reveals chronic activation of the acidic sphingomyelinase (Fig. 4A) as well as of the neutral sphingomyelinase (Fig. 4B), although with distinctly different time patterns. The acidic sphingomyelinase was activated more rapidly, reaching maximal activity 2 h after addition of GS-NO and thereafter slowly declining over the next several hours but still remaining significantly elevated after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the neutral sphingomyelinase activity shows a lag period of 4 h before steadily increasing over the next 20 h of GS-NO stimulation. After a very rapid and transient (10–20 min) increase in neutral sphingomyelinase activity (data not shown) TNFα also triggers a delayed activation of the acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases. A lag period of 4–8 h after TNFα stimulation is required before significant chronic increases of acidic (Fig. 4A) and neutral (Fig. 4B) sphingomyelinase activities are detected which subsequently persisted for 24 h. Strikingly, we observed that TNFα stimulation causes a chronic up-regulation of acidic and neutral ceramidase activities in mesangial cells (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas GS-NO leads to a time-dependent inhibition of acidic and neutral ceramidase activities (Fig. 5,A and B). This opposite behavior may explain why GS-NO causes a sustained increase in ceramide levels whereas TNFα-induced changes in sphingomyelinase and ceramidase activities counterbalance each other leaving ceramide levels unchanged (Fig. 2B). To test whether the inhibitory effect of NO on acidic and neutral ceramidase activities is caused by a direct modulation of the enzymes, increasing concentrations of the rapidly decomposing NO donor MAHMA-NO (t½ = 1–2 min) were incubated in vitrowith the cell extracts containing active acidic and neutral ceramidases. However, up to concentrations of 1 mmMAHMA-NO, no significant inhibition of either ceramidase activity is detected thus excluding a direct inhibitory modulation of the enzymes by NO (data not shown). We speculated that the lack of sustained ceramide generation by TNFα might be responsible for the failure of cytokines like TNFα or interleukin 1β to induce mesangial cell apoptosis, despite inducible NOS (iNOS) up-regulation and high levels of endogenously produced NO (10Mühl H. Sandau K. Brüne B. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Nitsch D.D. Ghilardi N. Mühl H. Nitsch C. Brüne B. Pfeilschifter J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 889-900PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate this hypothesis, we used an acidic ceramidase inhibitor N-oleoylethanolamine (28Sugita M. Willians M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 22: 125-131Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) to deplete acidic ceramidase activity in mesangial cells. Inhibition of ceramide metabolism will lead to increased ceramide levels and given the case that ceramide is responsible for initiating apoptosis, we expected to get an increased apoptotic response. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6, in the presence ofN-oleoylethanolamine, mesangial cells display an enhanced rate of apoptosis when stimulated with TNFα.N-Oleoylethanolamine alone had no effect on apoptosisper se. The majority of physiological functions of NO appears to be mediated by activation of its main intracellular receptor guanylate cyclase (29Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schmidt H.H. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). By nitrosation of the heme moiety NO increases guanylate cyclase activity by 2 orders of magnitude (31Ignarro J.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 32Mülsch A. Gerzer R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The generation of cyclic GMP and the subsequent regulation of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases, cyclic GMP-regulated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, and ion channels is responsible for functional cell responses triggered by NO (29Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schmidt H.H. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). However, under pathological conditions, when large quantities of NO are generated, other reactions become more prominent and predominate. Among those are interactions of NO with iron-sulfur centers, protein thiols, lipids, and zinc fingers in various important cellular molecules (33Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Another important reaction partner of NO is superoxide, and the subsequent generation of peroxynitrite, which, in the presence of a metal catalyst (like Fe3+), can be converted to nitronium ion that readily nitrates tyrosine residues in proteins, and thus may block critical phosphorylation reactions in signal transduction cascades (34Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These latter reactions may be responsible for the pathophysiological roles played by large amounts of NO produced by the inducible isoform of NOS that contributes to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and to host defense mechanisms required to successfully cope with microbial infections. The number of newly discovered targets of NO is steadily increasing, and NO was shown to affect crucial intracellular signaling pathways. In Jurkat T cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and in mesangial cells NO was found to activate distinct subgroups of mitogen-activated protein kinases including the stress-activated protein kinases and p38 kinase (9Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate for the first time that NO triggers ceramide formation in glomerular mesangial cells in a cyclic GMP-independent manner. This observation provides an unexpected link between two highly versatile signaling molecules. The sphingomyelin pathway is a ubiquitous signaling pathway that is used by an increasing number of cell surface receptors and environmental stress factors and includes the generation of ceramide by acidic or neutral sphingomyelinases (20Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 21Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type ceramide was shown either to trigger cell differentiation or proliferation or to initiate programmed cell death (apoptosis) (20Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 21Pena L.A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover, stress-induced apoptosis was reported to require ceramide-induced signaling via the stress-activated protein kinase cascade (36Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Our data now provide evidence for cross-communication between the NO signaling system and the sphingolipid signaling pathway. Strikingly, we found that NO increases ceramide levels in the cell by a dual mechanism; on the one hand it stimulates the ceramide-producing enzymes acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases, thus leading to an increased ceramide formation, and on the other hand NO inhibits the ceramide-metabolizing enzymes, i.e. acidic and neutral ceramidases, and thereby prevents degradation of ceramide resulting in an amplified increase in ceramide steady-state levels. By contrast, TNFα, besides activating the sphingomyelinases like NO does, causes a potent activation of the ceramidases, which fully compensates for the increased generation of ceramide, and no net change in chronic ceramide production is observed. This may also explain why mesangial cells undergo apoptosis when NO is delivered by exogenous sources but are resistant to endogenously produced NO after cytokine-induced inducible NOS expression (10Mühl H. Sandau K. Brüne B. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Nitsch D.D. Ghilardi N. Mühl H. Nitsch C. Brüne B. Pfeilschifter J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 889-900PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of both acidic and neutral ceramidase activities has also been reported to occur in interleukin 1β-exposed rat hepatocytes (37Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merril Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that NO either directly or indirectly affects one of the ceramide-producing or -metabolizing enzymes,i.e. acidic or neutral sphingomyelinases or ceramidases. Work is presently in progress to elucidate possible direct effects of NO on enzymes in the ceramide signaling cascade. Whether the NO-induced formation of ceramide is causally related to apoptosis of mesangial cells seen after exposure to NO donors (9Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Mühl H. Sandau K. Brüne B. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) remains to be elucidated. It is however noteworthy that it is not the formation of ceramide per se but rather the prolonged and sustained increase of ceramide levels that correlates with programmed cell death. This becomes obvious after inhibition of acidic ceramidase by N-oleoylethanolamine (28Sugita M. Willians M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 22: 125-131Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which enables mesangial cells to undergo apoptosis after TNFα stimulation (Fig. 6). However, it should be noted that this inhibitor has only been characterized in a few systems, and data on the selectivity of the compound in mesangial cells are presently not available. Inhibition of ceramidase now unveils the stimulatory action of TNFα on acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases and gives rise to sustained increases in ceramide levels in mesangial cells, which may be required to trigger apoptosis. In Fig. 7 we have compiled data on ceramide production in and apoptosis of mesangial cells in response to a number of different stimuli. There is a strong correlation between chronic ceramide production and apoptosis of the cells. However, further work is required to formally establish a causal link between these two phenomenons. Another interesting aspect of this study is the negative regulatory role of PKC in NO-induced ceramide formation. Previously, we have shown that mesangial cells express four PKC isoenzymes, PKC-α, -δ, -ε, and –ζ (38Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrated that ceramide is able to directly interact with PKC-α and –δ, but not with PKC-ε and -ζ isoenzymes (40Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. Kidney Int. 1998; 67: S34-S39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 41Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14557-14562Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data together with the results presented in this study raise the intriguing possibility of PKC-α and/or PKC-δ acting as negative regulators of the sphingomyelin cycle, in a way similar to the PKC-α-mediated feedback regulation of hormone-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover (38Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 43Ochsner M. Huwiler A. Fleck T. Pfeilschifter J. Eur. J. Pharmacol.-Mol.

Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 329-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, C2-ceramide-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in U937 cells could be blocked by treatment of cells with phorbol ester (45Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), thus providing further evidence for a link between NO-induced ceramide production and subsequent apoptosis. The direct target of PKC mediating this negative feedback regulation is not yet known. It will be important though to see whether the NO-induced ceramide signal is further propagated along the different signaling pathways thought to be targeted by this lipid and to be crucially involved in a cell's decision to live or to die."

In addition, the N365S mutant could be clearly distinguished from less Na+-tolerant HKT1mutants by a markedly decreased relative permeability for Na+ at high Na+ concentrations.

Nature. 1994; 370: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). HKT1 is highly expressed in the root cortex and in cells surrounding the vasculature in leaves (6Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.I. Nature. 1994; 370: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and shows homology to the yeast plasma membrane high affinity K+ uptake transportersTRK1 and TRK2 (6Schachtman D.P.

HKT1 has been shown to mediate high affinity Na+-K+ symport (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional high affinity K+ uptake pathways should exist in roots (9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Detailed biophysical studies showed that HKT1 is highly selective for the alkali cations K+ and Na+ (9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When the extracellular concentrations of K+ and Na+ are similar, HKT1 functions as a Na+-coupled K+uptake transporter. HKT1 is modelled to have a high affinity K+-coupling site with an apparent affinity for K+ of 3 μm, and a high affinity Na+-coupling site with an apparent affinity for Na+ of 175 μm (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). At toxic, high millimolar, extracellular Na+ concentrations, however, Na+ competes with K+ at the high affinity K+-coupling site, leading to a block of high affinity K+ uptake; large rates of detrimental low affinity Na+ uptake are mediated via HKT1 in yeast and oocytes (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar,9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity of the high affinity K+-coupling site for Na+ is approximately 5 mm (8Rubio F. Gassmann W.

These findings suggest that HKT1 may be one of the pathways for Na+ transport across plant root and leaf membranes that is important for salt toxicity in plants. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying Na+transport in plants and identifying structural components that allow Na+ uptake via these transporters are required for a fundamental understanding of Na+ homeostasis. It has been proposed that important Na+ entry pathways into plant cells represent K+ uptake transporters (10Rains D.W. Epstein E.

Plant responses to salt stress are a complex phenomenon involving several processes such as osmoprotectant accumulation (14Greenway H. Munns R. Annu. Rev.

Structural studies of the wheat transporter HKT1 led to the identification of point mutations located in the 6th hydrophobic domain that decrease low affinity Na+ uptake and confer Na+ tolerance to yeast (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Here we report on the isolation of new Na+-tolerant HKT1 mutations in novel domains, by using yeast mutants with increased Na+sensitivity. These new HKT1 mutants cause greatly enhanced Na+ tolerance in yeast compared with previous mutants. The mechanisms by which mutants cause Na+ tolerance were characterized, and mechanistic distinctions among Na+-tolerant HKT1 mutants are revealed. The new mutations contribute to the identification of a new site in a loop domain, N365, that is involved in cation specificity of HKT1 and in HKT1-mediated Na+ tolerance. These findings contribute to a molecular physiological understanding of HKT1 structure and function. Furthermore, highly tolerant HKT1 mutants can be used to determine contributions of HKT1 to plant Na+transport in molecular physiological studies. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains CY162 (Mat a, ura3–52, his3Δ200, his44–15, trk1Δ, trk2::pCK64) (21Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Standard minimal medium (22Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) and arginine phosphate medium (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, arginine phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (23Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with KCl and NaCl as indicated were used for yeast growth. Yeast transformation was carried out by the polyethylene glycol method as described previously (24Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used forEscherichia coli growth and transformation and DNA manipulations (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The HKT1 cDNA cloned in the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) was mutagenized randomly by error PCR as described elsewhere (26Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Two different sets of DNA fragments generated by error PCR that covered the coding region of the HKT1 cDNA were employed: the first reaction produced DNA fragments from position −36 to 1152, and the second reaction from position 657 to 1570. The DNA fragments were cotransformed into yeast to allow homologous recombination (27Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) with a gapped pDR195-based plasmid containing the yeast PMA1 gene promoter (28Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and the HKT1cDNA lacking the BgII (387 position) to the BclI (939 position) fragment for the first set of PCR reactions or the BclI (939 position) to the XbaI (1478 position) fragment for the second set of PCR reactions. URA+ transformants were first selected on standard minimal medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 100 mmK+ and then replica-plated to AP medium supplemented with 0.1 mm K+ plus 400 mmNa+, where strain 9.3 containing the wild type HKT1 did not grow because of Na+ toxicity. Growing colonies were selected, and their plasmids were isolated and reintroduced into yeast to retest for Na+ tolerance. Clones conferring the highest Na+ tolerance were chosen for further characterization. The K+uptake-deficient yeast strain CY162 described above (21Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3736-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and the same strain transformed with a plasmid containing the wild typeHKT1 cDNA or the mutated HKT1 cDNA under the control of the yeast PMA1 gene promoter (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 28Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) were used for uptake experiments. Cells were grown in arginine phosphate medium (23Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 30 mm K+. For Na+ uptake experiments in the low affinity range of concentrations (1–300 mm Na+), cells were used directly. For Rb+ and Na+ uptake experiments in the high affinity range of concentrations (1–300 μmRb+ or Na+), cells were previously starved of K+ for 5–6 h (29Ramos J. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the uptake experiments, cells were harvested and resuspended in uptake buffer (10 mm Mes, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 2% glucose brought to pH 6.0 with Ca(OH)2) and incubated at 30 °C. For high affinity Rb+ and Na+ uptake experiments,86Rb+ or 22Na+ (NEN Life Science Products) were added at 0.05 μCi nmol−1 at time 0. Samples were filtered at different time points through a Millipore membrane (0.8 μm) and washed with a 10 mm RbCl or NaCl solution. The internal Rb+ or Na+content was calculated from the external activity, and the counts accumulated in the cells. Samples were counted in a Beckman Ls-230 scintillation counter. For low affinity Na+ uptake experiments, NaCl was added at time 0. Samples were collected as described above, washed with a 20 mm MgCl2solution, and extracted with acid. The internal Na+ content was determined by atomic emission spectrophotometry using a Perkin-Elmer 5000 spectrophotometer. Initial rates of Rb+or Na+ uptake are reported and represent averages of at least three independent experiments. Error bars denote standard error of the mean. Yeast cells expressing HKT1 or the Na+-tolerant HKT1 mutants were incubated in AP medium supplemented with 0.1 mm K+ and 300 or 500 mm Na+. After 24 h, samples were collected on filters as described above and the internal K+ and Na+ contents determined by atomic emission spectrophotometry. Error bars denote standard error of the mean. Statistical analyses for uptake experiments and ionic content determination in yeast were performed with the Instat3 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) using an unpaired ttest. The significance level was p < 0.05. HKT1 and HKT1 mutant mRNA synthesis and injection (20 ng) into oocytes, voltage clamp recordings with a Dagan Cornerstone TEV-200 voltage clamp amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) one day after mRNA injection, and data acquisition and analysis with the program Axotape (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) were performed as described previously (6Schachtman D.P. Schroeder J.I. Nature. 1994; 370: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Data were low pass filtered at 20 Hz. Oocytes were impaled with electrodes filled with 1 m KCl and were bathed in a solution containing (in mm): 6 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 Mes-Tris, pH 5.5, osmolality 240–260 mosmol kg−1 with D-sorbitol. K+ and Na+ were added as glutamate salts. Tris+ (as glutamate) was added in experiments where the total alkali cation concentration varied. Error bars denote standard error of the mean. To calculate the pK+/pNa+ permeability ratios, the Goldman equation (Eq. 1) for ion channels was employed. Erev=RTzFlnpK+[K+]o+pNa+[Na+]opK+[K+]i+pNa+[Na+]i(Eq. 1) In addition, and to more accurately reflect the pK+/pNa+ permeability ratios of just the K+-coupling site for the HKT1 model with two separate Na+ and K+-coupling sites (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), an expanded version of the Goldman equation was employed (Eq. 2). Erev=RT(m+n)F(m lnpK+[K+]o+pNa+[Na+]opK+[K+]i+pNa+[Na+]i+n lnp′K+[K+]o+p′Na+[Na+]op′K+[K+]i+p′Na+[Na+]i)(Eq. 2) Eq. 2 consists of the addition of two terms that consider the permeability of HKT1 for the K+-coupling site (mterm) and the permeability of HKT1 for the Na+ coupling (n term). To solve forpK+/pNa+ in the expanded Goldman equation (Eq. 2), the K+ permeability of the high affinity Na+-coupling site was approximated to be negligible (9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the stoichiometries were set to m = 2 and n = 1 (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). pK+pNa+=[Na+]o−10S[Na+]i10S[K+]i(Eq. 3) where S=(m+n)F2RTErev−log12[Na+]o[Na+]i(Eq. 4) For all equations, E rev is the reversal potential, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, z is the charge of the ion,F is the Faraday constant, pNa+ is the relative permeability of the K+-coupling site of HKT1 for Na+, pK+ is the relative permeability of the K+-coupling site of HKT1 for K+. p′Na+ and p′K+ refer to the Na+-coupling site. The ionic concentrations are given in brackets (o = external, i = internal). The internal K+and Na+ concentrations were assumed to be 92.5 mm K+ and 6.2 mm Na+ as has been determined for Xenopus oocytes (30Barish M.E. J. Physiol. 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A nonbiased random selection approach was used to identify new amino acid positions in HKT1 that affect Na+ transport. To isolate newHKT1 mutants that conferred even larger Na+tolerance than those found previously (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), we used a yeast strain, 9.3, which is more Na+ sensitive than the CY162 strain. The 9.3 yeast strain has a deletion in the four ENA1 toENA4 genes that encode plasma membrane Na+-extruding ATPases (31Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 32Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Bañuelos M.A. Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, the yeast K+ uptake transporter genes TRK1 and TRK2 were deleted in the 9.3 strain. Mutants were isolated at 0.1 mm K+ where strain 9.3 does not grow because it lacks the endogenous high affinity K+ uptake system, thus including selective pressure for maintaining high affinity K+ uptake in HKT1 mutants, and 400 mm Na+ to select for Na+tolerance. The HKT1 cDNAs were randomly mutagenized by error-prone PCR amplification (see “Experimental Procedures”). By screening 5,000 clones, putative HKT1 mutants were isolated that showed increased growth in the presence of 0.1 mmK+ plus 400 mm Na+. Subsequent plasmid isolation and retransformation of yeast was performed to retestHKT1 mutants for Na+ tolerance. Sequencing of the strongest Na+ tolerance-conferring HKT1mutants showed that five new HKT1 mutants had been isolated (Table I). Interestingly, four of five mutants were altered in the Asn-365 residue in independent PCR reactions, indicating that this residue is important for Na+ tolerance.Table IMutations in HKT1 that confer Na+ toleranceMutationNa+ tolerancemmN365S400Q270L350N365S, P402T, K492R300S344P, N365T, I462T300N365T, L431P300 Open table in a new tab The single base Q270L and N365S HKT1 mutants were analyzed in detail here, because they conferred the highest degree of Na+ tolerance (Table I). Fig. 1A shows that at high Na+, the yeast strain 9.3 expressing HKT1 did not grow, whereas 9.3 expressing the HKT1 mutants Q270L, N365S, and the former mutant A240V grew. To quantify the Na+ tolerance conferred by the two new mutations, the growth of the 9.3 strain expressing HKT1 and the Na+-tolerant HKT1 mutants was followed in liquid culture at several Na+ concentrations. The HKT1mutant A240V was included for comparison because it was the more Na+-tolerant of the two previously describedHKT1 mutants (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). At 150 mm Na+, 9.3 cells expressing HKT1 did not grow and 9.3 cells expressing the HKT1 mutants A240V, Q270L, and N365S grew well (Fig. 1B). The control strain 9.3 did not show growth because the medium contained low K+ and high Na+concentrations. When the Na+ concentration was increased to 250 mm Na+, only yeast cells expressing the N365S mutation showed large growth rates (Fig. 1C; N365S doubling time 10 ± 0.7 h). Thus, this mutant dramatically increased Na+ tolerance compared with the previously isolated Na+-tolerant HKT1 mutant A240V. According to hydrophobicity analysis of HKT1, the new N365S and Q270L mutations lie in the loop between the 8th and 9th hydrophobic domains (N365S) and in the 7th hydrophobic domain (Q270L) (Fig. 1D). These results provide evidence that HKT1 domains in addition to the 6th hydrophobic domain are involved in HKT1-mediated Na+ tolerance. To investigate whether the two new HKT1 mutations Q270L and N365S affected high affinity transport characteristics under non-Na+ stress conditions, Rb+ and Na+ uptake experiments at micromolar Rb+ and Na+ concentrations were carried out in the yeast strain CY162 expressing the HKT1 mutants. Micromolar Na+ concentrations produced a similar activation of high affinity Rb+ uptake in HKT1 and in the N365S and Q270L mutants (data not shown). Rb+ uptake was measured in the presence of 1 mm Na+ for maximal activation of high affinity Rb+ uptake (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that CY162 expressing wild type HKT1 and the mutants Q270L and N365S displayed approximately similar rates of high affinity Rb+ uptake. Detailed analysis of uptake kinetics showed a slight 1.5-fold increase in the affinity for Rb+ in the Na+-tolerant N365S mutant. The K m (Rb+) values for Rb+ uptake in the presence of 1 mmNa+ were 70.2 ± 8 μm for HKT1, 49.8 ± 5 μm for Q270L, and 45.8 ± 9 μm for N365S, and the Vmax (nmol Rb+ mg−1 min−1) values 2.7 ± 0.1 for HKT1, 2.2 ± 0.1 for Q270L, and 2.0 ± 0.1 for N365S. Statistical analyses of the data showed that there were not significant differences among the Rb+ K mvalues (p values were 0.079 for the HKT1, N365S pair and 0.084 for the HKT1, Q270L pair). The untransformed control strain CY162 did not show Rb+ uptake in the range of Rb+concentrations used in these experiments because of the deletion of the high affinity K+ uptake systems encoded by TRK1and TRK2 genes. High affinity Na+ uptake experiments were performed in the presence of 100 μm K+ for maximal activation of high affinity Na+ uptake (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The two mutations showed small effects on high affinity Na+ uptake (Fig. 2B). The K m (μmNa+) values for Na+ uptake in the presence of 100 μm K+ were 65.3 ± 6.9 μm for HKT1, 36.5 ± 13.3 μm for Q270L, and 33.2 ± 9.8 μm for N365S, and the Vmax (nmol mg−1 min−1) values 6.8 ± 0.2 for HKT1, 5.5 ± 0.2 for Q270L, and 5.0 ± 0.2 for N365S. Statistical analyses of the data showed that the Na+ K m values were not significantly different (p = 0.054 for the HKT1, N365S pair and p = 0.11 for the HKT1, Q270L pair), whereas the Na+ Vmax values were significantly different (p = 0.005 for the HKT1, N365S pair and p = 0.009 for the HKT1, Q270L pair). The untransformed control strain CY162 did not show Na+ uptake in the range of Na+ concentrations used in these experiments. The Na+-tolerant mutants showed significantly lowerVmax values for high affinity Rb+and Na+ uptake. This could be a consequence of a lower expression of the mutants in yeast as compared with wild type HKT1. However, a reduced expression level would decrease the rate at which yeast expressing the mutants grow in low K+ medium, which was not observed (data not shown). Although the lowerVmax for high affinity Na+ uptake showed by the mutants could contribute to Na+ tolerance, we hypothesized that other substantial changes in transport parameters would be required in the HKT1 mutants to achieve the observed dramatic increase in Na+ tolerance (Fig. 1C). An earlier study showed that high Na+ concentrations inhibited high affinity Rb+ uptake through HKT1 (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The effect of millimolar Na+ concentrations on high affinity Rb+ uptake was investigated for the new HKT1mutants, Q270L and N365S. Fig. 3A shows the rates of Rb+ uptake from a 100 μm Rb+solution in yeast cells expressing HKT1 mutants as a function of increasing millimolar Na+ concentrations in the range from 1 to 400 mm Na+. High Na+ concentrations inhibited high affinity K+(Rb+) uptake to a lesser extent in cells expressing the Na+-resistant HKT1 mutants than in cells expressing wild type HKT1 (Fig. 3A). The three mutations N365S, Q270L, and A240V showed a similar reduction in the inhibition of high affinity Rb+ uptake by high Na+ concentrations. The Na+ concentrations (mm Na+) that produced 50% inhibition of Rb+ uptake were 40 ± 4.3 for HKT1, 90 ± 2.6 for N365S (p = 0.0044), 90 ± 1.7 for Q270L (p = 0.0054), and 112 ± 2.9 for A240V (p = 0.0016). These data show that the ability of Na+ to bind to a modelled high affinity K+-coupling site (9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) is reduced in the HKT1mutants. However, the 50% inhibition constants show that Na+ block of K+ uptake alone cannot account for the increased Na+ tolerance of the N365S mutant with respect to A240V (Figs. 3A and 1C). In addition to high affinity Na+-coupled K+uptake, HKT1 also promotes low affinity Na+ uptake in yeast and oocytes, with an apparent K m of approximately 5 mm Na+ (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). High and low affinity components of Na+ uptake mediated by HKT1 could be clearly separated by Eadie-Hofstee analyses (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with previous studies showing two distinct transport mechanisms for high and low affinity Na+ uptake by HKT1 (8Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar,9Gassmann W. Rubio F. Schroeder J.I Plant J. 1996; 10: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Low affinity Na+ uptake was investigated and kinetic parameters were compared in the Na+-tolerant mutants. Fig. 3C shows that CY162 cells expressing the more Na+-tolerant mutants A240V and N365S showed a substantial reduction in low affinity Na+ uptake compared with the wild type HKT1. The A240V mutant showed a significant lowerVmax value and the N365S showed significant lower affinity and lower Vmax of low affinity Na+ uptake (Table II). The results described above illustrate that HKT1 mutants become more Na+ resistant by simultaneously reducing Na+ inhibition of Rb+ uptake (Fig. 3A) and by reducing low affinity Na+ uptake (Fig. 3C, Table II). This dual effect of the mutations cannot be explained by a reduction in the expression level of the mutated transporter in yeast. To further test this hypothesis, we measured the internal K+ and Na+ contents of yeast cells expressing HKT1 and the HKT1 mutants after incubation in media with high Na+ concentrations (Fig. 4). When the yeast cells were incubated for 24 h in medium with 0.1 mm K+ and 500 mm Na+, the internal Na+/K+ ratios were 6.8 ± 1.4 for HKT1 (n = 6), 2.7 ± 0.4 for A240V (n = 6, p = 0.013), 1.9 ± 0.2 for Q270L (n = 6, p = 0.0065), and 0.6 ± 0.1 for N365S (n = 6, p = 0.0025). The most Na+-tolerant mutant N365S showed the lowest internal Na+/K+ ratio at both 300 and 500 mm Na+ (Fig. 4).Table IIKm and Vmax values for low affinity Na+ uptake in yeast cells expressing HKT1, Na+-tolerant HKT1 mutants and the control yeast strain CY162HKT1A240VQ270LN365SCY162K m (mmNa+)4.6 ± 1.16.7 ± 0.76.7 ± 0.7ap = 0.08.10.2 ± 1.1bp = 0.02.83.3 ± 10.2Vmax (nmol mg−1min−1)15.3 ± 0.98.6 ± 1cp = 0.008.11.4 ± 1.7dp = 0.12.10.6 ± 1.2ep = 0.04.5.3 ± 0.2a p = 0.08.b p = 0.02"
https://openalex.org/W2055605961,"We report the optical and resonance Raman spectral characterization of ferrous recombinantChlamydomonas LI637 hemoglobin. We show that it is present in three pH-dependent equilibrium forms including a 4-coordinate species at acid pH, a 5-coordinate high spin species at neutral pH, and a 6-coordinate low spin species at alkaline pH. The proximal ligand to the heme is the imidazole group of a histidine. Kinetics of the reactions with ligands were determined by stopped-flow spectroscopy. At alkaline pH, combination with oxygen, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide displays a kinetic behavior that is interpreted as being rate-limited by conversion of the 6-coordinate form to a reactive 5-coordinate form. At neutral pH, combination rates of the 5-coordinate form with oxygen and carbon monoxide were much faster (>107 μm−1 s−1). The dissociation rate constant measured for oxygen is among the slowest known, 0.014 s−1, and is independent of pH. Replacement of the tyrosine 63 (B10) by leucine or of the putative distal glutamine by glycine increases the dissociation rate constant 70- and 30-fold and increases the rate of autoxidation 20- and 90-fold, respectively. These results are consistent with at least two hydrogen bonds stabilizing the bound oxygen molecule, one from tyrosine B10 and the other from the distal glutamine.

The LI637 and LI410genes encode proteins of 164 and 171 amino acids, respectively, including at their N termini, leader sequences that serve to target the proteins to the chloroplast. Within the chloroplast, they are distributed between the proteinaceous ribulose-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase-rich pyrenoid and the thylacoid membrane regions (1Couture M. Chamberland H. St.-Pierre B. Lafontaine J. Guertin M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Their discovery constitutes the first evidence that hemoglobin occurs in chloroplasts. Chlamydomonas hemoglobins are induced by light to a final concentration of approximately 130 nm within the chloroplast. As the internal pH of the stroma of the chloroplast is known to range from about pH 6.9 in the dark to more than pH 8.0 in the light (3Werdan K. Heldt H.W. Milovancev M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 396: 276-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), in this investigation we examine acid, neutral, and alkaline forms of Chlamydomonaschloroplast hemoglobin.Phylogenetic analysis based on primary amino acid sequences suggests that Chlamydomonas hemoglobin shares a small gene family with the hemoglobins of the cyanobacteria Nostoc commune (4Potts M.

The three-dimensional structure has not been solved for any of them. Multiple sequence alignment and comparison with myoglobin suggests that these hemoglobins have a universally conserved proximal histidine and a phenylalanine at position CD1 (1Couture M.

Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ferric protein forms complexes with cyanide and azide and also with the less usual ligands dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol (8Couture M. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Optical spectra of the 6-coordinate ferrous and ferric forms of the protein suggest structures of the distal ligand different from those usually encountered in hemoglobins. In this study, we use optical, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy to probe the nature of the ligands to the ferrous heme iron of the expressed protein and of single amino acid substitution mutants. We use stopped-flow spectroscopy to establish the kinetics of the reactions with oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide. We present evidence that the bound oxygen molecule forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the putative distal glutamine and tyrosine 63 (B10) residues that stabilize the oxygenated structure.DISCUSSIONC. eugametos chloroplast hemoglobin (encoded by the gene LI637) is expressed in response to light and requires photosynthesis for its full expression (1Couture M. Chamberland H. St.-Pierre B. Lafontaine J. Guertin M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Gagne G. Guertin M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Within the chloroplast of the wild type cells, the hemoglobin concentration does not exceed 130 nm, far too little to store a metabolically significant amount of oxygen or to facilitate oxygen movement, except possibly within very limited structural domains. Within the cell, delivery of oxygen to possible oxygen-consuming enzymes will be limited by the rate of oxygen dissociation. It would appear that oxygen dissociation fromChlamydomonas hemoglobin, among the slowest known,t½ = 49 s, is far too slow to support a metabolic function requiring dissociation of hemoglobin-bound oxygen. The function of Chlamydomonas hemoglobin remains to be determined.Sequence alignment, and comparison with myoglobin, suggests that the proximal heme residue of Chlamydomonas hemoglobin is histidine; the distal residue is glutamine; and tyrosine occupies position B10 (1Couture M. Chamberland H. St.-Pierre B. Lafontaine J. Guertin M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). EPR and resonance Raman spectra reported here confirm the assignment of histidine as the proximal residue. Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative proximal histidine residue, His-111 → Gly, leads to expression of an apoprotein, which does not bind heme (data not shown). Several hemoglobins, many characterized by very high oxygen affinity, share with Chlamydomonashemoglobin the simultaneous presence of a distal glutamine and a tyrosine residue in position B10. Among these are the hemoglobins of numerous nematodes (25Vanfleteren J.R. Van de Peer Y. Blaxter M.L. Tweedie S.A. Trotman C. Lu L. Van Hauwaert M.L. Moens L. Mol. Phylogenet.

Tyrosine B10 alone, in the absence of a distal glutamine residue, as in the symbiotic and nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins (36Hargrove M.S. Barry J.K. Brucker E.A. Berry M.B. Phillips G.N.J. Olson J.S.

Site-directed mutagenesis implicates two distal pocket residues in stabilizing the bound oxygen. Mutation of the distal glutamine residue, Gln-84 → Gly, or of tyrosine B10, Tyr-63 → Leu, increases the rate of oxygen dissociation 30- and 70-fold and increases the rate of autoxidation 90- and 20-fold, respectively, as summarized in Table IV. We suggest that these two residues may form hydrogen bonds stabilizing the bound oxygen molecule. The rate of oxygen dissociation from wild type oxyChlamydomonas hemoglobin is the same from pH 7.5 to pH 10.5. This suggests that the structure of the oxygen complex does not depend on protonatable groups titrating within this range.Instances in which the distal residue forms stabilizing hydrogen bonds to the hemoglobin-ligated oxygen molecule are many (38Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 39Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Imidazole from histidine plays this role in the majority of vertebrate hemoglobins and myoglobins but may be replaced by glutamine, as in elephant myoglobin (40Bisig D.A. Di Iorio E.E. Diederichs K. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20754-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or in mutant versions of sperm whale myoglobin (41Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3057-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When glutamine replaces histidine, hydrogen bond formation from the distal glutamine to the bound oxygen molecule becomes a common theme among invertebrate hemoglobins and myoglobins (38Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Among these,Ascaris hemoglobin offers a strong analogy toChlamydomonas hemoglobin. In Ascaris hemoglobin, tyrosine B10, together with the distal glutamine residue, contributes to a network of hydrogen bonds believed to stabilize the bound oxygen molecule, see Table II (28De Baere I.

A still more elaborate network of hydrogen bonds involving the distal glutamine, tyrosine B10, and, in addition, a water molecule, accounts for the very slow dissociation of oxygen from Lucina HbII (31Peterson E.S. Huang S.C. Wang J.Q. Miller L.M. Vidugiris G. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Chance M.R. Wittenberg J.B. Friedman J.M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16054-16059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), see Table II.Acidic Ferrous Chlamydomonas HemoglobinThe optical spectra of ferrous Chlamydomonas hemoglobin are pH-dependent (Figs. 2, 4, and 5a). This dependence is best fit by a model involving two pK avalues (8.5 and 6.4) and three different optical entities. In the following sections we discuss the properties of these species.At pH 5.0, ferrous Chlamydomonas hemoglobin exists as a stable 4-coordinate species (Figs. 2, 3, and 5a and TableI). Observation of a 4-coordinate heme in Chlamydomonashemoglobin at acidic pH indicates that the proximal histidine-iron bond is broken. This is unusual because mammalian ferrous myoglobins and hemoglobins retain their proximal ligand in a similar pH range. Hence, the heme pocket structure and strain on the proximal ligand bond must be very different from other hemoglobins and myoglobins. Breaking of the proximal histidine ligation in Chlamydomonas hemoglobin is not caused by protein unfolding, indicated by the absence of any significant increase in the tryptophan fluorescence in the pH range 5–9.5. In addition, the heme does not fall out of the heme pocket, which would also be expected to result in a large increase in fluorescence. The optical absorption spectrum is also consistent with the above suggestion as the Soret band of the 4-coordinate species ofChlamydomonas hemoglobin is located at 421 nm in comparison to highly blue-shifted Soret band (∼380 nm) in acid-denatured deoxymyoglobin (42Tang Q. Kalsbeck W.A. Olson J.S. Bocian D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7047-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and model heme complexes in aqueous solutions. 4T. K. Das, unpublished results. Thus, inChlamydomonas hemoglobin in the absence of its axial ligation, the heme is stabilized in the pocket by non-bonded interactions. This is consistent with reports of stable 5-coordinate, hydroxide-bound heme groups in mutants of myoglobin and cytochromec peroxidase in which the proximal histidine has been replaced by glycine (43Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 44McRee D.E. Jensen G.M. Fitzgerald M.M. Siegel H.A. Goodin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12847-12851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein structures of these mutants do not unfold. On the other hand, in sperm whale deoxymyoglobin at low pH (pH < 4), unfolding has been proposed to be a prerequisite for cleavage of the proximal histidine bond (42Tang Q. Kalsbeck W.A. Olson J.S. Bocian D.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7047-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reversible formation of a 4-coordinate species at acid pH has been observed only in wild-type recombinant Chlamydomonas hemoglobin. None of the mutants examined formed this species, suggesting that each of the mutated heme pocket residues contributes toward stabilizing this unique structure.Neutral Ferrous Chlamydomonas HemoglobinThe optical spectrum of neutral ferrous Chlamydomonas hemoglobin (Fig. 5 and Table I) is consistent with a high spin 5- coordinate heme as found in other globins at neutral pH. Furthermore, the resonance Raman spectra supply strong evidence that the fifth ligand is histidine. A line at 232 cm−1 (Fig. 7) is assigned to the Fe-His stretching mode of this 5-coordinate species (45Argade P.V. Sassaroli M. Rousseau D.L. Inubushi T. Ikeda-Saito M. Lapidot A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6593-6596Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our assignment of this mode is based on the following lines of evidence. First, the resonance Raman spectrum in the high frequency region demonstrates that the ferrous protein is 5-coordinate. It is only under such conditions that the Fe-His mode appears in the resonance Raman spectrum. Second, EPR of the CN complex and of the NO complex establish that histidine is coordinated to the proximal position of both the ferric and ferrous hemes, respectively. Third, on photodissociation of the CO-bound species, the 232-cm−1 line, which was absent in the presence of CO, reappeared in the spectrum. The frequency of 232 cm−1 is very high for a hemoglobin under equilibrium conditions (46Rousseau D.L. Ondrias M.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1983; 12: 357-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is the same as in photodissociated hemoglobins prior to structural relaxation in which there is no strain on the proximal histidine to iron bond (47Friedman J.M. Rousseau D.L. Ondrias M.R. Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1982; 33: 471-491Crossref Google Scholar), and it is the same in peroxidases when the proton on the proximal histidine is either absent or strongly hydrogen-bonded to amino acid residues (48Smulevich G. Miller M.A. Kraut J. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9546-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we turn to the EPR spectra. The EPR spectrum of the ferric cyanide complex is consistent with a neutral imidazole such as that found in myoglobin and is not consistent with the deprotonated imidazole group. We note that the (first derivative) EPR spectrum of the FeNO protein (Fig. 10, upper) has poorly resolved hyperfine splittings commonly observed for NO-bound globins, whereas for the Fe-NO complexes of peroxidases, it is possible to resolve hyperfine splittings for both axial nitrogens without the use of second derivative analysis such as that shown in the lower part of Fig. 10 (23Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Erman J.E. Leigh Jr., J.S. Reed G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2447-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the comparison of these two spectroscopic studies, we conclude that the histidine adopts a perpendicular orientation to the heme, and there is no strain induced on the proximal histidine to iron bond in ferrousChlamydomonas hemoglobin at neutral pH. This should contribute to a high ligand affinity since the iron can be pulled into heme plane without the restraints imposed to it by the protein as occurs in most other hemoglobins.The spectra of the CO-bound form provide additional evidence in support of the assignment of a neutral imidazole as the proximal ligand. It is widely accepted that the Fe–CO and C—O stretching modes display an inverse correlation because of π-electron back-donation from the d-π (d xz and d yz) orbitals of iron to the π* orbitals of CO (12Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar, 49Yu N.T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 39-95Google Scholar). This results in an increase of the Fe–CO bond order and a concomitant decrease in the C—O bond order. The correlation between these two frequencies depends on the nature of the proximal ligand, as the electron density in the Fe-proximal ligand bond affects the Fe–CO bond order. The Fe–CO stretching mode, detected at 491 cm−1(Fig. 9), and the C—O stretching line at 1957 cm−1, are characteristic of a hemoglobin or myoglobin with an open heme pocket with no positive groups interacting directly with the bound CO. Most myoglobin mutants lacking a distal histidine display similar frequency of the Fe–CO stretching mode (50Morikis D. Champion P.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4791-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Fe—CO and C—O frequencies of Chlamydomonas hemoglobin fall on the correlation line (data not shown) which is characteristic for hemeproteins that contain histidine as the proximal ligand. The part of the Fe—COversus C—O frequency correlation line with the higher Fe—CO frequencies and the lower C—O frequencies is generally occupied by peroxidases that have a proximal imidazolate, and the part of the line with the lower Fe—CO frequencies and the higher C—O frequencies is occupied by hemeproteins that have a neutral proximal imidazole (51Wang J. Takahashi S. Hosler J.P. Mitchell D.M. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9819-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The fact that Chlamydomonas hemoglobin falls on the part of the correlation line with the lower Fe—CO frequencies and the higher C–O frequencies is consistent with a neutral imidazole character of its proximal ligand.In marked contrast to the 6-coordinate alkaline ferrous form which does not react directly with oxygen, the 5-coordinate ferrousChlamydomonas hemoglobin observed at neutral pH combines very rapidly, >107μm−1 s−1, with oxygen and carbon monoxide. These combination rates are comparable to those of sperm whale myoglobin, see Table II. The behavior ofChlamydomonas hemoglobin is analogous to that of rice hemoglobin, where a 5-coordinate mutant species, His(E7) → Leu, reacts more rapidly with oxygen than the native 6-coordinate ferrous species (52Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our finding bolsters the suggestion, made below, that 5-coordinate and 6-coordinate forms are in equilibrium, and only the 5-coordinate form is able to combine directly with ligands.Alkaline Ferrous Chlamydomonas HemoglobinThe clearly resolved optical spectrum of alkaline ferrous Chlamydomonashemoglobin is similar to those of a number of 6-coordinate low spin ferrous derivatives of hemeproteins and model compounds with oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms of the distal ligand coordinated to the heme iron. These include ferrous hemochromogens, ferrous cytochromesb and c, barley 5H. C. Lee, R. D. Hill, J. B. Wittenberg, and J. Peisach, unpublished observations. (53Duff S.M.G. Wittenberg J.B. Hill R.D.

The resonance Raman spectra are also consistent with 6-coordinate low spin heme in the alkaline form of ferrousChlamydomonas hemoglobin.Although we cannot make a definitive determination of the nature of the sixth ligand in alkaline ferrous Chlamydomonas hemoglobin, we can rule out several possibilities. Occupancy of the sixth coordination position by a component of the buffer is ruled out by the insensitivity of the optical and resonance Raman spectra to the nature of the buffers. Imidazole from histidine is an unlikely candidate, as there are no histidines in the distal pocket based on the amino acid sequence alignment (see Fig. 1). 6If the structure of Chlamydomonashemoglobin is very different from that of myoglobin and other hemoglobins, then it is possible that one of the two histidine residues of the G helix (see Fig. 1)"
https://openalex.org/W2080881172,"Class I P-glycoproteins (Pgp) confer multidrug resistance in tumors, but the physiologic function of Pgp in normal tissues remains uncertain. In cells derived from tissues that normally express Pgp, recent data suggest a possible role for Pgp in cholesterol trafficking from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum. We investigated the esterification of plasma membrane cholesterol under basal conditions and in response to sphingomyelinase treatment in transfected and drug-selected cell lines expressing differing amounts of functional class I Pgp. Compared with parental NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, cells transfected with human multidrug resistance (<i>MDR1</i>) Pgp esterified more cholesterol both without and with sphingomyelinase. Esterification also was greater in drug-selected Dox 6 myeloma cells than parental 8226 cells, which express low and non-immunodetectable amounts of Pgp, respectively. However, no differences in total plasma membrane cholesterol were detected. Transfection of fibroblasts with the multidrug resistance-associated protein (<i>MRP</i>) did not alter esterification, showing that cholesterol trafficking was not generally affected by ATP-binding cassette transporters. Steroidal (progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone) and non-steroidal antagonists (verapamil, PSC 833, LY335979, and GF120918) were evaluated for effects on both cholesterol trafficking and the net content of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-Sestamibi, a reporter of drug transport activity mediated by Pgp. In Pgp-expressing cells treated with nonselective and selective inhibitors, both the kinetics and efficacy of inhibition of cholesterol esterification differed from the antagonism of drug transport mediated by Pgp. Thus, although the data show that greater expression of class I Pgp within a given cell type is associated with enhanced esterification of plasma membrane cholesterol in support of a physiologic function for Pgp in facilitating cholesterol trafficking, the molecular mechanism is dissociated from the conventional drug transport activity of Pgp."
https://openalex.org/W1988859550,"Assembly and degradation of fibronectin-containing extracellular matrices are dynamic processes that are up-regulated during wound healing, embryogenesis, and metastasis. Although several of the early steps leading to fibronectin deposition have been identified, the mechanisms leading to the accumulation of fibronectin in disulfide-stabilized multimers are largely unknown. Disulfide-stabilized fibronectin multimers are thought to arise through intra- or intermolecular disulfide exchange. Several proteins involved in disulfide exchange reactions contain the sequence Cys-X-X-Cys in their active sites, including thioredoxin and protein-disulfide isomerase. The twelfth type I module of fibronectin (I12) contains a Cys-X-X-Cys motif, suggesting that fibronectin may have the intrinsic ability to catalyze disulfide bond rearrangement. Using an established protein refolding assay, we demonstrate here that fibronectin has protein-disulfide isomerase activity and that this activity is localized to the carboxyl-terminal type I module I12. I12 was as active on an equal molar basis as intact fibronectin, indicating that most of the protein-disulfide isomerase activity of fibronectin is localized to I12. Moreover, the protein-disulfide isomerase activity of fibronectin appears to be partially cryptic since limited proteolysis of I10–I12 increased its isomerase activity and dramatically enhanced the rate of RNase refolding. This is the first demonstration that fibronectin contains protein-disulfide isomerase activity and suggests that cross-linking of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix may be catalyzed by a disulfide isomerase activity contained within the fibronectin molecule.

Multimeric fibronectin is a major constituent of extracellular matrices found throughout the body and plays a role in a wide variety of biological events, including maintenance of endothelial cell integrity, platelet adhesion, and cell migration during blood vessel repair (1Hynes R.O.

It has been postulated that this cross-linking event occurs by a disulfide exchange mechanism involving type I or II modules in the 70-kDa amino terminus of the molecule (15McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12210-12215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regions involved in disulfide cross-linking of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix have not been identified (16Chen H. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

The fifth and sixth cysteines in the twelfth type I module of fibronectin (I12) are arranged in a similar sequence, Cys-Asp-Asn-Cys (21Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 1-24Google Scholar), suggesting that fibronectin may contain a disulfide isomerase activity. To determine whether fibronectin contains an intrinsic protein-disulfide isomerase activity, we assayed fibronectin as well as proteolytic and recombinant fragments of fibronectin for their ability to reactivate reduced and denatured RNase. Using an established protein refolding assay (22Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Boniface J.J. Reichert Jr., L.E. Science. 1990; 247: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we found that fibronectin contains a protein-disulfide isomerase- and thioredoxin-like activity and that this activity is localized to I12. This is the first demonstration that fibronectin contains protein-disulfide isomerase activity and suggests that fibronectin may catalyze disulfide bond rearrangement during its incorporation into the extracellular matrix. Gelatin-Sepharose, Sephadex G-25, and SP Sephadex C-25 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein-disulfide isomerase (107 kDa) (EC 5.3.4.1) and thioredoxin (11.7 kDa) were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). The remaining chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Human fibronectin was purified from a fibronectin and fibrinogen-rich by-product of factor VIII production as described (24Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 160/180-kDa proteolytic fragment of fibronectin was generated by limited trypsin digestion of intact fibronectin essentially as described (25Smith D.E. Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. Furcht L.T. J.

The 40-kDa (cathepsin and trypsin) gelatin-binding and 70-kDa (cathepsin) amino-terminal fragments of fibronectin were the generous gifts of Drs.

The baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was modified so that genes cloned into the multiple cloning site would be produced with six histidines at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The complementary oligonucleotides 5′-AATTCTTCACCATCACCATCACCATTGATCAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTGATCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGAAG-3′ (encoding the histidine tag and containing EcoRI and BamHI overhangs) were hybridized to each other and then ligated to pVL1392 that was previously digested with EcoRI and BamHI. I12 was amplified with the sense primer 5′-CCCAGATCTACTCTCCTCCCATCCACTCAAG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CCCGAATTC CAGCCCCAGGTCTGCGGCAG-3′ using I12/GE-1 as a template (30Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The sense primer has aBglII restriction enzyme site at the 5′-end (underlined letters), and the antisense primer has an EcoRI restriction enzyme site at the 5′-end (underlined letters). The base in boldface (C) was added to the antisense primer following the EcoRI site to maintain the correct reading frame. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA was subcloned into the baculovirus vector pVL1392/His6. Cloning I12 upstream of the EcoRI site resulted in the addition of Gly-Ile-Leu before the six-histidine tag. Amplified DNA contains sequences coding for the fibronectin signal sequence and the I12 coding sequence. DNA was sequenced (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) to ensure that no DNA mutations were introduced during polymerase chain reaction amplification and to verify the sequence of the modified pVL1392 vector. I12/pVL1392/His6 was cotransfected into insect cells with Baculogold DNA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant viruses were prepared using established methods (32Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-55Google Scholar, 33Miller D.W. Safer P. Miler L.K. Setlow J.A. Hollaender A. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Press, New York1986: 277-298Crossref Google Scholar). SF21 insect cells were grown under serum-free conditions using SF900-II (Life Technologies, Inc.). Conditioned medium containing recombinant I12 was applied to an SP Sephadex C-25 column equilibrated with 60 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris, pH 6.2. The column was washed with 250 mm NaCl and 100 mmTris, pH 6.2, and then eluted with 350 mm NaCl and 100 mm Tris, pH 6.2. Purified I12 was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline or into 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m Tris prior to use in the RNase refolding assay. Purity of proteins was assessed using a discontinuous Tricine 1The abbreviations used are: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow (34Schagger H. von Jagow G. Biochemistry. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) and visualized with either 0.025% Serva blue G (Serva, Paramus, NJ) or silver nitrate (35Wray W. Boulikas R. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). RNase was reduced and denatured essentially as described by Pigiet and Schuster (22Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNase A (30 mg) was incubated overnight in 6 m guanidine HCl containing 0.15m dithiothreitol and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.6, at room temperature. RNase was then purified on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 0.1% acetic acid. Peak samples were pooled, nitrogen-sparged, and then stored at −80 °C until use. Reduced and denatured RNase at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml (30 μm) was mixed with various proteins in a reaction mixture containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA as described (22Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Boniface J.J. Reichert Jr., L.E. Science. 1990; 247: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The extent of RNase reactivation was determined by removing aliquots of the reaction mixture at various time intervals and measuring RNase activity as described (23Boniface J.J. Reichert Jr., L.E. Science. 1990; 247: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Crook E.M. Mathias A.P. Rabin B.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The absorbance change at 284 nm was recorded in a final assay mixture that included 1.4 μm RNase and 0.44 mm cytidine 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0. No contaminating RNase activity was detected in any of the purified proteins used in the RNase refolding assay, as assessed by the inability of purified proteins to hydrolyze cytidine 2′:3′-cyclic monophosphate in the absence of added RNase (data not shown). It is also unlikely that purified proteins contained small amounts of contaminating redox reagents since the addition of 5 μmto 2 mm reduced or 4–100 μm oxidized dithiothreitol did not accelerate the rate of RNase refolding in comparison with controls (data not shown). Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences between groups were identified using the Tukey HSD multiple comparisonpost hoc test. Statistics were performed using Statistica software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Plots of substrate concentration versus initial velocity were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Enzfitter program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) or DeltaGraph (Deltapoint, Monterey, CA). Lineweaver-Burk plots thus derived were used to determine Vmaxand K m values. To determineVmax and K m, the standard RNase refolding assay (described above) was performed in the presence of fibronectin (3 μm), protein-disulfide isomerase (1.5 μm), or thioredoxin (30 μm) using RNase concentrations ranging from 15 to 75 μm. At various time intervals, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed, and the amount of active RNase was determined by measuring the change in absorbance at 284 nm over time (as described above). A standard curve was generated in which the change in absorbance at 284 nm over time was recorded for various concentrations of native RNase. Initial velocities for the Michaelis-Menten plots (μm native RNase generated per min) were calculated from the slope of the line derived from the plot of native RNase concentration versus time. The 19- or 40-kDa fragment was incubated with α-chymotrypsin at a protein ratio of 1:200 (w/w) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (37Fahrney D.E. Gold A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 997-1000Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Samples of digested proteins were removed and analyzed by Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to use in the RNase refolding assay. Soluble protomeric fibronectin is believed to be stabilized in the extracellular matrix as a result of disulfide cross-linking. Fibronectin contains a Cys-X-X-Cys motif in I12 (21Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 1-24Google Scholar). This motif has been identified as the active-site sequence in other proteins that exhibit disulfide isomerase activity (17Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C.A. Raines R.T. Guzman N.A.

To determine whether fibronectin has disulfide isomerase activity, we used an established protein refolding assay. This assay has been widely used to assess the isomerase activity of thioredoxin (22Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rabin B.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). During the process of RNase refolding, non-native as well as native disulfide bonds form (22Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,40Anfinsen C.B. Haber E. Sela M. White Jr., F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, both disulfide oxidation as well as isomerization reactions must occur to achieve the native folded state. Intact fibronectin at a concentration of 4 μm enhanced the refolding of RNase at a rate similar to that of 1 μmprotein-disulfide isomerase (Fig. 1) and 30 μm thioredoxin (data not shown). A control protein, ovalbumin, which contains disulfide bonds as well as free sulfhydryl residues, but lacks the Cys-X-X-Cys motif, showed little activity in this assay (Fig. 1). The ability of fibronectin to catalyze RNase refolding was concentration-dependent. Intact fibronectin at a concentration of 3 μm had ∼84% of the activity of 4 μm fibronectin; 2 μmfibronectin had ∼74% of the activity (data not shown). To directly compare the ability of fibronectin, protein-disulfide isomerase, and thioredoxin to catalyze the refolding of reduced and denatured RNase,kcat and K m values were determined. The ability of fibronectin to catalyze RNase refolding followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 2B, inset). The reactions catalyzed by protein-disulfide isomerase (Fig. 2A,inset) and thioredoxin (data not shown) also followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 2 and data not shown) were used to determine the Vmax,K m, and kcat/K m values for each of these proteins (Table I). As shown in Table I, fibronectin is ∼9-fold more active than thioredoxin and 9-fold less active than protein-disulfide isomerase in catalyzing RNase refolding.Figure 2Kinetic analysis of RNase refolding by fibronectin and protein-disulfide isomerase. For the Lineweaver-Burk plots, the RNase refolding assay was performed using various concentrations of reduced and denatured RNase in the presence of 1.5 μm protein-disulfide isomerase (A) or 3 μm fibronectin (B). The data are plotted as 1/v versus 1/[S], and a linear fit of the data was calculated using DeltaGraph.

Open table in a new tab The standard RNase refolding assay was performed using 15–75 μm reduced and denatured RNase in the presence of 3 μm fibronectin, 30 μm thioredoxin, or 1.5 μm protein-disulfide isomerase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine K m, Vmax, and kcat (Vmax/enzyme concentration). To localize the disulfide isomerase activity within fibronectin, proteolytic fragments of fibronectin encompassing the entire fibronectin molecule (Fig. 3,inset) were assayed for activity. Fragments of fibronectin that demonstrated the most activity in this assay were the 160/180- and 19-kDa fragments, which contain the carboxyl-terminal type I modules I10–I12 (Fig. 3). The 40- and 70-kDa fragments, which contain disulfides, but do not contain the Cys-X-X-Cys motif, had activity only slightly higher than the control protein, ovalbumin (Fig. 3). The central 110-kDa cell-binding fragment of fibronectin, which contains one free sulfhydryl residue, but no disulfide bonds (21Petersen T.E. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 1-24Google Scholar), had little activity in this assay (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the protein-disulfide isomerase activity of fibronectin is localized to the 19-kDa fragment that contains I10–I12. I12 is located within the 19-kDa fragment and contains the Cys-X-X-Cys motif. Therefore, to determine whether the disulfide isomerase activity of the 19-kDa fragment could be further localized to I12, recombinant I12 was generated using a baculovirus expression system and tested in the RNase refolding assay. As shown in Fig. 4, I12 at a concentration of 4 μm was more active than 4 μm intact fibronectin and as active as 1 μmprotein-disulfide isomerase. These data suggest that most or all of fibronectin's protein-disulfide isomerase activity is localized to I12. Deposition of fibronectin into the extracellular matrix is a highly regulated process (44Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J.

If fibronectin's protein-disulfide isomerase activity is involved in cross-linking of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix, then it would be expected that its protein-disulfide isomerase activity would also be tightly regulated. One mechanism by which this activity may be regulated is through conformation-induced activation. In such a model, isomerase activity would be partially masked in the native soluble fibronectin molecule and enhanced by conformational changes induced upon binding of fibronectin to cell surfaces. If fibronectin's protein-disulfide isomerase activity is partially cryptic, limited proteolysis might enhance its protein-disulfide isomerase activity by generating smaller fragments whose conformations are distinct from those in the intact molecule. Others have shown that proteolytic fragments of proteins can have enhanced or novel activities when compared with native proteins (49Schor S.L. Ellis I. Banyard J. Humphries M.J. Mosher D.F.

https://openalex.org/W2033749858,"We have shown previously that the octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) activates the AT1 receptor through an induced-fit mechanism (Noda, K., Feng, Y. H., Liu, X. P., Saad, Y., Husain, A., and Karnik, S. S. (1996)Biochemistry 35, 16435–16442). In this activation process, interactions between Tyr4 and Phe8 of Ang II with Asn111 and His256 of the AT1receptor, respectively, are essential for agonism. Here we show that aromaticity, primarily, and size, secondarily, of the Tyr4side chain are important in activating the receptor. Activation analysis of AT1 receptor position 111 mutants by various Ang II position 4 analogues suggests that an amino-aromatic bonding interaction operates between the residue Asn111 of the AT1 receptor and Tyr4 of Ang II. Degree and potency of AT1 receptor activation by Ang II can be recreated by a reciprocal exchange of aromatic and amide groups between positions 4 and 111 of Ang II and the AT1 receptor, respectively. In several other bonding combinations, set up between Ang II position 4 analogues and receptor mutants, the gain of affinity is not accompanied by gain of function. Activation analysis of position 256 receptor mutants by Ang II position 8 analogues suggests that aromaticity of Phe8 and His256 side chains is crucial for receptor activation; however, a stacked rather than an amino-aromatic interaction appears to operate at this switch locus. Interaction between these residues, unlike the Tyr4:Asn111 interaction, plays an insignificant role in ligand docking. We have shown previously that the octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) activates the AT1 receptor through an induced-fit mechanism (Noda, K., Feng, Y. H., Liu, X.

A central question in characterizing the biochemistry and action of the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) 1The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II (DRVYIHPF); IP, inositol phosphate; Sar, sarcosine; R, inactive receptor conformation; R′, unconstrained receptor conformation; R*, activated receptor conformation; Cha, β-cyclohexylalanine; GPCR, the G-protein-coupled receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium is the mechanism by which the Tyr4 and Phe8 residues mediate the biological functions of Ang II. In vivo, Ang II is an important regulator of mean arterial pressure, water-electrolyte balance, and cardiovascular homeostasis. A clear understanding of the molecular mechanism of Ang II activation of cell surface receptors is necessary for the development of therapeutic agents to treat disorders such as high blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy. A recently proposed model, based on NMR constraints of locked Ang II analogues, suggests that a very large pharmacophore spanning the entire structure of Ang II is presented to the receptor. Every other Ang II residue is involved in receptor contact. Only the Tyr4 and Phe8 side chains are considered agonist “switches” because analogues of Ang II function as agonists in vivo if the position 4 residue is tyrosine and the position 8 residue is a phenylalanine. Modifications of Tyr4 and Phe8in Ang II give rise to antagonists in vivo that display high affinity for the Ang II receptor but at higher concentrations elicit partial receptor agonism (1Marshall G.R.

AT1 receptor is necessary and sufficient for regulating blood pressure, and activates intracellular inositol phosphate (IP) production via coupling to a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (3Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benefield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II-binding pocket consists of transmembrane domain and the extracellular loops. Two salt-bridge interactions, one between the α-COO– group of Phe8 of Ang II and Lys199 of the AT1 receptor and the other between the Arg2 of Ang II and the Asp281 of the AT1 receptor, have been assigned. These salt-bridge interactions are not critical for receptor activation. Thus, a charge-separation mechanism described for the light activation of rhodopsin and the agonist activation of structurally related monoamine receptors is not a valid paradigm in the Ang II activation of the AT1 receptor. Instead, the interactions of the Tyr4 and Phe8 residues of Ang II initiate the AT1 receptor activation process (6Karnik S.S. Husain A. Graham R.M. Clin. Exp. Pharm. Physiol.

Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28511-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the bonds between Ang II and the receptor that switch the AT1 receptor to its active state conformation is not clearly defined. In this report, we examine the hypothesis that amino-aromatic bonding between the agonist “switches” Tyr4 and Phe8 of Ang II and the respective agonist switch-binding residues Asn111 and His256 of the AT1 receptor is responsible for initiating receptor activation. The absence of amino-aromatic interaction should primarily affect the receptor activation process. Analogues bearing saturated unnatural amino acid analogue β-cyclohexylalanine (Cha) substituents at the X 4 and X 8 positions of Ang II were synthesized and tested with wild-type and AT1receptor mutants with amino acid replacements at position Asn111 or His256. Cha does not have a negatively charged planar aromatic ring but through its saturated ring provides nearly the same size and hydrophobicity as the aromatic rings of Tyr and Phe. We show that Cha replacements at either position 4 or position 8 of Ang II principally hinder ligand-dependent activation of the receptor. Oligonucleotides were obtained from the oligonucleotide synthesis core facility of the Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and Ang II were purchased from Bachem. [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method and purified, as described previously (8Noda K. Saad Y. Kinoshita A. Boyle T.P. Graham R.M. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2284-2289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was 2200 Ci/mmol. Losartan was a gift from DuPont Merck Co., Wilmington, DE. Analogues of [Sar1]Ang II were synthesized and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography purified by the peptide synthesis core facility at the Lerner Research Institute. The accuracy of synthesis was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry of the pure analogues using a PE-Sciex model AP1 III spectrometer. Concentration of the peptide in stock solutions was estimated by molarity of individual amino acids determined against known standards on an amino acid analyzer. To evaluate the role of the aromaticity of Tyr4 and Phe8 rings without a change of residue size, β-cyclohexylalanine, an unnatural analogue of Phe, was substituted at these positions to obtain [Sar1,Cha4]Ang II and [Sar1,Cha8]Ang II. In addition, we synthesized three analogues of [Sar1]Ang II containing position 4 side chain size modifications to evaluate the influence of size; [Sar1,Phe4]Ang II serves as a control for the size difference between Tyr and Cha. [Sar1,di-I-Tyr4]Ang II analogue retains the aromatic ring but bulkier than Tyr. The smaller side chain substituted Ang II analogues, [Sar1,Ala4]Ang II and [Sar1,Ile4]Ang II both lack an aromatic ring. The surface area accessible for interaction with the receptor, defined as the area accessible to a sphere of water molecule of 1.4 Å in diameter (14Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structural and Molecular Principles. Freeman and Co., New York1984: 2-60Google Scholar), was estimated in each case as described below.

The IP response values shown are obtained at identical levels of receptor/cell. The maximal response (100%) shown is at 10 μm concentration of each ligand is unaffected by increases in ligand concentration. Loss of aromaticity leads to diminished stimulation. An apparent linear correlation between the residual IP stimulation and the surface area of the side chain at position 8 of Ang II was observed.

The side chain size in each case is drawn to scale using Chem Office®. The values shown in each case are:K d (nm; top row), relative activation (% IP; middle row) and the EC50 (nm, bottom row). The values are derived from concentration-response curves in which ligand concentrations were varied from 10−10mto 10−4m. The IP response produced by the wild-type receptor by 10 μm [Sar1]Ang II (see Fig. 1 for cpm values) was taken as 100%. In each experiment, this control was included for comparison and values are normalized for variations in IP formation in basal and mock-transfected cells. Relative activation value close to 100% indicates that activation of the mutant by the analogue and [Sar1]Ang II are nearly identical. Note that substitution with smaller residues, such as Gly. Ala, Ser, and Cys for Asn111, gives rise to a partially activated receptor that binds almost all Ang II analogues with high affinity, and maximal stimulation of these mutant receptors requires Ang II, but not its agonist side chains. Hence, those mutations are not included in the current analysis (32Feng Y.-H. Miura S.-I. Husain A. Karnik S.

For competition binding studies, membranes expressing the wild-type receptor or the mutants were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 300 pm125I–[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and various concentrations of the agonist or antagonist. All binding experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a 250-μl volume. Nonspecific binding of the radioligand measured in the presence of 10 μm127I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was <3–5% of the total binding. After equilibrium was reached, the binding experiments were stopped by filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, which were extensively washed further with binding buffer to wash the free radioligand. The bound ligand fraction was determined from the counts per minute (cpm) remaining on the membrane. Equilibrium binding kinetics were determined using the computer program Ligand ™.

Immunoblotting experiments (data not shown) indicated that the expression of the mutant AT1 receptors described in this report were ±20% of the level of the wild-type receptor expression. This level of variability in receptor polypeptide expression did not cause significant variation in cell surface receptor numbers (≈1.4–1.6 × 105 sites/cell), which was determined from acid-labile125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding in intact cells. The Bmax estimated varied ≈2-fold (see Table I). Statistical analysis of 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding kinetics was best fit to a one-site model, which indicated that a homogeneous population of wild-type and mutant receptors were produced in COS1 cells. Affinity of the wild-type AT1receptor to the radioligand was 0.37 ± 0.02 nm. The K d values for the agonist [Sar1]Ang II and the native hormone Ang II were 0.33 ± 0.02 and 1.48 ± 0.05 nm, respectively. The measured affinities did not change significantly in the presence of analogues of GTP, since our membrane preparations have been EDTA washed to uncouple G-proteins. Hence, the K d values in Table I represent the intrinsic affinity of the receptor in the absence of G-protein coupling. The expressed AT1 receptor bound the nonpeptide antagonist losartan with high affinity (K d, 10 ± 2 nm) and did not bind the AT2receptor-selective antagonist PD123319 (K d>10−5m). The ability of the AT1receptor to activate IP production in COS1 cells is shown in Fig. 1.Table ILigand affinity of Asn111 and His256 substitution mutantsReceptorExpression (Bmax)K d[Sar1]Ang II[Sar1,Cha4] Ang II[Sar1,Cha8] Ang IIpmol/mgnmWild type5.4 ± 0.100.33 ± 0.0275.9 ± 6.60.47 ± 0.04N111K5.8 ± 0.160.77 ± 0.1169.3 ± 1.6NDN111Q3.5 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.0131.3 ± 3.4NDN111H5.1 ± 0.070.24 ± 0.0134.3 ± 2.8NDN111I3.1 ± 0.130.52 ± 0.021.98 ± 0.10NDN111F3.8 ± 0.771.67 ± 0.212.18 ± 0.14NDN111Y4.3 ± 0.411.09 ± 0.113.06 ± 0.20NDH256A4.3 ± 0.200.36 ± 0.08ND1.69 ± 0.24H256Q4.1 ± 0.500.58 ± 0.10ND1.08 ± 0.17H256Y4.4 ± 0.140.13 ± 0.02ND0.30 ± 0.04The K d and Bmax values represent the mean ± S.E. obtained from three to five independent transfection experiments performed in duplicate.Bmax values represent total receptors present in plasma and endoplasmic reticulum membranes.

Expression plasmid concentrations, >4 μg of DNA/dish, did not further increase the maximal IP produced, as well as cell surface receptor number (see above). All IP measurements shown in this report were carried out at 10 μg of expression plasmid DNA/dish. Therefore, the maximal IP values given in each case truly represent the magnitude of signal transduction and not the differences in cell surface receptor numbers. The basal IP production without [Sar1]Ang II treatment is <5 ± 0.3% when compared with the maximal IP response (taken as 100%) elicited by [Sar1]Ang II concentrations >10−7m in transfected COS1 cells. Interaction of [X 4]Ang II analogues with the wild-type AT1 suggests that aromaticity and the size provided by Tyr4 in Ang II are critical for function. The affinity of the AT1 receptor for [Sar1,Cha4]Ang II and [Sar1,Phe4]Ang II (the size of Phe is nearly the same as Cha) was 230- and 2-fold lower, respectively, than the affinity of [Sar1]Ang II (see Fig. 2A), indicating that the aromatic ring is an important determinant of affinity. Size restriction in the interaction of aromatic group with the receptor is evident from 328-fold reduction of affinity for [Sar1,di-I-Tyr4]Ang II (with an ≈40-Å increase of accessible area). It is known that the addition of iodine atom on the Tyr4 ring alters the interaction with the receptor. [Sar1,mono-I-Tyr4]Ang II is a full agonist with slightly improved affinity, while [Sar1,di-I-Tyr4]Ang II is a partial agonist with lower affinity. Samanen et al. (18Samanen J. Cash T. Narindray D.

Chem. 1984; 27: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) also reported that different halide modifications of the position 4 aromatic ring of Ang II increase the electronegativity associated with a reduction of affinity for the receptor. The 458- and 710-fold reduced affinity, respectively, for aliphatic amino acid-substituted analogues [Sar1,Ala4]Ang II and [Sar1,Ile4]Ang II is also consistent with size and aromaticity constraints. The binding energy contributions for the interactions were calculated as described in legend to Table II. The energy of interactions indicates that the aromatic ring in Tyr4 contributed ≈2.8 kcal mol−1, whereas the hydroxyl group in Tyr4 contributed ≈0.4 kcal mol−1 and the surface area (based on comparison between Cha4 and Ile4) accounted for ≈0.6–1.0 kcal mol−1 (see Table II).Table IIActivation of AT1 receptor by different types of interactions between [X4] of ligand and [X111] of the receptorReceptor residue[X 4]Ang II residueΔΔGFunctionKcal−M% IPA"

We have isolated the murine cDNA clones encoding p38-δ MAPK, and we have localized the p38-δ gene to mouse chromosome 17A3-B and human chromosome 6p21.3. By using Northern and in situ hybridization, we have examined the expression of p38-δ in the mouse adult tissues and embryos. p38-δ was expressed primarily in the lung, testis, kidney, and gut epithelium in the adult tissues. Although p38-δ was expressed predominantly in the developing gut and the septum transversum in the mouse embryo at 9.5 days, its expression began to be expanded to many specific tissues in the 12.5-day embryo. At 15.5 days, p38-δ was expressed virtually in most developing epithelia in embryos, suggesting that p38-δ is a developmentally regulated MAPK. Interestingly, p38-δ and p38-α were similar serine/threonine kinases but differed in substrate specificity. Overall, p38-δ resembles p38-γ, whereas p38-β resembles p38-α. Moreover, p38-δ is activated by environmental stress, extracellular stimulants, and MAPK kinase-3, -4, -6, and -7, suggesting that p38-δ is a unique stress-responsive protein kinase.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The first p38 MAPK (hereafter designated as p38-α) was identified initially in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and was found later to share significant homology with the yeast HOG1 kinase (7Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 41Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the human p38-α homologues (CSBPs) were isolated by using radiolabeled and radiophotoaffinity labeled pyridinyl imidazole compounds, which block inflammatory cytokine biosynthesis by monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (8Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Another member (p38-β) of the p38 MAPK family was identified and cloned, which is very homologous (with 75% amino acid identity) to p38-α (42Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The third member (p38-γ) of the p38 MAPK family was recently isolated as ERK-6 (43Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.-F. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and SAPK3 (44Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), which share significant homology (63% amino acid identity) with p38-α. All these p38 MAPK members contain a characteristic Thr-Gly-Tyr motif within the kinase subdomain VIII. Here, we present a murine p38 MAPK family member, p38-δ, whose sequence is significantly homologous to p38-α (63% amino acid identity). We showed that expression of p38-δ mRNA was regulated in different developmental stages, suggesting that p38-δ is a developmentally regulated MAPK. We characterized p38-δ by determining its chromosomal location, stimulation by extracellular stimuli, and activation by upstream kinases (MKKs). Moreover, we compared substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity between p38-δ and p38-α, and we showed that they are discrete. Our results indicate that p38-δ is a unique stress-responsive protein kinase. A rat 1.3-kilobase pair expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA clone with ∼62% homology to mouse p38-β (GenBankTM accession number D83073) cDNA was used as a probe to screen a rat lung cDNA library in λgt11 phage vector (CLONTECHLaboratories). For hybridization, replicate filters were prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in Express hybridization buffer (CLONTECH Laboratories) and hybridized 12 h at 68 °C in the same solution with the [32P]dCTP-labeled probe. After hybridization, the filters were washed several times at high stringency, at 65 °C in 0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC (1× SSC, 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), and subjected to autoradiography. Several positive clones were picked and purified after screening 4 × 106 phages. The cDNA inserts of these positive phage clones were subsequently subcloned into pCR3.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen). After analysis of the inserts, the longest cDNA clone was sequenced on both strands, using a PCR procedure employing fluorescent dideoxynucleotides and a model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Similarly, for human p38-δ cDNA cloning, the same EST cDNA probe was used to screen a human lung cDNA library in λTripEx phage vector (CLONTECH Laboratories). Several positive clones were obtained, and the cDNA inserts of these phage clones were converted in vivo into pTripEx plasmid vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A candidate full-length cDNA clone was sequenced on both strands as described above. Sequence comparisons were aligned with the Bestfit program of the GCG sequence analysis software package (Wisconsin Package version 9.0). The Flag-tagged p38-δ expression plasmid was constructed from the murine p38-δ cDNA by the PCR technique using oligonucleotides 5′-AAGCTTGTCGACGCCACCATGGATTATAAAGATGATGATGATAAAAGCCTCATTCGGAAAAGGGGCTTC-3′ and 5′-TATTGCGGCCGCTTATCACTGCAGCTTCATCCCACTTCG-3′ as primers to incorporate a Flag epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) at the amino terminus of p38-δ. The PCR-generated product was cloned into the expression vector pCR3.1 plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and designated pFlag-p38-δ. The Flag-tagged p38-δ(AGF) mutant expression plasmid was generated from pFlag-p38-δ plasmid by the PCR technique using oligonucleotides 5′-GATGCGGAGATGGCTGGCTTTGTGGTGACCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGGTCACCACAAAGCCAGCCATCTCCGCATC-3′ as primers to replace the Thr180-Gly-Tyr182 motif with Ala180-Gly-Phe182, using a QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences of these cDNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing on both strands as described. The pVA1 (containing the adenovirus VA1 RNA gene) plasmid was obtained as described previously (45Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Flag-tagged p38-α, MKK-3, MKK-4, MKK-6, MKK-7, and MEK kinase-5 (ASK-1) expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. R. Geronsin (Amgen Inc.). ATF-2-(1–96) and GST-MAPKAP kinase-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. PHAS-1 and p38-α inhibitor were purchased from Stratagene. Myelin basic protein (MBP), anisomycin, and Na3VO4 were purchased from Sigma. GST-c-Jun was prepared as described previously (45Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and anti-Flag M2 mAb was purchased from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems. Human TNF-α, IL-1α, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from R & D Systems. Poly(A)+ RNAs from various mouse tissues were obtained from CLONTECHLaboratories. Each sample (2 μg) was denatured and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC as described (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Murine p38-δ or human β-actin cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP to a specific activity of approximately 108 dpm/μg. Membranes were hybridized with either the p38-δ or β-actin cDNA probe, then washed at high stringency, at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and subjected to autoradiography. Probes were removed in 0.5% SDS at 95–100 °C. ISH was performed as described (47Lyons G.E. Schiaffino S. Sassoon D. Barton P. Buckingham M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2427-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetuses and tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight, dehydrated, and infiltrated with paraffin. Serial sections at thickness of 5–7 μm were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and post-fixed. The tissue sections were digested with proteinase K, post-fixed, treated with triethanolamine/acetic anhydride, washed, and dehydrated. The cRNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized cDNA templates to generate antisense and sense probes, according to manufacturer's conditions (Ambion) and labeled with35S-UTP (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cRNA transcripts larger than 200 nucleotides were subjected to alkali hydrolysis to give a mean size of 70 nucleotides. The tissue slides were hybridized overnight at 52 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 0.3m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaPO4, 5 mm EDTA, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, 50 μg/ml total yeast RNA, and 5–7.5 × 104 cpm/μl 35S-labeled cRNA probe. The tissue slides were subjected to stringent washing at 65 °C in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline before treatment with 20 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Following washes in 2× SSC and 0.1× SSC at 37 °C for 10 min, the slides were dehydrated and dipped in Kodak NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and exposed for 2–3 weeks in light-tight boxes with desiccant at 4 °C. Photographic development was carried out in Kodak D-19. The tissue slides were counterstained lightly with toluidine blue and analyzed using both light and dark field optics of a microscope. Sense control cRNA probes indicate the background levels of the hybridization signal. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells to be transfected were plated the day before transfection at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids (10 μg each plasmid per dish) as indicated with pVA1 (10 μg per dish) to enhance transient protein expression, using the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Specialty Media, Inc.). The transfected 293T cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For cell stimulation, 293T cells were treated with human TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 10 min before harvest. Cells were lysed in WCE lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim) or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Soluble lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared using Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) and then incubated with specific antibodies. After 16 h of incubation, immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of Gamma-Bind Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then washed four times with lysis buffer. Subsequently, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE (10%), electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Novex, Inc.), and probed with the corresponding rabbit antiserum or mouse monoclonal antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antisera conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Pierce). Immunocomplex kinase assays were carried out as described previously (48Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.-P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2277-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Specifically, cellular p38-δ or p38-α proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-Flag mAb and protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad) in WCE lysis buffer. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were collected and washed twice with WCE lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Mops, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Pellets were then mixed with 5 μg of substrate, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 15 μm unlabeled ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The substrates included MBP, GST-c-Jun, GST-MAPKAP kinase-2, PHAS-1, and ATF-2-(1–96) in the absence or presence of p38-α inhibitor (SB203580). The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by boiling in an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The phosphorylated proteins obtained from immunocomplex kinase assays were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The spots containing phosphoproteins on the membranes were excised according to the bands on autoradiograms and then hydrolyzed in 50 μl of 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The supernatant was lyophilized and dissolved in 6 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid and 7.8% acetic acid) containing cold phosphoamino acids as markers. The phosphoamino acids were resolved electrophoretically in two dimensions using a thin layer cellulose (TLC) plate with two pH systems as described (49Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The markers were visualized by staining with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone, and the 32P-labeled residues were detected by autoradiography. Lymphocytes isolated from human blood were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. The lymphocyte cultures were treated with bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml, Sigma) to synchronize the cell population. The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to release the block and recultured at 37 °C for 6 h in α-minimal essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma). The cells were harvested, and the cell slides were prepared by using standard procedures including hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air-drying. The procedure for FISH detection was performed as described previously (50Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 51Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma (Berl .). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h. After RNase treatment, the slides were denatured in 70% formamide in 2× SSC for 2 min at 70 °C followed by dehydration with ethanol. DNA probes were labeled with biotinylated dATP at 15 °C for 1 h, using the Life Technologies, Inc., BioNick labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Probes were denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate and loaded onto the denatured chromosomal slides. After 16–20 h hybridization, the slides were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories), and the signal was amplified as described (51Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma (Berl .). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). FISH signals and the 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) banding patterns were recorded separately by taking photographs, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with the DAPI-banded chromosomes (52McDonnell P.C. DiLella A.G. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Genomics. 1995; 29: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A 1328-bp partial cDNA sequence with high homology (∼62% amino acid identity) to the kinase domain of mouse p38-β cDNA was identified from the Amgen EST data base of a rat colon cDNA library. Initially, we termed this cDNA an IKK-like kinase. By using this rat cDNA as a probe, we have isolated a putative full-length cDNA clone from a rat"
https://openalex.org/W2009324769,"We describe the cloning of a wheat cDNA (TaPSS1) that encodes a phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) and provides the first strong evidence for the existence of this enzyme in a higher eukaryotic cell. The cDNA was isolated on its ability to confer increased resistance to aluminum toxicity when expressed in yeast. The sequence of the predicted protein encoded byTaPSS1 shows homology to PSS from both yeast and bacteria but is distinct from the animal PSS enzymes that catalyze base-exchange reactions. In wheat, Southern blot analysis identified the presence of a small family of genes that cross-hybridized to TaPSS1,and Northern blots showed that aluminum induced TaPSS1expression in root apices. Expression of TaPSS1complemented the yeast cho1 mutant that lacks PSS activity and altered the phospholipid composition of wild type yeast, with the most marked effect being increased abundance of phosphatidylserine (PS). Arabidopsis thaliana leaves overexpressingTaPSS1 showed a marked enhancement in PSS activity, which was associated with increased biosynthesis of PS at the expense of both phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol. Unlike mammalian cells where PS accumulation is tightly regulated even when the capacity for PS biosynthesis is increased, plant cells accumulated large amounts of PS when TaPSS1 was overexpressed. High levels ofTaPSS1 expression in Arabidopsis and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) led to the appearance of necrotic lesions on leaves, which may have resulted from the excessive accumulation of PS. The cloning of TaPSS1 now provides evidence that the yeast pathway for PS synthesis exists in some plant tissues and provides a tool for understanding the pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis and their regulation in plants.

Although phosphatidylserine (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction is a minor phospholipid component of plant membranes (1Galliard T. Ansell G. Hawthorne J. Dawson R. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier Scientific Publisher B.V., Amsterdam1973: 253-288Google Scholar), it is likely to have roles in addition to contributing to the structure of lipid bilayers. In mammalian and yeast cells, PS is normally distributed asymmetrically across the plasma membrane with the inner surface containing most of the PS (2Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 3Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Externalization of PS on the plasma membrane is an early indicator of apoptosis in mammalian cells (4Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J.

Phosphatidylserine is required for activation of protein kinase C (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar), is implicated as a key element in the coagulation of blood (3Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and also allows phagocytes to recognize apoptotic cells (7Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C. Warner M.L. Henson P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). By comparison, there is little information available describing the roles of PS in plants although a recent report describes the migration of PS to the outer surface of the plasma membrane being associated with apoptosis in plant cells (8O'Brien I.E.W. Baguley B.C. Murray B.G. Morris B.A.M. Ferguson I.B. Plant J. 1998; 13: 803-814Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PS is synthesized by the action of phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS; CDP-diacylglycerol:l-serineo-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.8) that catalyzes the condensation of l-serine with CDP-diacylglycerol (9Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PS in yeast is the first committed step in the major pathway for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC; Fig. 1A), the two most abundant phospholipids of yeast membranes. In mammalian cells, by contrast, PS is synthesized by exchange of the polar head group of an existing phospholipid with l-serine (10Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in a so-called base-exchange reaction (PSS-BE; Fig. 1B) whereas PC and PE are synthesized by pathways that do not involve PS (11Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Although the enzymes involved in the synthesis of PS by both types of reactions share the same trivial name, phosphatidylserine synthase, the biochemistry of the reactions is different, and there is minimal amino acid sequence similarity between the two types of enzymes.In plant cells the major pathway for the synthesis of PS is uncertain and may differ according to the type of tissue and species in question (12Moore Jr., T.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 235-259Crossref Google Scholar). A PSS-base exchange enzyme activity has been demonstrated in castor bean endosperm (13Moore Jr T.S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1975; 56: 177-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another report described a PSS activity in extracts of spinach leaves (14Marshall M.O. Kates M. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but there are no subsequent reports to verify the presence of PSS in other plant species or tissues. Feeding of radiolabeled precursors to plant cells has produced equivocal results in identifying the major pathways for phospholipid biosynthesis. Some results have suggested that PC is synthesized primarily by pathways that do not require PS, but it has not been possible to completely rule out that PS contributes to PC biosynthesis (15Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kinney A.J. Moore Jr., T.S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1987; 84: 78-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Despite the paucity of direct experimental evidence in plants, a dogma has developed that PS synthesis in higher eukaryotic cells, including plant cells, proceeds exclusively by the base-exchange pathway (11Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 17Yamashita S. Nikawa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).As a result of screening a wheat cDNA library for clones that conferred enhanced aluminum resistance to yeast, we isolated a cDNA encoding a PSS that catalyzes the formation of PS by the condensation of CDP-diacylglycerol with l-serine. The cDNA complements a yeast mutant defective in PSS activity, and the putative translation product shows homology to PSS proteins from yeast and bacteria. Heterologous expression in plants leads to increased synthesis of PS, and high levels of expression are associated with lesions on the leaves.DISCUSSIONFour lines of evidence support the conclusion that the wheatTaPSS1 gene encodes a functional PSS enzyme as follows: (i) there is homology between the protein encoded by TaPSS1 and known PSS proteins from yeast and bacteria; (ii) TaPSS1complements the yeast cho1 mutant; (iii) overexpression ofTaPSS1 in plants and in a disrupted cho1 mutant of yeast yields measurable PSS activity in both types of organisms; and (iv) overexpression of TaPSS1 in yeast and plants changes the phospholipid composition in both these organisms with an increase in PS content being the most marked effect. Our cloning of a functional plant PSS gene provides the first strong evidence for the existence of PSS in higher eukaryotic cells. The role of PSS in wheat could be primarily for PS biosynthesis; or alternatively, in some plant species or tissues, it may play a key role in the biosynthesis of PC, as occurs in yeast.Complementation of the yeast cho1 mutant provided strong evidence for TaPSS1 gene function. The fact that there is a single gene encoding PSS in the yeast genome (39Letts V.A. Klig L.S. Bae-Lee M. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7279-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) precludes the possibility that TaPSS1 is enhancing endogenous PSS in yeast by transactivation of another gene. A marked difference between yeast PSS and wheat PSS is the absence of an acidic N-terminal sequence in the wheat protein (Fig. 2). However, overexpression of a truncated form of the yeast CHO1 gene that lacks sequence encoding the acidic N-terminal region of the protein was also able to complement the cho1 mutant. The truncated yeast gene produced less than one-tenth the amount of active enzyme produced by the wild type gene, even though comparable amounts of protein were produced by expression of the genes (40Sperka-Gottlieb C. Fasch E.-V. Kuchler K. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Yeast. 1990; 6: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This lower activity was attributed to the truncated form not being correctly inserted into membranes. In our case, the wheat TaPSS1 gene yielded even greater enzyme activity than the wild type CHO1 gene when overexpressed in yeast (TableI). The significance of the lack of an acidic domain in the wheat enzyme is not known, but this does not appear to limit its activity in yeast.The plasma membrane is a primary barrier to the entry of aluminum into cells. A change in its lipid composition could conceivably alter the resistance of the cell by excluding aluminum, by altering the activity of specific membrane proteins involved in confering aluminum resistance, or by altering the response of the yeast cell to external stimuli. Aluminum ions bind to phospholipids, and the binding affinity under acidic conditions is greatest for anionic phospholipids such as PG and PI (41Jones D.L. Kochian L.V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several features of our results suggest further links between phospholipids and aluminum resistance. The wheat PSS transcript was induced in response to aluminum stress, and overexpression of PSS activity increased aluminum resistance in two strains of yeast, whereas deletion of the PSS gene decreased aluminum resistance in a third strain. However, the change in phospholipid composition in itself does not appear to be sufficient to confer aluminum resistant to all yeast genotypes, since expression of TaPSS1 in strain FY833 did not increase aluminum resistance despite similar changes in phospholipid composition as found for strain InVSc2. Preliminary results also indicate that overexpression of TaPSS1 in tobacco does not confer enhanced aluminum resistance.In yeast, the major pathway for de novo PC biosynthesis is through the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol and l-serine to PS (catalyzed by PSS) which is then converted sequentially to PE and PC by the action of PS decarboxylase and methyltransferases (9Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The increased PE synthesis seen in yeast cells overexpressing PSS is consistent with this pathway since PS decarboxylase should convert some of the excess PS to PE. The observed increase in PS content at the expense of PI when TaPSS1 is expressed (Fig. 5) is also consistent with PSS and PI synthase competing for CDP-diacylglycerol as a common substrate (Fig. 1A).In plants the major pathway for PC biosynthesis is not well defined, although much of the biochemical and physiological evidence suggest that the CDP-choline pathway predominates in some tissues (12Moore Jr., T.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 235-259Crossref Google Scholar, 15Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of Brassica napus and ArabidopsiscDNAs that encode CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of choline to PC, provides support for the existence of this pathway (42Choi S.B. Lee K.W. Cho S.H. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 58-63Google Scholar,43Nishida I. Swinhoe R. Slabas A.R. Murata N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our cloning of a wheat cDNA that encodes a functional PSS protein now provides evidence for the existence of the yeast pathway for PS biosynthesis in wheat. Overexpression of TaPSS1 inArabidopsis increased PS biosynthesis at the expense of both PI and PG, consistent with PSS, PI synthase, and PG-phosphate synthase competing for CDP-diacylglycerol as a common substrate (Fig. 1A). The rate of PC synthesis was also increased in the TaPSS1-overexpressing plants (Fig. 7, A and B), but PE synthesis did not increase. This result contrasts with that found in yeast, where PE biosynthesis increased but PC was little affected in both short and long term experiments. If the pathway to PC synthesis were the same in the transgenic plants as in yeast, then one would expect PE synthesis to be enhanced relative to PC because PE is the direct precursor of PC in this pathway. One possible explanation is that a base-exchange reaction of the type found in mammalian cells (Fig. 1B; PSS-BEI) converts PS and free choline directly to PC without proceeding through PE. The increase in PC may be a consequence of the plant cells attempting to reduce the amount of PS accumulated in the TaPSS1overexpressers or, alternatively, may represent an active pathway for PC biosynthesis in wild type plants that is further enhanced in the transgenic plants.As found in other organisms, PS is likely to be an essential phospholipid for growth of plant cells. In contrast to yeast and mammalian cells where PS can comprise up to 10% of the total phospholipids, in plants PS is a minor component comprising less than 2% of the total phospholipids found in leaves of many species (1Galliard T. Ansell G. Hawthorne J. Dawson R. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier Scientific Publisher B.V., Amsterdam1973: 253-288Google Scholar). Results from our long term 32P-labeling experiments (Figs.5 and 7) are consistent with these values for abundance of PS in yeast and plant cells. In mammalian cells overexpressing a PSS-base exchange enzyme, PS biosynthesis was greatly increased in vivo, but the steady state phospholipid composition was unchanged (44Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This lack of effect on phospholipid composition was attributed to compensatory changes in activities of the pathways that synthesize and degrade PS to maintain overall phospholipid homeostasis. Recently, Kuge et al. (45Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that PSS-base exchange I activity is regulated by PS concentrations in the cell and that this can in itself account for a large part of the PS homeostasis. By contrast, our results indicate that plant cells are unable to maintain phospholipid homeostasis when PSS activity is in excess since large changes in overall phospholipid composition were seen. We speculate that the necrotic lesions arise on plants expressing TaPSS1 at high levels because of a large increase in abundance of PS in membranes. This may have resulted in PS appearing on the outer surface of the plasma membrane by saturating the mechanisms that normally maintain phospholipid asymmetry across the membrane. The appearance of PS on the outer surface of cells is an early step in the apoptotic pathway, and in mammalian cells increased biosynthesis of PS precedes the appearance of PS on the outer surface of the plasma membrane (46Aussel C. Pelasy C. Breittmayer J.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, external application of PS to Chinese hamster ovary cells can in itself trigger apoptosis, whereas other phospholipids are not able to elicit this response (47Uchida K. Emoto K. Daleke D.L. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have isolated a wheat gene that encodes a functional PSS enzyme. Overexpression of TaPSS1 in yeast and plants alters the phospholipid composition of these organisms. Altering the expression of this gene in plants provides a new tool for defining the pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis and for understanding how these pathways are regulated. Altering the abundance of PS will also provide clues to the biological functions in plants of this minor, but potentially important, phospholipid. Although phosphatidylserine (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction 1The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction is a minor phospholipid component of plant membranes (1Galliard T. Ansell G. Hawthorne J. Dawson R. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier Scientific Publisher B.V., Amsterdam1973: 253-288Google Scholar), it is likely to have roles in addition to contributing to the structure of lipid bilayers. In mammalian and yeast cells, PS is normally distributed asymmetrically across the plasma membrane with the inner surface containing most of the PS (2Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 3Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Externalization of PS on the plasma membrane is an early indicator of apoptosis in mammalian cells (4Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang G. Gurtu V. Kain S.R. Yan G. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylserine is required for activation of protein kinase C (6Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar), is implicated as a key element in the coagulation of blood (3Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and also allows phagocytes to recognize apoptotic cells (7Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C. Warner M.L. Henson P.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). By comparison, there is little information available describing the roles of PS in plants although a recent report describes the migration of PS to the outer surface of the plasma membrane being associated with apoptosis in plant cells (8O'Brien I.E.W. Baguley B.C. Murray B.G. Morris B.A.M. Ferguson I.B. Plant J. 1998; 13: 803-814Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PS is synthesized by the action of phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS; CDP-diacylglycerol:l-serineo-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.8) that catalyzes the condensation of l-serine with CDP-diacylglycerol (9Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PS in yeast is the first committed step in the major pathway for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC; Fig. 1A), the two most abundant phospholipids of yeast membranes. In mammalian cells, by contrast, PS is synthesized by exchange of the polar head group of an existing phospholipid with l-serine (10Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in a so-called base-exchange reaction (PSS-BE; Fig. 1B) whereas PC and PE are synthesized by pathways that do not involve PS (11Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Although the enzymes involved in the synthesis of PS by both types of reactions share the same trivial name, phosphatidylserine synthase, the biochemistry of the reactions is different, and there is minimal amino acid sequence similarity between the two types of enzymes. In plant cells the major pathway for the synthesis of PS is uncertain and may differ according to the type of tissue and species in question (12Moore Jr., T.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1982; 33: 235-259Crossref Google Scholar). A PSS-base exchange enzyme activity has been demonstrated in castor bean endosperm (13Moore Jr T.S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1975; 56: 177-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas another report described a PSS activity in extracts of spinach leaves (14Marshall M.O. Kates M. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but there are no subsequent reports to verify the presence of PSS in other plant species or tissues. Feeding of radiolabeled precursors to plant cells has produced equivocal results in identifying the major pathways for phospholipid biosynthesis. Some results have suggested that PC is synthesized primarily by pathways that do not require PS, but it has not been possible to completely rule out that PS contributes to PC biosynthesis (15Datko A.H. Mudd S.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1988; 88: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kinney A.J. Moore Jr., T.S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1987; 84: 78-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Despite the paucity of direct experimental evidence in plants, a dogma has developed that PS synthesis in higher eukaryotic cells, including plant cells, proceeds exclusively by the base-exchange pathway (11Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 17Yamashita S. Nikawa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As a result of screening a wheat cDNA library for clones that conferred enhanced aluminum resistance to yeast, we isolated a cDNA encoding a PSS that catalyzes the formation of PS by the condensation of CDP-diacylglycerol with l-serine. The cDNA complements a yeast mutant defective in PSS activity, and the putative translation product shows homology to PSS proteins from yeast and bacteria. Heterologous expression in plants leads to increased synthesis of PS, and high levels of expression are associated with lesions on the leaves. DISCUSSIONFour lines of evidence support the conclusion that the wheatTaPSS1 gene encodes a functional PSS enzyme as follows: (i) there is homology between the protein encoded by TaPSS1 and known PSS proteins from yeast and bacteria; (ii) TaPSS1complements the yeast cho1 mutant; (iii) overexpression ofTaPSS1 in plants and in a disrupted cho1 mutant of yeast yields measurable PSS activity in both types of organisms; and (iv) overexpression of TaPSS1 in yeast and plants changes the phospholipid composition in both these organisms with an increase in PS content being the most marked effect. Our cloning of a functional plant PSS gene provides the first strong evidence for the existence of PSS in higher eukaryotic cells. The role of PSS in wheat could be primarily for PS biosynthesis; or alternatively, in some plant species or tissues, it may play a key role in the biosynthesis of PC, as occurs in yeast.Complementation of the yeast cho1 mutant provided strong evidence for TaPSS1 gene function. The fact that there is a single gene encoding PSS in the yeast genome (39Letts V.A. Klig L.S. Bae-Lee M. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7279-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) precludes the possibility that TaPSS1 is enhancing endogenous PSS in yeast by transactivation of another gene. A marked difference between yeast PSS and wheat PSS is the absence of an acidic N-terminal sequence in the wheat protein (Fig. 2). However, overexpression of a truncated form of the yeast CHO1 gene that lacks sequence encoding the acidic N-terminal region of the protein was also able to complement the cho1 mutant. The truncated yeast gene produced less than one-tenth the amount of active enzyme produced by the wild type gene, even though comparable amounts of protein were produced by expression of the genes (40Sperka-Gottlieb C. Fasch E.-V. Kuchler K. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Yeast. 1990; 6: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This lower activity was attributed to the truncated form not being correctly inserted into membranes. In our case, the wheat TaPSS1 gene yielded even greater enzyme activity than the wild type CHO1 gene when overexpressed in yeast (TableI). The significance of the lack of an acidic domain in the wheat enzyme is not known, but this does not appear to limit its activity in yeast.The plasma membrane is a primary barrier to the entry of aluminum into cells. A change in its lipid composition could conceivably alter the resistance of the cell by excluding aluminum, by altering the activity of specific membrane proteins involved in confering aluminum resistance, or by altering the response of the yeast cell to external stimuli. Aluminum ions bind to phospholipids, and the binding affinity under acidic conditions is greatest for anionic phospholipids such as PG and PI (41Jones D.L. Kochian L.V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several features of our results suggest further links between phospholipids and aluminum resistance. The wheat PSS transcript was induced in response to aluminum stress, and overexpression of PSS activity increased aluminum resistance in two strains of yeast, whereas deletion of the PSS gene decreased aluminum resistance in a third strain. However, the change in phospholipid composition in itself does not appear to be sufficient to confer aluminum resistant to all yeast genotypes, since expression of TaPSS1 in strain FY833 did not increase aluminum resistance despite similar changes in phospholipid composition as found for strain InVSc2. Preliminary results also indicate that overexpression of TaPSS1 in tobacco does not confer enhanced aluminum resistance.In yeast, the major pathway for de novo PC biosynthesis is through the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol and l-serine to PS (catalyzed by PSS) which is then converted sequentially to PE and PC by the action of PS decarboxylase and methyltransferases (9Carman G.M.

Such movement requires flexibility in the neck region of ISP, since the head and transmembrane domains of the protein are rather rigid. To test this hypothesis, Rhodobacter sphaeroidesmutants expressing His-tagged cytochrome bc1complexes with cysteine substitution at various positions in the ISP neck (residues 39–48) were generated and characterized. The mutants with a single cysteine substitution at Ala42 or Val44 and a double cysteine substitution at Val44 and Ala46 (VQA-CQC) or at Ala42 and Ala46 (ADVQA-CDVQC) have photosynthetic growth rates comparable with that of complement cells. Chromatophore membrane and intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) prepared from these mutants have cytochrome bc1complex activity similar to that in the complement membranes, indicating that flexibility of the neck region of ISP was not affected by these cysteine substitutions. Mutants with a double cysteine substitution at Ala42 and Val44 (ADV-CDC) or at Pro40 and Ala42 (PSA-CSC) have a retarded (50%) or no photosynthetic growth rate, respectively. The ADV-CDC or PSA-CSC mutant ICM contains 20 or 0% of the cytochromebc1 complex activity found in the complement ICM. However, activity can be restored by the treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME). The restored activity is diminished upon removal of β-ME but is retained if the β-ME-treated membrane is treated with the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide orp-chloromercuribenzoic acid. These results indicate that the loss of bc1 complex activity in the ADV-CDC or PSA-CSC mutant membranes is due to disulfide bond formation, which increases the rigidity of ISP neck and, in turn, decreases the mobility of the head domain. Using the conditions developed for the isolation of His-tagged complement cytochrome bc1 complex, a two-subunit complex (cytochromes b and c1) is obtained from all of the double cysteine-substituted mutants. This suggests that introduction of two cysteines in the neck region of ISP weakens the interactions between cytochromes b, ISP, and subunit IV.

This suggests that introduction of two cysteines in the neck region of ISP weakens the interactions between cytochromes b, ISP, and subunit IV. The cytochrome bc1 complex (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) is an essential segment of the energy-conserving electron transfer chains of mitochondria and many respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome cand concomitantly translocates protons across the membrane to generate a membrane potential and pH gradient for ATP synthesis. Although the cytochrome bc1 complexes from different sources vary in their polypeptide compositions, they all contain four redox prosthetic groups: two b-type cytochromes (b566 or bL and b562 or bH), onec-type cytochrome (cytochrome c1), and one high potential Rieske iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S]. 1The abbreviations used are: [2Fe-2S] cluster, iron sulfur cluster of Rieske iron-sulfur protein; bL, low potential heme b; bH, high potential heme b; DM, dodecylmaltoside; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; ICM, intracytoplasmic membrane(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ISP, iron-sulfur protein; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PCMB, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid 1The abbreviations used are: [2Fe-2S] cluster, iron sulfur cluster of Rieske iron-sulfur protein; bL, low potential heme b; bH, high potential heme b; DM, dodecylmaltoside; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; ICM, intracytoplasmic membrane(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ISP, iron-sulfur protein; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PCMB, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid The proton-motive Q cycle model (2Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) has been favored for electron transfer and proton translocation in the complex. The key feature of this model is the presence of two separate ubiquinone- or ubiquinol-binding sites: a ubiquinol oxidation site near the P side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and a ubiquinone reduction site near the N side of the membrane. Recently, the cytochrome bc1 complex from beef heart mitochondria was crystallized and its three-dimensional structure solved at 2.9-Å resolution (3Yu C.-A. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The structural information obtained not only answered a number of questions concerning the arrangement of the redox centers, transmembrane helices, and inhibitor binding sites but also suggested movement of an extramembrane domain within the iron-sulfur protein (ISP) during electron transfer (4Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). This suggestion arose from observation of an uneven electron density in the I4122 crystal data of native bovine cytochromebc1 complex. A particularly low electron density area is observed in the intermembrane space portion of the complex, where the extramembrane domains of ISP and cytochromec1 reside (4Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). This movement hypothesis was further supported by the finding that the position of the iron-sulfur cluster in the complex is affected by ubiquinol oxidation site inhibitor binding (5Kim H. Xia D. Deisenhofer J. Yu C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L. Yu L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1084Google Scholar, 6Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and by the crystal form (7Zhang Z.L. Huang L.-S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Huang L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 9Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K.

Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8677-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anomalous light scattering signal of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is enhanced in co-crystals with stigmatellin or UHDBT but is diminished in the co-crystal with (E)-methyl-3-methoxy-2-(4′-trans-stilbenyl) acrylate (5Kim H. Xia D. Deisenhofer J. Yu C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L. Yu L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1084Google Scholar). Thus, binding of stigmatellin or UHDBT arrests the movement of the extramembrane domain of ISP, fixing the iron-sulfur cluster 27 Å from heme bL and 31 Å from heme c1 (referred to as the “fixed state” of ISP), the same position it occupies in the I4122 crystal of native bovine cytochrome bc1 complex. The position of the iron-sulfur cluster changes from the fixed state to somewhere closer to heme c1 (referred to as the “released state” of ISP) upon (E)-methyl-3-methoxy-2-(4′-trans-stilbenyl) acrylate binding. The recent report of Iwata et al. (9Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), showing the iron-sulfur cluster at two different positions in two crystal forms, further supports the presence of a variable position of in the “released state” of the iron-sulfur cluster. Movement of the head domain of ISP during electron transfer in cytochrome bc1 complex can be explained as follows. The [2Fe-2S] cluster is reduced by the first electron of ubiquinol at a position 27 Å from heme bL and 31 Å from heme c1 (ISP in “fixed state”). Since a reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster cannot donate an electron to cytochromec1 before the second electron of ubiquinol is transferred to heme bL, it was postulated that either the change of the ubiquinone binding position during reduction ofbL or the electron transfer frombL to bH causes a conformational change in cytochrome b, which forces or allows reduced [2Fe-2S] to move close enough to heme c1(ISP in “released state”) for electron transfer (5Kim H. Xia D. Deisenhofer J. Yu C.A. Kachurin A. Zhang L. Yu L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1084Google Scholar, 7Zhang Z.L. Huang L.-S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Huang L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). This model would also explain why ubisemiquinone, a more powerful reductant than ubiquinol, reduces bL, but not the [2Fe-2S] cluster, during ubiquinol oxidation. ISP has three domains: the membrane-spanning N-terminal domain consisting of residues 1–62 (tail), the soluble C-terminal extramembrane domain consisting of residues 73–196 (head), and the flexible linking domain comprising residues 63–72 (neck). ISP is associated with the complex primarily via the membrane-spanning N-terminal domain (4Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Z.L. Huang L.-S. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Huang L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The [2Fe-2S] cluster is located at the tip of the head domain (12Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Link T.A. Saynovits M. Assmann C. Iwata S. Ohnishi T. Von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since the three-dimensional structures of the head and tail domains are the same in the fixed and released states, movement of the head domain of ISP in the bc1 complex requires flexibility in the neck region. If movement of the head domain of ISP is required forbc1 catalysis and the neck region of ISP confers the required mobility, decreasing the flexibility of the neck region of ISP should affect bc1 complex activity. This hypothesis can be tested by site-directed mutagenesis followed by biochemical and biophysical characterization of mutant expressing cytochrome bc1 complexes with altered ISP necks. However, site-directed mutagenesis in bovine heart mitochondria is not practical. R. sphaeroides is an ideal system to study the neck region of ISP by molecular genetics approach. The four-subunit complex is functionally analogous to the mitochondrial enzyme; the largest three subunits are homologous to their mitochondrial counterparts; and this system is readily manipulated genetically. In addition, the recent generation of R. sphaeroides expressing His6-tagged cytochrome bc1 complex greatly speeds up the preparation of the bc1complex from wild-type or mutant cells (14Tian H. Yu L. Mather M. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The R. sphaeroides ISP neck is composed of residues 39–48 (corresponding to residues 63–72 of bovine ISP) with a sequence of NPSADVQALA. Ala42, Asp43, Val44, Ala46, and Ala48 are the conserved amino acid residues. We have previously generated mutants with increased ISP neck rigidity by double or triple proline substitution of the conserved residues. The results demonstrated that flexibility in the ISP neck is important in bc1 catalysis (14Tian H. Yu L. Mather M. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ALA-PLP and ADV-PPP mutant membranes have, respectively, 30 and 0% of the cytochrome bc1 complex activity found in the complement membrane. The ALA-PLP mutant complex has a larger activation energy than the wild-type complex, suggesting that movement of the head domain decreases the activation energy barrier of the bc1 complex. To better define the structure and function relationship of the neck region of ISP in the bc1 complex, we recently generated mutants expressing His6-taggedbc1 complex with single or double cysteine substitution at various positions in the ISP neck. We predict that formation of a disulfide bond between a pair of genetically engineered cysteines in the neck will decrease its flexibility and thus decrease electron transfer activity. Measuring the bc1activity in these cysteine-substituted mutants should give insight into the dynamic state of the ISP neck. Herein we report procedures for generating R. sphaeroides mutants expressing His6-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes with altered ISP necks by introducing single cysteines or a pair of cysteines at different positions. The photosynthetic growth behavior, the cytochrome bc1 complex activity, and the EPR characteristics of the Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster in membranes and the purified state from complement and mutant strains are examined and compared. The effect of sulfhydryl reagents on cytochromebc1 complexes from complement and mutant membranes is also examined. 2-Mercaptoethanol (β-ME),N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB) are from Sigma. All other chemicals are of the highest purity commercially available. Mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites system from Promega. The oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: ADV(42–44)-CDC, GCTGATCAACCAAATGAATCCGTCGTGCGACTGCCAGGCCCTCGCCTCCATCTTCGTCG; A42C, CAAATGAATCCGTCGTGCGACGTGCAGGCCCTCGCCTCCATCT; V44C, ATGAATCCGTCGGCCTACTGCCAGGCCCTCGCCTCCATCT; VQA(44–46)-CQC, AACCAAATGAATCCGTCGGCCGACTGCCAGTGCCTCGCCTCCATCTTCGTCGATGTGA; PSA(40–42)-CSC, TGGCCGCTGATCAACCAAATGAATTGCTCGTGCGACGTGCAGGCCCTCGCCTCCATCTT; ADVQA(42–46)-CDVQC, TCGTGCGACGTCCAGTGCCTCGCCTCCATCTT. The method for construction of ISP mutants is essentially the same as previously reported by Tian et al. (14Tian H. Yu L. Mather M. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ADVQA(42–46)-CDVQC mutant was constructed by annealing the oligonucleotide primer with single-stranded pSELNB3503 carrying a A42C mutation in ISP. The presence of engineered mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing before and after photosynthetic or semiaerobic growth of the cells. Expression plasmid pRKDfbcFmBCHQ was purified from an aliquot of a photosynthetic or semiaerobic culture using the Qiagen plasmid Mini Prep kit. Since R. sphaeroides cells contain four types of endogenous plasmids, the isolated plasmids are not pure and concentrated enough for direct sequencing. Thus, a 1.2-kilobase pair DNA segment containing the mutation sequence was amplified from the isolated plasmids by polymerase chain reaction and purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The 1.2-kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction product was recovered from the gel by a gel extraction kit from Qiagen. Escherichia coli was grown at 37 °C in an enriched medium (TYP) in order to shorten growth time and increase plasmid yield (15Khosravi M. Ryan W. Websger D.A. Stark B.C. Plasmid. 1990; 23: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For photosynthetic growth of the plasmid-bearing R. sphaeroides BC17 cells, an enriched Sistrom's medium containing 5 mm glutamate and 0.2% casamino acids was used. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 with a mixture of 6 n NaOH and 2 n KOH to increase the sodium and potassium ion content of the medium to a more optimal level (16Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Photosynthetic growth condition of R. sphaeroides was essentially as described previously (14Tian H. Yu L. Mather M. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); cells harboring mutated fbc genes on the pRKDfbcFBCQ plasmid were grown photosynthetically for one or two serial passages to minimize any pressure for reversion. For semiaerobic growth of R. sphaeroides, an enriched Sistrom's medium supplemented with 20 amino acids and extra rich vitamins was used. These semiaerobic cultures were grown in 0.5 liters of enriched medium in 2-liter Bellco flasks with vigorous shaking (220 rpm) for 26 h. The inoculation volumes used for both photosynthetic and semiaerobic cultures were always at least 5% of the total volume. Antibiotics were added to the following concentrations: ampicillin (125 mg/liter), tetracycline (10 mg/liter for E. coli and 1 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides), kanamycin sulfate (30 mg/liter for E. coli and 20 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides), trimethoprim (87.5 mg/liter for E. coli). Cells were harvested, washed, and passed twice through a French pressure cell at 846 p.s.i. as described previously (17Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 30: 4934-4939Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The chromatophore fraction was pelleted by ultracentrifugation of broken cells in a Beckman Ti 50.2 rotor at 48,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Membrane was washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm MgSO4 and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol. The His6-tagged cytochromebc1 complexes were purified from chromatophores by the method of Tian et al. (14Tian H. Yu L. Mather M. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). His6 tag is located at the C terminus of the cytochromec1 subunit. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured at 23 °C in a 1-ml assay mixture containing 100 mmsodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm EDTA, 100 μm cytochrome c, 25 μm2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol, and an appropriate amount of membrane or purified cytochromebc1 complex. Chromatophores or ICM were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 20% glycerol and 1 mm MgSO4 to a final concentration of cytochromeb of 5 μm. No detergent was added to the diluted mixture in order to preserve the bc1activity. 5 μl of diluted membrane was added to the assay mixture. Activity was determined by measuring the reduction of cytochromec (the absorbance increase at 550 nm), using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 cm−1mm−1. Nonenzymatic oxidation of 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol, determined under the same conditions in the absence of enzyme, was subtracted. The purified bc1 complex activity assay is essentially as described previously (14Tian H. Yu L. Mather M. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). β-ME was added to membrane preparations (40 μm cytochrome b) to a final concentration of 100 μm. After incubation on ice for 10 min, aliquots were removed from the mixture for assay. β-ME was removed from the treated membrane by washing with 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm MgSO4 and centrifuging at 80,000 rpm for 30 min with a Beckman TL ultracentrifuge. This process was repeated three times. Freshly prepared NEM (100 mm in H2O) was added to the β-ME-pretreated chromatophore or ICM (concentration is at 40 μm cytochrome b) to a final concentration of 500 μm. The mixture was flushed briefly with nitrogen, sealed, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before measuring cytochromebc1 complex activity. The stock solution of PCMB was prepared by first dissolving PCMB powder in 0.5 n NaOH followed by neutralization. Modification of cysteine with PCMB was carried out as described for NEM. Excess NEM and PCMB was removed by repeated washing and centrifuging, and enzymatic activity was redetermined. Molecular modeling was carried out in a Indigo II Silicon Graphics Station. A peptide with NCSCQVQALA sequence, corresponding to the ISP neck sequence of the R. sphaeroidesPSA-CSC mutant, was built using the Builder Module from Insight II software from Molecular Simulation, Inc. Whether this peptide has acceptable geometry for disulfide bond formation was examined by minimizing the structure as follows: (a) continued iterations using steepest descents minimization until the maximum derivation was less than 10 kcal/Å; (b) continued iterations using conjugate minimization until the maximum derivation was less than 1.0 kcal/Å; (c) continued iterations using va09a minimization until the maximum derivation was less than 0.01 kcal/Å; (d) creation of a disulfide bond; (e) minimization of the peptide using the Optimize command in Builder; and (f) visual examination of geometry and comparison with a control (no disulfide bond) using the print energy per residue command. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b (19Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and cytochromec1 (20Yu L. Dong J.H. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were determined according to published methods. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-protean dual slab vertical cell. Western blotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cytochrome b, cytochromec1, ISP, and subunit IV of the R. sphaeroides bc1 complex. The polypeptides separated in the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as the second antibody. EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker ER 200D apparatus equipped with a liquid N2 Dewar at 77 K. Instrument settings are detailed in the figure legends. Six R. sphaeroides mutants expressing His6-tagged cytochromebc1 complexes with single or double cysteine substitutions at various positions in the ISP neck region were generated to test the hypothesis that neck flexibility allows ISP head domain movement required for bc1 catalysis. The flexibility of the neck should decrease when a disulfide bond is formed between a pair of substituted cysteines. Of the six mutants, two, A42C and V44C, are single substitutions, in which Ala-42 or Val-44 is replaced with cysteine. The other four are double cysteine substitutions, PSA-CSC, ADV-CDC, VQA-CQC, and ADVQA-CDVQC, in which Pro40 and Ala42, Ala42 and Val44, Val44 and Ala46, or Ala42 and Ala46 are replaced with cysteines. A plate mating technique was used (22Pemberton J.M. Bowen A.R.S.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to transfer the pRKDfbcFmBC6HQ plasmid from E. coli S17 to R. sphaeroides BC17. The mating took place in less than 16 h on the LB/SIS plates. R. sphaeroides BC17 cells harboring pRKDfbcFmBC6HQ plasmid were selected by spreading the conjugated cell mixture on enriched Sistrom's plate containing tetracycline and kanamycin sulfate. It took 4 days for the A42C, V44C, ADVQA-CDVQC, and VQA-CQC mutant colonies to show up on the plate, the same time period as that required for complement colonies. However, it took about 7 days for the ADV-CDC and PSA-CSC mutant colonies to appear. This slower growth rate on the plates is an indication of zero or reduced bc1 activity in the virtual absence of environmental selection pressure. A similar phenomenon was observed with several cytochrome b mutants that had no bc1activity. 2H. Tian, S. White, L. Yu, and C-A. Yu, unpublished data. When mid-log phase, aerobically grown complement and mutant cells were inoculated into enriched Sistrom medium and subjected to anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions, the A42C, V44C, VQA-CQC, and ADVQA-CDVQC mutants grow at a rate comparable with that of complement cells, the ADV-CDC mutant has a retarded (50%) growth rate, and PSA-CSC does not grow photosynthetically (TableI). Chromatophores from the A42C, V44C, and ADVQA-CDVQC mutant cells have cytochrome bc1complex activity comparable with that of the complement chromatophores. The VQA-CQC and ADV-CDC mutant chromatophores have, respectively, 77 and 68% of the bc1 complex activity found in complement chromatophores.

Western blot analysis with antibodies against R. sphaeroides cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, ISP, and subunit IV revealed that the amount of these four subunits in the six mutant membranes is the same as that in the complement membrane (Fig. 1, lanes 2–8). Absorption spectral analysis shows that the content of cytochrome b and c1/c2 in all of these mutant membranes is the same as that in complement membrane. These results indicate that the mutations did not affect the assembly of ISP protein into the membrane. The [2Fe-2S] cluster in all of these mutant membranes has an EPR spectrum identical to that observed in complement chromatophores, with resonance at gx = 1.80 and gy = 1.9 (Fig. 2).

Truncation of the bovine cardiac troponin tail was investigated using recombinant TnT fragments and subunits TnI and TnC. Progressive truncation of the troponin tail caused progressively weaker binding of troponin-tropomyosin to actin and of troponin to actin-tropomyosin. A sharp drop-off in affinity occurred with NH2-terminal deletion of 119 rather than 94 residues. Deletion of 94 residues had no effect on Ca2+-activation of the myosin subfragment 1-thin filament MgATPase rate and did not eliminate cooperative effects of Ca2+ binding. Troponin tail peptide TnT1–153 strongly promoted tropomyosin binding to actin in the absence of TnI or TnC. The results show that the anchoring function of the troponin tail involves interactions with actin as well as with tropomyosin and has comparable importance in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Residues 95–153 are particularly important for anchoring, and residues 95–119 are crucial for function or local folding. Because striated muscle regulation involves switching among the conformational states of the thin filament, regulatory significance for the troponin tail may arise from its prominent contribution to the protein-protein interactions within these conformations.

This spacing is due to the 1:1 complex formation of troponin with tropomyosin, an elongated coiled-coil protein that stretches along seven actin monomers. Ca2+ binding to troponin triggers conformational changes in the thin filament, thereby allowing actin and myosin to interact to produce force and movement. Troponin contains two domains: a globular region, which is composed of subunits TnC, 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, bovine cardiac troponin; myosin S1, myosin subfragment 1; Tn95, ternary troponin complex composed of bovine heart TnC, TnI, and a recombinant TnT fragment from position 95 to the COOH terminus (Lys-284); Tn120, Tn133, Tn154, Tn174, similar to Tn95; CBMII, D65A/E66A cardiac TnC TnI, and the COOH-terminal portion of TnT, and a highly extended region, or tail, containing the remainder of TnT (5White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips J.G.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Flicker P.F. Phillips J.G.N. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The globular region has a central role in regulation, because it is the site of calcium binding. In contrast, the tail region of troponin, which is the subject of this report, has an uncertain role in conformational changes of the thin filament. One possibility is that it has little direct effect on regulation, acting instead as a calcium-insensitive anchor that holds troponin onto tropomyosin (7Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8Hitchcock S.E. Huxley H.E. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the details of the interactions of troponin with actin and tropomyosin are unknown, in any of the conformations of the thin filament. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the structure of the troponin tail can alter thin filament function in a complex manner (9Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

To better understand the troponin tail region, the present study reports the properties of a series of troponin complexes containing progressively less of this region. Cardiac TnC plus TnI was reconstituted with either cardiac TnT or a series of recombinant NH2-terminal truncation mutants of TnT. The NH2-terminal region of TnT was also examined in isolation, in the absence of TnC or TnI. The results suggest that the anchoring function of this region involves interactions with actin as well as with tropomyosin and that this function is not confined to a small region of the tail, and they suggest that a critical peptide in the tail may be particularly important for proper function. Bovine cardiac TnT cDNA was cloned from a bovine heart cDNA library. 2C. Landis and L. Tobacman, manuscript in preparation. The encoded amino acid sequence was almost completely consistent with the predominant adult bovine cardiac TnT isoform, as previously determined by protein sequencing (17Leszyk J. Dumaswala R. Potter J.D. Gusev N.B. Verin A.D. Tobacman L.S. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7035-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the cDNA contained no codon for Glu-42 of the protein sequence, possibly due to splice site variability within the alternative splicing region of TnT (18Townsend P.J. Barton P.J.R. Yacoub M.H. Farza H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2223-2236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 20Breitbart R.E. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1987; 49: 793-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Many of the TnTs used in the present study are NH2-terminal truncations, which therefore do not include the lone Cys (Cys-39) of native TnT. (Numbering follows the published protein sequence.) Therefore, to facilitate labeling of all the planned TnTs by carboxymethylation with radioactive iodoacetic acid, a single Cys mutant was designed by performing the double mutation C39S/D266C. Asp-266 was chosen because it would be present in all the truncation mutants, was in a charged region unlikely to be buried on folding, was not directly implicated in interactions with the other troponin subunits (2Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and would have its negative charge restored by the planned carboxymethylation of the new Cys-266. The C39S mutation was created using polymerase chain reaction, with a primer producing both the desired codon change (G170C) and a protein-silent change (A177G) that created a SacII site to facilitate identification of recombinants. The D266C mutation was produced similarly by polymerase chain reaction, using a primer with TnT cDNA alterations G847T/A848G to encode the amino acid change, as well as A834T/C831A to introduce a silent BSaAI site. Double mutant C39S/D266C was obtained by subcloning. To remove 94 NH2-terminal residues, D266C TnT cDNA was inserted in pSP72 and digested withEco0109 I and HindIII, and the TnT-encoding 3′-fragment was isolated. A similar digestion using BsaI and HindIII yielded a 550-base pair fragment encoding the COOH-terminal portion of TnT starting at Leu-120. cDNAs encoding TnT COOH-fragments starting with Glu-133, Ala-154, or Ala-174 were created by polymerase chain reaction, using D266C TnT as the template. Plasmids encoding NH2-terminal TnT fragments 1–94, 1–132, 1–153, and 1–173 were created by polymerase chain reaction and contained Cys-39 rather than the C39S mutation. All cDNAs were inserted into the expression plasmid pET3d (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) and confirmed by automated chain termination sequencing. Recombinant TnT was obtained by modification of published protocols (10Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed and extracted TnTs were dialyzed against a denaturing buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 murea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 5 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. The full-length TnT molecules were applied to a Fast Flow Q Sepharose column, which was then washed with an 80 mm NaCl buffer, and then purified with a 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient. The truncated forms were similarly purified, but using an SP Sepharose column. An additional column purification step was performed using fast protein liquid chromatography columns, either Resource Q (full-length TnTs) or Resource S (truncated TnTs missing the negatively charged NH2-terminal region). The fast protein liquid chromatography step was sometimes omitted, and residual impurities after the Sepharose step removed instead by gel filtration of the troponin complex after reconstitution with TnI and TnC. Recombinant TnT or TnT fragments were mixed under denaturing conditions with bovine cardiac muscle TnI and TnC (13Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Protein molarities were calculated by combining measured absorbance with sequence-determined aromatic amino acid composition (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). However, NH2-terminal TnT fragments have weak molar absorbance (one Tyr and no Trp), so they were measured by protein assay ESL (Boehringer Mannheim), using a modification (22Matsushita M. Irino T. Komada T. Sakagishi Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1998; 216: 103-111Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) of the biuret reaction. The mixtures were then dialyzed in several steps to remove urea and KCl (13Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure was modified for the truncated troponins, which precipitated when the protocol was tried without modification: the pH of all dialysis buffers was raised from 7.5 to 8.8 (Tris-HCl in both cases), and the final dialysis step retained 0.1m KCl, instead of removing all KCl as in the unmodified procedure. This succeeded in producing ternary troponin complexes containing bovine cardiac TnI, TnC and either TnT95–284, TnT120–284, TnT133–284, TnT154–284, or TnT174–284. These dialyzed complexes, designated Tn95, Tn120, Tn133, Tn154, and Tn174, respectively, were further purified chromatographically using Sephadex G100. The hydrodynamic properties of the various troponin complexes were assessed by molecular sieve chromatography (23Sorensen B.R. Shea M.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3407-3420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), involving measurement of elution positions relative to molecular weight standards on an FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. The following standards and Stokes radius (R s) values were used to calibrate the column: ribonuclease A, 16.4 Å; chymotrypsinogen A, 20.9 Å; ovalbumin, 30.5 Å; bovine serum albumin, 35.5 Å; aldolase, 48.1 Å; and catalase, 52.2 Å. To reduce any non-ideal behavior, low protein concentrations were applied (0.3 mg/ml), and the column was run in the presence of 1m KCl. Binding of radiolabeled tropomyosin or troponin to actin was measured by cosedimentation (24Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tropomyosin was stoichiometrically labeled under denaturing conditions on Cys-190 with [3H]iodoacetic acid. Recombinant TnT or truncated TnT was similarly labeled on Cys-266 and then reconstituted as above to form troponin complexes. However, unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed with unlabeled troponin complexes. Troponin-induced binding of tropomyosin to actin was studied by varying the troponin concentration of samples containing 10 μm rabbit skeletal muscle actin (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.5 μm [3H]bovine cardiac tropomyosin (26Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 0.5 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2. Binding of the troponin-tropomyosin complex to actin was measured under the same conditions, except the actin concentration was 5 μm and both the troponin and the tropomyosin concentrations were varied in parallel, with the total troponin concentration maintained at 0.2 μm in excess of the total tropomyosin concentration. Raising the concentration of the shortest of these troponins (Tn120 and Tn133) to a 0.5 μm excess relative to tropomyosin had no effect, and data points with both 0.2 and 0.5 μm excess were included. Similarly, TnT1–153-tropomyosin was studied by including 0.5 μmexcess relative to the tropomyosin concentration and by showing that under such conditions, TnT1–153 was not limiting for tropomyosin binding to actin. The relative affinities of the various troponin complexes for actin-tropomyosin were compared by a competitive binding assay (modified from Ref. 27Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All samples contained 6 μmF-actin, 3 μm unlabeled tropomyosin, 1 μmbovine cardiac troponin that had been 3H-labeled on TnT Cys-39, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 0.5 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2. Displacement of the 3H-labeled troponin from the thin filament was produced by varying the concentration of competing unlabeled troponin or truncated troponin that was added to the samples and then measured by liquid scintillation counting of the free concentration (F, the dependent variable in Eq. 1, below) in the supernatant after centrifugation. Control troponin binding is tight (K > 108m−1) (9Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under these conditions, and the ratio (K R) of the affinity of competitor troponin to the affinity of control labeled troponin was fit using the following expression, 0=F2×(1−KR)+F×(S−T+Kr×(C+T−S))(Eq. 1) +T×KR×(S−C−T)where C (the independent variable) is the concentration of added competitor troponin, S is the concentration of troponin binding sites on F-actin, and T is the total concentration of [3H]troponin. The actin-activated MgATPase rate of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1 (28Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) was measured by release of32P from γ-labeled ATP (29Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle myosin S1 was used instead of bovine cardiac mysoin S1 because of its greater stability, higher ATPase rates, and many functional similarities: (i) the effects of Ca2+ on Vmax, ATPase actin Kapp, and true myosin S1-ATP affinity for the thin filament (26Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Tobacman L.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Chalovich J.M.

Rates were linear over 10 min (four or five aliquiots removed and quenched with sulfuric/silicotungstic acid) and were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 20 mm ATP to 190-μl protein samples. Conditions (except as indicated) were as follows: 25 °C, 5 mmimidazole (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 7 μm F-actin, 0.3 μm rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1, 1.5 μm bovine cardiac tropomyosin, and a total of 1 μm of a variable mixture of Tn95 plus an inhibitory form of Tn95. This inhibitory Tn95 was made by reconstitution (13Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1:1:1 mixture of TnI:TnT95–284:CBMII. CBMII is cardiac TnC with an inactivating mutation (D65A/E66A) (27Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys.

Although the structure of troponin is unknown, available information aids interpretation of progressive NH2-terminal truncations of TnT. Troponin contains a globular domain and an elongated tail region (6Flicker P.F. Phillips J.G.N. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The globular domain contains TnI, TnC, and the COOH-terminal portion of TnT. Specifically, rabbit fast skeletal muscle TnT COOH-terminal residues 159–259 (35Pearlstone J.R. Johnson P. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 983-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) form a stable ternary complex with TnI and TnC (36Fisher D. Wang G. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

The troponin tail is formed by an imprecisely defined part of TnT, which is highly elongated (6Flicker P.F. Phillips J.G.N. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mass attributable to TnT residues 1–71 is located far from the other subunits, at the end of the tail (5White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips J.G.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The corresponding NH2-terminal region of bovine cardiac TnT, used in the present study, contains an additional 27 amino acids (17Leszyk J. Dumaswala R. Potter J.D. Gusev N.B. Verin A.D. Tobacman L.S. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7035-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and this produces a 20-Å increase in TnT length for the cardiac isoform (40Cabral-Lilly D. Tobacman L.S. Mehegan J.P. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1996; 73: 1763-1770Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that serial deletions of the cardiac TnT NH2 terminus will qualitatively shorten the tail region, without preventing troponin complex formation. The structure of such complexes will depend on the original tertiary structure of the tail region and upon any folding alterations resulting from the deletion. A series of troponin complexes was created lacking a variable amount of the TnT sequence at the NH2 terminus, from 0 to 173 residues. The least (94 residues) and the most extensive (173 residues) truncations correspond to skeletal muscle TnT deletions of 67 or 146 residues, which can be removed with relatively minor or major effects on troponin function, respectively (24Hill L.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23746-23752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As predicted from results with skeletal muscle TnT, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of gel filtered samples (Fig. 1A) indicated that all of these cardiac TnT fragments could be combined with TnC and TnI to form ternary complexes. In other words, none of the deletions caused sufficient unfolding of the remaining TnT fragment to preclude formation of a truncated troponin complex, nor did the deletions remove sequences critical for complex formation. The hydrodynamic properties of the various troponin complexes were compared by gel permeation chromatography. There was a monotonic pattern of decreasing Stokes radius as the amino terminus was progressively shortened (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, this pattern was linear, with the change in R s proportional to the number of amino acids deleted. This suggests that the truncations did not lead to major unfolding of the remaining portions of TnT and is consistent with the interpretation that the various troponins have progressively shorter tail regions. It also suggests that none of the truncations was dramatically altered from the preceding, next larger form. The results are in general agreement with previous hydrodynamic studies of cardiac troponin (52 Å R s in Ref. 42Byers D.M. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and with scattering studies of the TnI-TnC complex (33 Å Rgand 118 Å for the largest linear dimension of TnI in Ref. 43Olah G.A. Trewella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the presence of high ionic strength conditions, tropomyosin binds weakly to actin unless troponin is added. Fig. 2A demonstrates this effect of troponin, which increases the binding of tropomyosin to actin, with indistinguishable results whether the troponin was isolated from heart muscle (●) or troponin reconstituted using single Cys TnT mutant C39S/D266C (▪), a control molecule. TnT truncation potentially alters this effect of troponin directly, by eliminating sites of troponin-tropomyosin interactions, sites of interaction with actin, or both. The figure shows a moderate weakening of the action of cardiac troponin when 94 TnT residues were deleted (▴), a more striking suppression of function when 119 NH2-terminal residues were absent (♦), and virtual elimination of the action of troponin when 132 (○), 153 (■), or 173 (▵) NH2-terminal residues were absent. The results suggest that progressively larger truncations produce progressively severe loss of function. Similar results were obtained in the presence of calcium (data not shown). The preceding experiments were conducted in the presence of high ionic strength conditions (0.3 m KCl), a condition that we found essential for quantitative assessment of the full-length control molecules (24Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which tend to polymerize with tropomyosin under lower ionic strength conditions. To better study the truncated troponins, they were also examined in the presence of 60 mm KCl. Under these conditions, the truncated troponins lacking 119 (♦) or 132 (○) TnT residues promoted tropomyosin binding to actin (Fig. 2B), implying direct and/or indirect interactions between tropomyosin and these troponins under these lower ionic strength conditions. However, the effect on tropomyosin sedimentation was much less than the effects of full-length troponin (●) or troponin lacking 94 TnT residues (▴). To explore the phenomenon illustrated in Fig. 2 in more detail, actin binding was assessed as the concentrations of the various troponin-tropomyosin complexes were varied. If the tail region of troponin merely holds the molecule onto tropomyosin, then deleting part of the tail would have little effect on the affinity of the troponin-tropomyosin complex for actin. However, Fig. 3A shows that progressive deletion of the tail had a large and progressive effect on this process in the absence of calcium. Removal of 94 residues (Tn95, ▪) caused a 2-fold shift from control results (●) in this representative experiment. Deletion of another 25 residues (Tn120, ▴) had an additional 7-fold effect, for a 14-fold effect relative to whole troponin. Similar results were found for Tn120 and for Tn133 (♦). These last two complexes had only a small effect on tropomyosin binding to actin, as seen by comparison to data with tropomyosin alone (▵). The truncations produced a similar pattern in the presence of saturating calcium concentrations (Fig. 3B), suggesting similar importance for the troponin tail in thin filament assembly, regardless whether calcium is bound to TnC. An alternative means to evaluate the function of the troponin tail is to examine it directly, rather than studying the effects of its deletion. This was investigated with several NH2-terminal TnT fragments, with mixed success. TnT1–153 (Fig. 1A) was the easiest to examine in cosedimentation experiments because, like whole troponin (24Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it caused tropomyosin to sediment in the presence of 300 mmKCl only when actin was also present (data not shown). Fig. 3C shows the effects of this TnT NH2-terminal fragment alone (*), in the absence of TnI and TnC, on tropomyosin binding to actin. For comparison, binding of the troponin-tropomyosin complex to actin (●) was determined with the same actin and labeled tropomyosin preparation, a repeat of the titration in Fig. 3A. The TnT1–153·tropomyosin complex bound almost as tightly to actin as did the entire troponin-tropomyosin complex (*,Kapp = 5.0 × 106m−1 and y = 46; ●,Kapp = 11 × 106m−1 and y = 24). There is only a 2.2-fold difference between the curves. A repeat experiment (not shown) with different protein preparations showed a 3.5-fold effect. Comparison to the tropomyosin alone data (▵) in Fig. 3Ashows that addition of the troponin tail fragment increased the Kapp approximately 17-fold. Furthermore, this large effect is not due to increased cooperativity (the curves are actually less steep when TnT1–153 is present than for tropomyosin alone), so the shift is due to enhanced interactions with actin and is caused by the NH2-terminal portion of TnT. A slightly longer tail fragment, TnT1–173, strongly promoted tropomyosin binding to actin, but also caused tropomyosin sedimentation in the absence of actin. This precluded measurement of its effect on binding (data not shown). Experiments with TnT fragments shorter than 153 residues"

Two protein kinases that have been linked to growth factor-regulated proliferation and survival are mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) and its downstream target Erk, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Using complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that MEK and Erk activation requires a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-generated signal in an interleukin (IL)-3-dependent myeloid progenitor cell line. Analysis of the upstream pathway leading to MEK activation revealed that inhibition of PI3-K did not block c-Raf activation, whereas MEK activation was effectively blocked under these conditions. Furthermore, agents that elevated cAMP suppressed IL-3-induced c-Raf activation but did not inhibit MEK activation. Because c-Raf activation and MEK activation were inversely affected by PI3-K- and cAMP-dependent pathways, we examined whether IL-3 activated the alternative Raf isoforms A-Raf and B-Raf. Although IL-3 did not activate B-Raf, A-Raf was activated by the cytokine. Moreover, A-Raf activation, like MEK activation, was blocked by inhibition of PI3-K but was insensitive to cAMP. Experiments with dominant negative mutants of the Raf isoforms showed that overexpression of dominant negative c-Raf did not prevent MEK activation. However, dominant negative A-Raf effectively blocked MEK activation, suggesting that activation of the MEK-Erk signaling cascade is mediated through A-Raf. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-3 receptors engage and activate both c-Raf and A-Raf in hemopoietic cells. However, these intermediates are differentially regulated by upstream signaling cascades and selectively coupled to downstream signaling pathways.

IL-3 and the related cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor and IL-5 bind to heterodimeric receptors, which are composed of unique α subunits and shared β subunits (1Lopez A.F.

Ligand-induced receptor subunit heterodimerization activates receptor-bound protein-tyrosine kinases and initiates a series of intracellular signaling cascades, including the Erk activation pathway (2Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Hara T. Miyajima A. Stem Cells. 1996; 14: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although commonly depicted as a simple linear pathway, the Ras-Erk signaling cascade receives regulatory inputs from several other receptor-triggered signaling pathways. One key site for signal integration is at the level of c-Raf. A requisite signal is provided by the interaction of GTP-bound Ras with c-Raf. Although necessary, Ras interaction with c-Raf is insufficient for maximal c-Raf activation, and other signaling pathways impinge on c-Raf (4Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The precise identities of these other pathways remain unclear, but protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (5Kolch W. Heidecker G.

A. 1996; 93: 11681-11686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have all been implicated in c-Raf activation. c-Raf is the most-studied Raf isoform; however, mammalian cells also express the related Raf isoforms A-Raf and B-Raf (9Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar), which phosphorylate and activate MEK. Although much is known about the stimuli that regulate and activate c-Raf and B-Raf, comparatively little is known about A-Raf. Relatively few stimuli have been shown to activate A-Raf, and these limited studies suggest that A-Raf regulation is similar to c-Raf regulation (10Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Like c-Raf, A-Raf associates with GTP-bound Ras, suggesting that A-Raf is a downstream Ras effector, although it currently remains unclear whether A-Raf has unique functions or is redundant with c-Raf. In addition to the Raf protein kinases, another Ras effector is the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) (12Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Several forms of PI3-K have been identified, including the heterodimeric PI3-K, which is composed of a regulatory 85-kDa subunit and a catalytic 110-kDa subunit (12Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). PI3-K activation has pleiotropic effects on cell function and downstream signaling pathways (13Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The lipid kinase is required for growth factor-induced activation of the protein kinases PDK1 (14Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) and AKT (15Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Both PDK1 and AKT bind 3′-phosphorylated lipids through their pleckstrin homology domains. PDK1 is required for p70S6K (17Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and AKT activation. AKT participates in transducing cellular survival signals by phosphorylating and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic action of BAD, a Bcl-2 family member (18Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). However, PI3-K also has functions that are cell type-specific. For example, PI3-K is essential for receptor-driven activation of the MEK-Erk signaling cascade in some cell types (20Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) but not in others (23Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). In cells that require PI3-K for MEK and Erk activation, analysis of the pathway has demonstrated that in most instances PI3-K was not required for Ras activation, but the lipid kinase was required for c-Raf activation. Taken together, these studies suggest that PI3-K may deliver a cooperative activation signal to c-Raf. However, the nature of the signal and how it interacts with c-Raf are currently unknown. Using complementary pharmacologic and genetic strategies, the present results demonstrate that PI3-K is an essential element of IL-3-induced activation of the MEK-Erk signaling cascade in primary mouse bone marrow cells and in the IL-3-dependent cell line FDC-P1. Additional analyses revealed that agents that elevate cAMP did not block MEK and Erk activation. These findings prompted us to examine the upstream signaling pathways that regulate MEK and Erk activation. Our results demonstrate that, unlike MEK activation, c-Raf activation was not blocked by PI3-K inhibition. Moreover, MEK activation was not sensitive to cAMP, whereas c-Raf activation was sensitive to the drug, suggesting that other MEK kinases activate MEK. Thus, we examined the Raf isoforms A-Raf and B-Raf. Although B-Raf was not activated by IL-3, A-Raf activity was induced by the cytokine. Moreover, A-Raf activation, like MEK activation, required PI3-K and was not blocked by cAMP. Using dominant negative mutants of both A-Raf and c-Raf, we found that only kinase-inactive A-Raf blocked MEK activation. Together, these results document that IL-3 activates both c-Raf and A-Raf and that only A-Raf activation requires a PI3-K-dependent signal. Furthermore, even though both isoforms are activated by IL-3, only A-Raf relays MEK- and Erk-activating signals, suggesting that other molecular mechanisms determine how activated Raf isoforms engage downstream signaling pathways. WEHI-3-conditioned medium was used as a source of IL-3 for growth of FDC-P1 cells. WEHI-3 cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium containing additions as described previously (24Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To prepare WEHI-3-conditioned medium, cells were grown to stationary phase and then incubated for 2 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was then centrifuged, filtered though a 0.2 μm filter, and stored at 4 °C. FDC-P1 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 10% WEHI-3-conditioned medium. To prepare primary bone marrow cells, the femurs and tibias from four BALB/c mice were flushed with FDC-P1 growth medium. The resulting cell suspension was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in a 50-ml conical tube to allow large debris to settle. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 600 × g for 8 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in FDC-P1 cell growth medium containing 40 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (1 × 107/ml) were cultured in tissue culture-treated 100-mm plastic dishes, and fresh medium was added to the cultures each day. After 3 days, the cells (1–1.5 × 107 per assay point) were deprived of growth factors as described previously (24Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for 4 h. FDC-P1 cells were transfected by electroporation. Cells (1 × 107 per transfection) were mixed with DNA in 400 μl of complete growth medium. Total DNA was kept constant (40 μg) for all transfections by addition of empty vector, if required. The DNA-cell suspension was transferred to a 4-mm cuvette and electroporated with a 10-ms, 350-V pulse using a BTX T820 square wave electroporator (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). Recombinant murine IL-3 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific for Erk2 (C-14), c-Raf (C-12), B-Raf (C-19), and A-Raf (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-MEK monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Murine monoclonal antibody preparations AU1 and 12CA5 (anti-HA) were purchased from Babco (Berkeley, CA). Monoclonal antibody 9E10 (anti-Myc) hybridoma was from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the antibody was purified over protein G-agarose from ascites fluid from inoculated BALB/c mice. The Erk substrate, myelin basic protein, was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins GST-ErkKD (MEK substrate) and GST-MEKKD (Raf substrate) were prepared as described previously (22Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The c-Jun N-terminal kinase substrate was produced in Escherichia coliusing an expression vector generously provided by J. S. Gutkind (National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD) (25Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). The c-Raf cDNA in pUC13 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. All epitope-tagged proteins were expressed from the elongation factor 1α promoter in a modified pEF-BOS (26Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) expression vector (pEF-BOSΔRI). The parental vector contains two EcoRI restriction sites. To generate pEF-BOSΔRI, the EcoRI restriction site on the 3′ side of the polyadenylation sequences was removed. Removal of this restriction site allowed insertion of cDNA sequences with 5′ EcoRI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites. All PCR- and mutagenesis-derived portions were sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the amplification and mutagenic procedures, respectively. Epitope-tagged Raf (Myc-Raf) was constructed with PCR by appending aBamHI site, a Kozak consensus sequence, an initiating Met codon, and the Myc epitope in frame with the N terminus of c-Raf. ANotI site was inserted between the Myc epitope and the N terminus of c-Raf. A C-terminal XbaI site was incorporated after the stop codon. The digested PCR fragment was ligated intoBamHI- and XbaI-digested pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3-Myc-c-Raf. Because expression levels were higher with the pEF-BOSΔRI vector, Myc-c-Raf was transferred to the pEF-BOSΔRI vector using a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ XbaI site. Epitope-tagged MEK (Myc-MEK) was constructed by PCR amplification using primers that fused a NotI site to the N terminus of the MEK1 cDNA, a generous gift of G. Johnson (National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO), and anXbaI site to the 3′-end. The PCR product was then digested with NotI and XbaI and ligated into the vector backbone of NotI- and XbaI-digested pEF-BOSΔRI-Myc-c-Raf (removing c-Raf but not the Myc epitope tag) to generate pEF-BOSΔRI-Myc-MEK. Epitope-tagged, wild-type, and kinase-inactive c-Raf (RafKD-HA2) expression constructs were constructed by PCR amplification of the 5′ portion of the gene to remove all native 5′ untranslated sequences. These were replaced with an EcoRI site and a Kozak consensus sequence. The 3′-end of c-Raf was modified to remove the stop codon of c-Raf and to append tandem copies of the HA tag (recognized by the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody), a new stop codon, and an XbaI site. The epitope-tagged version was ligated into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pEF-BOSΔRI to yield pEF-BOS-c-Raf-HA2. The kinase-inactive version (pEF-BOS-c-RafKD-HA2) was constructed using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to change Lys-375 to Trp. The human A-Raf cDNA was isolated by PCR amplification from a brain cDNA preparation (CLONTECH) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). The 5′ PCR primer added an EcoRI restriction site and a Kozak consensus sequence. The 3′ primer removed the terminal stop codon and was engineered to provide an in frame fusion (using the XbaI site) with the same tandem HA tag as was used in construction of the epitope-tagged c-Raf. The resulting A-Raf PCR product was subcloned into pEF-BOS-c-RafKD-HA2, replacing the c-Raf coding sequence with the A-Raf PCR product to yield pEF-BOS-A-Raf-HA2. To prepare the kinase-inactive A-Raf expression construct, pEF-BOS-A-RafKD-HA2 was mutagenized with the GeneEditor kit (Promega, Corp; Madison, WI) to replace K336 with Trp, an analogous mutation to that present in the kinase-inactive c-Raf. The AKT cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from a commercial PCR-ready cDNA preparation from human bone marrow (CLONTECH). The epitope-tagged AKT expression vector (pEF-BOS-AU1-AKT) was prepared by appending an EcoRI site, a Kozak consensus site, a translation initiation AUG codon, and the AU1 epitope tag that was fused in frame to the second codon of AKT. The 3′-end of the PCR product contained an XbaI site. pEF-BOS-AU1-AKT was assembled by ligating the epitope-tagged AKT fragment into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pEF-BOSΔRI. The dominant negative p85 expression vector was prepared from a murine p85 cDNA clone, which was a generous gift of L. Williams (Chiron Corp., San Francisco, CA). A portion of the iSH2 domain of p85 was deleted with the Transformer kit (CLONTECH). The deletion removed amino acids 479–513 (27Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and replaced them with a Glu and Phe residue (an EcoRI site) to generate Δp85. The Δp85 cDNA was modified on the 3′-end to remove the native stop codon and append a tandem HA tag and XbaI site to Δp85. The epitope-tagged Δp85 cDNA was cloned into pEF-BOSΔRI to yield pEF-BOSΔRI-Δp85. Raf, MEK, and Erk assays were performed as described previously (22Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J.

Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), except that cells were deprived of IL-3 for 4 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For all kinase assays, cells were deprived of growth factors as described previously (22Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and stimulated with 10 or 20 ng/ml IL-3 or 10 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for the indicated times. Kinase activities were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. FDC-P1 cells were deprived of growth factors for 12 h in RPMI medium supplemented with TCM (Celox Laboratory Inc., St. Paul, MN) (24Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells were pretreated with either nothing or the indicated concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min in the same medium and added to 96-well plates (10,000 cells per well). The cells were stimulated with the indicated amounts of recombinant IL-3 for 12 h. At the end of this incubation, [3H]thymidine was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 6 h. Cells were then harvested and processed as described previously (29Abraham R.T. Ho S.N. McKean D.J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1986; 10: 93-100Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For cell cycle analysis, FDC-P1 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression construct (pEGFP-N1, CLONTECH) and either empty vector or 20 μg of pEF-BOSΔRI-Δp85-HA2. Twenty hours later, the cells were incubated in PBS with 20 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33342 at 37 °C for 20 min. Two-color flow cytometry was used to analyze transfected cells (using GFP for green fluorescence) for cell cycle (using Hoechst dye for blue fluorescence). Data were analyzed using Modfit analysis software (Topsham, ME). Our previous results demonstrated that IL-2-induced Erk activation in T cells was partially sensitive to wortmannin, suggesting that both wortmannin-sensitive and wortmannin-resistant pathways participated in the Erk activation response in this cell type (22Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We therefore extended our investigation to determine whether Erk activation induced by other hemopoietic growth factors was also sensitive to wortmannin. Our initial experiments tested whether the drug affected IL-3-induced Erk activation in primary bone marrow cells. Isolated murine bone marrow cells were deprived of exogenous growth factors for 4 h, pretreated with wortmannin and stimulated with IL-3. Wortmannin strongly inhibited IL-3-induced Erk activation in these cells (Fig. 1), but the drug had no effect on phorbol ester-induced Erk activation. These results demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of wortmannin on cytokine-induced Erk activation were not restricted to T cells and that the wortmannin-sensitive pathway played a major role in IL-3-induced Erk activation in normal bone marrow cells. Due to the technical limitations imposed by studies in primary hemopoietic cells, we determined whether the inhibitory effects of wortmannin on Erk activation were recapitulated in the IL-3-dependent cell line FDC-P1 (Fig. 2). Factor-deprived FDC-P1 cells were treated with wortmannin and stimulated with IL-3. Erk (Fig. 2A) and MEK (Fig. 2B) were immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates for determination of in vitro kinase activities. As was observed with the primary bone marrow cells, wortmannin effectively suppressed both MEK and Erk activation, indicating that the IL-3 receptor couples to Erk largely through a wortmannin-sensitive signaling pathway. Because FDC-P1 cells are amenable to biochemical and genetic analyses, we used this cell line as a model system to dissect the signaling pathways that regulate IL-3-induced Erk activation. In many experimental systems PI3-K plays critical roles in relaying proliferative signals from growth factor receptors. However, the situation is less clear for hemopoietic cytokine receptors. Because wortmannin effectively inhibits PI3-K, we asked how wortmannin would affect IL-3-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 3). FDC-P1 cells were deprived of growth factors, which synchronizes them in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (data not shown). The G1 phase cells were pretreated with a single addition of the indicated concentrations of wortmannin and stimulated with IL-3. Because wortmannin is unstable in solution and PI3-K levels remain suppressed for only 9–12 h after drug addition (22Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), cells were pulsed after 12 h with [3H]thymidine (as cells first enter S phase) and cultured an additional 6 h before harvesting. Therefore, PI3-K was maximally inhibited during the progression of the IL-3-stimulated cells through G1. Wortmannin attenuated IL-3-induced DNA synthesis at concentrations that inhibited PI3-K and blocked IL-3-induced Erk activation. Because these experiments were performed with a single addition of wortmannin, and PI3-K activity would be recovering during the later times of the experiment, these results likely do not reflect the full impact of PI3-K inhibition on G1-to-S phase progression. This inhibition of DNA synthesis is not the result of cell killing, as FDC-P1 cells cultured in these concentrations of wortmannin do not undergo apoptosis, even though PI3-K and AKT activation are fully inhibited (data not shown). To address the specificity of the effects of wortmannin, we coexpressed GFP with either empty vector or dominant negative p85 (Δp85) (27Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of green-fluorescing cells revealed that transfection with GFP and empty vector produced cells that cycled normally through the cell cycle (58% G1, 33% S, and 9% G2/M). In contrast, cells cotransfected with GFP and Δp85 were primarily found in G1 (81% G1, 12% S, and 7% G2/M), suggesting that genetically blocking that pathway may be more effective than wortmannin in blocking cell cycle progression. Taken together with the drug study, these results suggest strongly that PI3-K plays a crucial role in promoting IL-3-induced cell cycle progression. Wortmannin blocked MEK and Erk activation by 50% (IC50) at a concentration of 3 nm (data not shown), which coincides with the IC50 for PI3-K inhibition in intact cells (30Karnitz L. Sutor S.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested that a wortmannin-sensitive PI3-K is an upstream regulator of Erk activation in IL-3-stimulated hemopoietic cells. Therefore, as a complementary strategy to assess the role of PI3-K in Erk activation, we examined the effect of dominant negative Δp85 (Δp85-HA2) on IL-3-induced MEK activation. As a positive control to confirm that Δp85-HA2 interrupts PI3-K-mediated signaling, we cotransfected the cells with an AU1-tagged AKT expression vector. Expression vectors for all three epitope-tagged proteins were cotransfected into FDC-P1 cells, with increasing amounts of Δp85-HA2 as indicated (Fig. 4A). After factor deprivation, the transfected cell populations were divided into two equal sets. One set was stimulated IL-3 (20 min), the detergent lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-AU1 antibody, and AKT activity was determined (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). The other set was stimulated with IL-3 (5 min), the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and MEK kinase assays were performed (see Fig. 6A, top panel). Increasing amounts of cotransfected Δp85-HA2 plasmid DNA progressively blocked IL-3-induced activation of both AKT and MEK with virtually identical potencies (Fig. 4C). However, a small portion of MEK activation was not blocked by Δp85 or wortmannin (see Fig. 2), suggesting that a PI3-K-independent pathway plays a minor role in IL-3-induced MEK activation. The alterations in IL-3-induced MEK and AKT activation were not explained by differences in the expression of the epitope-tagged protein kinases (Fig. 4B). Because AKT and MEK showed nearly identical sensitivity to coexpressed Δp85-HA2, these results argue strongly that PI3-K plays a pivotal u"

In this study, gel shift assays and electron microscopic analysis were used to show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH2/6 complex binds to Holliday junctions and has an affinity and specificity for them that is at least as high as it has as for mispaired bases. Under equilibrium binding conditions, the MSH2/6 complex had a K d of binding to Holliday junctions of 0.5 nm. The MSH2/6 complex enhanced the cleavage of Holliday junctions by T4 endonuclease VII and T7 endonuclease I. This is consistent with the view that the MSH2/6 complex can function in both mismatch repair and the resolution of recombination intermediates as predicted by genetic studies.

This is consistent with the view that the MSH2/6 complex can function in both mismatch repair and the resolution of recombination intermediates as predicted by genetic studies. Virtually all recombination models propose the formation of heteroduplex joints during recombination in which a single strand from one parental DNA is paired with a complementary strand from another parental DNA (1Radman M. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1988: 169-192Google Scholar, 2Meselson M. Low K.B. Recombination of the Genetic Material. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 91-113Google Scholar). When the two single strands differ in sequence, the resulting heteroduplex intermediate contains mispaired bases. These mispaired bases are generally processed by the MutHLS mismatch repair pathway in bacteria and the related pathway in eukaryotes that utilizes the MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS1, and MLH1 gene products (3Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 4Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Some specific mispaired bases like T:G, A:G, and A:C can also be repaired by the base-specific mismatch repair pathways, and some other mispaired bases like C:C and palindromic insertion mispairs sometimes escape repair at significant frequencies (3Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 4Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev.

In addition to repairing mispaired bases, the MutHLS type of mismatch repair pathways are also known to play other roles in recombination. One example of this is that recombination between divergent, so-called homologous DNA sequences occurs at reduced frequency compared with recombination between homologous sequence (7Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). This regulation of recombination occurs as a consequence of the formation of mispaired bases in recombination intermediates and is also dependent on mismatch repair genes such as mutS, mutL, MSH2,MSH3, MLH1, PMS1, and probably other such genes. Such effects have been extensively documented in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells (7Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M.

Huang H.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed that could explain these observations. One is that mismatch repair recognizes recombination intermediates that are formed from divergent DNAs and contain multiple mismatches and destroys them as a byproduct of repair (19Borts R.H. Haber J.E. Science. 1987; 237: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Doutriaux M.P. Wagner R. Radman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2576-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Alternately, some combination of mismatch repair enzymes could recognize the formation of mispaired bases in recombination intermediates and block the formation of the mature recombination intermediate (21Radman M. Genome. 1989; 31: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this latter model, Escherichia coli mismatch repair enzymes can block the RecA-mediated branch migration in vitro when the recombining DNAs contain sequence differences (24Worth Jr., L. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A second type of regulation of recombination has been observed during the study of gene conversion polarity gradients (6Detloff P. White M.A. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 113-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene conversion polarity gradients are thought to be due to a gradient of heteroduplex DNA that is highest near the site where recombination initiates and decreases with increasing distance away from the initiation site. However, in mismatch repair-deficient mutants or when mutations that form mispairs that escape mismatch repair are located at the low end of the polarity gradient, the extent of apparent heteroduplex formation at the low end of the gradient is increased to the level seen at the high end of the gradient. Three models have been presented to explain this. One suggests that polarity gradients are due to restoration repair occurring specifically at the low end of the gradient (6Detloff P. White M.A. Petes T.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 113-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second is that heteroduplex DNA formed at the low end of the gradient is specifically unwound when mispaired bases are present (22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third is that, once mispaired bases are formed at the low end of the gradient, this causes the resolution of the Holliday junctions that are extending the heteroduplex regions. This would leave symmetrically located nicks in the recombinant DNA molecules, which could serve to initiate compensating mismatch repair that would eliminate the genetic consequences of heteroduplex DNA at the low end of the polarity gradient (22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these models postulates the coordination of mismatch repair/recognition with the process of heteroduplex formation and recombination intermediate resolution. A different type of effect of mismatch repair-related proteins on recombination was observed through the discovery of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MSH4 and MSH5 (25Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These proteins are apparently not required for mismatch repair but are required for meiotic crossing over, as mutations in MSH4 and MSH5 reduce the frequency of crossing over and cause defects in chromosome segregation during meiosis. Humans and mice also containMSH4 and MSH5, and mice containing mutations in MSH5 have meiotic defects suggesting that the human and mouse proteins act in the same processes as the S. cerevisiae proteins (27Paquis-Flucklinger V. Santucci-Darmanin S. Paul R. Saunieres A. Turc-Carel C. Desnuelle C. Genomics. 1997; 44: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,28Winand N. Panzer J.A. Kolodner R. Genomics. 1998; 53: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 1Edelmann, W., Cohen, P., Knetz, B., Winand, N., Heyer, J., Kolodner, R., Pollard, J. W., and Kucherlapati, R. (1999)Nat. Genet. 21,123–127 In both humans and S. cerevisiae, MSH4 and MSH5 form a heterodimer consistent with the results that mutations in each of the two S. cerevisiae genes cause similar defect in meiotic crossing over (28Winand N. Panzer J.A. Kolodner R. Genomics. 1998; 53: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Pochart P. Woltering D. Hollingsworth N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30345-30349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that MLH1 plays a role in meiotic crossing over similar to that proposed for MSH4 and MSH5 (30Hunter N. Borts R.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these observations is that MSH4, MSH5, and possibly MLH1 interact with recombination intermediates and regulate their resolution. Although it is clear that mismatch repair and mismatch repair-related proteins play important roles in regulating recombination, particularly in eukaryotes, there is little information about the mechanism of these processes. In the first two cases discussed above, there must be some interaction between the processes that recognize and repair mispaired bases and the processes/intermediates that form heteroduplex DNA. In the latter case, MutS-related proteins play a role in how recombination intermediates are resolved, suggesting they may actually recognize recombination intermediates. In previous studies, we demonstrated that MSH2 can recognize Holliday junctions in DNA, suggesting it may play a role in the processing of Holliday junctions (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is known that MSH2 functions in a complex with either MSH3 or MSH6 and that the MSH2/3 and MSH2/6 complexes have different mispair recognition properties compared with MSH2 alone (for reviews see Refs. 3Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 32Fishel R.

To further analyze the role of MSH2 in Holliday junction processing, we have investigated the ability of MSH2-MSH6 complex to recognize Holliday junctions and modify their processing by Holliday junction resolution enzymes. S. cerevisiae MSH2/MSH6 was purified using a method similar to that described by Alani (34Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). MSH2 and MSH6 were coexpressed in the presense of galactose from separate 2-μm plasmids under control ofGAL10 promoters in a protease deficient strain (S. cerevisiae strain RKY2418 containing pRDK354 MSH2 and pRDK568 MSH6). Cell extracts were made from galactose-induced cells by grinding under liquid nitrogen, and the MSH2-MSH6 was purified by sequential chromatography on PBE94, single-strand DNA cellulose, and Q-Sepharose using chromatography conditions that were essentially the same as those described by Alani (34Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Details of the purification will be described elsewhere. 2G. T. Marsischky and R. D. Kolodner, submitted for publication. Analysis of the protein preparation by SDS-PAGE is presented in Fig. 1A. Densitometric analysis demonstrated that the purity of MSH2/6 in the final fraction was determined to be greater than 95% and the molar ratio of MSH2 to MSH6 was 1:1. Gel filtration analysis using a Pharmacia SMART system did not detect any free MSH2 or MSH6 in the preparation. 4H. Flores-Ruzas and R. D. Kolodner, unpublished results. Holliday junction substrates (J0-J12) and the G:C homoduplex substrate used in this study were constructed from oligonucleotides and were purified by HPLC 3The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EM, electron microscopy; DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s); endo, endonuclease using a Waters GEN-PAK FAX column (Milford, MA) as described (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The G:T heteroduplex substrate analogous to the G:C homoduplex substrate was constructed by annealing oligos 28756 (5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCC) and 28755 (5′-GGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGATGTCTTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTC), and was purified by HPLC as described. The Holliday junction 565 and Holliday junction 75 DNAs (32P-labeled) used for EM and junction cleavage were prepared as described previously (35Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). HPLC-purified DNA substrates were 5′-end-labeled using [γ -32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by centrifugation through a Centri-Sep column (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ). DNA binding assays were performed by incubating MSH2/6 (50 nm MSH2/6 heterodimer, unless otherwise described) with the 32P-labeled DNA substrate (10 nm, unless otherwise described) in a final volume of 30 μl of Binding Buffer (25 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 20 °C. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 5% just prior to gel electrophoresis on 4.5% polyacrylamide (60:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 5% glycerol for 5 h at 150 V at 4 °C. Gels were dried and subsequently analyzed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Complexes of MSH2/6 with Holliday junction DNA were formed by incubating the DNA (5 μg/ml) with MSH2/6 in a 20-μl volume at a molar ratio of 40 MSH2/6 heterodimers per Holliday junction DNA for 15 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 40 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The DNA-protein complexes were then prepared for EM by fixation with 0.6% glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by filtration through 2-ml columns of BioGel A5m (Bio-Rad). The purified DNA samples were mixed with a buffer containing 2 mm spermidine, 0.15 m NaCl, and applied for 30 s to thin carbon foils supported by 400-mesh copper grids. The grids were washed with sequential washes of water and a graded ethanol series, air-dried, and rotary shadowcast at 10−7 torr with tungsten. Samples were examined in a Philips CM12 instrument. Images were taken on sheet film, scanned with a Nikon LS4500 AF film scanner, and the contrast adjusted with Adobe Photoshop. The 32P-labeled Hol75 DNA was used as a substrate for the junction cleavage assays. The DNA was incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg/ml calf thymus DNA at room temperature with or without MSH2/6 for 15 min, and then treated with the indicated amount of enzyme (the kind gift of Dr. Borries Kemper, University of Koln, Koln, Germany) for different times as described previously (35Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA and SDS to 50 mm and 1%, respectively, followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. The cleavage products were electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. The percent of cleavage was measured by using a PhosphorImager. In previous experiments, MSH2 was observed to bind to oligonucleotide duplexes containing Holliday junctions (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in addition to its ability to recognize mispaired based present in oligonucleotide duplexes (36Alani E. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 34Alani E. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), we tested whether MSH2/6 heterodimers would also bind to Holliday junctions. In the present experiments, gel mobility shift experiments were used to assess the binding of MSH2/6 to the same series of eight Holliday junctions (J0-J12) previously used to study binding of MSH2 (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of MSH2/6 to a control oligonucleotide homoduplex (G:C) and an oligonucleotide heteroduplex (G:T) was assessed. The MSH2/6 preparation (Fig. 1A) used in these experiments was greater than 95% pure, had a molar ratio of MSH2 to MSH6 of 1:1, and did not contain any free MSH2 or free MSH6. In experiments where increasing amounts of MSH2/6 were incubated with a fixed amount of different DNA substrates, increasing amounts of MSH2/6 complexed with either the J12 Holliday junction or the G:T- or G:C-containing duplexes were observed (Fig. 1B). In this experiment, the relative affinity of MSH2/6 for the different DNA substrates appeared to be J12 > G:T > G:C. Similarly, in experiments with a fixed amount of MSH2/6 and increasing amounts of either J12 or G:T-containing duplex substrates, MSH2/6 bound to greater amounts of J12 at lower substrate concentration than to a G:T-containing duplex. The binding of MSH2/6 to J12 and G:T-containing duplex was found to be saturating at 1.1 and 0.9 pmol of MSH2/6 per pmol of substrate, assuming that the active species is a MSH2/6 heterodimer. In previous experiments with MSH2, equilibrium binding conditions were not achieved (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine if equilibrium binding was observed with MSH2/6, two different experiments were performed with J12 Holliday junction, and the G:T- and G:C-containing duplexes. In one experiment, each labeled substrate was mixed with different amounts of unlabeled competitor substrate (molar ratios of 2.5:1 to 50:1 were tested) and incubation with MSH2/6 at a 5:1 ratio of MSH2/6 per labeled substrate was performed for 60 min prior to measuring the relative amount of labeled substrate present in complex. In a second experiment, MSH2/6 was incubated with labeled J12, G:T, or G:C substrate for 60 min to preform complexes. Then the same ratios of unlabeled competitors were added and incubation continued. The results showed equal amounts of competition independent of whether competitors were added before or after the MSH2/6 complexes were formed with labeled substrate (not shown). This demonstrated that, under the binding conditions used in the present experiments, equilibrium binding is achieved. This allows the data of Fig. 1C to be analyzed by Scatchard analysis yielding Kd values of 0.5 and 0.7 nmfor MSH2/6 binding to the J12 and G:T substrates, respectively. To further analyze the specificity of MSH2/6 for Holliday junctions, a series of competition experiments were performed in which labeled G:T-containing substrate was mixed with different amounts of unlabeled G:T-, J12, or G:C-containing competitors and the amount of complex formed between MSH2/6 and labeled G:T-containing substrates was measured. Analysis of the results showed that J12 was a slightly better competitor than G:T, which was a significantly better competitor than G:C (Fig. 2A). When these data were analyzed by the method of Chi and Kolodner (42Chi N.-W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29984-29992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MSH2/6 was found to have a 9.4- and 5.6-fold greater affinity for J12 and G:T, respectively, compared with G:C. In a second series, a 10-fold excess of eight different Holliday junctions, as well as G:T- and G:C-containing duplexes, were tested for their ability to compete for binding of MSH2/6 to labeled G:T-containing substrate (Fig. 2B). The results showed that under these conditions, theoretical competition was observed for the G:T competitor. The G:T competitor was about a 7-fold better competitor than G:C, and all of the Holliday junctions tested were significantly better competitors that the G:T competitor, with some being up to 3-fold better competitors than the G:T competitor. These data demonstrate that MSH2/6 binds specifically to both G:T- and Holliday junction-containing substrates compared with G:C-containing substrate and that MSH2/6 likely recognizes Holliday junctions with greater affinity than the G:T-containing substrate tested here. In a study to be published elsewhere, we have analyzed the ability of MSH2/6 to recognize 65 different mispaired base-containing DNAs including all possible base-base mispairs and numerous insertion/deletion mispairs ranging from +1 base to +16 bases. In no case did the affinity of MSH2/6 for another mispaired base exceed the affinity seen here for the G:T-containing substrate. Thus MSH2/6 appears to generally have a higher affinity for the Holliday junctions studied here than for mispaired bases. The preceding experiments demonstrate that MSH2/6 binds strongly to DNA molecules containing a Holliday junction, but do not address the question whether it binds directly to the junction as contrasted to binding along an arm or as an extreme case, binding to the ends of the four arms and then coalescing to form a more stable complex. To address this, EM was used to examine complexes of MSH2/6 with a synthetic Holliday junction DNA (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) containing four arms of ∼565 base pairs extending from the J12 junction of Picksley et al.(43Picksley S.M. Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as described previously (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This DNA, termed Hol565, was incubated with MSH2/6 at a ratio of 40 heterodimers per junction DNA for 15 min and the samples then fixed with glutaraldehyde followed by preparation for EM (44Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Examination of fields of molecules revealed Holliday junction DNAs with four extended arms and, in many cases, with proteins bound (Fig. 3). In one experiment, 79% of the DNA molecules scored (n = 89) showed MSH2/6 bound while 21% of the molecules were protein-free. Of the Holliday junction molecules containing MSH2/6, 82% showed a large protein complex centered over the junction while 18% had protein balls located along one or more arms or at a DNA terminus. In general, the four DNA arms exiting the MSH2/6 complex were well separated from each other, often taking nearly 90° trajectories. When the incubation buffer contained 5 mm MgCl2, conditions used below for the endonuclease cleavage experiments, all four DNA arms were most often folded back on themselves, generating a thick DNA filament having the length of one DNA arm and with a protein complex at one end (not shown). Reduction of the molar ratio of MSH2/6 to Holliday junction DNA to 5:1 resulted in a lower amount (25%) of the Holliday junction DNA-containing bound protein. From these results we conclude that the protein is mostly localizing to the junction as contrasted to elsewhere on the DNA and binds with very high specificity as shown above. Previous EM studies demonstrated that MSH2 can also bind to Holliday junctions (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using the same substrates and binding conditions, 25% of the Holliday junctions had MSH2 bound at a single site and 75% were protein-free. Of the DNAs with MSH2 bound, 61% had MSH2 bound at the junction, 21% had MSH2 bound at an end and 18% had MSH2 bound at a single internal site on an arm. As described above, MSH2/6 complex bound to over three times more DNA molecules and with a greater proportion of binding at the junction. These results suggest that MSH2/6 has a greater affinity and specificity for Holliday junctions compared with MSH2 alone. In order to further characterize the binding of MSH2/6 to Holliday junctions, we tested whether the binding of MSH2/6 would occlude the Holliday junction from access by the Holliday junction resolution enzymes T4 endo VII and T7 endo I. Complexes of MSH2/6 were formed with a 32P-labeled Holliday junction DNA containing 75-bp arms (Hol 75 DNA) (35Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The DNA was incubated with either no MSH2/6 or 40 heterodimers per junction DNA. T4 endo VII (1, 2, 5, or 10 ng) or T7 endo I (1, 2, 3, 5, or 12 ng) were added to each sample, and incubation continued under conditions where the enzymes were competent for cleavage. The DNA was deproteinized, electrophoresed on an acrylamide gel, and imaged by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4(A and B) and quantified by phosphoimager analysis (Fig. 4C), the binding of MSH2/6 to the Hol75 DNA significantly facilitated its cleavage by both enzymes as contrasted to parallel incubations lacking MSH2/6. Under the salt conditions required for enzyme cleavage, approximately half of the Holliday junctions would have been complexed by MSH2/6. The effect of MSH2/6 was particularly evident when only 1 ng of T4 endo VII was present in the reaction; under these conditions, at least a 2-fold enhancement of cleavage was observed in the presence of MSH2/6. A prior study of the binding of p53 to Holliday junctions (35Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) similarly revealed that, although the junctions were hidden by a large mass of protein (as seen by EM), they were nonetheless more sensitive to cleavage by two well characterized junction-resolving enzymes, T4 endo VII and T7 endo I. To follow the kinetics of junction cleavage, the Hol75 DNA was preincubated with either no MSH2/6 or 40 heterodimers per DNA, followed by the addition of 100 ng of T4 endo VII or T7 endo I for 15 min. Aliquots were removed over this period and the cleavage patterns analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results (Fig. 5) revealed that, for both enzymes, the rate of cleavage of the Holliday junctions was markedly greater when the Holliday junctions were first complexed by MSH2/6. The greatest difference was noted with T7 endo I (Fig. 5, B and C), where a roughly 3-fold difference in the rate of cleavage was observed. These data suggest that MSH2/6 binds to Holliday junctions and alters their structure in some way so as to either make them more assessable to the Holliday junction resolution enzymes tested or increase the activity of these enzymes on the substrate DNA. Genetic studies demonstrating that mismatch repair proteins might play a role in the resolution of recombination intermediates previously led us to perform experiments demonstrating that MSH2 protein could specifically recognize Holliday junction recombination intermediates (22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Reenan R.A.G. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Alani E. Lee S.

Genetics. 1996; 142: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MSH2 is known to function as part of a complex with other MutS-related proteins, we have now extended our previous studies to the analysis of the interaction between the MSH2/6 complex and Holliday junctions. The results of these studies indicate that the MSH2/6 complex can interact with DNA molecules containing Holliday junctions due to a specific interaction with the Holliday junction. Several observations support this view. First, a high proportion of the Holliday junction-containing DNAs can be bound by MSH2/6. Binding saturation occurs at a molar ratio of approximately 1 MSH2/6 complex per Holliday junction. This value is similar to that obtained with a G:T mispair-containing substrate, a mispair known to be efficiently recognized by MSH2/6 in vitro and in vivo. Second, competition experiments and equilibrium binding experiments have shown that MSH2/6 complex has a higher affinity for Holliday junctions than for either control duplex DNAs or DNAs containing well recognized mispairs like G:T. Third, because the binding experiments presented here were performed in the presence of Mg2+, it is likely that MSH2/6 recognizes the junction structure itself rather than interacting with unpaired bases at the junction since all of the bases at the junction are base-paired under these conditions (reviewed in Ref. 46Lilley D.M. Clegg R.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. 1993; 22: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Finally, EM experiments directly demonstrate that MSH2/6 primarily binds to the junction rather than to other locations on junction-containing DNAs. Exactly what structural feature of a Holliday junction MSH2/6 recognizes is unclear. In previous experiments, MSH2 was observed to bind to oligonucleotide duplexes containing Holliday junctions (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in addition to its ability to recognize mispaired based present in oligonucleotide duplexes (36Alani E. Chi N.W. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,37Fishel R. Ewel A. Lee S. Lescoe M.K. Griffith J. Science. 1994; 266: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, the available evidence suggests that isolated MSH6 only interacts with DNA nonspecifically (34Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 38Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 39Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In previous studies, MSH2 interactions with DNAs containing Holliday junctions were analyzed using filter binding assays and EM (31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas in the present studies, we used gel mobility shift assays and EM. While the filter binding and gel mobility shift assays used were somewhat different, the DNA binding conditions used in the two studies were almost exactly the same and the EM experiments were conducted under the same DNA binding conditions, allowing us to compare the Holliday junction recognition properties of MSH2 and MSH2/6 complexes. Some distinct differences between the proteins were observed. First, MSH2 and MSH2/6 preferentially recognized Holliday junctions compared with either duplex control DNAs or mispair-containing DNAs in competition experiments. However, saturation binding to Holliday junctions occurred at 10-fold lower protein to DNA ratios for MSH2/6 complex compared with MSH2. Second, MSH2 alone appears to form two types of complexes with Holliday junctions, an unstable complex and a stable complex. In contrast, MSH2/6 appears to be in equilibrium with Holliday junctions in solution and only one type of complex is formed. Finally, EM experiments demonstrate that, compared with MSH2, MSH2/6 shows a greater specificity for binding at the junction compared with interaction at other locations on the Holliday junction-containing substrate. These observations indicate that not only does the presence of the MSH6 subunit change the character of the interaction between MSH2 and Holliday junctions, it also increases the specificity and affinity for interaction with Holliday junctions. These data support the idea that MSH6 modifies the intrinsic ability of MSH2 to recognize Holliday junctions and further support the idea that the MutS family of proteins interact with structures like Holliday junctions in vivo. A number of genetic studies have demonstrated that mismatch repair proteins interact with recombination intermediates and alter their resolution and/or processing in response to the extent of mispairing between the recombining DNAs. One idea that has been suggested is that proteins like MSH2 or, as shown here, MSH2/6 can coordinate the resolution of recombination intermediates in response to mispairing by virtue of their ability to recognize both mispaired bases and structures like Holliday junctions (22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Alani E. Lee S. Kane M.F. Griffith J. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The observation that the binding of MSH2/6 to Holliday junctions enhanced the cleavage of these structures suggests that the interaction between MSH2/6 and Holliday junctions alters the structure of the Holliday junction in some way that enhances their accessibility to the T4 and T7 endonucleases. It was not possible to test the effect of MSH2/6 on the appropriate eukaryotic Holliday junction resolution enzymes because the identity of these proteins has not yet been clarified and they are not available in pure form. However, the observation that MSH2/6 enhances the cleavage of Holliday junctions suggests that MSH2/6 and possibly other MutS-related proteins may be components of the Holliday junction resolution machinery. This suggests that MSH2/6 could be a useful reagent for use in the identification of other proteins that function in Holliday junction resolution. Genetic and biochemical studies have documented three different heterodimeric complexes of MutS-related proteins that function in the nucleus in genetic recombination and in some cases mismatch repair. These are MSH2/6, MSH2/3, and MSH4/5, the latter of which appears to only be required for efficient meiotic crossing over (3Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 28Winand N.

MSH2 appears to have an intrinsic ability to recognize mispaired bases and other structures in DNA and the MSH3 and MSH6 subunits appear to alter the ability of MSH2 to interact with these structures as well as possibly interact with other proteins (3Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). It is not known what structures MSH4, MSH5, or the MSH4/5 complex recognize in DNA. However, by analogy to the properties of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 and taking into account the genetics of MSH4 and MSH5, it seems likely that MSH4/5 also recognizes some DNA structure involved in recombination. Such recognition could occur in conjunction with other MSH proteins and other mismatch repair proteins like MLH1 (30Hunter N. Borts R.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It seems likely that it is different DNA structure recognition properties of these complexes and different abilities to interact with other proteins and recombination/repair pathways that accounts for the different roles these proteins appear to play in recombination.

In the presence of a nucleoside 5′-triphosphate (NTP) substrate, a reducing system, and a 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate (dNTP) allosteric effector, RTPR catalyzes homolysis of the C–Co bond of 1 to generate 2, 5′-deoxyadenosine, and a thiyl radical at Cys-408 of RTPR in a kinetically competent and concerted fashion (9Licht S.S.

This thiyl radical is then proposed to initiate the nucleotide reduction chemistry by abstraction of the 3′-hydrogen atom of the NTP (15Stubbe J. Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Silva D. Booker S. Krautler B.

In this paper we report studies with a mechanism-based inhibitor of this protein, 2′-deoxy-2′-methylenecytidine 5′-triphosphate (MdCTP, 3). These studies in conjunction with [U-15N]RTPR and AdoCbl specifically labeled in the nitrogens of its DMB moiety ([15N]AdoCbl) have provided the vehicle to identify DMB as the axial ligand during catalysis.DISCUSSIONThe means by which B12-requiring enzymes effect the remarkable 1010–1012 rate acceleration of C–Co bond cleavage is not understood and is an ongoing focus in many research laboratories. A number of proposals addressing this rate acceleration have been forwarded based on model studies and theoretical considerations (26Finke R.G. Krautler B. Arigoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim1998: 383-402Google Scholar). One hypothesis advocates an upward flexing of the corrin ring, thereby applying a steric strain to the upper axial ligand resulting in a weakening of the C–Co bond (27Schrauzer G.N. Grate J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 4601-4611Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Chemaly S.M. Pratt J.M. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1980; : 2274-2281Crossref Google Scholar, 29Randaccio L. Bresciani-Pahor N.

A recent resonance Raman study of MMCoA mutase, albeit in the absence of substrate, revealed a significant change in the conformation of the corrin ring of1 upon binding to the enzyme but little perturbation of the Co–C force constant (32Dong S. Padmakumar R. Maiti N. Banerjee R. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9947-9948Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar).A second hypothesis emphasizes the importance of the axial nitrogen ligand trans to the C–Co bond that is cleaved. Model studies have indicated that a weaker nitrogen donor ligand decreases the dissociation energy of the C–Co bond (33Ng F.T.T. Rempel G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 621-623Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Marzilli L.G. Summers M.F. Bresciani-Pahor N. Zangrando E. Charland J.-P. Randaccio L. J. Am. Chem.

Interest in this second hypothesis has been stimulated by extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography studies on MMCoA mutase, which indicate displacement of the DMB lower axial ligand of1 by a protein histidine in cob(II)alamin-bound MMCoA mutase, with a long Co–N bond (3Mancia F.

EPR studies on other AdoCbl-requiring carbon skeleton mutases reveal that these class I enzymes also utilize a histidine as their axial ligand (1Buckel W. Golding B.T. Chem. Soc.

In contrast, the AdoCbl enzymes catalyzing irreversible heteroatom rearrangements, typified by DD, use the DMB moiety of the cofactor as the axial ligand (7Abend A. Nitsche R. Bandarian V.

Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This motif is present in all class I enzymes and in methyltransferases and absent in class II enzymes, including RTPR. However, recently a methylcobalamin-dependent methyltransferase complex fromMethanobacterium thermoautrophicum, which possesses this motif, was shown not to use the designated histidine as its axial ligand but instead another histidine (41Sauer K. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 401-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus the presence of this putative cobalamin binding motif in the amino acid sequence of a cobalamin protein is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the protein histidine mode of ligation.In our continuing efforts to understand the mechanism of C–Co bond homolysis catalyzed by RTPR, we have now determined the identity of the lower axial ligand in a cob(II)alamin-bound form of the enzyme as DMB. RTPR thus appears to use the same mode of cofactor binding as the other class II proteins such as DD. Furthermore the similarities between RTPR and DD extend to the first steps in the chemistries these enzymes catalyze that involve hydrogen atom abstraction followed by an irreversible loss of water. However, despite these similarities only RTPR chemistry seems to require a protein-based radical. Recent studies have begun to shed light as to how RTPR manages to perturb the rate and equilibrium constants for the C–Co bond homolysis so dramatically. First, the enzyme has been shown to couple the thermodynamically unfavorable C–Co bond homolysis step with a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen atom abstraction from Cys-408, the first enzymatic example of molecule-induced homolysis (10Licht S.S. Booker S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Stubbe J. Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Silva D. Booker S. Krautler B. Arigoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim1998: 321-331Google Scholar). Second, a kinetic and thermodynamic analysis has revealed unexpectedly that entropy plays a key role in both ground state stabilization/destabilization and transition state stabilization (15Stubbe J. Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Silva D. Booker S. Krautler B. Arigoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim1998: 321-331Google Scholar,42Licht S.S. Lawrence C.C. Stubbe J.

Li J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9466-9474Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether these factors are in play in other B12-requiring proteins remains to be determined. The significance of nature's choice of DMB as the axial cobalamin ligand in RTPR and related enzymes such as DD on the one hand and a protein histidine in the carbon skeleton mutases on the other also remains to be established. Finally, it should be noted that in all the investigations into the nature of the axial ligand in AdoCbl-requiring proteins thus far, a substrate analog, a coenzyme analog, or photolysis of 1 have been required to generate the spectroscopic handle of cob(II)alamin. It remains to be established whether the axial ligand is in fact the same during substrate turnover. The exchange coupling observed in many of the kinetically competent intermediates and the lack of detectable nitrogen hyperfine interactions in these signals have required use of alternative approaches to identify the axial ligand (9Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Stubbe J. Science. 1996; 271: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

All three classes initiate their radical-dependent reactions by catalyzing carbon–cobalt bond homolysis. The mechanism(s) by which these enzymes catalyze C–Co homolysis of 1, the identification of the axial ligand trans to the C–Co bond that is cleaved, and its role in this process have recently been a topic of interest in many laboratories (2Krautler B.

The means by which B12-requiring enzymes effect the remarkable 1010–1012 rate acceleration of C–Co bond cleavage is not understood and is an ongoing focus in many research laboratories. A number of proposals addressing this rate acceleration have been forwarded based on model studies and theoretical considerations (26Finke R.G. Krautler B. Arigoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim1998: 383-402Google Scholar). One hypothesis advocates an upward flexing of the corrin ring, thereby applying a steric strain to the upper axial ligand resulting in a weakening of the C–Co bond (27Schrauzer G.N. Grate J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 4601-4611Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Chemaly S.M. Pratt J.M. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1980; : 2274-2281Crossref Google Scholar, 29Randaccio L. Bresciani-Pahor N.

A recent resonance Raman study of MMCoA mutase, albeit in the absence of substrate, revealed a significant change in the conformation of the corrin ring of1 upon binding to the enzyme but little perturbation of the Co–C force constant (32Dong S. Padmakumar R. Maiti N. Banerjee R. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9947-9948Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A second hypothesis emphasizes the importance of the axial nitrogen ligand trans to the C–Co bond that is cleaved. Model studies have indicated that a weaker nitrogen donor ligand decreases the dissociation energy of the C–Co bond (33Ng F.T.T. Rempel G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 621-623Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Marzilli L.G. Summers M.F. Bresciani-Pahor N. Zangrando E. Charland J.-P. Randaccio L. J. Am. Chem.

Interest in this second hypothesis has been stimulated by extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography studies on MMCoA mutase, which indicate displacement of the DMB lower axial ligand of1 by a protein histidine in cob(II)alamin-bound MMCoA mutase, with a long Co–N bond (3Mancia F.

EPR studies on other AdoCbl-requiring carbon skeleton mutases reveal that these class I enzymes also utilize a histidine as their axial ligand (1Buckel W. Golding B.T. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1996; 25: 329-337Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Zelder O. Beatrix B. Kroll F. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as do most of the cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases thus far examined (37Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 38Sauer K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J.

In contrast, the AdoCbl enzymes catalyzing irreversible heteroatom rearrangements, typified by DD, use the DMB moiety of the cofactor as the axial ligand (7Abend A. Nitsche R. Bandarian V. Stupperich E. Retey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Yamanishi M. Yamada S. Muguruma H. Murakami Y. Tobimatsu T. Ishida A. Yamauchi J. Toraya T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was initially thought based on sequence alignments that if a given protein possessed the putative cobalamin binding motif DX H XXG-(41–42 amino acids)-SXL-(22 amino acids)-GG (40Marsh E.N. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or a modification thereof then it would utilize H as the axial ligand, as revealed in the x-ray structures of MMCoA mutase (3Mancia F. Evans P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bosecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (37Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This motif is present in all class I enzymes and in methyltransferases and absent in class II enzymes, including RTPR. However, recently a methylcobalamin-dependent methyltransferase complex fromMethanobacterium thermoautrophicum, which possesses this motif, was shown not to use the designated histidine as its axial ligand but instead another histidine (41Sauer K. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 401-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus the presence of this putative cobalamin binding motif in the amino acid sequence of a cobalamin protein is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the protein histidine mode of ligation. In our continuing efforts to understand the mechanism of C–Co bond homolysis catalyzed by RTPR, we have now determined the identity of the lower axial ligand in a cob(II)alamin-bound form of the enzyme as DMB. RTPR thus appears to use the same mode of cofactor binding as the other class II proteins such as DD. Furthermore the similarities between RTPR and DD extend to the first steps in the chemistries these enzymes catalyze that involve hydrogen atom abstraction followed by an irreversible loss of water. However, despite these similarities only RTPR chemistry seems to require a protein-based radical. Recent studies have begun to shed light as to how RTPR manages to perturb the rate and equilibrium constants for the C–Co bond homolysis so dramatically. First, the enzyme has been shown to couple the thermodynamically unfavorable C–Co bond homolysis step with a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen atom abstraction from Cys-408, the first enzymatic example of molecule-induced homolysis (10Licht S.S. Booker S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Stubbe J. Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Silva D. Booker S. Krautler B. Arigoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim1998: 321-331Google Scholar). Second, a kinetic and thermodynamic analysis has revealed unexpectedly that entropy plays a key role in both ground state stabilization/destabilization and transition state stabilization (15Stubbe J. Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Silva D. Booker S. Krautler B. Arigoni D. Golding B.T. Vitamin B12 and B12-Proteins. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim1998: 321-331Google Scholar,42Licht S.S. Lawrence C.C. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1234-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 4A different conclusion derived from a different method of analysis of similar experimental data has recently been reported by another laboratory (43Brown K.L. Li J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9466-9474Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether these factors are in play in other B12-requiring proteins remains to be determined. The significance of nature's choice of DMB as the axial cobalamin ligand in RTPR and related enzymes such as DD on the one hand and a protein histidine in the carbon skeleton mutases on the other also remains to be established. Finally, it should be noted that in all the investigations into the nature of the axial ligand in AdoCbl-requiring proteins thus far, a substrate analog, a coenzyme analog, or photolysis of 1 have been required to generate the spectroscopic handle of cob(II)alamin. It remains to be established whether the axial ligand is in fact the same during substrate turnover. The exchange coupling observed in many of the kinetically competent intermediates and the lack of detectable nitrogen hyperfine interactions in these signals have required use of alternative approaches to identify the axial ligand (9Licht S.S. Gerfen G.J. Stubbe J. Science. 1996; 271: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2053788554,"Ligation of the Fas molecule expressed on the surface of a cell initiates multiple signaling pathways that result in the apoptotic death of that cell. We have examined Mg2+ mobilization as well as Ca2+mobilization in B cells undergoing Fas-initiated apoptosis. Our results indicate that cytosolic levels of free (non-complexed) Mg2+([Mg2+]i) and Ca2+([Ca2+]i) increase in cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, the percentages of cells mobilizing Mg2+, fragmenting DNA, or externalizing phosphatidylserine (PS) increase in parallel as the concentration of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody is raised. Kinetic analysis suggests that Mg2+ mobilization is an early event in apoptosis, clearly preceding DNA fragmentation and probably occurring prior to externalization of PS as well. The source of Mg2+ that produces the increases in [Mg2+]i is intracellular and most likely is the mitochondria. Extended pretreatment of B cells with carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, produces proportional decreases in the percentage of cells mobilizing Mg2+, fragmenting DNA, and externalizing PS in response to anti-Fas monoclonal antibody treatment. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated [Mg2+]i is required for apoptosis. Furthermore, we propose that the increases in [Mg2+]i function not only as cofactors for Mg2+-dependent endonucleases, but also to facilitate the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria, which drives many of the post-mitochondrial, caspase-mediated events in apoptotic cells.

Signal transduction by cell-surface receptors is critical for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, but may serve a variety of other functions, including induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The cell-surface receptor Fas (CD95), which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor family, is the most extensively studied of the so-called death receptors (1Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3979) Google Scholar, 2Depraetere V. Golstein P. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

There have been a number of studies of the phenotypic changes that occur early in apoptosis. Among those events, the disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) (3Kroemer G.

It has also been reported that a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) can trigger lethal processes (7Nicotera P. Zhivotovsky B. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Mihich E. Schimke R.T. Apoptosis. Plenum Press, New York1994: 97-108Crossref Google Scholar) and that increased intracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) promotes apoptosis in rat hepatocytes (8Patel T. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2183-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Most recently, Eskes et al. (9Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria (induced by overexpression of the apoptosis-promoting molecule Bax) is independent of Δψm, but dependent on Mg2+. Although Mg2+ has often been considered a messenger in signal transduction because of its ability to regulate a variety of cellular processes, changes in [Mg2+]ifollowing induction of apoptosis via receptor ligation in lymphocytes have not been demonstrated. The susceptibility of primary B cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis is dependent on whether the cell has received signals in the absence of antigen through CD40, another member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Resting B cells express very low levels of Fas and are not prone to apoptosis induced by this receptor (10Liu Y.-J. Barthélémy C. de Bouteiller O. Arpin C. Durand I. Banchereau J.

In this study, we have used Fas-positive, CD40-primed primary B cells or the M12.C3 B cell lymphoma, which also expresses high levels of Fas, to explore the role of [Mg2+]i in Fas-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that B cells undergoing apoptosis have elevated [Mg2+]i and that this increase in free cytosolic Mg2+ appears to serve as a “second messenger” for downstream events in apoptosis.

All mAbs were purified from culture supernatants by passage over protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). RPMI 1640 complete medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 40 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and modified HBSS lacking Mg2+ and Ca2+ were obtained from Sigma. AKR/J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were used at 6–10 weeks of age. Splenic B cells were prepared from murine splenocytes after the depletion of T cells by a mixture of anti-CD4 (GK 1.5), anti-CD8 (HO = 2.2), and anti-Thy 1.2 (T24) mAbs with baby rabbit complement as described previously (17Newell M.K.

The isolated primary B cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated with anti-CD40 antibody (1C10) at 8 μg/ml of RPMI 1640 complete medium in six-well tissue culture plates (5.5 ml/well) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 days (13Rothstein T.L.

The CD40-stimulated B cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the viable cells were obtained by sedimentation of dead cells with Lympholyte-M. The isolated activated B cells had high Fas expression as determined by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Fas mAb Jo2. The cell line used in this study is the B cell lymphoma M12.C3, which is maintained in RPMI 1640 complete medium and also has high Fas expression. Both types of cells were treated with varying concentrations of anti-Fas mAb in RPMI 1640 complete medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Untreated and anti-Fas mAb-treated cells were washed with HBSS, loaded with 20 μm mag-indo-1 AM or indo-1 AM in HBSS (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm HEPES for 30 min at 37 °C, diluted 2-fold with prewarmed HBSS (pH 7.4) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES; and incubated for an additional 30 min as described previously (18Rijkers G.T. Griffioen A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fluorochrome-loaded cells were then washed and resuspended in HBSS (pH 7.2) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES for flow cytometric analysis. In the experiments in which the role of extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ was explored, the cells were washed, resuspended, and analyzed in modified HBSS containing only the appropriate divalent cation(s). An Ortho 50H cytometer with a 5-watt argon laser set for 364 nm excitation at 50 milliwatts was used. Fluorescence emission data were collected through a 390/490-nm band-pass filter using Phoenix Flow Acquisition software. The ratio of emissions for 390/490 nm was determined, and a cytogram of [Mg2+]i or [Ca2+]i was constructed by reference to standard curves of 390/490 nm emission ratio versus cation concentration (19Justement L.B. Cambier J.C. Rijkers G.T. Fittschen C. Grinstein S. Foskett J. Noninvasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 353-374Google Scholar). Readily mobilized pools of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the cells (106/ml/sample) were measured by treating the mag-indo-1- and indo-1-loaded cells with 1 μm ionomycin. Flow cytometric analysis was begun before addition of ionomycin to obtain base-line values. The cell flow was halted for addition of ionomycin, resulting in a gap in the profiles. The data were analyzed using Phoenix Flow System MTIMENEW software, and mean [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i were calculated as functions of time. In addition, the percentage of cells mobilizing Mg2+ after ionomycin treatment was determined for each time point, and maximum values were calculated. PS expression was determined using an ApoAlert annexin V apoptosis kit. The untreated and anti-Fas mAb-treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the washed cells (5 × 105) were resuspended in 200 μl of 1× binding buffer. After adding 5 μl each of fluorescein-labeled annexin V (0.5 μg/ml final concentration) and propidium iodide (PI; 1 μg/ml final concentration), the treated cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark; the cells were then analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology, San Jose, CA). Two-color analysis allowed the resolution of viable (PS−PI−), early apoptotic (PS+PI−), and late apoptotic and necrotic (PS+PI+) populations. Cells (5 × 105) were incubated in 200 μl of a solution containing PI (5 μg/ml), saponin (0.3%), RNase (50 μg/ml), and EDTA (5 mm) for 30 min at room temperature (20Vella A.T. McCormack J.E. Linsley P.S. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Immunity. 1995; 2: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were identified on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer as a distinct hypodiploid population that showed a diminished staining relative to the G0/G1population of the normal viable cells. To study the effect of Fas ligation on [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i, we conducted a flow cytometric analysis of M12.C3 B cell lymphomas that had been incubated with anti-Fas mAb and then loaded with the Mg2+ and Ca2+ indicators mag-indo-1 and indo-1, respectively. Untreated cells appeared as a homogeneous population by forward side scatter (data not shown) with uniform base-line distributions of [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1,A and B, respectively; 0∼2 min). The mean value of [Mg2+]i in the untreated cells was 500 μm (Fig. 1E, dashed line at 0∼2 min), in good agreement with the range of values reported for hepatocytes (21Corkey B.E. Duszynski J. Rich T.L. Matschinsky B. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle cells (22Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H281-H288PubMed Google Scholar), and cardiac muscle cells (23London R.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The mean value for [Ca2+]i was 100 nm (Fig. 1F, dashed line at 0∼2 min), in agreement with the published value of 90 nm for [Ca2+]i in murine splenic B cells (19Justement L.B. Cambier J.C. Rijkers G.T. Fittschen C. Grinstein S. Foskett J. Noninvasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 353-374Google Scholar). Incubating M12.C3 cells for 3 h with anti-Fas mAb (0.5 μg/ml) produced two distinguishable subpopulations with regard to [Mg2+]i. In the anti-Fas mAb-treated cells, one population had a base-line [Mg2+]i of 500 μm (Fig. 1C, arrowheads), and a second population had a base-line [Mg2+]i of 900 μm (Fig. 1C, 0∼2 min). The existence of these two populations is reflected in the mean base-line [Mg2+]i of 700 μm for the treated cells (Fig. 1E, solid line, 0∼2 min). Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in parallel by flow cytometric analysis of indo-1-loaded cells. Fas cross-linking also gave rise to two separate populations, a well defined major one with a [Ca2+]i of 100 nm and a broad “tail” with Ca2+i levels ranging up to 1000 nm or higher (Fig. 1D, 0∼2 min). These populations produced an increase in the mean base-line [Ca2+]i from 100 nm in the untreated cells to 170 nm in the anti-Fas mAb-treated cells (Fig. 1F, solid line, 0∼2 min). After the base-line values for [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i were established, the cells were treated in the flow cytometer with 1 μm ionomycin and were monitored for several minutes longer (∼2–10 min) to determine if there are pool(s) of divalent cations that can be mobilized by ionophore treatment. In the untreated cells, ionomycin produced the classical Ca2+ mobilization pattern with an initial sharp rise followed by a gradual decrease to a plateau value somewhat above base-line levels (Fig. 1, B and F, dashed line). Untreated cells did not have a pool of Mg2+that could be mobilized by this same dose of ionomycin and showed an insignificant increase in the mean [Mg2+]i (Fig. 1E, dashed line) as well as a transient response by no more than 22% of the cells in the population (Fig. 1G, dashed line). Ionomycin treatment of cells that had been incubated with anti-Fas mAb revealed significant differences from the control cells. The vast majority of the high [Mg2+]i cells clearly had a pool of Mg2+ that could be further mobilized by ionomycin treatment (Fig. 1, C and G, solid line), which is reflected in the gradual rise in the mean [Mg2+]i, reaching maximum values by 8–10 min after ionomycin treatment (Fig. 1E, solid line). The low [Mg2+]i population (Fig. 1C,arrowheads) did not further mobilize Mg2+ in response to ionomycin. Ionomycin treatment also revealed that the cells that had been incubated with anti-Fas mAb fell into two populations with regard to Ca2+ mobilization. Although both subpopulations responded to ionomycin treatment, one continued to show the “classic” mobilization profile of the untreated cells, whereas the other reached and maintained extremely high Ca2+i levels (Fig. 1D). The behavior of these populations is reflected in the increased mean [Ca2+]i response (Fig. 1F, solid line). Because both subpopulations mobilized Ca2+, it was not possible to use the flow cytometer software to calculate a percent response for Ca2+ in order to discriminate between them. Treatment of M12.C3 cells with increasing concentrations of anti-Fas mAb for 16 h caused a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in the high [Mg2+]i state (Fig. 2A). This is also reflected in a dose-dependent increase in the mean [Mg2+]i, which reached a plateau value of 700 μm with 0.03 μg/ml anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 2C,closed squares). Similarly, the percentage of cells in the high [Ca2+]i state increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B), and the base-line [Ca2+]i increased from 100 to 170 nm (Fig. 2D, closed circles). These latter observations are consistent with the generally accepted model that elevation of [Ca2+]i is required for apoptotic death. Ionomycin was used to determine the additional Ca2+ and Mg2+ mobilization potential at each dose of anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 2, C and D, open symbols). With ionomycin treatment, [Ca2+]iincreased ∼100 nm regardless of the dose of anti-Fas mAb used. In contrast, ionomycin caused [Mg2+]i to increase markedly only at anti-Fas mAb concentrations above 0.03 μg/ml. We used the Mg2+ response to ionomycin as a readout for cells in the high [Mg2+]i state because these data (Figs. 1C and 2, A and C) suggest that the cells that are in the high [Mg2+]i state are the same cells that further mobilize Mg2+ in response to ionomycin treatment and because the available cytometric analysis software provides a direct calculation of the percentage of cells mobilizing Mg2+ in response to ionomycin. Duplicate wells from the experiments shown in Fig. 2 (A–D) were examined for apoptotic cells using PI staining and flow cytometry. In saponin-permeabilized cells, PI uptake is proportional to DNA content, and apoptotic cells show diminished (“hypodiploid”) staining below the G0/G1 population of viable cells (20Vella A.T. McCormack J.E. Linsley P.S. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Immunity. 1995; 2: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F.

The results of this analysis indicate that the percentage of cells mobilizing Mg2+ correlates with the apoptotic (hypodiploid) cells (Fig. 2E). Incubation of murine splenic B cells with CD40 ligand leads to enhanced Fas expression and increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis, as seen in other systems (13Rothstein T.L. Wang J.K.M. Panka D.J. Foote L.C. Wang Z. Stanger B. Cui H. Ju S.-T. Marshak-Rothstein A. Nature. 1995; 374: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 26Foote L.C. Schneider T.J. Fischer G.M. Wang J.K. Rasmussen B. Campbell K.A. Lynch D.H. Ju S.-T. Marshak-Rothstein A. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1878-1885PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar manner, we treated splenic B cells (which had been pretreated with anti-CD40 mAb for 72 h) with anti-Fas mAb for 2 h and then determined Mg2+ mobilization, PS externalization, and DNA fragmentation. The dose dependence of Mg2+ mobilization in anti-Fas mAb-treated B cells (Fig. 3A) was similar to that of the B cell lymphoma M12.C3 (cf. Fig. 2C). Thus, the base-line [Mg2+]i of the primary B cells also reached a plateau value of 700 μm with 0.1 μg/ml anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 3A, closed squares), and ionomycin (1 μm) treatment during the flow cytometric analysis increased [Mg2+]i 2-fold at anti-Fas mAb concentrations above 0.03 μg/ml (open squares). As with M12.C3 B cells, the percentage of cells mobilizing Mg2+ in response to ionomycin correlates with the high [Mg2+] population (data not shown). We also examined DNA fragmentation and PS externalization in the same experiment. PS is largely excluded from the external leaflet of the plasma membrane in viable cells, but becomes expressed on the external leaflet during apoptosis (5Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used staining with annexin V, a naturally occurring PS-binding protein, to detect cells in early stages of apoptosis. Cells from parallel cultures used for Mg2+ mobilization were doubly stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V and PI, without permeabilizing the cells (5Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). This technique allows the definition of three subpopulations: viable cells are PS−PI−, early apoptotic cells are PS+PI−, and late apoptotic cells (and necrotic cells) are PS+PI+. In our experiments, we considered only the early apoptotic (PS+PI−) cells. The results (Fig. 3B) show that each of the responses reaches a plateau above 0.03 μg/ml anti-Fas mAb and also indicate, for each dose of mAb, that the relative percentage of cells that mobilize Mg2+ is same as the percentage of cells with increased PS externalization and DNA fragmentation. These results further demonstrate that Mg2+ mobilization is a property of primary B cells undergoing apoptosis and not just an artifact associated with the use of the B cell lymphoma M12.C3. We used kinetic analysis to determine whether Mg2+ mobilization is an early or late event in apoptosis. In M12.C3 cells treated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Fas mAb, the mean base-line [Mg2+]iincreased with time, reaching a value of 1000 μm after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 4A). At each time point (other than t = 0), ionomycin caused a significant Mg2+ mobilization in the high [Mg2+]ipopulation of cells that were committed to die by apoptosis as previously demonstrated. The kinetics of Mg2+ mobilizationversus DNA fragmentation were also measured in cells treated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 4B). The percentage of cells showing Fas-potentiated, ionomycin-induced Mg2+mobilization was significantly higher than the percentage of those fragmenting DNA at 1–3 h after mAb treatment, but by 16 h, DNA fragmentation exceeded Mg2+ mobilization. These results suggest that Mg2+ mobilization precedes DNA fragmentation in B cells. We decided to examine loss of plasma membrane asymmetry on these cells because, whereas DNA fragmentation is considered to be a late stage apoptotic event in many systems, PS externalization occurs early in the process. Kinetic analysis of PS externalization versusFas-potentiated, ionomycin-mediated Mg2+ mobilization suggested that Mg2+ mobilization preceded PS externalization (Fig. 4C), although the lag in PS response was not as striking as with DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B). Because the percentage of cells in the PS+PI−population never reached the same level of those mobilizing Mg2+, we checked to see if we were underestimating apoptosis by excluding the PS+PI+ population. The PS+PI+ population did not increase significantly over the 0-h time point except at the 16-h time point (data not shown), suggesting that the apparent decrease in PS+PI− cells at that time point may be due to their conversion to PS+PI+, late apoptotic (or necrotic) cells. However, at the earlier time points (1–3 h), loss of PS+PI− cells to the PS+PI+ population is not an explanation for lower PS+PI− numbers, and thus, PS externalization clearly lags behind Mg2+ mobilization. Calcium mobilization in B cells involves both release from intracellular stores (primarily endoplasmic reticulum) and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 27Cheek T.R. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly less is known about the relative roles of intracellularversus extracellular sources of Mg2+ for Mg2+ mobilization during apoptosis. We therefore examined the source of [Mg2+]i in cells undergoing apoptosis. The experiments described above were repeated with M12.C3 cells in defined media lacking Mg2+, Ca2+, or both ions. The increase in the base-line [Mg2+]icaused by anti-Fas mAb was not dependent on Mg2+ in the extracellular milieu (Fig. 5A). Likewise, the percentage of cells possessing a readily mobilizable store of Mg2+ was independent of extracellular Mg2+ (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the production of a high [Mg2+]i state and the generation of a pool of readily mobilized Mg2+ were completely dependent on extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5). These data support the concept that Ca2+ mobilization is required for the induction of the apoptosis signaling pathway and place the Ca2+-dependent event(s) upstream of the release of Mg2+ from intracellular stores. Mitochondria are one of the major storage sites of intracellular Mg2+ (28Cittadini A. Wolf F.I. Bossi D. Calviello G. Magn. Reson. 1991; 4: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar) and play a central role in intracellular signaling by releasing Mg2+ in response to a variety of agents (22Quamme G.A. Dai L.-J. Rabkin S.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H281-H288PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bond M. Vadasz G. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15630-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated Mg2+release from mitochondria during Fas-induced, ionomycin-potentiated Mg2+ mobilization using CCCP. This agent uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (30Li H.-Y. Dai L.-J. Krieger C. Quamme G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and short-term treatment of cells with CCCP has been reported to disrupt Δψm (4Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.-G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). We treated M12.C3 B lymphoma cells overnight with 20 μm CCCP. Although the cells remained viable, they did show disrupted Δψm (as measured by decreased uptake of the cationic fluorochrome DiOC6(3); data not shown). Cells treated with CCCP for 16 h and with anti-Fas mAb for the last 3 h were examined for their ability to mobilize Mg2+and Ca2+ in response to 1 μm ionomycin. Pretreatment of the cells with CCCP did not alter their ability to mobilize Ca2+ relative to controls not treated with CCCP (Fig. 6A, shaded bars). The slight (6%) decrease in ability to mobilize Ca2+ between cells treated with anti-Fas mAb plus CCCP and those treated with anti-Fas mAb alone was not statistically significant. These results suggest that pretreatment of the cells with CCCP did not significantly alter their ability to flux Ca2+. Conversely, whereas pretreatment of the cells with CCCP did not alter the ability of the control cells to mobilize Mg2+, it did cause a marked (40%) and highly significant decrease in the ability of the anti-Fas mAb-treated cells to mobilize Mg2+. In a subsequent experiment, parallel cultures were assayed for Mg2+ mobilization, PS externalization, and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6B). In the anti-Fas mAb-treated cells, pretreatment with CCCP caused a 37% inhibition of Mg2+mobilization relative to the untreated cells, a 41% inhibition of PS externalization, and a 45% inhibition of DNA fragmentation. In each case, the decrease in response was statistically significant, and the decreases in cells showing PS externalization and DNA fragmentation were proportional to the decrease in the number of cells mobilizing Mg2+. These data identify the mitochondria as a major source of intracellular Mg2+ and, furthermore, are consistent with a role for Mg2+ as a second messenger for apoptosis in B cells. The data also clearly separate the role of Mg2+ from that of Ca2+ since long-term treatment with CCCP does not significantly inhibit Ca2+mobilization in response to ionomycin treatment even while Mg2+ mobilization and apoptosis are decreased. In this study, we have used the fluorescent Mg2+chelator mag-indo-1 to determine [Mg2+]i. Although this chelator is the indicator of choice for determining [Mg2+]i by flow cytometry, it is capable of binding Ca2+ as well. However, other studies have indicated that [Ca2+]i in the ∼1 μm range causes >7% overestimation of [Mg2+]i in the 500 μm range (31Lattanzio Jr., F.A. Bartschat D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 177: 184-191Google Scholar). Because the mean [Ca2+]i rarely, if ever, achieved these levels in our experiments, it is unlikely that interference from [Ca2+]i plays a significant role in our measurements of [Mg2+]i. The role of intracellular Ca2+ in apoptosis is generally accepted (7Nicotera P. Zhivotovsky B. Bellomo G. Orrenius S. Mihich E. Schimke R.T. Apoptosis. Plenum Press, New York1994: 97-108Crossref Google Scholar, 32McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 239: 357-366Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and our studies suggest a role for elevated [Ca2+]i in B cell apoptosis as well. Multiple functions in apoptosis have been ascribed to increased [Ca2+]i. These include activation of calpain, a caspase-like protease postulated to be one of the initiators of the apoptotic cascade (33Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar, 34Squier M.K.T. Miller A.C.K. Malkinson A.M. Cohen J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar); inactivation of the PS-specific flippase and activation of the phospholipid scramblase (35Verhoven B. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar); and activation of Ca2+-dependent endonucleases (36Khodarev N.N. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 922-931PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gaido M.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18580-18585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Seiliev A.A. Zvonareva N.B. Zhivotovsky B.D. Hanson K.P. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1992; 31: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mitochondria serve as sinks for Ca2+ released from the endoplasmic reticulum during intracellular Ca2+oscillations, and it recently has been postulated that sustained elevated [Ca2+]i may cause the mitochondria to become overloaded with Ca2+, leading to downstream events that facilitate apoptosis (39Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that although elevations in [Ca2+]i may be necessary for B cell apoptosis, they are not sufficient, as proliferative signals such as those produced by ligation of the B cell receptor (surface immunoglobulin) also result in Ca2+mobilization. In contrast to the well studied role of Ca2+ in apoptosis, the role of Mg2+ has been largely ignored. There is only a single report that elevating [Mg2+]i in hepatocytes, using glycodeoxycholates (bile salts) to allow the ingress of extracellular Mg2+, leads to their death by apoptosis (8Patel T. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2183-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Intracellular Mg2+ is stored primarily in the microsomes (50% of total intracellular Mg2+) and mitochondria (20% of total), with much smaller amounts in the nucleus and cytosol (28Cittadini A. Wolf F.I. Bossi D. Calviello G. Magn. Reson. 1991; 4: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). About 98–99% of total intracellular Mg2+ (23London R.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and 94% of cytosolic Mg2+ (21Corkey B.E. Duszynski J. Rich T.L. Matschinsky B. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2567-2574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are complexed to nucleic acids, proteins, or membranes. Therefore, complex equilibria between compartments and between bound and free forms of Mg2+ contribute to the concentration of free cytosolic Mg2+, i.e. [Mg2+]i (28Cittadini A. Wolf F.I. Bossi D. Calviello G. Magn. Reson. 1991; 4: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively slow release of Mg2+ (as compared with Ca2+) in the response to ionomycin treatment in our studies may reflect the need for Mg2+ not only to cross the mitochondrial membrane, but also to dissociate from immobile ligands within the mitochondria. Because our data with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor CCCP suggest that mitochondrial stores of Mg2+are critical for obtaining apoptosis and because our kinetic analysis suggests that Mg2+ mobilization is an early event in apoptosis, we are struck by the parallel between disruption of Δψm and Mg2+ mobilization. On one hand, the release of Mg2+ from the mitochondria could be merely a consequence of the opening of mitochondrial pores as Δψm is reduced. On the other hand, there are at least two reports that, taken together, imply that Mg2+ release from the mitochondria is independent of the loss of Δψm. First, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c has been reported to occur prior to and to be independent of disruption of Δψm (40Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Second, when isolated mitochondria are incubated with the pore-forming, pro-apoptotic molecule Bax, they incorporate Bax and release cytochrome c in a manner that is independent of Δψm, but “highly dependent on Mg2+ ions” (9Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of cytochrome c release in activating apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) (41Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1336: 139-149Crossref Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 42Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6258) Google Scholar) and thereby driving post-mitochondrial events in cells undergoing apoptosis, we suggest that achieving high levels of [Mg2+]i is central to the apoptotic process. Although Mg2+ is an important cofactor for a diverse set of functions in viable and proliferating cells (28Cittadini A. Wolf F.I. Bossi D. Calviello G. Magn. Reson. 1991; 4: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar), the Mg2+dependence of a number of endonucleases implicated in apoptosis (36Khodarev N.N. Ashwell J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 922-931PubMed Google Scholar,43Sun X.-M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14857-14860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kawabata H. Anzai N. Matsutani H.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2576-2582PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that elevated Mg2+ levels are involved in apoptosis as well. The role played by Mg2+ in PS externalization is less clear. One of the best candidates for the aminophospholipid translocase (“flippase”) responsible for maintaining PS asymmetry in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes is a Mg2+-ATPase (46Bitbol M. Fellman P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 268-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 47Auland M.E. Roufogalis B.D. Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One might therefore assume that elevating [Mg2+]i should decrease PS expression on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, although the Mg2+ dependence of the flippase activity has been well documented, the effect of supernormal Mg2+ concentrations is unknown. Thus, it may be possible that elevated [Mg2+]i desensitizes the flippase, thus turning it off, or that Mg2+ has no direct effect on flippase activity and that the regulation of PS externalization by Mg2+ may be indirect, e.g. through the activation of caspases or other death-signaling molecules. Future experiments will establish the mechanism of, and the role played by, mitochondrial Mg2+ in B cells undergoing Fas-initiated apoptosis.

The antigen receptors expressed on B-cells and T-cells in animals are encoded by genes that are assembled at the DNA level from arrays of inherited segments in a process termed “V(D)J recombination” (reviewed in Refs. 1Gellert M.

Targets for this recombination reaction are identified by recombination signal sequences (RSSs) 1The abbreviations used are: RSS, recombination signal sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: RSS, recombination signal sequence; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid immediately adjacent to the recombination site in the DNA. The RSS is composed of conserved heptamer (CACAGTG) and nonamer (ACAAAAACC) motifs, separated by a spacer of either 12 or 23 base pairs in length. Recombination in vivo occurs between pairs of DNA segments bordered by RSSs of the two different spacer lengths (the 12/23 rule; Ref. 3Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar). Similar segments always carry RSSs of the same length, and as a consequence of this organization, a V segment (for example) could be permitted to join to a D segment in the same locus, but not a second V segment.V(D)J recombination occurs through a cutting and pasting mechanism in which specific double strand DNA breaks are generated adjacent to each RSS. The first step in this reaction, cleavage of DNA containing an RSS, can be reconstituted in vitro (4van Gent D.C. McBlane J.F. Ramsden D.A. Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

The biochemistry of the cleavage reaction has been studied by means of the expression and purification of truncated “core” regions of these proteins, which maintain all the activities currently measurable.The specificity in the reaction must be derived by direct contacts between the RAG proteins and the RSS. The individual roles of the proteins have not been fully explored, although several studies have implicated RAG1 in binding to the RSS. Previously, we showed an alteration in the specificity of recombination by a RAG1 mutant, which suggested that RAG1 could interact with the heptamer and the immediately adjacent coding DNA (10Sadofsky M.J.

RAG1 bound the DNA with specificity for the nonamer, and a mild enhancement of binding was found in the presence of the heptamer. RAG2 would also bind the RSS, but only in the presence of RAG1. DNA binding in vitro by RAG proteins was assayed by surface plasmon resonance, which showed RAG1 binding to the nonamer, a low affinity interaction with the heptamer, and no binding by RAG2 under the high salt conditions studied (12Spanopoulou E.

Protein-DNA interactions were also observed in complexes cross-linked by glutaraldehyde (13Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); however, no binding by RAG1 alone was observed.Because our mutant studies had suggested the importance of the heptamer in mediation of recombination by RAG1, and physical approaches have demonstrated only slight heptamer effects in RAG1 binding, we were motivated to explore, in more detail, the contacts between RAG1 and target DNA alone, and in the context of a protein complex containing RAG2. We chose to examine the behavior of RAG1 and RAG2 individually and together using gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking. Here we report that RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, purified individually, can associate to form a protein complex in the absence of DNA. We also find that in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), each protein by itself can bind DNA, albeit at low specificity. However, together the two proteins and DNA form a different complex with significantly higher specificity for the RSS. Sequence alteration of the oligonucleotides reveals that the complex is dependent on the presence of the nonamer motif, and somewhat more binding occurs when the heptamer is also present. Both proteins are present in the ternary complex. Most important, using a series of probes substituting iodouracil at individual positions, we find that UV exposure of the mixed protein complex generates cross-links to RAG1 not only in the nonamer but also in the heptamer, while RAG2 is not cross-linked. The interaction of RAG1 at both the nonamer and the heptamer alters our view of the protein-DNA complex that must form during cleavage. The precise configuration and biochemical roles of these proteins in the cleavage step and subsequent processing and joining steps remain to be determined.RESULTSIt has been shown previously that the truncated forms of RAG1 and RAG2 used here are active in V(D)J recombination and capable of supporting the complete reaction in cells (14Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. McBlane J.F. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Cuomo C.A. Oettinger M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1810-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these truncated forms are more easily expressed in the baculovirus system, purified, and assayed for cleavage activity in vitro. Most commonly these proteins are expressed as fusions to the bacterial MBP, which increases the protein solubility and provides an affinity purification method. It should be noted that the truncated RAG1 is entirely lacking in a N-terminal zinc-binding ring-finger motif and the RAG2 lacks a C-terminal acidic region. A function for these regions in the reaction mechanism has yet to be described. Previous studies have coexpressed the two truncated proteins in a single mixed infection allowing the copurification of RAG1 and RAG2 (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). We felt it would be useful to express the proteins individually so as to better characterize their behaviors and perhaps to demonstrate that a mixed complex could form from purified components. The activity of these proteins was demonstrated by testing them individually and together in the oligonucleotide cleavage assay (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Only the combination of the two proteins cleaved the end-labeled oligonucleotide to liberate the shorter hairpinned coding end (Fig. 1A).RAG1 or RAG2 Alone Binds DNA NonspecificallyDNA binding was demonstrated for each of these individual proteins by EMSA. In the absence of competitor DNA, both proteins bound probes in a manner suggestive of nonspecific binding. We observed that, as either protein alone was titrated into the binding reaction, complexes were formed with slower mobility, ultimately creating large aggregates that were trapped in the sample well (data not shown). This behavior is typical of DNA binding that is not specific for sequence, and indeed this proved to be the case when tested with probes of differing sequence. Discrete bands could be obtained by adding the nonspecific competitor dI-dC, at 50 or 5 μg/ml, respectively, for MR1 and MR2. Fig. 1B shows the DNA binding behavior of each protein with a variety of RSS-related probes under these conditions. For MR1, binding is detected with all probes, though is somewhat reduced (about 2-fold in these and other data not shown) among probes in which the heptamer, nonamer, or both are fully replaced (lanes 2–4) compared with the intact 12-RSS (lane 1). Similarly MR2 does not exhibit a significant difference in binding to these different probes. No change in specificity was observed with additional probes containing either 12-RSS or 23-RSS related sequences (data not shown). It is worth noting that, at higher concentrations of dI-dC than shown in Fig. 1B, MR2 alone did not form a stable complex on any of the probes (data not shown). This indicates that the affinity of MR1 alone for the probe, while not sequence-specific, appears to be more than 10-fold higher than that of MR2 since it tolerates a 10-fold higher concentration of competitor in this assay.Both Proteins Together Bind DNA SpecificallyThe behavior changed markedly when MR1 and MR2 together were tested by EMSA. Even in the absence of dI-dC (Fig. 2A), the mixed proteins formed a DNA complex that migrated more discretely and at different mobility than those produced by the individual proteins. Complexes with similar mobility assembled on probes containing either a 12- or 23-RSS. We note here that MR1 plus MR2 generated the same binding pattern whether the proteins were purified individually from separate infections and then mixed (lane 3) or copurified from coinfected insect cells (lane 4). In the presence of dI-dC competitor (50 μg/ml), the faster migrating species predominated. Furthermore, a stronger sequence dependence was revealed when the mixed proteins were bound to the probes of altered sequence (Fig. 2B). In this titration experiment, increasing amounts of the two proteins were bound to each of three related probes. Binding to a probe in which the nonamer had been extensively mutated was much weaker than to the other two probes. The results are quantified in Fig. 2C. A set of similar 12-RSS probes, when tested with RAG1 plus RAG2 protein together, also showed binding with specific dependence on the intact nonamer (data not shown).Figure 2MR1 plus MR2 together form a complex with higher specificity for the RSS. A, in the absence of dI-dC, MR1 forms a nonspecific smear on both 12-RSS (duplex oligo-245,lane 2) or the 23-RSS (duplex oligo-36,lane 5). MR1 plus MR2, at the same concentration, forms a new discrete band of different mobility, whether mixed as isolated proteins or purified from a mixed infection (lanes 3, 4, and 6). B, titration of increasing amounts of MR1 + MR2 in the presence of dI-dC competitor (50 μg/ml) shows preferred binding to 23-RSS probe (duplex oligo-36,lanes 2–4) over the probe in which the nonamer is replaced (duplex oligo-40, lanes 8–10). The probe in which the heptamer is replaced (duplex oligo-38,lanes 5–7) shows binding more like the first probe. Each protein is at the level indicated in μg/ml. C, graph of the binding data from panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We performed competitive binding experiments to determine the relative affinities of the MR1 plus MR2 complex for the canonical signals over those in which the heptamer or nonamer was altered. Binding to a 12-RSS probe is shown (Fig. 3A) with competition by the same unlabeled DNA, and with related DNA in which the heptamer or nonamer was entirely replaced. Similarly, binding to a 23-RSS probe was performed with competition by the same DNA or related heptamer and nonamer replacements (Fig. 3B). Both experiments yielded comparable results. In both cases, the heptamer-mutated DNA competed almost as well as the self-competition by unlabeled probe DNA. Again, in both cases, the nonamer-mutated DNA competed significantly less well. Comparing the sets of data shows that the MR1 plus MR2 complex bound the intact RSS between 5- and 10-fold better than the equivalent DNA lacking the nonamer. A weak but consistent effect was also apparent favoring binding to the intact RSS over the heptamer mutants.Figure 3Specificity for the nonamer. A, competitive binding at a fixed concentration of both RAG proteins is demonstrated by EMSA using a duplex 12-RSS probe (oligo-245) and a canonical RSS (duplex oligo-245), a RSS with a mutated heptamer (duplex oligo-30), or mutated nonamer (duplex oligo-34) as competitor. Ratio of competitor to probe is indicated.B, analysis as in panel A using a duplex 23-RSS probe (oligo-36) and a canonical RSS (duplex oligo-36), a RSS with a mutated heptamer (duplex oligo-38), or mutated nonamer (duplex oligo-40) as competitor. C, comparison of three probes, each replacing 2 base pairs of the nonamer, with the consensus 12-RSS probe. Relevant changes are in lowercase, listed above each lane. Binding of the probes to the two RAG proteins was performed under comparable conditions in the presence of 50 μg/ml dI-dC. Stable complexes were visualized by EMSA. The images inB and C were assembled from a single original gel each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since a fairly strong dependence on the nonamer was evident in this assay, we explored the effect of more modest alterations in the sequence. These EMSAs were performed at a fixed protein concentration with a series of 12-RSS probes that differed by only two base pairs each and with dI-dC as competitor. Fig. 3C shows a comparison of the intact 12-RSS (lane 4) with three probes in which the nonamer was modified at its first two base pairs, the second two, or positions 6 and 7. The results show that each of these nonamer mutations decreased the binding of the protein complex, with the most profound effect found at the sixth and seventh positions of the nonamer.RAG1 Associates with RAG2 in VitroWe wished to describe this new complex that assembled in the presence of both proteins. We have shown that MR2 binds DNA only weakly, and it seemed possible that the complex obtained in the presence of both proteins could contain only MR1. The role of RAG2 could be, for example, to catalyze a change in conformation in RAG1 while not remaining integral to the complex. We therefore tested whether MR1 and MR2 could associate stably with each other in the absence or presence of DNA. Fig. 4A is the result of a two-dimensional electrophoretic separation of MR1 and MR2 that had been coincubated in the standard reaction buffer, but in the absence of DNA. A sample of the two proteins (in this case purified from coinfected cells) was applied to a native gel system and driven in the horizontal direction as indicated. Next, the gel was soaked in SDS and electrophoretically separated in the vertical dimension. Denatured markers were applied to one side of the gel during the second run to aid in the identification of the final proteins. Finally, the gel was transferred (through its third dimension) to nitrocellulose and probed with the anti-epitope antibody, which binds to both proteins. Displayed on the blot, from right to left, are two prominent bands of MR2 that migrate by themselves (positionsmarked D and E), followed by a band of MR1, which also migrated alone (position C). These are followed by two sets of spots where MR1 and MR2 appear to migrate coincidentally in the first dimension (positions A and B). The last spots (other than the markers) represent MR1 and MR2 that failed to enter the gel in the first dimension, dissociated upon treatment with SDS, and therefore appear at the position of the origin. The coincident bands (representing approximately 10% of the input protein) are evidence that slower migrating components in the native gel contained both MR1 and MR2.Figure 4MR1 and MR2 associate in the absence and presence of DNA. A, two-dimensional gel analysis of MR1 plus MR2 without DNA. Proteins and protein complexes were separated in the first dimension under native conditions, and in the second dimension under denaturing conditions. Letters indicatepositions of the gel that contain either both proteins (A and B) or only one (C,D, and E). Markers were added for the second dimension electrophoresis. The proteins were visualized by Western blot. B, MBP pull-down assay. R1 (lacking MBP) was incubated with MR2 or purified MBP with or without DNA. Complexes were collected by affinity chromatography to amylose resin, which will retain R1 only if it associates with the other proteins. Retained proteins are eluted and analyzed by Western blot. C, protein analysis of EMSA bands. The specific complex assembled on 12-RSS probe (duplex oligo-245) and 23-RSS probe (duplex oligo-36) were excised, denatured, and analyzed for protein content by Western blotting. Both proteins contain the same epitope tag so the signal is a direct measure of relative protein abundance. Both proteins were present in apparent equimolar representation by densitometric analysis of this image.Lanes marked M are markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate complex formation by a second approach, we designed the MBP pull-down assay (Fig. 4B). For this experiment, we purified a protein (R1) that was identical to MR1 with its epitope tag, but did not contain the maltose-binding fusion partner. A 3-fold molar excess of R1 over MR2, purified separately, was mixed in the reaction buffer used for the cleavage assay. One sample remained free of DNA, while to the second the 12-RSS DNA (duplex oligo-245) was added. Parallel samples were assembled replacing MR2 with purified MBP (New England Biolabs) to test for any interaction that could occur through the fusion partner. This protein does not contain the c-Myc epitope tag. After incubation on ice, the samples were then exposed to the amylose resin, washed extensively in reaction buffer, and finally eluted in the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm maltose. The eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blot visualized with the anti-Myc antibody. Since the MBP protein itself does not contain the c-Myc epitope tag, it does not appear on the blot. The key observation, however, is that the tagged R1 does appear. Since it does not bind directly to the amylose beads, and interacts minimally with the MBP protein alone (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2), the strong positive R1 band in those lanes that contain MR2 (lanes 3 and 4) indicates that the R1 protein is associating with the MR2 specifically. The association of MR2 with R1 is only slightly increased by the presence of the DNA (lane 4).We next analyzed the protein content of the gel-shift band that is assembled in the presence of MR1, MR2, the RSS DNA probe, and competitor dI-dC. Preparative amounts of the complexes on both 12- and 23-RSS probes (duplex oligonucleotides 245 and 36) were assembled using copurified MR1 and MR2. The major protein-DNA complex of each was excised from a native gel. Each gel slice was denatured in SDS and the eluted proteins analyzed by Western blotting. Both MR1 and MR2 were found in apparent equal molar ratio in each case (Fig. 4C). The adjacent gel slice from a lane in which both proteins were loaded without DNA yielded only a trace amount of protein when treated the same way (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that each of these proteins derived from RAG1 and RAG2 are capable of binding DNA alone, but that their specificity for each RSS is increased significantly when the two proteins are present simultaneously. Both proteins are present in the specific complex formed on the 12- and 23-RSS. Furthermore, this complex appears to contain an equal molar ratio of the two proteins.RAG1 Contacts Both the Heptamer and the NonamerSince specific base changes in the nonamer significantly reduced the binding of MR1 and MR2 in the EMSAs, we wished to use additional methods to detect contacts between the protein and DNA. One such method is UV cross-linking. Ordinary DNA will cross-link to proteins at low efficiency upon UV exposure. We first attempted to cross-link ordinary DNA to MR1 or the mixture of MR1 plus MR2. While cross-linked products dependent on the presence of protein was obtained (at a level of less that 0.1% of the DNA), we could not demonstrate sequence specificity in this interaction and dI-dC quenched the cross-linking to unacceptable low levels (data not shown). We therefore utilized the ability of modified DNA bases to increase the cross-linking efficiency at the site of modification. In these experiments, we used 5-iodouracil in place of thymine at individual positions along one strand of the probe DNA. The substitution of the iodine for the 5-methyl of thymine does not interfere with the normal structure of DNA but increases the reactivity of that base more than 10-fold upon UV exposure. A series of five probes were synthesized of the identical sequence (containing a 12-RSS) save for the positioning of a single 5-IdU residue in place of the normal T on the bottom strand of the DNA as depicted in Fig. 5A. This set placed the IdU residues at three positions in the nonamer, at one position in the heptamer, and at one position within the spacer. The substituted strands were end-labeled, assembled into duplex DNA, and used as probes for both EMSA and UV cross-linking assays. The sample was exposed to UV and then split into two fractions. One was analyzed directly under native conditions while the other was disassembled with SDS and heat, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Experiments were performed with MR1 alone or with both MR1 and MR2 under the same conditions (including dI-dC competition) that showed specific binding previously (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the UV cross-linking of unmodified DNA, here we were able to obtain cross-linking efficiencies as high as 1–2%. The EMSA results for both sets of proteins show that equal binding occurred with each probe, as expected (top panels in Fig. 5B). The UV cross-linking with MR1 alone (Fig. 5B, bottom left) confirms the previous interpretation of nonspecific binding. The cross-links formed with this protein using each of the probes were essentially equal in intensity across all five positions. This is the expected result if RAG1 is binding nonspecifically, and therefore forming a population of complexes with protein distributed equally over the entire DNA probe. Any single position in the DNA would have an equal probability of cross-linking to protein. Contrast this with the behavior of the mixed MR1 plus MR2 gel (Fig. 5B,bottom right). Here, distinct inhomogeneities in cross-linking efficiency exist. Within the nonamer, there is a considerably less cross-linking at the third base pair (probe 3) compared with the adjacent fourth and fifth positions of the nonamer (probes 4 and 5). There is essentially no cross-linking to probe 6, which places the iodine in the spacer. The inhomogeneities in cross-linking are the anticipated behavior of specific binding since, in this case, certain positions should be in close contact with protein and other positions relatively unbound.Figure 5Cross-linking of the specific complex to the RSS. A, the sequence of the 12-RSS is shown with IdU on the bottom strand at the sites indicated for five probes designated 3–7. B, cross-linking of IdU-containing probes demonstrate specific contacts made by MR1. Upper panels show that each probe is equally capable of forming a complex with MR1 or both proteins in EMSA. Bottom panels show that MR1, when alone, cross-links equally at all positions, whereas MR1 in the presence of MR2 make preferred contacts in the nonamer (probes 4 and 5) and at the heptamer (probe 7). Portions of the same samples analyzed in the EMSA gels were denatured and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the bottom gels. Competitor dI-dC was included in these reactions at 50 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Most interesting is the strong signal obtained with probe 7. This probe is substituted at the second position of the heptamer. It is apparent, therefore, that in the presence of MR2, a complex forms in which MR1 is in close contact to both the nonamer and heptamer. All of the contacts visualized in these experiments represent cross-links to MR1. The complexes seen in the SDS gels all possess mobilities expected for MR1 (120 kDa) and not for MR2 (92 kDa). This interpretation has been confirmed by using the R1 version of RAG1 and obtaining a more rapidly moving species (data not shown). We fail to see MR2 cross-linking to any of these probes under these conditions, although we are convinced that it is in contact with DNA. These points will be discussed below.DISCUSSIONThe V(D)J recombination mechanism has been divided into two phases. The initial step requires recognition of the RSS and cleavage of the DNA backbone immediately adjacent to the heptamer. There are two different RSS sequences that differ in the length of the spacer region, but the proteins RAG1 and RAG2 together are sufficient to act at either one alone and also participate in creating a synaptic structure that couples one of each type RSS into a larger complex (8van Gent D.C.

Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The two proteins also seem to play a necessary role in stabilizing the post-cleavage DNA ends for subsequent processing and rejoining in later steps in the reaction (19Ramsden D.A. Paull T.T.

It is not known whether these proteins have additional enzymatic activities. Thus, these two proteins must play several roles in the reaction, and teasing apart the DNA-protei"

The fluorescence technique should prove valuable for future transition state studies of F1-ATPase. F1-ATPase is the catalytic sector of the enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase, responsible for ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria and also for ATP-driven proton pumping in bacteria. It consists of five different subunits in the stoichiometry α3β3γδε and contains three catalytic nucleotide-binding sites whose structures have been defined by x-ray crystallography at 2.8 Å resolution (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 2Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Each catalytic site lies at an interface between an α- and β-subunit of the enzyme, with most of the ligands between the nucleotide and the protein being provided by side chains from the β-subunit. Rotation of the γ-subunit within the α3β3 hexagon has been demonstrated during MgATP hydrolysis (3Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating that the three catalytic sites participate in catalysis in sequential fashion. Functional characterization of catalysis has been facilitated by mutagenesis of critical catalytic site residues and also by introduction of specifically engineered Trp residues into the catalytic sites. The latter technique has enabled determination of catalytic site nucleotide binding parameters in wild-type and mutant enzymes under a wide range of conditions (for recent reviews see Refs. 4Nakamoto R.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 5Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis in F1, the manner in which the catalytic transition state is attained and stabilized by catalytic site residues must be established. We have previously studied the catalytic transition state using techniques of “unisite catalysis.” Unisite catalysis is the term used to describe the single turnover of ATP hydrolysis that occurs under conditions where F1 is present in excess over substrate MgATP (6Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar). Complete characterization of all the rate and equilibrium constants of unisite catalysis allows one to construct Gibbs free energy diagrams for the entire catalytic pathway, including the catalytic transition state (7Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19640-19648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of difference energy diagrams for mutant versus wild-type enzymes then readily reveals situations where destabilization of the catalytic transition state has been brought about by mutagenesis (8Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4402-4410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21471-21478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this technique, the roles of several critical catalytic site residues were defined in our laboratory (7Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19640-19648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

The x-ray structures have since confirmed their proximity to the bound substrate in the catalytic sites and revealed their actual locations in exquisite detail. However, unisite catalysis assays require significant quantities of both enzyme and radioactive isotope and are time-consuming. An alternative approach to study the transition state that overcomes these problems would be of great value. Earlier, Vignais and colleagues (11Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Garin J. Issartel J.P. Michel L. Chabre M. Vignais P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8958-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Dupuis A. Issartel J.P. Vignais P.V.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) had shown that the MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex was a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial and Escherichia coliF1-ATPase. At that time, it was already recognized that the MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex bound in catalytic sites of ATP- or GTP-hydrolyzing enzymes was most likely mimicking the catalytic transition state, and the data reported by Vignais and colleagues strongly supported the view that this was also the case for F1.

The fluoroaluminate species that occurs at the catalytic site of F1 is not yet known from x-ray data, and we will refer to it here simply as fluoroaluminate. When the βY331W mutation is engineered into catalytic sites ofE. coli F1, the fluorescence of residue β-Trp-331 provides a sensitive and specific probe of catalytic site nucleotide binding (23Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal can readily be monitored at low enzyme concentration, and because the aromatic ring of residue β-331 stacks against the adenine ring of bound nucleotide (24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the fluorescence signal is totally quenched upon binding of adenine nucleotide in the catalytic sites. We therefore hypothesized that in βY331W mutant enzyme (which, it should be stated, shows normal catalytic behavior in ATP synthesis and hydrolysis), the MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex should be readily detected as a very high affinity species by fluorescence titration. In this paper, we use this approach to measure the effects of fluoroaluminate on MgADP binding to catalytic sites in normal, mutant, and DCCD 2The abbreviations used are: DCCD, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate -inhibited enzyme.

Before use the enzymes were passed twice through 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50 in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, as described (27Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was shown to effectively remove catalytic site-bound nucleotide (“native” enzyme). Nucleotide-depleted F1 (depleted of both catalytic and noncatalytic site-bound nucleotide) was prepared as described by Senior et al. (28Senior A.E. Lee R.S-F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Before use, it was passed once through a centrifuge column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0 (as above), and then EDTA was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. Then, after 1 h at room temperature, the enzyme was passed through a centrifuge column equilibrated in 50 mmTris/SO4, pH 8.0. F1 (0.24 mg/ml) was preincubated at room temperature in 50 mmTris/SO4, pH 8.0, with or without 2.5 mm MgADP, AlCl3, and NaF. Aliquots (100 μl) were removed, and ATPase activity was assayed in a total volume of 1 ml containing 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.5, 10 mm NaATP, and 4 mm MgCl2 at room temperature for 2–5 min, at which time the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Pi release was linear with time and was measured as in Ref. 29Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar.

The enzyme was assayed as above. Fluorescence measurements were made at room temperature in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0. A SPEX Fluorolog 2 or Aminco-Bowman 2 spectrofluorometer was used. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and fluorescence emission at 360 nm was used as the signal (23Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

For MgADP titration in absence of fluoroaluminate, the buffer contained 2.5 mmMgSO4, and NaADP was added. For MgADP titration in presence of fluoroaluminate, the buffer contained 2.5 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm AlCl3, and 5 mm NaF, and NaADP was added. For ADP titration (absence of Mg2+), the buffer contained 0.5 mm EDTA, and NaADP was added. Enzyme was preincubated 60 min at room temperature before fluorescence signals were measured to allow full inhibition by fluoroaluminate to be attained. Background signals (buffer) were subtracted, and inner filter and volume effects were corrected by performing parallel titrations with wild-type F1. Nucleotide binding parameters were analyzed by fitting theoretical curves to the measured data points assuming theoretical models with one, two, or three types of binding sites as described in detail previously (24Löbau S.

Conditions for potent inhibition of mitochondrial and wild-typeE. coli F1-ATPase by MgADP in combination with AlCl3 and NaF, which together form fluoroaluminate complexes, have been documented by Vignais and colleagues (11Lunardi J.

Here it was necessary to confirm that the βY331W mutant enzyme was also subject to the same inhibition. TableI shows the data. It is seen that complete inhibition was achieved in the presence of MgADP, AlCl3, and NaF and that all three of these components were necessary. It should also be noted that preincubation with MgADP alone, at 2.5 mm concentration, had no significant inhibitory effect. The small reduction in activity seen (8%) is readily explained as due to competitive inhibition by MgADP carried over from the preincubation into the enzyme assay. We emphasize that our ATPase assays are carried out under conditions where free [Mg2+] is minimal, by use of an ATP/Mg2+ concentration ratio of 10:4, which minimizes any potential inhibition by MgADP (28Senior A.E.

Open table in a new tab βY331W mutant F1 was passed through two centrifuge columns in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then preincubated for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, with additions of MgADP (2.5 mm), AlCl3 (1 mm), and NaF (5 mm) as indicated. ATPase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Further experiments showed that for complete inhibition the minimal concentrations of AlCl3 and NaF needed were 0.5 and 5.0 mm, respectively, and at least 60 min of preincubation was required. Quenching of the fluorescence signal of βY331W mutant F1 was used to determine nucleotide binding to catalytic sites. It was found that inclusion of AlCl3 and NaF had no effect on the fluorescence spectrum of the βY331W enzyme. Initial experiments were done on native enzyme, i.e. enzyme that had been passed sequentially through two 1-ml Sephadex G-50 columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This treatment removes catalytic site-bound nucleotide but not endogenous noncatalytic site-bound nucleotide (27Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For MgADP binding in the absence of fluoroaluminate (Fig. 1,circles), NaADP was added to enzyme in 50 mmTris/SO4, pH 8.0, in the presence of 2.5 mmMgSO4, and the data were similar to what we have previously published (23Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We previously determined that a model assuming two types of binding site, with one site of higher and two sites of lower affinity, gives a satisfactory fit to these data (23Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When the same model was used here, calculated values of binding parameters were as follows: K d1 = 0.08 μm, n1 = 1.21;K d2 = 14 μm, n2= 1.62. For MgADP binding in the presence of fluoroaluminate (Fig. 1,triangles), NaADP was added to enzyme in 50 mmTris/SO4, pH 8.0, in the presence of 2.5 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm AlCl3, and 5 mm NaF. The effect of fluoroaluminate was very obvious, with a large increase in binding of MgADP occurring at low MgADP concentrations. It was found that a theoretical model assuming three binding sites of different affinities gave a better fit to these data than a model with two types of site. Calculated values for binding parameters were as follows: K d1 < 1 nm,K d2 = 0.06 μm, K d3= 40 μm. For comparison, if the data for MgADP binding in the absence of fluoroaluminate (Fig. 1, circles) were analyzed using the same three-site model, the calculated values for binding parameters were as follows: K d1 = 0.05 μm, K d2 = 2.54 μm,K d3 = 47 μm. (The three-site model was equally satisfactory as the two-site model for these data.) Overall, the Fig. 1 binding curves indicated that fluoroaluminate induced a very large increase in affinity for MgADP at site one, a significant effect at site two, and little or no effect at site 3. However, it should be noted that in the presence of fluoroaluminate (Fig. 1, triangles), at low concentrations of added NaADP, the stoichiometry of bound catalytic site MgADP considerably exceeded the actual amount of ADP added. The F1 concentration in Fig. 1 was 100 nm, and total MgADP concentration is plotted on the x axis. (It is assumed that total MgADP is equivalent to ADP added, since MgSO4 concentration was 2.5 mm). A possible explanation for the anomaly could be that endogenous ATP or ADP is released from noncatalytic sites and becomes sequestered into catalytic sites by fluoroaluminate, because the MgADP-fluoroaluminate is bound at catalytic site one with extremely high affinity. This possibility was investigated as follows. Native enzyme was preincubated in the presence of 2.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm AlCl3, and 5 mm NaF, and then ATPase activity was assayed and found to be inhibited by 60%. In a parallel fluorescence experiment, the addition of 2.5 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm AlCl3, and 5 mm NaF to enzyme in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, induced a 10% quench of fluorescence. This fluorescence quench is equivalent to a catalytic site occupancy of 0.6 mol/mol, which is in excellent agreement with the degree of inhibition seen. In contrast, when nucleotide-depleted enzyme (depleted of catalytic and noncatalytic site nucleotide) was tested similarly, there was no inhibition of ATPase and only a small quench of fluorescence. Therefore, we concluded that in native enzyme, significant transfer of nucleotide from noncatalytic to catalytic sites did occur in presence of fluoroaluminate. MgADP binding experiments were therefore repeated using nucleotide-depleted enzyme. For the data in the absence of fluoroaluminate (Fig. 2,circles), a model with two types of binding site gave a satisfactory fit to the data as seen previously (23Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the following values were calculated: K d1 = 0.13 μm, n1 = 1.29;K d2 = 6.8 μm,n2 = 1.37. These values are similar to our previously published values for nucleotide-depleted F1 and are similar to the values for native enzyme (see above). A model with three sites of differing affinities gave an equally satisfactory fit with calculated values of K d1 = 0.07 μm, K d2 = 1.1 μm,K d3 = 14 μm. In the presence of fluoroaluminate (Fig. 2, triangles), again a very large increase in binding stoichiometry at low MgADP concentrations was seen. These experiments utilized 26 nmF1 concentration, which, under our experimental conditions, is at the low range permissible for a satisfactory fluorescence signal. In Fig. 2, we have plotted bound catalytic site MgADP versuscalculated free, nonbound MgADP concentration (x axis). Even at the lowest concentration of free MgADP (1.7 nm), the first catalytic site was already filled when fluoroaluminate was present. A fit of the data to a model assuming two types of binding site was unsatisfactory, but a model assuming three sites of different affinities gave a satisfactory fit, and the calculated binding parameters were as follows: K d1 ≪ 1 nm, K d2 = 0.06 μm,K d3 = 5.6 μm. At concentrations of MgADP below the lowest point shown in Fig. 2, calculated free MgADP concentration was undependable, because it represented a tiny fraction of the total MgADP present (bound plus free). The value forK d1 of ≪ 1 nm should be taken only as indicating an extremely high affinity for MgADP-fluoroaluminate at catalytic site one and not as an accurate estimate of binding affinity. A value far below 1 nm would not be surprising. Fig. 2showed that K d2 was also decreased in the presence of fluoroaluminate as compared with its absence. Summarizing the data of Figs. 1 and 2, fluoroaluminate had a very large effect on MgADP binding at catalytic site one, a more moderate effect at site two, and no significant effect at site three. The very tight MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex formed at catalytic site one may be regarded with confidence as a transition state analog, and it may well be that a complex with partial transition state-like properties forms also at catalytic site two. As noted under “Discussion,” there is prior evidence for binding of 2 mol of MgADP-fluoroaluminate/mol of F1. Fig. 3 shows binding of ADP, in the absence of Mg2+, to native βY331W mutant enzyme. It is evident that fluoroaluminate did not influence ADP binding in the absence of Mg2+. The data were analyzed assuming a model with one class of binding site, as used previously for ADP binding (23Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and gave values of K d = 28 μmand n = 2.8 in the absence or presence of fluoroaluminate. Therefore, a transition state analog did not form under these conditions. This is consistent with x-ray structures of enzymes complexed with MgADP-fluoroaluminate, which show that Mg2+ plays an important role in forming the complex itself and in liganding the complex to the enzyme catalytic site. Inhibition of F1-ATPase by fluoroaluminate requires the presence of Mg2+ (13Issartel J.P. Dupuis A. Lunardi J. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the enzyme is inactive in the absence of Mg2+. Taken together, the results of Table I and Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 demonstrate that the fluorescence of residue β-Trp-331 provides a sensitive probe of high affinity binding of the MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex and of formation of a catalytic transition state-like complex, at the first, highest affinity catalytic site of F1-ATPase. β-Lys-155 is the Lys residue of the Walker A consensus sequence. In the x-ray structure, it is seen to lie close to the phosphate moieties of the catalytic site-bound nucleotide (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), and as will be discussed later, it has previously been implicated as a critical functional residue. Here our goal was to determine its role in stabilizing the catalytic transition state using binding of MgADP-fluoroaluminate as the assay. Fig. 4A shows titration of the native βK155Q/βY331W enzyme with MgADP in the presence and absence of fluoroaluminate. The two curves are essentially identical, showing there was no enhancement of MgADP binding by fluoroaluminate, in marked contrast to the results seen with the parent βY331W mutant F1 in Fig. 1. This result demonstrates that formation of the catalytic transition state does not occur in the βK155Q mutant, giving direct confirmation of the role of β-Lys-155 in stabilizing the transition state. This residue was earlier implicated as a critical catalytic residue by mutagenesis studies (see “Discussion”). In the x-ray structure (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), residue β-Glu-181 is seen to be located at some distance (4.1 Å) from the γ-phosphate, but it is close to a water molecule that appears hydrogen-bonded to the carboxyl oxygens and could be the substrate water for hydrolysis. Our goal was to analyze the role of β-Glu-181"

Farnesyltransferase (FTase) 1The abbreviations used are: FTase, farnesyltransferase; GGTase I, geranylgeranyltransferase I; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1The abbreviations used are: FTase, farnesyltransferase; GGTase I, geranylgeranyltransferase I; GGTI, geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor; FTI, farnesyltransferase inhibitor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) modify cysteines of proteins that end in CAAX (C = Cys, A = aliphatic amino acid, X = any amino acid) at their carboxyl-terminal with GGTase I preferring leucine or isoleucine and FTase preferring Met or Ser in the X position (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). GGTase II, on the other hand, geranylgeranylates on two cysteines in proteins that end inXXCC, CCXX, or CXC sequences. Many prenylated proteins are small G-proteins that are integral components of proliferative signal transduction pathways (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). For example, Ras farnesylation is required for its ability to transduce growth signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to transcription factors and the cell cycle machinery that regulates cell division (2Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutated Ras is found in about 30% of all human cancers and is believed to cause malignant transformation by constitutive activation of abnormal growth (3Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Farnesylation of oncogenic Ras is required for its cancer-causing activity (4Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. Bourne J.R. Solski P.A. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Rho family of small G-proteins such as RhoA and Rac1 require geranylgeranylation for their biological function. One of their key biological roles is to allow cells to traverse the G1 phase of the cell cycle and begin DNA synthesis in S phase (5Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Recently, RhoA and Rac1 have been shown to be required for malignant transformation by Ras (6Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 7Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutively activated RhoA and Rac1 can also lead to oncogenic transformation (6Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 7Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The overwhelming evidence implicating the Ras and Rho family of proteins in aberrant proliferative pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases prompted us and others (reviewed in Ref. 8Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to design and synthesize FTase and GGTase I inhibitors. FTI-277 and GGTI-298 are CAAX peptidomimetics that potently and selectively inhibit FTase and GGTase I, respectively (9Lerner E. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A. Der C.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). We have found FTI-276 and its methyl ester FTI-277 to be potent inhibitors of oncogenic Ras processing and signaling (9Lerner E. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A. Der C. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). FTI-276 also potently inhibited the growth in nude mice of human tumors with multiple genetic alterations such as K-Ras mutation and p53 deletion (11Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4243-4247PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). FTIs from several other groups have also shown potent antitumor efficacy without toxicity in several animal models (8Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several FTIs are presently in phase I clinical trials (13Zujewski J. Horak I.D. Woestenborghs R. Chiao J. Cusack G. Kohler D. Kremer A.B. Cowan K.H. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39 (abstr.): 270Google Scholar). Selective inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation with GGTI-298 has major consequences on several biological pathways. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with GGTI-298, blocks PDGF- and epidermal growth factor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of their corresponding tyrosine kinase receptors (14McGuire T. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, selective inhibition of protein farnesylation has no effect on receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation (14McGuire T. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GGTI-298 inhibits the growth in nude mice of human tumors by a mechanism that is not yet known (12Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism may involve GGTI-298-mediated G1 phase block and apoptosis in cultured human tumor cells (15Miguel K. Pradines A. Sun J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Favre G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1846-1850PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of GGTI-298 to inhibit proliferation is not limited to human tumor cells that are of epithelial and fibroblast origin. GGTI-298 also has a major effect on the proliferative pathways of smooth muscle cells (16Stark W.W. Blaskovich M.A. Johnson B.A. Vasudevan A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). For example, GGTI-298 is very effective at inducing G1 arrest and apoptosis in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, GGTI-298 enhances the ability of interleukin-1β to induce nitric oxide synthase-2 in the same cells (17Finder J.D. Litz J.L. Blaskovich M.A. McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Davies P. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13484-13488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This induction of nitric oxide synthase-2 results in a large increase in the production of the nitric oxide radical, which is known to be inhibitory to smooth muscle cell proliferation. GGTI-298 also inhibited the ability of PDGF, interleukin-1β, and activated Ras to induce superoxide production in smooth muscle cells (18Boota A. Johnson B. Lee K. Blaskovich M.A. Hamilton A.D. Pitt B. Sebti S.M. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L55-L63PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the data indicate that GGTI-298 has antiproliferative effects on fibroblasts, epithelial, and smooth muscle cells, and this cell growth inhibition appears to be mediated through a G1 phase arrest. Recently, we have shown that in human tumors this G1 arrest correlated with an induction of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1 (19Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, whether this induction of p21WAF1 is responsible for the G1 arrest is not yet known. The G1 to S phase transition of the mammalian cell division cycle is a highly regulated step. The key regulators of G1/S progression are a series of kinases that depend on cyclins for activation (for review, see Refs. 20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar, 21Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 22Musunuru K. Hinds P.W. Cell Cycle Regulators in Cancer. Karger Landes Systems, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). For example, the d-type cyclins are made in early G1, bind to and activate the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. Activation of these kinases also requires phosphorylation by CDK kinases such as CAK or cyclin H-CDK7 and dephosphorylation by phosphatases such as cdc25 (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). At this stage, the cell has reached a critical checkpoint of its cell cycle called the restriction point (R) at which time the cell checks that all is ready for DNA synthesis. Cyclin D·CDK4 and cyclin D·CDK6 complexes are now active and phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product pRb. Phosphorylated pRb disassociates from the transcription factor E2F, which, once freed from pRb, is able to induce the expression of several genes that prepare the cell for DNA synthesis (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). Among these is cyclin E, which activates CDK2, a kinase required for late G1 to early S phase transition. The cyclin E·CDK2 complex hyperphosphorylates pRb, and the cell proceeds into S phase. At this time cyclin A expression is high, whereas cyclins D and E have been degraded (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The cyclin A·CDK2 complex maintains the phosphorylation of pRb to sustain DNA replication. Finally CDK kinase activities are highly regulated by two families of CDK inhibitors, CKIs such as p21 and p27 and the INKs such as p15 and p16 (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar, 21Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 22Musunuru K. Hinds P.W. Cell Cycle Regulators in Cancer. Karger Landes Systems, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). These inhibitors play a key role in making sure the cells stop at the R point if any DNA damage is detected. This allows the cells to repair the damage before replicating their DNA. Growth factors such as PDGF and epidermal growth factor activate several pathways, some of which have been shown to directly regulate the cell cycle (22Musunuru K. Hinds P.W. Cell Cycle Regulators in Cancer. Karger Landes Systems, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). For example, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade, which results in increased expression of cyclin D1 that in turn will activate CDK4/CDK6 allowing cells to traverse the R point. PDGF activation of the Ras/RhoA pathway results in the degradation of p27, which also will have the same overall effect of allowing cells to traverse the R point and enter S phase of the cell cycle (23Weber J.D. Hu W. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32966-32971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The G1 arrest brought about by GGTI-298 inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation could be due to effects on several important steps in G1/S such as the inhibition of expression of cyclins D and/or E, CDK2, CDK4 and/or CDK6, or increased expression of CKIs and/or INKs. The work described in this study suggests a possible mechanism for GGTI-298 growth arrest involving increased expression and partner switching of CDK inhibitors, resulting in inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4, and pRb phosphorylation. The GGTase I-specific peptidomimetic GGTI-298 was synthesized as described previously (10Vogt A. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar,14McGuire T. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Human tumor cell lines Calu-1 and A-549 (lung carcinomas), T-24 (bladder carcinoma), and A-253 (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in McCoy's 5A (Calu-1, T-24, and A-253) and F12K (A-549) media at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 10% CO2. Cells were treated with GGTI-298 (15 μm) for 48 h, harvested, and lysed in HEPES lysis buffer as described previously (11Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4243-4247PubMed Google Scholar, 14McGuire T. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Proteins were then resolved by 12.5% or 7% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with antibodies against Rap1A/Krev-1(121), p21WAF1 (C-190), cyclin E (C-19), cyclin D1 (72–13G), CDK2 (M2), CDK4 (H-22), CDK6 (C-21), p16INK4A(C-20), p15INK4B (C-20), cyclin A (H-432) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p27KIP1 (G173–524), and pRb (G3–245) (from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The ECL blotting system (NEN Life Science Products) was used for detection of positive antibody reactions (14McGuire T. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were treated and harvested as described for Western blotting, and nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. DNA content was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter as described previously (19Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells were treated and harvested as described above for Western blotting. Lysates (500 μg) were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to CDK2 (M2), CDK4 (H-22), and CDK6 (C-21). The immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with p15, p16, p21, and p27 as described above. To measure the activity of CDK2, histone H1 was used as the substrate; for CDK4 and CDK6, GST-Rb (C-terminal fragment of pRb) was used as a substrate. The CDK immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 10 μl of 50 mmHepes (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μg/ml histone H1 (BM) or 20 μg/ml GST-Rb, and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with occasional mixing. The reaction was terminated with an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (93.75 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 3% SDS, 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol). The sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. GGTI-298 was previously shown to inhibit the growth in nude mice and to induce G1 block of human tumor cells (12Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Miguel K. Pradines A. Sun J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Favre G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1846-1850PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to understand how GGTI-298 prevents Calu-1 cells from traversing G1 and entering S phase of the cell cycle. We first determined the ability of GGTI-298 to affect phosphorylation of pRb, one of the key events required for G1/S transition. Calu-1 cells were treated for 48 h with GGTI-298 (15 μm), and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-pRb antibody that recognizes both hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Other cell lysate aliquots were immunoblotted with antibodies to either Rap1A or RhoA, small G-proteins that are exclusively geranylgeranylated. Finally, a set of cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the proportion of cells at different phases of the cell cycle. Fig. 1A shows that Calu-1 cells treated with the vehicle contained predominantly hyperphosphorylated pRb. Treatment with GGTI-298 resulted in hypophosphorylation of pRb (Fig. 1A). Hypophosphorylation of pRb correlated with inhibition of the geranylgeranylation of the GGTase I substrates, Rap1A and RhoA, and increased the proportion of Calu-1 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Because processed and unprocessed RhoA migrated closely (Fig. 1A), we confirmed the effects of GGTI-298 on the processing of RhoA by isolating membranes and cytosolic fractions and showing that GGTI-298 decreases the membrane levels of RhoA while inducing accumulation of RhoA in the cytosol (Fig. 1B). We next evaluated the ability of GGTI-298 to inhibit G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinases that phosphorylate pRb. Calu-1 cells were treated with GGTI-298 for 48 h, and the lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2, anti-CDK4, or anti-CDK6 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows that CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 from control Calu-1 cells were active and phosphorylated histone H1 (CDK2) and GST-Rb (CDK4 and CDK6) in vitro. Treatment with GGTI-298 blocked the activity of CDK2, inhibited CDK4 and CDK6 activities by 75% and 30%, respectively(Fig. 2). The mechanism by which GGTI-298 results in inhibition of the activities of CDKs could involve inhibition of the expression of the G1 kinases themselves or their cyclins A, D, and E, or because of an increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. To further investigate these possibilities, Calu-1 cells were treated with GGTI-298 for 48 h, and the lysates immunoblotted with antibodies to CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, cyclins D1, E, and A, p21, p27, p15, and p16 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows that control-dividing Calu-1 cells expressed all cell cycle components evaluated except p21, which was barely detectable. Treatment of Calu-1 cells with GGTI-298 did not alter the levels of CDK2 and CDK4 or those of cyclins E and D1, indicating that the inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4 activities is not because of a decrease in the levels of cyclins E and D1 or the kinases (Fig. 3). However, the amount of cyclin A was decreased by 20%, and this could contribute to the block of CDK2 kinase activity. The levels of CDK6 decreased by 15%, and this could account for the decrease in its kinase activity (Fig. 2). Furthermore GGTI-298 greatly increased (7-fold) the levels of p21, and to a lesser extent (2-fold) increased the levels of p15 and had little effect on the levels of p16 and p27 (Fig. 3). The above data suggest that the inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4 and the subsequent hypophosphorylation of pRb are caused by increased protein levels of some of the CDK inhibitors. Therefore we investigated whether association of the CDKs with their inhibitors was also affected. Calu-1 cells were treated with vehicle (control) or GGTI-298 for 48 h, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with various CDKs, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted by various CKIs. Fig. 4 shows that in control cells, p21 and p15 were associated with primarily CDK6, whereas p27 was primarily associated with CDK4 and CDK6. Treatment with GGTI-298 increased (7-fold) association of p21 with CDK2 while decreasing (70%) its association with CDK6. Similarly, GGTI-298 treatment decreased binding of p27 to CDK6 (85%) and CDK4 (22%) and increased binding to CDK2 (2-fold) (Fig. 4). Furthermore, GGTI-298 treatment increased (2-fold) association of p15 to CDK4 with no effects on association with CDK6 (Fig. 4). Finally, GGTI-298 had no effect on the association of p16 with CDK4 or CDK6 (data not shown). Thus, GGTI-298 treatment resulted in a partner switch for p21 and p27 from CDK6 to CDK2. Furthermore, GGTI-298 treatment also induced an increased association of CDK4 with p15 while decreasing its association with p27. We next determined whether the GGTI-298-induced partner switching is unique to Calu-1 cells. To this end, we treated three other human tumor cell lines; A-549 lung carcinoma, T-24 bladder carcinoma, and A-253 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with GGTI-298, immunoprecipitated the lysates with CDK2 and CDK6 antibodies, and blotted with p27 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 shows that in all three cell lines treatment with GGTI-298 increased the levels of p27 associated with CDK2 while it decreased the levels associated with CDK6. To determine whether removal of GGTI-298 would result in reversal of G1 block and partner switching, we treated Calu-1 cells with GGTI-298 for 48 h, fresh medium lacking GGTI-298 was then added, and the cells collected after 0, 4, 24, and 48 h post-GGTI-298 removal. The cells were then harvested and processed for p21waf induction, immunoprecipitation/blotting and flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6 shows that, consistent with Fig. 4, GGTI-298 induced p21waf, partner switching of p27 from CDK6 to CDK2 and G1 block (compare control versusGGTI-298 lanes of Fig. 6). GGTI-298 had little effect on the association of p27 with CDK4. Removal of GGTI-298 resulted in a time-dependent reversal of p21waf induction, partner switching, and G1 block. Little change was observed 4 h after removal. However, significant reversal occurred at 48 h (Fig. 6). Although there are more geranylgeranylated proteins than farnesylated proteins, more efforts have been spent on designing, synthesizing, and biologically characterizing FTase rather than GGTase I inhibitors (8Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The intense search for FTase inhibitors was prompted some years ago by the realization that farnesylation is required for the cancer-causing activity of the important oncoprotein Ras (8Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, however, more attention has been directed toward understanding the effects of inhibiting (by GGTase I inhibitors) the function of geranylgeranylated proteins. This is primarily due to the discovery that some geranylgeranylated proteins such as those from the Rho family are essential for normal and aberrant proliferation in several cell types (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 5Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In addition to their ability to inhibit human tumor growth, GGTase I inhibitors may also have great therapeutic potential in cardiovascular diseases. For example, GGTI-298 blocks the ability of smooth muscle cells to proliferate by inducing a G1 block and apoptosis (16Stark W.W. Blaskovich M.A. Johnson B.A. Vasudevan A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). This may be related to the inhibition by GGTI-298 of PDGF and Ras induction of superoxide formation (18Boota A. Johnson B. Lee K. Blaskovich M.A. Hamilton A.D. Pitt B. Sebti S.M. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L55-L63PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that a geranylgeranylated protein downstream of Ras is critical to events regulating cell division. This is consistent with a recent report, which shows that the geranylgeranylated protein Rac1 mediates superoxide formation and transformation by Ras (24Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollot S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that GGTI-298 treatment of the human lung carcinoma Calu-1 cells results in a large increase of the CDK inhibitor p21 and a modest increase of p15 with little effect on p27 and p16. In nontreated dividing cells, CDK2 and CDK4 bound mainly p27 and their kinases were active, whereas CDK6 bound all inhibitors and was also active. Upon treatment with GGTI-298, p21 and p27 switched partners from CDK6 to CDK2, whereas p15 became bound to CDK4. The effects of GGTI-298 on the observed partner switching was reversible. We found that removal of GGTI-298 resulted in reversal of the G1 phase block, which was paralleled by a reversal of partner switching of p27 from CDK2 to CDK6. The fact that in dividing cells, CDKs are bound to some inhibitors is not surprising, because low levels of such inhibitors may be required to stabilize cyclins with the corresponding CDKs (25LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the suggestion that some CDKs may serve as cellular reservoirs for low levels of inhibitors (26Blain S.W. Montalvo E. Massague J. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25863-25872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although there was little increase in total cellular levels of p27 after GGTI-298 treatment, the amount of p27 bound to CDK2 was increased. This suggests that p27 that was released from CDK6, and to a lesser degree from CDK4, bound to CDK2. Taken altogether, the data suggests that GGTI-298 induced partner switching for p21 and p27 from CDK6 to CDK2. This partner switching was not unique to Calu-1 cells and was found to occur in three other human tumor cell lines, A-549, T-24, and A-253. These results are similar to those obtained from cells that were arrested in late G1 following treatment with transforming growth factor β (27Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In these cells, transforming growth factor β induced the expression of p15, which bound CDK4 and CDK6 and displaced p27 from cyclin D·CDK4 and cyclin D·CDK6 complexes (27Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The free p27 bound the cyclin E·CDK2 complex and inhibited its activity, which resulted in preventing cells from entering S phase (27Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The fact that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation results in G1 arrest suggests that some geranylgeranylated proteins are required for cell progression from G1 to S. The most likely candidates are members of the Rho family of proteins such as RhoA and Rac1. In this study, we showed that GGTI-298 inhibits the processing of RhoA, and recently we have demonstrated that RhoA represses p21waf transcription and suggested that GGTI-298 induction of p21waf is mediated by inhibition of RhoA geranylgeranylation (29Adnane J. Bizouarn F. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6962-6970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that both RhoA and Rac1, when microinjected into G1-arrested cells, promote progression to S phase (5Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dominant-negative Rac1 and RhoA reverse oncogenic Ras transformation (6Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 7Qiu R.G. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Rac1 may regulate transcription by activating the Jun kinase pathway that in turn will affect genes that are regulated by AP-1. Furthermore, very recently Tapon et al. (28Tapon N. Nagata K. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) discovered a novel effector of Rac1, POSH, a kinase that appears to be required for activation of Jun kinase by Rac1. It would be of great interest to determine whether activated Jun kinase or POSH would rescue the cells from the GGTI-298 mediated G1 block. These studies, which are in progress, will further enhance our understanding of how inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation results in G1 arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2025279706,"Human cytokeratin 1 (CK1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is expressed on their membranes and is able to bind high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (Hasan, A. A. K., Zisman, T., and Schmaier, A. H. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 3615–3620). New investigations have been performed to demonstrate the HK binding domain on CK1. Four overlapping recombinant (r) CK1 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli by a glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system. Biotin-HK specifically bound to rCK128 and rCK131 in the presence of Zn2+ but not toDeleted1–6rCK131. Recombinant CK128 and rCK131 also inhibited biotin-HK binding to HUVEC with IC50 of 0.4 and 0.5 μm, respectively. Alternatively, rCK114 and Deleted1–6rCK131 did not inhibit binding at concentrations ≥1 μm. Seven sequential 20 amino acid peptides of CK1 were prepared to cover the protein coded by exons 1–3. Only the first peptide (GYG20) coded by exon 1 significantly inhibited HK binding to HUVEC with an IC50 of 35 μm. Fine mapping studies isolated two overlapping peptides also coded by exon 1 (GPV15 and PGG15) that inhibited binding to HUVEC with IC50 of 18 and 9 μm, respectively. A sequence scrambled peptide of PGG15 did not block binding to HUVEC and biotin-GPV20 specifically bound to HK. Peptides GPV15 and PGG15 also blocked prekallikrein activation on endothelial cells. However, inhibition of PK activation by peptide PGG15 occurred at 10-fold lower concentration (IC50 = 1 μm) than inhibition of biotin-HK binding to HUVEC (IC50 = 10 μm). These studies indicate that HK binds to a region of 20 amino acids coded by exon 1 on CK1 which is carboxyl-terminal to its glycine-rich amino-terminal globular domain. Furthermore, HK binding to CK1 modulates PK activation on HUVEC. Human cytokeratin 1 (CK1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is expressed on their membranes and is able to bind high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (Hasan, A. A. K., Zisman, T., and Schmaier, A. H. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 3615–3620). New investigations have been performed to demonstrate the HK binding domain on CK1.

Furthermore, HK binding to CK1 modulates PK activation on HUVEC. Recent investigations indicate that when the proteins of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system (high molecular weight kininogen (HK), 1The abbreviations used are: HK, high molecular weight kininogen; LK, low molecular weight kininogen; PK, prekallikrein; XII, factor XII; uPAR, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; r, recombinant; CK1, cytokeratin 1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BSA, bovine serum albumin 1The abbreviations used are: HK, high molecular weight kininogen; LK, low molecular weight kininogen; PK, prekallikrein; XII, factor XII; uPAR, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; r, recombinant; CK1, cytokeratin 1; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BSA, bovine serum albumin prekallikrein (PK), and factor XII (XII)) assemble on their binding sites, putative receptor(s) on endothelial cells, PK is activated to kallikrein, and factor XII is activated secondarily (1Motta G.

Activation of this proteolytic system on endothelial cells is independent of a negative charged, artificial surface (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PK is activated to kallikrein by a membrane-associated cysteine protease whose activity is recognized only when PK binds to HK on endothelial cells (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data along with the finding that metabolic inhibitors, antimycin A and 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and pronase abolish HK binding to endothelial cells (4Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the kininogen-binding site, putative receptor, is a physiochemical structure. Recent evidence also suggests that the kininogen receptor on endothelial cells may be comprised of one or more candidate proteins. A 33-kDa protein identified as gC1qR has been recognized as a kininogen-binding protein (5Herwald H. Dedio J. Kellner R. Loos M. Mueller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13040-13047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Joseph K. Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E. Reid K.B.M. Kaplan A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8552-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, this protein does not bind low molecular weight kininogen, a requirement of kininogen binding to endothelial cells (7Zini J.-M. Schmaier A.H. Cines D.B. Blood. 1993; 81: 2936-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and very few copies are found on the endothelial cell membrane (8Dedio J. Mueller-Esterl W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, investigations have shown that endothelial cell urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) can also serve as a kininogen-binding site on endothelial cells (9Colman R.W. Pixley R.A. Najamunnisa S. Yan W.-Y. Wang J. Mazar A. McCrae K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1481-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, this protein is not found on the platelet surface and alone cannot account for the total number of kininogen-binding sites that number 10 million versus 0.25 million for uPAR (10Barnathan E.S. Kuo A. Rosenfeld L. Kariko K. Leski M. Robbiati F. Nolli M.L. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2865-2872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies from our own laboratory have identified that cytokeratin 1 (CK1) is a kininogen-binding protein, and CK1 is found on the surface of endothelial cells (11Hasan A.A.K. Zisman T. Schmaier A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3615-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The present studies map the HK binding region on CK1 and show that peptides of the kininogen-binding site on CK1 block PK activation on HUVEC. These data indicate that CK1 is a component of the kininogen multiprotein receptor which participates in PK activation. A biotinylation kit and ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase dihydrochloride (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride) were supplied by Pierce. Prestained and low molecular weight standards, nitrocellulose, and polyacrylamide were purchased from Bio-Rad. Purified human cytokeratin was obtained from DAKO Corp., Carpintera, CA. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), endothelial cell growth medium, and trypsin-neutralizing buffer were purchased from Clonetics, San Diego, CA. Trypsin-EDTA was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. GST gene fusion system was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Single chain high molecular weight kininogen (HK) with a specific activity of 13 units/mg in 4 mm sodium acetate-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 5.3, was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc., South Bend, IN. HK was biotinylated according to the procedure of Pierce (see Ref.12Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 mg of HK was dialyzed against 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was added to HK to give 12-fold molar excess of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to HK. After incubation for 2 h in ice, the sample was then loaded onto 10 ml of Econo-PacI0 DG column (Bio-Rad). Biotinylated HK (biotin-HK) was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 7.0 for HK and a protein assay (Bio-Rad). Biotin-HK had a specific activity of 17 units/mg. Low molecular weight kininogen (LK) was prepared as previously reported (7Zini J.-M. Schmaier A.H. Cines D.B. Blood. 1993; 81: 2936-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prekallikrein (PK) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN. Peptides corresponding to specific amino acid sequences of CK1 were prepared (13Johnson L. Idler W.W. Zhou X.-M.

Peptides G143 PVCSPGGIQEVTIN157 (GPV15), P148GGIQEVTINQSLLQ162 (PGG15), and E153VTINQSLLQPLNVE166 (EVT14) were synthesized at the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility of the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). Additional peptides made at the University of Michigan were HVLDHGHKHKHGHGHGKHKNKGKK (HVL) and HKHGHGHGKHKNKGKKNGKH (HKH) both from domain 5 of HK, LDCNAEVYVVPWEKKIYPTVNCQPLGM (LDC) from domain 3 of kininogens, and FNQTQPERGDNNLTR (FNQ) from human coagulation factor X (12Hasan A.A.K.

The peptides were made by solid-phase synthesis using FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) moiety chemistry. All peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and characterized by amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy. In this article, each peptide from cytokeratin 1 is named using the one-letter code of the first three amino acid residues followed by the number of amino acids in the peptide unless otherwise stated. Peptide acetyl-CAEVKAQYEDIAQKSKAE-amide (CAE18) (A351–E367) was used to immunize goats for the production of antisera (anti-CAE18) at Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., Hopkinton, MA (13Johnson L. Idler W.W. Zhou X.-M. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Peptide CAE18 is seen in a few cytokeratins and is coded by exon 5 of cytokeratin 1 (13Johnson L. Idler W.W. Zhou X.-M. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Antisera produced were affinity purified on a column that immobilized its respective peptide. Monoclonal antibodies C1801 and C2931, which are mixtures of anti-cytokeratin clones, and mouse IgG were supplied by Sigma. Monoclonal antibody C1801 had antibodies against cytokeratins 1, 5, 6, and 8. Monoclonal antibody C2931 had antibodies against cytokeratins 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18. Proteins were separated on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 8 mA overnight. The electroblots then were incubated in blocking buffer (5% (wt/v) dry milk with 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h (14Schmaier A.H. Farber A. Schein R. Sprung C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 112: 182-192PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies C1801 or anti-CAE18 antibody at 1 μg/ml for 2 h. After washing, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat antibody, respectively (1:2,000), for 2 h. The specific reactivity of antibodies with the electroblotted proteins were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All steps were carried out at room temperature. Five oligonucleotide primers were prepared to include the coding sequences of exons 1–5, 1–7, or 3–5 of human CK1 (13Johnson L. Idler W.W. Zhou X.-M. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Each sense primer contained a 5′-encoding sequence, anEcoRI restriction enzyme site, and a translation initiation sequence (15Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). Each antisense primer had a SalI restriction site at the 3′ end. The two sense primers were 5′-G10TCACTATCAACCAGAGCCTT30-3′ from exon 1 and 5′-T355ATGAGGATGAAATCAACAAGCGG378-3′ from exon 3. The antisense primers were 5′-TCACTCAGCTTTGCTCTTCTGGGC-3′ from base pairs 631–651 of exon 5 and 5′-TCACTCCAGATCCAGGGCCAGCTT-3′ from base pairs 961–981 of exon 7. The sequence numbers of the previous nucleotides are from Steinert et al. (16Steinert P.M. Perry D.A.D. Idler W.W. Johnson L.D. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7142-7149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nested polymerase chain reaction was employed to isolate CK1 cDNA from either a keratinocyte or human umbilical vein endothelial λgt11 expression library (17Ginsburg D. Handin R.I. Bonthron D.T. Donlon T.A. Bruns G.A.P. Latt S.A. Orkin S.H. Science. 1985; 228: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The keratinocyte and endothelial cell cDNA libraries were generously provided by Drs. J. T. Elder and David Ginsburg, respectively, of the University of Michigan. By using 20 pmol of commercially available sense and antisense primers for λgt11 (Promega, Madison, WI), polymerase chain reaction on the cDNA expression libraries were performed in a 100-μl reaction mixture according to the standard methods (18Garson J.A. Tedder R.S. Briggs M. Tuke P. Glazebrook J.A. Trute A. Parker D. Barbara J.A.J. Contreras M. Aloysius S. Lancet. 1990; 335: 419-422Abstract PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reaction products (10 μl) were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Ten-μl aliquots of the polymerase chain reaction products then were used as templates for the second reaction. Fifty picomoles of primer pairs for human CK1, as shown above, were selected. The reactions were incubated at 94 °C for 2 min and then were amplified for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min with a final extension time for 15 min at 72 °C on Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler 480. The cDNAs of the exons of interest from either the keratinocyte or endothelial cell cDNA library were gel-purified from 1% agarose gels. The fidelity of the cDNAs for the desired fragments of human CK 1 were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The purified cDNA were cloned into the EcoRI-SalI restriction sites of vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transformed into INVαF′-competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All positive colonies were screened and analyzed by restriction digest using EcoRI and SalI. Additional digestion byBglI was performed to confirm the proper orientation of the insert. Recombinant CK1 proteins were produced in Escherichia coli from pGEX-5X-1 plasmid by the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, CK1 fusion proteins expression were induced by adding 0.6 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactoside to the E. colitransformed with the pGEX-5X-1 recombinants. Induced cultures were incubated for an additional 4 h at 25–30 °C to express GST-CK1 fusion proteins. The bacteria were harvested and lysed by sonicating for 4 cycles (30 s each) at 4 °C. Solubilization of the fusion proteins was performed by 1% Triton X-100, and it was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove the insoluble material and applied directly to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The GST-CK1 fusion proteins were washed and eluted from the column by the manufacturer's elution buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The isolated GST-CK1 fusion proteins were digested with 1% (w/w) bovine factor Xa for 16 h at room temperature. The cleaved GST fusion protein was then re-applied to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column, and the recombinant CK1 proteins were recovered in the fractions not binding to the column, whereas the GST mostly remained bound. The recombinant proteins were confirmed to be CK1 by immunoblotting with antibodies C1801 and anti-CAE18. The isolated recombinant CK1s (rCK1) were named according to the size of the protein as determined by reduced SDS-PAGE. HUVEC were obtained and cultured according to the recommendations of Clonetics Corp. Cells between the 1st and 5th passage were subcultured onto fibronectin-treated, 96-well plates 24 h prior to the start of the experiment as previously reported (19Schmaier A.H. Kuo A. Lundberg D. Murray S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16327-16333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Cell number were determined by counting on a hemocytometer. Recombinant CK128, rCK131, and Deleted1–6rCK131 at 1 μg/well were incubated in microtiter plate cuvette wells in 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 37 °C. After blocking the wells with 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed and then incubated with biotin-HK (7 nm) in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in the absence (−Zn2+) or presence (+Zn2+) of 50 μm Zn2+ or a 50-fold molar excess of HK (HK) in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+ for up to 2 h at 37 °C. The relative binding of biotin-HK binding to the cytokeratins was determined using ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Pierce), as described previously (4Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound biotin-HK was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a microplate auto reader EL 311 (Bio-Tek Instrument, Winooski, VT). Total biotin-HK binding to each recombinant protein in the presence or absence of 50 μm Zn2+ was determined and compared with the level of binding seen in the presence of zinc ion and a 50-fold molar excess of HK. Recombinant CK128 was coupled to microtiter plates in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 37 °C. After blocking the wells with 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed and then incubated with biotin-HK (7 nm) in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 and 50 μm Zn2+ in the absence or presence of a 50-fold molar excess of HK or various concentrations of peptides (HVL, HKH, LDC, and FNQ) or low molecular weight kininogen (LK) for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation the level of specific biotin-HK binding to the rCK128 was determined as described above by subtracting nonspecific binding, i.e. the level of binding seen in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of HK, from that determined in the presence of each of the peptides. Confluent monolayers of HUVEC were washed three times with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 14.7 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm dextrose, and 3.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.35) (4Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μmZn2+. Biotin-HK (7 nm) in the same buffer were added to the monolayers for 60 min at 37 °C in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of HK, various rCK1s, or synthetic peptides of the protein portion of CK1. The relative amount of biotin-HK bound to the cells was determined as described above. Specific biotin-HK binding was determined after nonspecific binding (i.e. binding in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess HK) was subtracted from that seen with biotin-HK alone or in the presence of the various protein and peptide inhibitors. Additional investigations were performed to determine if peptides to a HK binding region on CK1 blocked biotin-HK binding to native CK1. Human purified cytokeratin from Dako (1 μg/well) was incubated in microtiter plate wells in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 37 °C. After blocking the wells with 0.2% BSA, biotin-HK (7 nm) in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.35, containing containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μmZn2+ was incubated up to 2 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of a 50-fold molar excess of HK or various overlapping synthetic peptides to CK1. The amount of biotin-HK bound was demonstrated as described above for biotin-HK bound to rCK1 or endothelial cells. Further experiments were performed to determine if biotin-GPV20 directly binds to HK linked to microtiter plates. HK (1 μg/ml) was incubated in microtiter plate wells in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 37 °C. After blocking the wells with 0.2% BSA, increasing concentrations of biotin-GPV20 in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.35, containing containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μmZn2+ was incubated up to 2 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 50-fold molar excess of HK or peptide GPV15. The amount of biotin-HK bound was demonstrated as described above for biotin-HK bound to endothelial cells. Investigations were performed to determine if competing HK binding to endothelial cells by peptides to its binding domain on cytokeratin 1 could influence PK activation. Confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were incubated with 20 nmHK in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 50 μmZn2+ (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 100 or 500 μm GYG20, GPV15, or PGG15 for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed, and PK (20 nm) was added for an additional hour of incubation. At the conclusion of the incubation, the cells were washed and 0.4 mmH-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S2302) (Dia-Pharm, Franklin, OH) was added in the same buffer and hydrolysis proceeded for 1 h at 37 °C. Additional experiments were performed to determine if increasing concentrations of peptide PGG15 (0.003–500 μm) inhibited biotin-HK binding (7 nm) and PK activation in a concentration-dependent fashion. In order to map the domains on CK1 which HK binds, recombinant CK1s were expressed inE. coli by a GST gene fusion system (Figs.1 and 2). Since both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal globular end domains of CK1 are highly enriched with glycine, and glycine is toxic to cells, we designed recombinant proteins that avoided these regions (13Johnson L. Idler W.W. Zhou X.-M. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Steinert P.M. Perry D.A.D. Idler W.W. Johnson L.D. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7142-7149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three recombinant proteins were produced. Recombinant CK114was protein-coded by exons 3–5; rCK128 was protein partially coded by exon 1 and all of exons 2–5; and rCK131was protein partially coded by exons 1 and 7 and all of exons 2–6 (Fig. 1). A fourth recombinant protein (Deleted1–6rCK131) was identical in size and immunoreactivity to rCK131 but was missing the first 6 amino acids of its amino terminus (data not shown). The name of each recombinant protein is based upon its expected size or the migration of the isolated fragment on 12% SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The GST-CK1 fusion proteins migrated on 12% SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 40- (rCK114), 55- (rCK128), and 58-kDa (rCK131) protein bands when stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2, top panel). Since GST migrated with the approximate molecular mass of 26–31 kDa, small amounts of GST alone comigrated with isolated rCK128 and rCK131. Therefore we examined the isolated rCK1s by immunoblot for molecular mass. Using monoclonal antibody C1801 on immunoblot, detectable major bands of the rCK1s were seen at 14, 28, and 31 kDa, respectively, corresponding to the predicted size of the recombinant CK1 proteins (Fig. 2,middle panel). Using a monoclonal antibody that is not directed to CK1 (C2931), no protein bands were seen (data not shown). Furthermore, using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody reared to a peptide from exon 5 of CK1 (anti-CAE18), the isolated rCK114, rCK128, and rCK131 were also detected by immunoblot at the predicted size (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The higher bands seen on the immunoblots with rCK128 and rCK131 with both antibodies probably represented residual intact fusion protein detected by immunoblot. These results indicated that the recombinant proteins were recognized by antibodies that identify cytokeratin 1.Figure 2Characterization of recombinant CK1. Top panel, SDS-PAGE. Two to 3 μg of three glutathione transferase (GST) recombinant cytokeratin 1 (rCK1) fusion proteins (GST-rCK114, GST-rCK128, and GST-rCK131) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE after reduction with 2% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling. Isolated rCK1s (rCK114, rCK128, and rCK131) separated from the GST fusion protein also were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose paper. An immunoblot was performed with monoclonal antibody C1801 (middle panel, C 1801 Ab) and anti-CAE18 (bottom panel, Anti-CAE18) as described under the “Experimental Procedures.” The topfigure is a photograph of a SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue R250, and the middle and bottom figures are photographs of autoradiograms of chemiluminescence.

Zisman T. Schmaier A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3615-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Recombinant CK1 (rCK131, rCK128, and Deleted1–6rCK131) were coupled to microtiter plates followed by treatment with biotin-HK (Fig. 3). Incubation of biotin-HK with the microtiter plates coated with the rCK131and rCK128, but notDeleted1–6rCK131, resulted in increased specific biotin-HK binding over time only in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 3). These data indicated that the HK specifically bound directly to rCK131 and rCK128 but notDeleted1-6rCK131, and the binding was Zn2+-dependent. These data suggested that the six amino acids at the amino terminus of rCK131 and rCK128, but notDeleted1–6rCK131, participated in HK binding to CK1 (Table I).Table IThe variable influence of overlapping amino acid sequences of recombinant proteins and peptides coded by exon 1 of CK1 on biotin-HK binding to endothelial cellsSequenceaThe numbering of the amino acid sequences shown in this table is based upon the work of Johnson et al.

The expression of viral proteins that counter immune responses of the host is well documented. Viral factors have been identified that can potentially inhibit or modify the antiviral effects of antibodies, complement proteins, cytokines, and cytotoxic T cells (1Gooding L.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 5-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Characterization of viral proteins that interact with specific components of the immune system is likely to provide insights into immune mechanisms involved in host-virus interactions and into the molecular basis of viral persistence in the presence of a functional immune system. Herpesviruses, in particular, have evolved multiple mechanisms for interfering with humoral as well as cell-mediated immune responses (reviewed in Refs. 2Banks T.A. Rouse B.T. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and 3Ploegh H. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).

Fishman N.O. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Friedman H.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. 1992; 179: 111-120PubMed Google Scholar). HSV-1 virions, as well as cells infected with HSV-1, bind to immunoglobulins of the IgG subclass via the Fc region (5Westmoreland D. Watkins J.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1974; 24: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein gE of HSV-1 was identified as the IgG-binding polypeptide of HSV-1 (6Baucke R.B. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 779-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Para M.F. Baucke R.B. Spear P. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 512-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that gE associates with a second viral glycoprotein, gI (8Johnson D.C. Feenstra V. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Johnson D.C. Frame M. Ligas M.W. Cross A.M. Stow N.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that cells transfected with genes encoding both gE and gI have enhanced IgG binding activity compared with cells transfected with gE alone (10Bell S. Cranage M. Borysiewicz L. Minson T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2181-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dubin G. Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hanke T. Graham F.L. Lulitanond V. Johnson D.C. Virology. 1990; 177: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both gE and gI are type I transmembrane proteins, with an N-terminal extracellular portion, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Homologous glycoproteins encoded by other α-herpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV) (13Favoreel H.W. Nauwynck H.J. Van Oostveldt P. Mettenleiter T.C. Pensaert M.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8254-8261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and varicella zoster virus (14Litwin V. Jackson W. Grose C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3643-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to possess species-specific FcR activity. HSV-1-infected cells acquire low levels of FcR activity immediately upon exposure to virus (in the absence of viral gene expression), presumably by the transfer of virion gE-gI to the cell surface during viral entry (7Para M.F. Baucke R.B. Spear P. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 512-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV FcR may thus be particularly significant for protection of virally infected cells from early immune destruction (2Banks T.A. Rouse B.T. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that passively transferred anti-HSV IgG greatly reduced viral titers and disease severity in mice infected with a mutant HSV-1 that lacked FcR activity. By contrast, anti-HSV IgG was ineffective in reducing viral titers and disease severity in mice infected with wild type virus with intact FcR activity (15Nagashunmugam T. Lubinski J. Wang L. Goldstein L.T. Weeks B.S. Sundaresan P. Kang E.H. Dubin G. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the HSV-1 FcR activity facilitates evasion of antibody-mediated viral clearance in vivo. Several means of evading antibody-mediated immune responses could arise from the Fc binding function of gE-gI (16Lehner T. Wilton J.M.A. Shillitoe E.J. Lancet. 1975; ii: 60-62Abstract Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Costa J.C. Rabson A.S. Lancet. 1975; i: 77-78Abstract Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Adler R. Glorioso J.C. Cossman J. Levine M. Infect. Immun. 1978; 21: 442-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of nonimmune IgG by gE-gI present on HSV-1 virions can inhibit virus neutralization by anti-viral antibodies (19Dowler K.W. Veltri R.W. J. Med. Virol. 1984; 13: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Engagement of the Fc portion of anti-HSV antibodies can protect virally infected cells from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (20Dubin G. Socolof E. Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as complement-mediated lysis (21Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4479-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of ADCC has been suggested to occur by a phenomenon called antibody bipolar bridging (21Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4479-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a mechanism whereby antibodies bound via their Fab ends to HSV-1 glycoproteins on surface membranes of infected cells would simultaneously interact with the viral Fc receptors of the same infected cell. By engaging the Fc domain, the HSV-1 FcR could interfere with recognition by FcγRs on immune effector cells. Antibody bipolar bridging has also been suggested to facilitate antiviral antibody-induced patching, capping, and extrusion of viral glycoproteins from the surface of cells infected with PRV (13Favoreel H.W. Nauwynck H.J. Van Oostveldt P. Mettenleiter T.C. Pensaert M.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8254-8261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-induced shedding of viral glycoproteins may represent a strategy for rendering virally infected cells refractory to antiviral antibodies and for inhibiting the presentation of viral antigens via class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. A second function attributed to gE-gI is that of facilitating cell-to-cell spread of virus. Recent studies suggest that gE and gI are required for transneuronal transport of PRV from the retina to the visual centers of rats (22Whealy M.E. Card J.P. Robbins A.K. Dubin J.R. Rziha H.-J. Enquist L.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3786-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for cell-to-cell spread of PRV, and for full virulence of PRV (23Tirabassi R.S. Townley R.A. Eldridge M.G. Enquist L.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6455-6464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies with mutant HSV-1 virions indicate that gE and gI of HSV-1 facilitate cell-to-cell spread of virus in vivo and viral spread across junctions of cultured cells (24Dingwell K.S. Brunetti C.R. Hendricks R.L. Tang Q. Tang M. Rainbow A.J. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 834-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dingwell K.S. Doering L.C. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7087-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Balan P. Davis-Poynter N. Bell S. Atkinson H. Browne H. Minson T. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the cell-to-cell spread-promoting functions of gE-gI are unrelated to the Fc binding activity and that the HSV-1-encoded gE-gI glycoproteins and the analogous proteins of other α-herpesviruses may interact with other ligands, enabling viral transport across cells (24Dingwell K.S. Brunetti C.R. Hendricks R.L. Tang Q. Tang M. Rainbow A.J. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 834-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dingwell K.S. Doering L.C. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7087-7098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such ligands remain to be identified. To better understand the mechanisms by which IgG binding by gE-gI facilitates immune evasion, we initiated a molecular characterization of IgG binding by gE-gI. We expressed soluble forms of gE and gI and showed that the glycoproteins assemble into a stable heterodimer. The soluble receptor heterodimer binds to human IgG (hIgG) with relatively high affinity and can be purified to homogeneity using an hIgG-based affinity matrix. We determined a 1:1 binding stoichiometry for the gE-gI·IgG complex, and also determined that a histidine residue at the CH2-CH3 domain interface is a critical determinant of IgG binding specificity. The implications of the gE-gI binding site on IgG and the gE-gI·IgG complex stoichiometry are discussed. Molecular cloning manipulations were performed by standard protocols (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR was used to insert a 5′ XhoI site, a 3′NotI site, and a stop codon after the codon corresponding to amino acid 399 of the gE gene and amino acid 246 of the gI gene (the HindIII fragment containing the gE gene and the BamHI fragment containing the gI gene of HSV strain KOS was kindly provided by H. Ghiasi, Cedar Sinai Medical Center). Our numbering scheme starts with the first residue of the mature protein, which is designated residue 1, and all other residues are numbered sequentially (see “N-Terminal Sequencing and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Purified gE-gI”). The gE PCR product was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), and the gI PCR product was cloned into pBSIISK+ (Stratagene). Both sequences were verified. The modified gE and gI genes were excised using XhoI and NotI enzymes and individually subcloned into the uniqueXhoI and NotI sites of separate PBJ5-GS expression vectors (28Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PBJ5-GS carries the glutamine synthetase gene as a selectable marker and as a means of gene amplification in the presence of the drug methionine sulfoximine, a system developed by Celltech (29Bebbington C.R. Hentschel C.C.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 163-188Google Scholar). Expression vectors carrying gE, gI, or both gE and gI were transfected into CHO cells using a Lipofectin procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells resistant to 100 μm methionine sulfoximine were selected according to the protocol established by Celltech, modification of which has been previously described (28Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells were maintained in glutamine-free α-minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 100 μm methionine sulfoximine (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells secreting gE, gI, or both gE and gI were identified by immunoprecipitation of supernatants of cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (see below) by using either an antibody against gE (1108 (Goodwin Institute) or Fd172 (30Metcalf J.F. Chatterjee S. Koga J. Whitley R.J. Intervirology. 1988; 29: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Subbu Chatterjee) or an antibody against gI (Fd69 (31Longnecker R. Chatterjee S. Whitley R.J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Subbu Chatterjee) Clones were considered positive if immunoprecipitation yielded a protein of approximately 56 kDa corresponding to gE or a protein of approximately 43.5 kDa corresponding to gI. The identity of each protein was verified using N-terminal sequencing (see below). gE-, gI-, and gE-gI-transfected CHO cell lines derived from colonies were expanded into 12-well trays, grown to confluence, and incubated for 5 h in 1.0 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free medium (Life Technologies) plus 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum including 5 μCi of a [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (ICN) mixture. Supernatants were clarified by a 5-min spin in a microcentrifuge, and either anti-gE or anti-gI antibodies were added. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by standard methods (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310-311Google Scholar) with protein G-bearing Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) running buffer and loaded onto 15% polyacrylamide gels, which were fixed, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The image was then developed with a Molecular Dynamics 425E PhosphorImager scanner. PCR was used to insert a 5′ XhoI site and a 3′ NotI site into the genes encoding gE and gI. The PCR products were sequenced and subsequently individually subcloned into the unique XhoI and NotI sites of separate PBJ5-GS expression vectors. The two constructs were co-transfected into CHO cells, and cells resistant to 100 μm methionine sulfoximine were selected. Cells expressing both gE and gI were sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with FITC-labeled hIgG. Individual clones from the sort were amplified and subsequently shown to express both gE and gI by FACS analysis with 1108 or Fd69 as the primary antibodies and a goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. Sorting and analysis were performed on a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer. gE-gI-secreting CHO cell lines were grown to confluence in 50 10-cm plates and introduced into a hollow bioreactor device (Cell Pharm I; Unisyn Fibertec, San Diego, CA) in serum-free medium, and supernatants were collected daily. Soluble gE-gI heterodimers were purified from supernatants on either a human Fc or hIgG affinity column. The human Fc column was prepared by coupling 20 mg of human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) to cyanogen bromide-treated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at approximately 10 mg of protein/ml of resin according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The hIgG column was prepared similarly using 70 mg of hIgG (Sigma). Supernatants were passed over the affinity column, which was then washed with 50 column volumes of a solution consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% NaN3, and 1 mm EDTA. Bound gE-gI was eluted from the column with 50 mm diethylamine (pH 11.5) into tubes containing 1.0m Tris (pH 7.4). gE-gI heterodimers were further purified using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) filtration column. Approximately 10 mg of gE-gI heterodimers were recovered per liter of transfected cell supernatants. N-terminal sequencing was performed on 2.5 μg of purified, soluble gE-gI in a phosphate buffer dried onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and inserted into an Applied Biosystems model 476A sequencer reaction cartridge. Two sequences were isolated from the gE-gI sample: the sequence GTPKTSWRR, corresponding to the first 9 amino acids of mature gE (33McGeoch D.J. Dolan A. Donald S. Brauer D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and the sequence LVVRGPTVS, corresponding to the first 9 amino acids of mature gI (33McGeoch D.J. Dolan A. Donald S. Brauer D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of gE and that of gI were determined by matrix-assisted, laser desorption, time-of-flight mass spectrometry with a PerSeptive biosystems (Farmington, MA) ELITE mass spectrometer. An AVIV 62A DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder was used for CD measurements. Wavelength scans and thermal denaturation curves were obtained from samples containing 10 μm protein in 5 mm phosphate at pH 7 by using a 0.1-mm path length cell for wavelength scans and a 1-mm path length cell for thermal denaturation measurements. The heat-induced unfolding of gE-gI was monitored by recording the CD signal at 223 nm, while the sample temperature was raised from 25 to 80 °C at a rate of approximately 0.7 °C/min. The transition midpoint (Tm) for unfolding was determined by taking the maximum of a plot of dθ/dT versus T (where θ is ellipticity) after averaging the data with a moving window of 5 points. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the following extinction coefficients: gE-gI, 88816 m−1cm−1; hIgG, 202,500 m−1cm−1. The extinction coefficient for the gE-gI heterodimer was calculated from the amino acid sequences as described (34Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar), and the extinction coefficient for hIgG is known (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310-311Google Scholar).A280 measurements for a fixed amount of each protein were then compared in 6 m guanidine HCl and aqueous solutions, and the extinction coefficients were adjusted as necessary. For determining the gE-gI·hIgG stoichiometry, various molar ratios from 1:3 (300 pmol of gE-gI:900 pmol of hIgG) to 3:1 (900 pmol of gE-gI:300 pmol of hIgG) of gE-gI and hIgG were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% NaN3 in a total volume of 100 μl. Samples were injected onto a Superose 6B FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min. The composition of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium was performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using data analysis software provided by the manufacturer. Experiments were performed using 0.6 mg/ml gE-gI at both 4 and 20 °C at a rotor speed of 10,000 rpm, with equilibrium times of at least 36 h. Molecular masses were determined by nonlinear least square fit of the equilibrium gradient, absorbanceversus radius (Fig. 3), using the model of single ideal species, and a partial specific volume, 0.69, calculated from the amino acid composition and the carbohydrate content (35Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The equilibrium column chromatography method of Hummel and Dreyer (36Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) was used to observe the interaction between gE-gI and hIgG. A Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 gel filtration column of 2.4 ml was connected to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech μ Precision pump system. Absorbance of the eluant was monitored at 280 nm with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech μ Peak monitor. The column was equilibrated with five different concentrations of purified hIgG (Sigma): 250 nm, 500 nm, 1 μm, 2.5 μm, and 5 μm each in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. At each concentration, four 20-μl injections in the appropriate column equilibration buffer (including the relevant concentration of hIgG) were performed. These four injections included gE-gI at a concentration equal to that of the IgG in the column buffer plus no additional hIgG or hIgG at a concentration equal to 1, 2, or 3 times that of the IgG concentration contained in the column buffer. Binding experiments were done at 20 °C with a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Biosensor studies were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument. Purified gE-gI was diluted in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.1, for amine-based coupling to a Biacore chip. Immobilization was accomplished by initial activation of the sensor chip with 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. The N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester was then reacted with gE-gI using the manual injection mode to allow for better control of immobilization levels. Typically, an immobilization level of 200–300 response units was used for kinetic analyses described in Table I. The remaining unreacted ester groups were inactivated by 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). Different concentrations of the chimeric IgG molecules were injected over the immobilized gE-gI surface, as well as a control protein surface (murine IgG). A citrate buffer, pH 3.5, was used for regeneration of the surface between sequential injections. Sensorgrams obtained for IgG binding to the control surface were subtracted from those obtained for IgG binding to the gE-gI surface. The BIAevaluation version 3.0 software package was used for kinetic analysis. Kinetic constants were derived by simultaneous fitting to the association and dissociation phases of the subtracted sensorgrams and global fitting to all curves in a working set (Fig. 5). A working set consisted of injections of four or five different concentrations of a hIgG construct over a surface containing immobilized gE-gI. S.D. values are reported from experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate on different sensor chips (Table I). In all cases, a 1:1 binding model was used for curve fitting.Table IBinding of hIgG constructs to gE-gI immobilized on a Biacore chipka × 10−4kd × 103KDMs−1s−1nmhIgG11.87 ± 0.515.09 ± 0.77282 ± 36hIgG21.96 ± 0.516.03 ± 0.08327 ± 80hIgG3hIgG41.75 ± 0.213.64 ± 0.44199 ± 35hIgG3R435H1.55 ± 0.4412.31 ± 4.09947 ± 533hIgG4H435R3–4-3–33–3-4–42.02 ± 0.354.66 ± 0.36240 ± 604–3-4–41.62 ± 432.94 ± 2.04231 ± 188Kinetic constants were derived from sensorgram data using simultaneous fitting to the association and dissociation curves and global fitting to all curves in a working set.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants were derived from sensorgram data using simultaneous fitting to the association and dissociation curves and global fitting to all curves in a working set. Kinetic analysis was performed using the BIAevaluation version 3.0 package. The equilibrium constants,KD, were determined from the ratios of the kinetic constants. For hIgG3, hIgG4H435R, and 3–4-3–3, signals of less than 4 RU were observed at protein concentrations of 3.0 μm. The expression of chimeric hIgG molecules was described previously (37Artandi S.E. Canfield S.M. Tao M. Calame K.L. Morrison S.L. Bonagura V.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 603-610PubMed Google Scholar,38Bonagura V.R. Artandi S.E. Agostino N. Tao M. Morrison S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These molecules are composed of a murine anti-dansyl VH domain fused to the constant domains (CH1 through CH3) of hIgG4. An expression vector containing cDNA encoding the hybrid chain was co-transfected into a non-Ig-producing mouse myeloma line along with an expression vector containing cDNA encoding a chimeric K light chain (composed of a murine anti-dansyl VK region fused to the human CK region). Site-directed mutations were introduced into the chimeric heavy chain gene to make the hIgG4H435R mutant and the hIgG3R435H mutant. The hIgG3-hIgG4 chimeras were generated by exon shuffling as described previously (38Bonagura V.R. Artandi S.E. Agostino N. Tao M. Morrison S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Chimeric hIgG4 was iodinated to a specific activity of 16.1 μCi/μg using the chloramine-T method. CHO cell lines expressing full-length gE and gI were grown to confluence in tissue culture plates. Cells were detached by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA for 20–30 min and collected in binding buffer at pH 7.0 (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES, 0.25% bovine serum albumin). The cells were pelleted, washed once with binding buffer (pH 7.0), and resuspended in binding buffer (pH 7.0). Cells (1 × 106) were mixed in duplicate or triplicate assays with labeled hIgG4, different concentrations of unlabeled hIgG4, and binding buffer (pH 7.0) to a total volume of 0.5 ml. The samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After completion of the incubations, cells were pelleted for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, the supernatants were aspirated, and 1.0 ml of cold binding buffer was added. After removal of the supernatants by aspiration, the tubes were placed in vials, and the levels of radioactivity were determined using a Beckman Gamma 5500 counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by a similar treatment of wild type CHO cells. The binding data were analyzed using Scatchard plots. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the average of the two most similar readings was used to compute the concentration of bound IgG. We constructed soluble versions of both gE and gI by truncating each of the genes prior to their predicted transmembrane regions (following the codons for amino acid 399 of mature gE and amino acid 246 of mature gI). The modified genes were co-transfected into CHO cells. Transfected cells were screened by immunoprecipitating supernatants from metabolically labeled cells with antibodies against either gE or gI (Fig. 1A). SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitated protein from gE-gI positive clones revealed two bands with apparent molecular masses of 56 and 43.5 kDa using either the anti-gE or anti-gI antibody. The calculated molecular mass of truncated gE is 42 kDa, and that of gI is 26 kDa; however, both proteins are glycosylated (two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the sequence of gE and three potential sites in the sequence of gI) and would be expected to migrate with a higher apparent molecular mass. HSV-1-infected cells have previously been shown to encode proteins that bind hIgG but not rodent IgG (39Johansson P.J. Myhre E.B. Blomberg J. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 489-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the binding characteristics of soluble gE, gI, and the gE-gI heterodimer, metabolically labeled supernatants from gE-, gI-, or gE-gI-secreting cells were incubated with Sepharose-immobilized hIgG or rat IgG. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that while none of the proteins bind rat IgG, the gE-gI complex efficiently bound to the hIgG matrix. gE alone bound only weakly to the human IgG"
https://openalex.org/W2037871279,"A culture system was developed to analyze the relationship between proteoglycans and growth factors during corneal injury. Specifically, the effects of transforming growth factor β-1 (TGF-β1) and fetal calf serum on proteoglycan synthesis in corneal fibroblasts were examined. Glycosaminoglycan synthesis and sulfation were determined using selective polysaccharidases. Proteoglycan core proteins were analyzed using gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Cells cultured in 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum exhibited decreased synthesis of more highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate compared with cells cultured in 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The amount and sulfation of the glycosaminoglycans was not significantly influenced by TGF-β1. The major proteoglycan species secreted into the media were decorin and perlecan. Decorin was glycanated with chondroitin sulfate. Perlecan was linked to either chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, or both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. Decorin synthesis was reduced by either TGF-β1 or serum. At early time points, both TGF-β1 and serum induced substantial increases in perlecan bearing chondroitin sulfate and/or heparan sulfate chains. In contrast, after extended periods in culture, the amount of perlecan bearing heparan sulfate chains was unaffected by TGF-β1 and decreased by serum. The levels of perlecan bearing chondroitin sulfate chains were elevated with TGF-β1 treatment and were decreased with serum. Because both decorin and perlecan bind growth factors and are proposed to modulate their activity, changes in the expression of either of these proteoglycans could substantially affect the cellular response to injury.

The matrix is primarily composed of collagen fibrils stacked in orderly lamellae surrounded by proteoglycans. The organization of proteoglycans and collagen fibrils in the stroma may be responsible for the optical and structural properties of the tissue (1Trinkaus-Randall V. Lanza R.P. Langer R. Chick W.L. Principles of Tissue Engineering. Academic Press, Inc, San Diego, CA1997: 386-388Google Scholar). The corneal stroma contains two major classes of proteoglycans, one possessing keratan sulfate side chains and the other possessing chondroitin/dermatan sulfate side chains (2Axelsson I. Heinegard D.

The gene for the corneal chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan protein core has been cloned from chick corneas and identified as decorin (10Li W. Vergnes J.-P. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of decorin, lumican, and keratocan identify them as members of a group of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (5Funderburgh J.L. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

The structural and biochemical properties of ECM molecules in the corneal stroma are altered upon injury. Corneal wounds contain collagen fibrils with abnormally large diameter and irregular interspacing (11Schwarz W. Keyserling D.G. Virchows Arch. 1969; 347: 115-128Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar,12Cintron C. Hassinger L.C. Kublin C.L. Cannon D.J. J. Ultrastruct. Tissue Res. 1978; 65: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Disruption of the fibrillar organization of collagen fibrils in corneal wounds is thought to be attributed, in part, to alterations in the proportion and chemical characteristics of specific proteoglycans. Injured corneas contain unusually large chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans possessing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains with higher than normal sulfation and increased amounts of iduronic acid (13Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate (KS) chains in corneal scars have increased size and lower sulfation (14Funderburgh J.L. Cintron C. Covington H.I. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1988; 29: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar, 15Funderburgh J.L. Chandler J.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1989; 30: 435-442PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate to keratan sulfate has been shown to increase after wounding, and heparan sulfate (HS) has been detected in corneal scars (13Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Brown C.T. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell.

Interestingly, both transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and basic fibroblast growth factor are detected transiently in corneal wounds coincident with the expression of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (16Brown C.T. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Trinkaus-Randall V. Nugent M.A. J. Controlled Release. 1998; 53: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TGF-β has been implicated as a regulatory agent in numerous cellular and physiological processes, including proteoglycan expression (19O'Kane S. Ferguson M.W.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This influence appears to be at the level of core protein synthesis and GAG chain elongation (20Bassols A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3039-3045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β has been detected in corneal wounds and in corneal fibroblast cultures, suggesting that it plays a role in regulating the synthesis of stromal ECM components (16Brown C.T. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi K. Frangieh G. Wolf G. Kenyon K.R. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Although TGF-β has been detected in vivo and in vitro, the relationship between TGF-β and proteoglycan expression by corneal fibroblasts has not been fully elucidated. Cultured corneal fibroblasts synthesize proteoglycans remarkably similar to those in wounded corneas. Early reports indicated cultures of rabbit corneal fibroblasts produce mainly chondroitin sulfate (CS) and HS, with only low levels of KS (23Yue B.Y.J.T. Baum J.L. Silbert J.E. Biochem. J. 1976; 158: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Conrad G.W. Hamilton C. Haynes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6861-6870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dahl I.-M.S.

(27Schrecengost P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported reduced levels of a keratan sulfate proteoglycan containing truncated unsulfated keratan chains in chick corneal fibroblasts. Funderburgh et al. (28Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that bovine corneal fibroblasts in culture synthesize keratan sulfate proteoglycans with shorter KS chains and lower sulfation compared with those in normal corneas. The altered properties of KS and the increase in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) and HSPG synthesis suggests that the conditions of cell culture may recapitulate some of the aspects of injury. To date, most studies of corneal proteoglycans produced in vitro have been based upon biochemical analysis of GAG chains, with only limited analysis of the protein cores. Additionally, each of these studies employed different culture techniques, making the results difficult to compare. We developed a culture system to examine the regulation of proteoglycan synthesis by corneal fibroblasts during injury. The major proteoglycans synthesized by corneal fibroblasts were characterized and identified after culture in a defined environment. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of TGF-β1 and serum on the synthesis of specific GAGs and protein cores. We found that corneal fibroblasts synthesized predominantly CS and HS, with only trace amounts of an unsulfated form of keratan. The major proteoglycan species secreted into the medium were decorin and perlecan, and proteoglycan synthesis was mediated by TGF-β1 and serum. This model will allow us to systematically examine the relationship between specific growth factors and proteoglycan expression using a defined culture system. Chondroitinase ABC (protease-free), keratanase II, chondroitin sulfate B, keratan sulfate, and the mouse monoclonal antibody 3G10 directed against unsaturated uronic acid residues arising from heparinase digestion of heparan sulfate were purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Ijamsville, MD). Endo-β-galactosidase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Heparan sulfate, heparinase I, heparinase III, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine,N-ethylmaleimide, and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG antibodies were from Sigma. Q-Sepharose came from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ultrapure urea, sodium chloride, Tween-20, Tris-HCl, bovine serum albumin, and EDTA were obtained from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). TGF-β1 was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse monoclonal antibody A7L6 directed against perlecan was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The polyclonal sheep antiserum directed against rabbit corneal decorin was a generous gift from Dr. Charles Cintron (Schepen Eye Research Institute, Boston, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody R36 that binds unsaturated uronic acid residues resulting from chondroitinase ABC treatment was a generous gift from Dr. John Couchman (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). Corneas were excised from whole rabbit eyes purchased from Pel Freeze (Rogers, AR), and the epithelium and endothelium were removed as described previously (29Trinkaus-Randall V. Capecchi J. Sammon L. Gibbons D. Leibowitz H.M. Franzblau C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1321-1326PubMed Google Scholar). The corneas were washed two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1.0 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 20 units/ml nystatin. The corneas were minced with a sterile razor blade and subsequently digested with collagenase A (1.5 mg/ml) in DMEM containing 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml nystatin for 2–3 h with agitation at 37 °C. The digests were centrifuged at 1840 × g for 10 min, and the cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml nystatin, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cell were plated in 75-mm vented tissue culture flasks, and cultures were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml nystatin, nonessential amino acids and 4% fetal calf serum. The cultures achieved confluency after 7–10 days, at which time cells were passaged 1:4 and cultured in 4% FCS for 3 days. All experiments were performed on confluent fibroblast cultures that had been passaged once. The synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans was followed by metabolically radiolabeling corneal fibroblasts with [3H]glucosamine (18 μCi/ml) and/or [35S]sulfate (36 μCi/ml). Proteoglycan core proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine (50 μCi/ml). Corneal fibroblasts in first passage were cultured until confluent (3 days) in 4% FCS. Upon confluence, corneal fibroblasts were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Radioisotopes were added immediately after the addition of TGF-β1. After the designated radiolabeling period, the medium was collected and immediately combined with two volumes of 10 m urea containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Cell monolayers were washed with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and ECM proteins were isolated by gently scraping cell monolayers in 1.0m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (5520 ×g) for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected and defined as the ECM fraction. The cell pellet was extracted with TUT (8m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.0). The extract was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected and defined as the cell fraction (30Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21256-21264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell number was determined by measuring acid phosphatase activity on a replicate set of cultures (31Yang T.T. Sinai P. Kain S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Total radiolabeled protein present in [35S]cysteine/methionine labeled samples was determined by performing trichloroacetic acid precipitation on aliquots of medium and cell fractions prior to proteoglycan purification and quantitating the radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter (27Schrecengost P.K. Blochberger T.C. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Medium, cell, or ECM fractions were mixed with 1.0 ml of a 70% Q-Sepharose suspension and rocked for 45 min. The slurries were poured into 5.0-ml disposable minicolumns (Pierce), and the unbound fractions were discarded. The columns were washed with 25 column volumes of TUE (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) and subsequently washed with 25 column volumes TUE containing 0.2m NaCl. Columns were eluted with 7 column volumes of TUE containing 1.5 m NaCl. Salt fractions were exhaustively dialyzed against Milli-Q water, using membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 25,000 (Spectropore, Laguna Hills, CA), and lyophilized. Samples were resuspended in 2 mm sodium phosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, pH 7.4. Selective polysaccharidases were used to identify and quantitate GAGs and proteoglycan core proteins. Digestion conditions were optimized for time, temperature, concentration, and pH. Enzymes were routinely tested for activity and specificity using highly purified GAG standards (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and the dimethyl methylene blue assay (32Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J . Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar). Purified proteoglycans were subjected to digestion for 3 h at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl. The pH of the digest was adjusted to the optimum for each enzyme: chondroitinase ABC (1.0 unit/ml, pH 8.0), a mixture of heparinase I and heparinase III (10 and 20 units/ml respectively, pH 7.3), and a mixture of keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase (both enzymes 0.01 unit/ml, pH 5.9). Specific GAGs were quantitated by measuring the low molecular weight digestion products released after polysaccharidase treatment. Purified GAGs co-radiolabeled with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]SO4 were treated with chondroitinase ABC, a mixture of heparinase I and heparinase III, a mixture of keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase, or control with buffer lacking enzyme. Digests were subjected to ultrafiltration (Microcon, Millipore) to separate GAG digestion products from intact proteoglycans. The radioactivity in the filtrate was determined using liquid scintillation. A 10,000 molecular weight cut-off filter was used to recover CS and KS digestion products, and a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off filter was used to recover HS digestion products. The radioactivity in the filtrate from the undigested control was subtracted from the enzyme treated samples. In experiments with a large number of samples, fractions containing [35S]SO4-GAGs were analyzed, without any prior purification. [35S]Glycosaminoglycans in medium, cell, and ECM fractions were quantitated by dot-blotting samples onto cationic nylon filters as described previously (30Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21256-21264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, filters (Zeta-probe; Bio-Rad) were prehydrated in TBS (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0). The filter was then placed into a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and washed once by drawing TBS through each well with vacuum. Samples (100 μl) were applied to each well and pulled through under vacuum and wells were washed with 0.6 ml of TUT. The filter was washed twice with TBS followed by two additional washes with Milli-Q water (Millipore, Bedford MA). The washed filter was briefly immersed in 95% ethanol, and the area of the filter containing each sample was removed and counted using liquid scintillation. Heparan sulfate and CS were determined by treating a replicate filter with nitrous acid, which selectively degrades HS chains. After sample application, washed filters were treated twice with fresh nitrous acid (0.48 m sodium nitrite combined with 3.6 macetic acid) for 90 min followed by a wash with TBS containing 0.65m NaCl. The difference between the radioactivity measured on the non-acid-treated and acid-treated filters was defined as HS. The amount of radioactivity remaining after nitrous acid treatment was defined as CS. Proteoglycan core proteins were identified and quantified using selective polysaccharidases in conjunction with SDS-PAGE and/or Western blotting. Proteoglycans radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine were digested with either chondroitinase ABC, heparinases I and III, or a mixture of chondroitinase ABC and heparinases I and III. Digests were run on 5 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and loading was normalized to total radioactive protein present in fractions prior to purification (trichloroacetic acid precipitation). Gels were either processed for autoradiography or electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (integrated separations systems) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2) and were incubated with either mouse monoclonal anti-perlecan (2 μg/ml), sheep polyclonal anti-rabbit corneal decorin (1:9000), mouse anti-HS stub (1:1000), or rabbit anti-CS stub in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were washed with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). To distinguish between chemiluminescence and radioactivity, a piece of transparent plastic was placed between the membrane and the film, which was demonstrated to block >95% of the radioactivity. After probing, the blots were treated with 10% sodium salicylate in methanol and dried. Radiolabeled proteins were detected using autoradiography. Confluent corneal fibroblasts were cultured for 96 h in either 1 or 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum with or without daily treatments with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml). Cellular viability studies were performed, and no significant differences were observed after 6 days of culture in 0, 1, or 10% FCS (data not shown). To evaluate GAG synthesis and sulfation, cells were metabolically labeled with both [35S]SO4 and [3H]glucosamine. Glycosaminoglycans in medium, cell, and ECM fractions were purified using anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. The chromatographic conditions were optimized to separate highly charged proteoglycans from weakly charged glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid (16Brown C.T. Applebaum E. Banwatt R. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specific GAGs were quantitated by selective digestion with polysaccharidases. Chondroitin sulfate was determined using chondroitinase ABC. Glycosaminoglycans susceptible to chondroitinase ABC are referred to as CS because this enzyme does not distinguish between polymers containing iduronate and glucuronate (34Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate was determined using a mixture of keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase, and HS was determined using a mixture of heparinases I and III. Sulfation was defined as the ratio of polysaccharidase-sensitive [35S]SO4 to polysaccharidase-sensitive [3H]glucosamine.

Approximately 75–85% of the [3H]GAGs synthesized during the 96-h incubation period were secreted into the medium with the remaining present in the cell (16–21%) and ECM (2–3%) fractions. Compositional analysis revealed that the majority of the [3H]GAGs synthesized by corneal fibroblast in culture were CS (53–80%) and HS (18–47%), with a trace amount of a nonsulfated form of keratan (<1%). Corneal fibroblasts cultured in 10% dFCS showed an overall reduction in CS synthesis compared with cells cultured in 1% dFCS. This was evident from both [35S]SO4 and [3H]glucosamine incorporation. A similar decrease in HS was observed when cells were cultured in 10% dFCS compared with 1% dFCS.

https://openalex.org/W2049591022,"2-Methyl-4-carboxy,5-hydroxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyri- midine (THP(A) or hydroxyectoine) and 2-methyl,4-carboxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (THP(B) or ectoine) are now recognized as ubiquitous bacterial osmoprotectants. To evaluate the impact of tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives (THPs) on protein-DNA interaction and on restriction-modification systems, we have examined their effect on the cleavage of plasmid DNA by 10 type II restriction endonucleases. THP(A) completely arrested the cleavage of plasmid and bacteriophage λ DNA by EcoRI endonuclease at 0.4 mm and the oligonucleotide (d(CGCGAATTCGCG))2 at about 4.0 mm. THP(B) was 10-fold less effective than THP(A), whereas for betaine and proline, a notable inhibition was observed only at 100 mm. Similar effects of THP(A) were observed for all tested restriction endonucleases, except for SmaI and PvuII, which were inhibited only partially at 50 mm THP(A). No effect of THP(A) on the activity of DNase I, RNase A, and Taq DNA polymerase was noticed. Gel-shift assays showed that THP(A) inhibited the EcoRI-(d(CGCGAATTCGCG))2complex formation, whereas facilitated diffusion of EcoRI along the DNA was not affected. Methylation of the carboxy group significantly decreased the activity of THPs, suggesting that their zwitterionic character is essential for the inhibition effect. Possible mechanisms of inhibition, the role of THPs in the modulation of the protein-DNA interaction, and the in vivo relevance of the observed phenomena are discussed. 2-Methyl-4-carboxy,5-hydroxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyri- midine (THP(A) or hydroxyectoine) and 2-methyl,4-carboxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (THP(B) or ectoine) are now recognized as ubiquitous bacterial osmoprotectants.

Biochem. 1985; 149: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), THP(B), are now recognized as widely spread osmoprotectants within the bacterial world (5Csonka L.N. Epstein W. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1210-1223Google Scholar). The role and activities of THPs are of special interest as they represent a limited group of osmoprotectants that are synthesized de novo, in the bacterial cell, in contrast to those transported from the medium (6Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Their synthesis in a number ofStreptomyces strains as a response to increased salinity and elevated temperature was recently described (7Malin G. Lapidot A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 385-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). THPs are small molecules, highly soluble in water and neutral at physiological pH. NMR and x-ray crystallography data show that THPs are zwitterionic molecules with a delocalized π charge in the NCN group (Fig. 1) and form the half-chair conformation (8Inbar L. Frolow F. Lapidot A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More information has been accumulated lately on THPs activity in living cells. It was found that exogenously provided ectoine (THP(B)) could reverse growth inhibition, caused by osmotic stress, inEscherichia coli (9Jebbar M. Talibart R. Gloux K. Bernard T. Blanco C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5027-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Corynebacterium glutamicum(10Farwick M. Siewe R.M. Kramer R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the soil bacterium Rhizobium meliloti (11Talibart R. Jebbar M. Gousbet G. Himdi-Kabbab S. Wroblewski H. Blanco C. Bernard T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5210-5217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that exogenously provided THP(A), like THP(B), reversed inhibition of E. coli growth by osmotic stress, and moreover, both THP(A) and THP(B) could stimulate growth of E. coli at an elevated temperature (43 °C) (7Malin G. Lapidot A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 385-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently cloned genes for ectoine synthesis from Halomonas elongata (12Canovas D. Vargas C. Iglesias-Guerra F. Csonka L.N. Rhodes D. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25794-25801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and from Marinococcus halophilus (13Lois P. Galinski E.A. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were demonstrated to be both necessary for halotolerance of ectoine-producing bacteria and osmotically regulated. The ability of osmoprotectants (e.g. proline and betaine) to overcome the inhibitory effect of osmotic stress in bacteria was traditionally explained in two ways. One hypothesis states that proline and betaine have special interactions with proteins that protect them from denaturation in the presence of high concentrations of electrolytes (14Csonka L.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 121-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schobert B. Tschesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 541: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In support of this mechanism, it was recently shown that THPs stabilize proteins upon freezing and at elevated temperatures (16Galinski E.A. Experientia. 1993; 49: 487-495Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 17.Lapidot, A., Malin, G., and Iakobashvili, R. (1998) Israel Patent Application 123256, 10.02.1998.Google Scholar). According to another hypothesis, proline and betaine are merely aimed at maintaining cell turgor in media of high osmolarity, being compatible with normal cellular functions at high intracellular concentration. Intracellular concentrations of THPs attain up to 158 mm in nonhalophylicStreptomyces bacteria (7Malin G. Lapidot A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 385-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as high as 2.25 min the halophilic bacterium H. elongata (18Wohlfarth A. Severin J. Galinski E.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 705-712Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas betaine can be synthesized to 0.6 m in the Methanohalophilus strain Z7401 (19Lai M. Sowers K.R. Robertson D.E. Roberts M.F. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 173: 5352-5358Crossref Google Scholar) and proline to 0.7m in Bacillus subtilis (20Whatmore A.M. Chudek J.A. Reed R.H. J. Gen. Milcrobiol. 1990; 136: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At these high concentrations, proline, betaine, and THP(B) demonstrate a pronounced destabilizing effect on DNA in vitro(22Rees W.A. Yager T.D. Korte J. von-Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 23Buche A. Colson P. Houssier C. J. Biomol. Struct.

Iakobashvili, G. Malin, and A. Lapidot, submitted for publication. 2R. S. Iakobashvili, G. Malin, and A. Lapidot, submitted for publication. Moreover, THP(B) at certain concentrations, can, like betaine (22Rees W.A. Yager T.D. Korte J. von-Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), eliminate base pair composition dependence of DNA melting.2 In addition, THP molecules share similarity in structure and geometry with pyrimidine bases and have the zwitterionic character, which was recently shown to be responsible for modification of DNA electrostatic interaction with counterions by a number of osmolytes (25Flock S. Labarbe R. Houssier C. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1519-1529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These notions led us to suggest that the impact of osmoprotectants, and THPs in particular, on protein-DNA interaction is, likely, underestimated. The destabilization of the DNA duplex could play a dual role in the interaction of DNA with proteins; it may either enhance binding, as it was shown for proline and SSB protein, or diminish it, as it was shown for DNaseI, for which double-stranded DNA serves as a substrate (24Rajendrakumar C.S.V. Suryanarayana T. Reddy A.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Yet the impact of osmolytes on the sequence-specific interaction of proteins with DNA (e.g. restriction endonucleases and transcription factors) could be even more complex and remains to be elucidated. Type II restriction enzymes are recognized as an ideal model system for evaluating site-specific protein-DNA interaction, as any interference with the precise alignment of the enzyme and substrate will affect the cleavage. It has been demonstrated that the binding of ligands, such as antibiotics and dyes, reduces the activity and specificity of restriction endonucleases (26Wells R.D. Klein R.D. Singleton C.K. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XIV. Academic Press, New York1981: 157-191Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the constituents of bacterial cells, such as polyamines and basic proteins (27Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Alves J. Ehbrecht H.J. Zabeau M. Gualerzi C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5697-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or polyphosphate (28Rodriguez R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), are also capable of inhibiting the DNA cleavage by restriction endonucleases in vitro. Hence, the primary function of the restriction-modification system, aimed at protecting bacteria from phage infection or from other sources of foreign DNA, might be dependent on the composition of intracellular metabolites. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of bacterial osmolytes, such as THP(A), THP(B), proline, and glycine betaine, on DNA cleavage by several type II restriction endonucleases, taken as a model system for specific protein-DNA interaction. The results were compared with the effect on proteins that bind nucleic acid nonspecifically, such as DNaseI, RNase A, and Taq DNA polymerase. We report here that THP(A) and, to a lesser extent, THP(B) are capable of completely arresting the DNA cleavage by a number of restriction endonucleases, whereas proline and glycine betaine are almost ineffective. The effect of THPs on EcoRI binding to the oligonucleotide, containing its recognition site, and on linear diffusion was also examined. A possible role of THPs in the modulation of the restriction-modification system and in gene expression under stress is suggested. Plasmids pGEM1 and pBR322 were isolated from E. colistrain DH5 by alkaline lysis and purified by equilibrium centrifugation in a gradient of cesium chloride (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.42-1.43Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleasesEcoRI, PvuII, AvaI, and DraI were purchased from New England Biolabs,SspI and SmaI were from MBI Fermentas, and SgrAI and EcoRV were from Boehringer Mannheim. Pancreatic bovine deoxyribonuclease I, ribonuclease A, yeast RNA, betaine monohydrate (glycine betaine), and spermine tetrahydrochloride were from Sigma, l-proline (99.5%) was from Fluka, and Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (recombinant) was from MBI Fermentas. THPs were prepared and purified as described previously (7Malin G. Lapidot A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 385-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of THPs preparations in the restriction assay was checked before and after passing through a Chelex column, and no difference was observed. THPs preparations were further analyzed by atomic flame photometry, and no detectable amounts of Mg, Ca, and Fe ions and less then 0.1% sodium and potassium ions were found. The micromolar final concentration of Na+ or K+ upon addition of THPs to the reaction mixture is negligible in comparison to 50–100 mm potassium in the buffer. For the preparation of 2-methyl, 4-methylcarboxylate, 5-hydroxy-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (methyl-THP(A)) and 2-methyl, 4-methylcarboxylate-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine (methyl-THP(B)) (Fig. 1), an excess of thionylchloride was gradually added to a 0.5 m solution of THP(A) or THP(B) in methanol at 0 °C under continuous stirring. Resulting solutions were evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue, containing CH3-THP(A)·HCl or CH3-THP(B)·HCl, was dissolved in water and neutralized by NaOH to pH 7.0. Water was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the solid material was resuspended in methanol, separated from NaCl by filtration, and dried. The purity of methyl-THP(A) and methyl-THP(B) was determined by1H and 13C NMR (data not shown). (d(CGCGAATTCGCG))2 was prepared by solid phase synthesis (Chemical Services, Weizmann Institute of Science), purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea, and desalted on Sephadex G-25. The oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, New England Biolabs) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (30Connolly B.A. Kneale G.G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 30. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 371-383Google Scholar), purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and desalted on Sephadex G-25. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was heated for 5 min at 90 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and then slowly cooled to 4 °C, desalted on Sephadex G-25, purified by step elution on DEAE-Sephadex (10 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7.4), with increasing concentrations of KCl (up to 0.6 m KCl) and desalted by dialysis against water. About 95% of the resulting oligonucleotide was cleavable by EcoRI endonuclease. Cleavage of DNA by each restriction enzyme was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl of the reaction buffer recommended by manufacturer. The cleavage reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme to the incubation mixture containing THPs or other additives and terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a horizontal 1% agarose gel at 3 V/cm. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed, and pictures were quantified by densitometry. Cleavage of dodecadeoxynucleotide by EcoRI was carried out in 20 μl of buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Products of the 32P-labeled dodecadeoxynucleotide cleavage were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.0 m urea, visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. The DNase I assay was performed at 37 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. A minimal amount of enzyme (0.3 ng/ml) needed for complete transformation of supercoiled plasmid DNA into nicked circular within 1 h (as determined in a separate experiment in the absence of THPs) was added to the reaction mixture containing THPs. Aliquots, taken after short intervals of incubation (every 5 or 10 min), were immediately transferred into liquid nitrogen and kept frozen until loaded on the agarose gel. RNase A assay was carried out at 37 °C in 20 μl of buffer containing 1 μg of yeast RNA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. The minimal amount of enzyme needed for 50% digest of RNA within 30 min (0.2 μg/ml, as determined in a separate experiment in the absence of THPs) was added to the reaction mixture containing THPs. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Taq DNA polymerase activity assay was performed at 72 °C in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 67 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8); 6.7 mm MgCl2; 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; 10 nm [α-32P]dATP; 1.0 μm dATP; dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (200 μm each); 0.6 mmactivated calf thymus DNA (Sigma); 40 units/ml of Taq DNA polymerase; and different concentrations of THPs. After 15 min incubation (corresponding to the region of linear reaction kinetics, as determined in a separate experiment). The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA and applied to strips of chromatographic paper (Whatman No. 3). Strips were washed three times with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and dried, and the radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter. Assays on EcoRI binding to the dodecadeoxynucleotide were carried out in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. THPs were added to the reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before or after the addition of EcoRI, 8 μl of the loading buffer (40% w/v sucrose and 100 μg/ml bromphenol blue) was added, and the samples were loaded on the 9% (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel, 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0), and 2.0 mm EDTA. Gels were prerun for 2–3 h prior to loading of samples and after electrophoresis for 3–4 h at 10–12 V/cm and 4 °C, dried, and autoradiographed, and the resulting negatives were subjected to densitometry. We have basically followed the experiment developed by Ehbrecht et al. (31Ehbrecht H.J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of linear diffusion to the rate of the EcoRI-catalyzed reaction, the difference in the cleavage rate of short (378 bp) and long (4361 bp) fragments of pBR322 plasmid DNA with a centrally located target site by EcoRI endonuclease (see Fig. 5) was measured. To prepare short and long DNA fragments, 300 μg of pBR322 plasmid DNA was cleaved overnight bySspI/EcoRV or PvuII endonucleases (60 units of each) in the buffers recommended by the manufacturers. The resulting digest mixture was used without further purification as a substrate for EcoRI restriction endonuclease. As was shown previously, the components of the primary reaction do not affect the secondary reaction (31Ehbrecht H.J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This experimental setup ensures that factors of the reaction other than the length of the substrate are invariant; namely, all fragments with the EcoRI site have identical flanking sequences, and due to the presence of fragments not containing the EcoRI site, nonspecific binding is identical in all experiments. The secondary reaction (with EcoRI endonuclease) was carried out in the optimized buffer (31Ehbrecht H.J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 in the presence of varying amounts of THPs. We have studied the effect of THP(A), THP(B), proline, and betaine on plasmid DNA cleavage by EcoRI endonuclease. The rate of cleavage of pBR322 DNA by EcoRI endonuclease was notably decreased, starting from 0.1 mmTHP(A). It is worth noting that no intermediate products such as open circular DNA were accumulated upon inhibition (Fig. 2A). To determine the type of inhibition and estimate the inhibition constant, the steady state kinetics of cleavage was measured at constant DNA concentrations and varying concentrations of THP(A). A Dixon plot (32Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3269) Google Scholar) of these data (Fig. 2B) with Vmax constant within the range of error, combined with a set of parallel lines in a Cornish-Bowden plot (33Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), indicates a competitive inhibition (34Cornish-Bowden A. Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworth & Co. Ltd., London1979: 78-82Google Scholar) with K i = 0.16 ± 0.04 mm. The inhibition effect of other osmolytes was much less pronounced; i.e. whereas THP(A) completely arrested plasmid DNA cleavage at around 1.0 mm, THP(B) was 10-fold less effective, betaine and proline at low concentrations showed stimulation of DNA cleavage, and a notable inhibition was observed only at 100 mm (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that at this high concentration, additional effects, such as a decrease of water activity, a significant increase of the medium dielectric constant, or changes in the pH of the reaction mixture, are possible. The inhibitory effect of THP(A) on the EcoRI endonuclease reaction was not unique for the pBR322 plasmid DNA as a substrate; the same effect was observed for pGEM1 plasmid DNA and for bacteriophage λ linear DNA.Figure 3Effect of osmolytes and methyl derivatives of THPs on the rate of pBR322 DNA cleavage by EcoRI.Every data point reflects the initial rate of cleavage (the region of linear reaction kinetics has been determined in a separate experiment) of pBR322 DNA (37 μg/ml) by EcoRI restriction endonuclease (37 units/ml) in the presence of the corresponding solute, normalized by the rate of cleavage in the absence of additives. ▪, THP(A); ●, THP(B); ■, methyl-THP(A); ○, methyl-THP(B); ▵,l-proline; ▴, glycine betaine. Data points are the average of at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cleavage of dodecadeoxynucleotide duplex by EcoRI was tested in the presence of THP(A) with the minimal amount of enzyme needed for complete cleavage and with a 5-fold excess of the enzyme. Similar results were observed in both cases (Fig. 4, A and B). The complete (95–100%) inhibition of the reaction was reached at 5 mm THP(A). The higher concentration of THP(A) needed for complete inhibition of the oligonucleotide cleavage (3–5-fold) as compared with plasmid DNA could be attributed to the different reaction conditions employed in the two experiments, different flanking sequence of recognition sites, and known differences in the reaction kinetics of restriction enzymes on short duplexes of 8–12 bp compared with those on longer DNA (35Greene P.J. Poonian M.S. Nussbaum A.L. Tobias L. Garfin D.E. Boyer H.W. Goodman H.M J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The inhibition of EcoRI endonuclease reaction by THP(A) was not compensated by increased concentration of MgCl2 (20 mm instead of 10 mm) in the reaction mixture, suggesting that sequestering of Mg2+ ions is not responsible for the observed effect. In both cases, the inhibition of DNA cleavage by THP(A) was similar to that depicted in Fig. 3. The cleavage of the plasmid DNA substrate by restriction endonucleases is preceded by a number of consecutive events, such as a nonspecific association with the DNA and linear diffusion of the nonspecifically bound protein along the DNA until the recognition site is reached and specific binding occurs. On exploring the possible targets for THP(A) action, we further investigated its effect on the linear diffusion of EcoRI along the DNA by using the experimental approach developed by Ehbrecht et al. (31Ehbrecht H.J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the difference in the rate of cleavage in this experiment originates solely from the chain length of the substrate, the plasmid DNA (bearing a single EcoRI site) was cleaved beforehand by other restriction endonucleases, producing two sets of DNA fragments of different length. The resulting mixture was used as a substrate forEcoRI endonuclease, thus excluding possible effect of different flanking sequences and equalizing the nonspecific binding. Plasmid pBR322 was cleaved by PvuII endonuclease, to yield a linear fragment of 4361 bp. Alternatively, plasmid DNA was cleaved byEcoRV/SspI, resulting in a 3983-bp fragment without a recognition site and a 378-bp fragment with a centrally located EcoRI site (Figs. 5and 6A). Using optimized concentration of Mg2+ (31Ehbrecht H.J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we observed a distinct difference in the cleavage rate of the long and short DNA fragments byEcoRI endonuclease, ranging from 20 to 8% (Fig. 6,A and B). This enhancement of the reaction rate, proportional to the length of the DNA substrate, is usually explained in terms of sliding or intersegment transfer (36von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sliding process can be viewed as a one-dimensional diffusion of the nonspecifically bound protein (totally electrostatic binding mode) along the DNA, which is thought to occur by the displacement of bound (delocalized) positive counterions from the DNA (36von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, any influence decreasing the lifetime of the nonspecifically bound state (e.g. increase of salt concentration (37Jeltsch A. Wenz C. Stahl F. Pingoud A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 101-108Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) or presenting a steric obstacle to linear movement (e.g. nonsaturating amounts of histone-like protein Hu (31Ehbrecht H.J. Pingoud A. Urbanke C. Maass G. Gualerzi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) will notably diminish the reaction rate dependence on the DNA length. This was not the case for the inhibition of the EcoRI cleavage reaction by THPs. On the contrary, we found that the difference in the cleavage rate of the long and short DNA fragments somewhat increased upon increasing THPs concentrations (Fig. 6), suggesting that the linear diffusion was not significantly affected by THPs in the concentration range employed. Higher concentrations of THP(A) led to very low levels of remaining endonuclease activity for short DNA fragments to be quantified from a gel and compared with the rate of cleavage of long DNA fragments. It is known thatEcoRI endonuclease first binds to its recognition site and then the enzyme-DNA complex binds Mg2+ (38Halford S.E. Johnson N.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the DNA-protein complex formation in the absence of Mg2+ can be used to probe the effect of THP(A) on EcoRI binding to DNA. The experiments were conducted with a minimal amount ofEcoRI endonuclease, needed for complete binding of the d(CGCGAATTCGCG) duplex, and with a 5-fold excess of the enzyme, and they exhibited similar results. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, THP(A) inhibited EcoRI-oligonucleotide complex formation, starting at 1–1.5 mm concentrations, with an inhibition constant,K i (50% inhibition of binding), of 2.0–2.5 mm. Higher THP(A) concentrations, 3.5–4.0 mm, provided complete (95–100%) inhibition. These data indicate that THP(A) arrested the DNA cleavage by EcoRI as soon as the first step of the reaction by preventing EcoRI binding to its target DNA sequence. In order to establish whether the zwitterionic nature of THPs is necessary for the observed inhibition effect, we prepared carboxymethyl derivatives of THPs (Fig. 1) and tested their effect on the reaction catalyzed byEcoRI endonuclease. The ability of these compounds to inhibit the endonuclease reaction was almost 100-fold lower, in comparison to the respective THPs, and at low concentrations, the methylated THP(B) derivative even enhanced the reaction rate as seen in Fig. 3 (note the logarithmic scale). It is possible that the slight inhibition effect was observed due to the minor amounts of unmethylated THPs remaining in the preparation. The inhibition of DNA cleavage (95–100%) by THP(A) was also demonstrated for ot"

Expression of NFI-C or NFI-X, but not NFI-A or NFI-B proteins, represses glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells. Repression is DNA binding-independent as a deletion construct expressing the NH2-terminal 160 residues of NFI-C represses but does not bind DNA. Repression by NFI-C is cell type-dependent and occurs in HeLa and COS-1 cells but not 293 or JEG-3 cells. NFI-C does not repress progesterone induction of the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells, suggesting that progesterone induction of the promoter differs mechanistically from glucocorticoid induction. NFI-C-mediated repression is alleviated by overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), suggesting that NFI-C represses the MMTV promoter by preventing GR function. However, repression by NFI-C occurs with only a subset of glucocorticoid-responsive promoters, as the chimeric NFIGREβ-gal promoter that is activated by GR is not repressed by NFI-C. Since the coactivator proteins p300/CBP, SRC-1A, and RAC3 had previously been shown to function at steroid hormone-responsive promoters, we asked whether they could influence NFI-C-mediated repression of MMTV expression. Expression of p300/CBP or SRC-1A alleviates repression by NFI-C, whereas RAC3 has no effect. This abrogation of NFI-C-mediated repression by p300/CBP and SRC-1A suggests that repression by NFI-C may occur by interference with coactivator function at the MMTV promoter.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NFI-binding sites are also found in the promoter regions of several viruses including the neurotropic JC virus (8Amemiya K. Traub R. Durham L. Major E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14204-14211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human papilloma virus type 16 (9Gloss B. Yeo G.M. Meisterenst M. Rogge L.

Mutational analysis indicates that these NFI sites are required for the proper expression of many tissue-specific and developmentally regulated genes (11Knezetic J.A. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell.

NFI proteins contain a highly conserved but gene-specific NH2-terminal 200 amino acid domain that mediates DNA binding, dimerization, and the initiation of Ad replication (16Mermod N. O'Neill E. Kelly T. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 17Bandyopadhyay S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 392-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). NFI proteins bind to DNA as both homo- and heterodimers and recognize the consensus binding site, TTGGC(N5)GCCAA with the same apparent affinity (18Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Kruse U. Sippel A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, considerable variation occurs within the COOH-terminal domains of the NFI proteins that likely encode distinct transcription modulation domains. Additional variation between NFI proteins is generated through differential splicing of transcripts from each of the four genes (20Kruse U. Sippel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The existence of four conserved NFI genes in vertebrates that generate multiple alternatively spliced polypeptides argues in favor of diverse functions of individual NFI gene products. We have previously shown that NFI proteins representing each of the four murine NFI genes exhibit promoter-specific differences in their maximal transcriptional activation potentials due to differences in their COOH-terminal regions (21Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Chaudhry A.Z. Vitullo A.D. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18538-18546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for such differences in the transcriptional activation properties of NFI proteins is unknown. However, direct interactions between a human NFI-C isoform (CTF1) and components of the basal transcriptional machinery have been reported, with interactions dependent on a sequence motif related to the COOH-terminal heptapeptide repeat (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (23Xiao H. Lis J.T. Xiao H. Greenblatt J. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to be the only mechanism by which NFI proteins activate transcription as some NFI proteins lacking a CTD repeat are potent activators in both yeast (24Wenzelides S. Altmann H. Wendler W. Winnacker E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2416-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (21Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). While it is widely accepted that NFI proteins differ in their activation potentials, their ability to repress transcription is poorly understood. Here, we show that NFI proteins exhibit cell type- and promoter-specific differences in their repression properties, with NFI-C and -X repressing the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells, while NFI-A and -B do not. In contrast to earlier studies, we show that this repression domain of NFI-C is contained within the NH2-terminal DNA binding domain, but repression does not require DNA binding activity. We also demonstrate that overexpression of p300/CBP or SRC-1A abrogates repression of MMTV expression, suggesting that NFI-C-mediated repression may occur by interference with coactivator function at the MMTV promoter. The reporter plasmid pMMTVβ-gal contains the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promoter expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene and has been described previously (21Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1994; 238: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCHNFI-C-240, which expresses the DNA binding domain of the murine NFI-C isoform, was created by digesting pCHNFI-C withBstEII/BglII, repair with Klenow polymerase, and religation. Alternately, pCHNFI-C was digested withDraIII/BglII, AspI/BglII, or MscI/BglII, repair with Klenow polymerase, and religation to create pCHNFI-C1–160, pCHNFI-C1–130, and pCHNFI-C1–75, respectively. pNFI-X-210 and pNFI-B-235 which express the DNA binding domain of the NFI-X and NFI-B proteins were made by digesting pNFI-X with AflII/BglII and pNFI-B withBstEII/BglII, repair with Klenow, and religation. Sequence, orientation, and correct reading frame of all plasmids was verified by automated sequencing (CCF Molecular Biotechnology Core Facility). Plasmids expressing human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) and human progesterone receptor (hPR) were gifts from Drs. Ron Evans and Bert O'Malley, respectively. phGR was created by polymerase chain reaction amplification and subcloning a fragment containing the human glucocorticoid receptor coding sequence into a CMV expression vector.

Chen, respectively, and contain the CMV promoter-driving expression of each coactivator. The cell lines HeLa, COS-1, 293, and JEG-3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, 2 × 105 cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes and then transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described (31Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. 2. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1985Google Scholar) Typically, each coprecipitation consisted of an NFI-dependent β-gal reporter construct (5 μg), SV-40-luciferase (pGL2-Control, Promega), internal control (2.5 μg), and 2.5 μg of various NFI effector constructs. When indicated, 0.5 μg of phGR or phPR were cotransfected with pMMTVβ-gal and pNFIGREβ-gal. Carrier DNA (pBSIIKS+) was added to a total of 15 μg of transfected DNA per plate. Cells were incubated with CaPO4/DNA precipitate for 12–16 h, washed with PBS, and incubated for 24 h in culture media with or without 0.1 μm dexamethasone or 10 nm progesterone (Sigma). Cells were harvested in 300 μl/plate of Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega) with luciferase and β-gal assays performed as described (21Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in quadruplicate using duplicate precipitates for each point, and all results were confirmed by multiple independent experiments using at least two different CsCl-purified preparations of plasmid DNA. For whole cell extracts cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Cells were pelleted by spinning at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was removed; and the pellet was resuspended in Lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional swirling. Cell debris was pelleted by spinning at 16,000 × g for 10 min, with the supernatant removed and stored at −80 °C. Gel mobility shift analysis were performed using the 32P-labeled FIB-2.6 oligonucleotide as described previously (18Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For antibody supershift analysis with the C125A anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim), binding reactions were carried out for 30 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 μl of the anti-HA antibody (200 μg/ml) and further incubation for 20 min at room temperature. As a control, binding reactions not incubated with antibody were treated with 1 μl of PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6.5% polyacrylamide, 0.25% TBE gel, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics model 400 PhosphorImager. To detect the intracellular location of the HA-tagged NFI proteins, HeLa cells were grown on coverslips, transfected with vectors expressing the NFI protein or control vectors, cultured for 48 h, and fixed in chilled methanol at −20 °C for 15 min. Fixed cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST), incubated with 2–3 μg/ml anti-HA antibody in PBST for 45 min, washed in PBS, incubated for 45 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, and washed in PBS; the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories); the cells were examined using a Nikon fluorescence microscope; and the images were captured with an Oncor imaging system (Cleveland Clinic Fluorescent Microscopy Core). For control staining, the specific antibody solution was replaced by PBST alone. Cells transfected with the NFI effector plasmids and hormone receptor expression plasmids were pelleted, lysed directly in 1× Laemmli buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), boiled for 10 min, separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The blots were blocked and hybridized with either anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) or anti-GR PA-510 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) as per manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We previously reported the cloning of cDNAs representing each of the four murine NFI genes, analyzed their embryonic and postnatal expression patterns, and demonstrated promoter-specific differences in their relative activation potentials (21Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Chaudhry A.Z. Vitullo A.D. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18538-18546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that NFI proteins representing each of the four NFI genes differentially activated the MMTV promoter in human JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, with NFI-B activating expression ∼12-fold, NFI-X activating ∼10-fold, NFI-C ∼6-fold, and NFI-A only ∼2-fold. To determine whether the maximum activation potentials of these NFI isoforms differed in different cell types, we first examined their ability to modulate the MMTV promoter in human HeLa cells. HeLa cells had previously been used to demonstrate the requirement for an NFI-binding site for glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter (33Toohey M. Lee J. Huang M. Peterson D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4477-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, coexpression of NFI-C or NFI-X completely repressed glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 8and 10 versus lane 2). In contrast, glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter was not repressed in cells transfected with either control CMV vector (lane 2) or vectors expressing NFI-A (lane 4) or NFI-B (lane 6). As expected, expression of the MMTV promoter was completely dependent on the addition of dexamethasone (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus lane 1) and coexpression of human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR, Fig. 1B, lane 6 versus lane 2). Repression of MMTV expression by NFI-C and NFI-X appeared to be promoter-specific, since expression from the chimeric NFIβ-gal promoter, which contains a single NFI-binding site upstream of the Ad major late promoter, was not repressed by coexpression of any of the NFI proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes 10-13 versus lane 9). Previous studies had shown that this promoter requires NFI binding for maximal expression (22Chaudhry A.Z. Vitullo A.D. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18538-18546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Knox J.J. Rebstein P.J. Manoukian A. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2946-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Differences in repression by the four NFI gene products were not due to differences in expression since all four proteins were expressed at similar levels, as assessed by Western blot analysis of the HA-tagged proteins (Fig. 1C). To determine which domain(s) of the NFI-C and -X proteins mediated repressor function, we made COOH-terminal deletion constructs (Fig. 2A). As NFI-C and NFI-X both repressed the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells and NFI-A and NFI-B did not, deletion analysis was performed on the NFI-B and NFI-C proteins as examples of the two classes. The COOH-terminal deletion constructs express NFI-C proteins of 75 aa (NFI-C-75), 135 aa (NFI-C-130), 160 aa (NFI-C-160), and 240 aa (NFI-C-240). A plasmid containing the DNA binding domain NH2-terminal 235 residues of the NFI-B isoform (NFI-B-235) was used as a negative control. As expected, cotransfection of either the full-length NFI-B or NFI-B-235 expression plasmids failed to repress dexamethasone induction of the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 14 and 16 versus lane 2). As shown above, glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV reporter was completely repressed upon cotransfection with the full-length NFI-C (NFI-C-439) vector (Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus lane 2). Repression of the MMTV promoter was also observed with cotransfection with the NFI-C-240 and NFI-C-160 vectors (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 8). Cotransfection of either pNFI-C-130 or pNFI-C-75 failed to repress dexamethasone induction of the MMTV promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 10 and 12 versus lanes 4, 6, and 8), localizing the repression domain to a region within the NH2-terminal 160 residues of NFI-C. Previous studies showed that ∼200 NH2-terminal residues of NFI proteins are required for DNA binding and dimerization (16Mermod N. O'Neill E. Kelly T. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 19Kruse U. Sippel A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,34Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Apt D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10739-10745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since HeLa cells contain endogenous NFI proteins (18Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), anti-HA antibody supershifts were used to assess the DNA binding ability of the various transfected HA-tagged NFI proteins. As seen previously (18Goyal N. Knox J. Gronostajski R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), multiple NFI·DNA complexes were formed on the FIB 2.6 oligonucleotide in extracts of mock-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 1and 2, depicted by bracket B). None of these complexes were supershifted by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2C, lane 2 versus lane 1). In contrast, a robust anti-HA antibody supershift was observed in nuclear extracts from cells transfected with the NFI-B expression vector (Fig. 2C, lane 4 versus lane 3, arrow A). Analogous anti-HA-supershifted complexes were detected in extracts of cells transfected with the NFI-C-439, NFI-C-240, and NFI-B-235 vectors (data not shown (22Chaudhry A.Z. Vitullo A.D. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18538-18546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). However, no anti-HA-supershifted complexes were detected in extracts of cells transfected with the NFI-C-160 vector (Fig. 2C, lane 6 versus lane 5), indicating that the NFI-C-160 protein lacks DNA binding activity. The lack of DNA binding activity is not due to poor expression of NFI-C-160, since Western blots show that similar levels of NFI-B and NFI-C-160 proteins are expressed (Fig. 2D). Lack of DNA binding by NFI-C-160 was confirmed by transfection of the NFI-C-160 vector into JEG-3 cells which lack endogenous NFI proteins (data not shown). These data, together with previous studies showing that ∼200 NH2-terminal residues of NFI proteins are needed for DNA binding and dimerization (16Mermod N. O'Neill E. Kelly T. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 19Kruse U. Sippel A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Apt D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10739-10745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicate that repression of the MMTV promoter by the NFI-C-160 protein occurs in the absence of NFI DNA binding or dimerization activity. To assess whether the differences in repression by the NFI-C COOH-terminal deletion proteins were due to differences in cellular localization, we examined the intracellular location of the NFI-C proteins by immuno-histochemistry. Mock-transfected cells stained with the anti-HA antibodies or cells stained with secondary antibody alone showed no fluorescence (Fig. 2E, panel D, and data not shown). Although both NFI-C-439 and NFIC-160 exhibited strong nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 2, panel A versus panel B), cells expressing NFI-C1–160 exhibited some diffuse cytoplasmic staining not seen with NFI-C-439 (compare Fig. 2, panel A versus panel B). In contrast, cells expressing NFI-C-130 stained weakly in the nucleus but showed strong cytoplasmic staining with a punctate distribution (compare Fig. 2, panel C versus panels A and B), suggesting the presence of a nuclear localization or retention signal in residues 130–160 of NFI-C. To determine if the lack of repression observed with the NFI-C-130 construct was due to differences in nuclear localization, we made a chimeric construct containing residues 1–130 of NFI-C fused to residues 131–235 of NFI-B. Expression and nuclear localization of the chimeric protein was verified by DNA binding studies (data not shown). When cotransfected with the MMTV promoter in HeLa cells, the chimeric NFI construct failed to repress glucocorticoid induction (data not shown) suggesting that the differences in the repression properties of the NFI-C-160 and NFI-C-130 proteins are not due solely to differences in nuclear localization. The ability of NFI-C to repress glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter but not the chimeric NFIβ-gal reporter indicated that NFI-C might repress by inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor function. Since NFI-C-mediated repression is DNA binding-independent, it is unlikely that repression occurs by NFI and GR competing for binding to the MMTV promoter. Thus, repression likely involves some form of protein-protein interactions, either through direct interactions between NFI-C and GR or by NFI-C and GR competing for a limiting coactivator protein required for MMTV transcription (see “Discussion”). Either model would predict that repression by NFI-C might be overcome by overexpressing GR. To test this, we cotransfected increasing amounts of the hGR vector with pMMTVβ-gal, with or without the NFI-C expression plasmid (Fig. 3A). As seen above, HeLa cells cotransfected with 0.5 μg of phGR, and pMMTVβ-gal exhibited strong dexamethasone-dependent MMTV promoter activity (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 1). In the absence of coexpressed NFI-C, increasing amounts of cotransfected phGR increased dexamethasone-dependent MMTV activity ∼2-fold (lane 4 versus lane 2) and ∼2.5-fold (lane 6 versus lane 2). MMTV promoter activity in cells transfected with 5.0 μg of the hGR expression plasmid appeared to represent maximal promoter activation as further increasing the amount of phGR DNA transfected did not increase expression (data not shown). As seen above, repression of MMTV expression was observed when NFI-C was coexpressed together with either 0.5 or 1.5 μg of phGR DNA (lanes 8 and 10 versus lanes 2 and 4, respectively). However, repression by NFI-C was partially abrogated when 5.0 μg of phGR was cotransfected (lane 12 versus lanes 10 and 8). This ability of NFI-C to repress glucocorticoid induction of the MMTV promoter when sub-saturating amounts of the GR expression vector are used appears not to be due to NFI inhibiting GR expression, since Western blot analysis shows that glucocorticoid receptor levels are unaffected by expression of NFI-C (Fig. 3B, lane 3 versus lane 2, lane 5 versus lane 4, and lane 7 versus lane 6). Previous studies have shown that in addition to being activated by glucocorticoids, MMTV promoter expression can also be induced by progesterone in the presence of progesterone receptor (35Kalff M. Gross B. Beato M. Nature. 1990; 344: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test if NFI-C-mediated repression was specific to the glucocorticoid response of the MMTV promoter, we transfected HeLa cells with pMMTVβ-gal and vectors expressing either progesterone or glucocorticoid receptor (Fig. 4). In the absence of cotransfected hPR, no progesterone-dependent MMTV expression was seen ("
https://openalex.org/W2037487893,"Three separate classes of ribonucleotide reductases are known, each with a distinct protein structure. One common feature of all enzymes is that a single protein generates each of the four deoxyribonucleotides. Class I and III enzymes contain an allosteric substrate specificity site capable of binding effectors (ATP or various deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates) that direct enzyme specificity. Some (but not all) enzymes contain a second allosteric site that binds only ATP or dATP. Binding of dATP to this site inhibits the activity of these enzymes. X-ray crystallography has localized the two sites within the structure of the Escherichia coli class I enzyme and identified effector-binding amino acids. Here, we have studied the regulation of three class II enzymes, one from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum and two from eubacteria (Lactobacillus leichmannii and Thermotoga maritima). Each enzyme has an allosteric site that binds ATP or various deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and that regulates its substrate specificity according to the same rules as for class I and III enzymes. dATP does not inhibit enzyme activity, suggesting the absence of a second active allosteric site. For the L. leichmannii and T. maritima enzymes, binding experiments also indicate the presence of only one allosteric site. Their primary sequences suggest that these enzymes lack the structural requirements for a second site. In contrast, the T. acidophilum enzyme binds dATP at two separate sites, and its sequence contains putative effector-binding amino acids for a second site. The presence of a second site without apparent physiological function leads to the hypothesis that a functional site was present early during the evolution of ribonucleotide reductases, but that its function was lost from the T. acidophilum enzyme. The other two B12 enzymes lost not only the function, but also the structural basis for the site. Also a large subgroup (Ib) of class I enzymes, but none of the investigated class III enzymes, has lost this site. This is further indirect evidence that class II and I enzymes may have arisen by divergent evolution from class III enzymes.

This is further indirect evidence that class II and I enzymes may have arisen by divergent evolution from class III enzymes. Among the fascinating properties of ribonucleotide reductases is their allosteric regulation of substrate specificity (general review in Ref. 1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). These enzymes balance the reduction of ribonucleotides in a way that satisfies the cell's need for all four building blocks required for DNA synthesis. One protein catalyzes four separate reactions. The substrate specificity of the catalytic site for a given ribonucleotide is determined by binding of a specific deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) 1The abbreviations used are: dNTP, deoxynucleoside triphosphate; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol or ATP to an allosteric site (substrate specificity site). Thus, binding of ATP or dATP induces activity toward pyrimidine ribonucleotides; binding of dTTP induces activity toward guanine ribonucleotides; and binding of dGTP induces activity toward adenine ribonucleotides. These effects are largely the same for all ribonucleotide reductases studied so far, except for some viral enzymes (2Nikas I. McLaugchlan J. Davison A.J. Taylor W.R. Clements J.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Many reductases have, in addition, a second allosteric site (activity site) that regulates their overall activity, with ATP promoting and dATP inhibiting enzyme activity (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Three classes of ribonucleotide reductases occur in nature. In addition to the earlier mentioned allosteric regulation of substrate specificity, all enzymes share a similar common free radical mechanism for the reduction of ribose and contain, for this purpose, a free radical as part of their protein structure. The three classes differ in the way in which the protein radical is produced and have evolved distinct protein structures (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 3Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 4Stubbe J. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 793-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). Class I reductases, with the aerobic Escherichia coli enzyme as the prototype, contain a tyrosyl free radical and have an α2β2-structure (6Fontecave M. Nordlund P. Eklund H. Reichard P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 147-183PubMed Google Scholar). The large α2-dimer has been named the R1 protein (NrdA), and the small β2-dimer has been named the R2 protein (NrdB). The tyrosyl radical forms part of the R2 polypeptide, which also contains an oxygen-linked diferric center required for radical generation. This process requires oxygen, and class I enzymes function therefore only in aerobic organisms, both bacteria and eukaryotes. The R1 protein binds substrates and allosteric effectors and is the catalytic part of the enzyme. Class I has been divided into two subgroups (Ia (NrdAB) and Ib (NrdEF)) that differ from each other functionally and in their primary structures (7Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ia, the class Ib reductases contain no allosteric activity site. The three-dimensional structures of complexes between the allosteric effector dTTP (specificity site) or the effector analog AMPPNP (activity site) and the R1 protein of the E. coli class Ia reductase have been solved, and the amino acid residues involved in the binding of each effector were identified (8Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The signum of class II reductases (NrdJ proteins) is their dependence on adenosylcobalamin, which acts as a radical generator and thus supplies the same function as the R2 protein of class I reductases. All class II reductases contain a single polypeptide chain, functionally related to the R1 protein of class I enzymes. They are widely spread among aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and do not depend on oxygen. The enzyme from Lactobacillus leichmannii (9Panagon D. Orr M.D. Dunstone J.R. Blakeley R.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2378-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Licht S. Gerfen G.J. Stubbe J. Science. 1996; 271: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was, for a long time, the only well characterized member of this class and became its prototype. When, in recent years, the amino acid sequences of many more class II enzymes were determined, it became apparent that the L. leichmannii enzyme has an unusual sequence, different from those of most other class II as well as class I and III enzymes. Class III reductases (NrdDG proteins), with the anaerobic E. coli reductase as a prototype (12Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have again an α2β2-structure. The catalytic α-subunit carries not only both substrate and allosteric sites, but also the free radical required for catalysis, which, in class III reductases, is located on a glycyl residue at the C terminus of the polypeptide chain. The β-subunit generates this radical with the aid of an iron-sulfur cluster in an anaerobic reaction that requires reduced flavodoxin and S-adenosylmethionine (13Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The glycyl radical is oxygen-sensitive, and class III reductases can therefore operate only in strict anaerobic bacteria or facultative aerobic bacteria growing in the absence of oxygen. Within one class, the large α- and small β-subunits each share homologous amino acids. Between the classes, however, the α-subunits of the three prototypes for the classes show only very limited homology, suggesting no or only a distant evolutionary relation between the classes. However, recent studies of class II enzymes with deep evolutionary roots demonstrated that these enzymes and class I enzymes share homologous amino acids for effector binding at critical positions in the substrate specificity site (14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As for class III, excepting the T4-induced enzyme (15Young P. Öhman M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27815-27818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the N termini of the α-peptides containing the hypothetical allosteric second dATP site show considerable homology to corresponding segments of some of the new class II enzymes as well as to that of the E. coli class I enzyme. The allosteric properties of several class I reductases (16Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Jordan A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26582-26587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and one class III reductase (18Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been investigated in detail by kinetic and effector binding experiments. Our knowledge of the allosteric behavior of class II enzymes is, however, incomplete. We know next to nothing concerning the recently described archaeal and deeply rooted eubacterial enzymes, and early studies of the L. leichmannii enzyme (19Beck W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3148-3158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chen A.K. Bhan A. Hopper S. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) need to be complemented in the light of recent knowledge. Here, we describe our experiments with three class II reductases: the previous prototype enzyme from L. leichmannii (9Panagon D. Orr M.D. Dunstone J.R. Blakeley R.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2378-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the archaeal thermophilic enzyme fromThermoplasma acidophilum (21Tauer A. Benner S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the eubacterial hyperthermophilic enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). BothT. acidophilum and T. maritima are deeply rooted organisms. L. leichmannii, instead, is a highly specialized microorganism, adapted to life in milk. The three enzymes had the opportunity to diverge extensively during evolution. Despite this, their substrate specificity was regulated in a similar manner, according to the same rules as for class I and III reductases. The thermophilic organisms showed a clear allosteric regulation only at elevated temperatures, suggesting that the proteins at lower temperature are not sufficiently flexible to transmit the conformational change resulting from effector binding to the catalytic site. None of the three enzymes was inhibited by dATP, and they all thus lack a functional activity site. However, the T. acidophilum reductase (but not the other two enzymes) meets the structural requirements for an activity site, and in effect, it did bind a second dATP. Our results will be discussed in light of a previously suggested model for the evolution of ribonucleotide reduction. Bacterial strains overproducing the L. leichmannii(10Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and T. acidophilum (21Tauer A. Benner S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) enzymes were kindly provided by Dr. J. Stubbe. The T. maritima ribonucleotide reductase was purified from an overproducing E. coli strain prepared earlier in this laboratory (14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Labeled nucleoside di- and triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. They were diluted to the following specific activities: 14C-labeled substrates, 3–6 cpm/pmol; 3H-labeled substrates, 10–20 cpm/pmol; and 3H-labeled effectors, 200–450 cpm/pmol. Their radiopurity was checked by chromatography on polyethyleneimine strips. If necessary, they were purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex with a volatile buffer. Small portions of the dissolved labeled nucleotides were stored at −80 °C. Batch cultures of bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to a finalA600 of 0.5, at which point isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm. The bacteria were incubated for another 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and stored frozen. Except where indicated, all further procedures were done at close to 0 °C. Extracts of the bacteria were prepared as described earlier (14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the exception that streptomycin (at a final concentration of 1%) was included in the extraction buffer. This greatly facilitated centrifugation of the otherwise highly viscous extracts. The clear supernatant solutions were precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. After centrifugation, the precipitate was dissolved in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT) and freed from ammonium sulfate by dialysis against the same buffer. The final solution contained ∼10 mg of protein/ml. This procedure was applied to 3 g of bacteria for the purification of the L. leichmannii enzyme and to 20–50 g of bacteria for the purification of the T. maritima and T. acidophilum enzymes. Overproduction of the enzyme was very efficient, and at this stage, we had a total of 83 mg of protein with a specific activity of 490 units/mg of protein. Half of this protein, dissolved in 2.6 ml of buffer A, was adsorbed onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a 0–1 m KCl gradient in buffer A. A peak of activity was recovered at 0.23 m KCl, and the central portion of this peak (16.5 mg of protein, specific activity = 750 units/mg of protein) was used for our experiments. After the ammonium sulfate precipitation of the protein from an extract of 20 g of bacteria, we recovered 1.0 g of protein with a specific activity of 14 units/mg of protein. The solution was heated at 55 °C for 30 min and centrifuged, and the clear supernatant solution was precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. The centrifuged precipitate was dissolved in 2 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm DTT) and freed from ammonium sulfate by dialysis against the same buffer. The enzyme (144 mg) now had a specific activity of 46 units/mg of protein. It was adsorbed onto a Mono Q HR column and chromatographed with a 0–1 m KCl gradient. A peak of activity (8 mg, specific activity = 186 units/mg of protein) appeared around 0.2m KCl. After concentration in Centricon 30 tubes, the protein was adsorbed onto a 10-ml column of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Inactive protein was removed by elution with 75 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, followed by elution of the active protein (1.7 mg, specific activity = 246 units/mg of protein) with 200 mmphosphate, pH 7.5. After concentration in Centricon 30 tubes, the protein was equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol on a 5-ml column of Sephadex G-25, giving a final yield of 0.51 mg of pure enzyme. The protein was highly “sticky,” and recovery was low. It was also prepared in pure form, but again in low yield, by affinity chromatography on dATP-Sepharose as a final purification step instead of hydroxylapatite in a procedure related to the one described below for the T. maritimareductase. Both preparations gave a single band on denaturing gels and, when used in binding experiments, gave identical results. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, the protein in buffer B (1.44 g, 10 mg/ml, specific activity = 70 units/mg of protein) was heated for 10 min at 80 °C, and the resulting precipitate was removed by high speed centrifugation. After addition of 1.15 ml of 1 mCaCl2, the solution (114 ml, 1 mg of protein/ml, specific activity = 550 units/mg of protein) was adsorbed onto a 25-ml column of dATP-Sepharose equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm DTT. The column was washed with 40 ml of the same buffer, and the reductase was eluted with 0.5 m ammonia. The combined fractions containing 29 mg of protein were neutralized with 2 m NaH2PO4, and the protein was precipitated overnight after addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation. Denaturing gel electrophoresis at this stage showed only two protein bands with mobilities of ∼70 and 90 kDa. The proteins corresponding to these bands could be separated by chromatography on a column of Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in 1.5 ml of this buffer and added to the column. Elution with the same buffer resulted in the appearance of two cleanly separated symmetrical protein peaks with mobilities corresponding to ∼500 and 150 kDa, named TM1 and TM2, both enzymatically active. The materials corresponding to each peak were concentrated in Centriprep 30 tubes. TM1 (8.5 mg, specific activity = 1500 units/mg of protein) corresponded to the 90-kDa band on denaturing gels. Mass spectrometry showed a single peak with a mass of 93.5 kDa. 2A. Jordan, R. Eliasson, U. Hellman, I. Gibert, and P. Reichard, unpublished results. TM2 (2.9 mg, specific activity = 1800 units/mg of protein) corresponded to the 70-kDa band. Both TM1 and TM2 had the same N-terminal sequence as the enzyme isolated from T. maritima,2 suggesting that the smaller size of TM2 was due to C-terminal processing of the enzyme. Under standard conditions, all three enzymes were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl for 20 min in the presence of 0.5 mm [3H]CTP (L. leichmanniireductase) or [3H]CDP (T. acidophilum and T. maritima reductases), 100 mm DTT, 15 μm adenosylcobalamin, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μm dATP, and 10 mm CaCl2(L. leichmannii enzyme), 10 mm MgCl2(T. maritima enzyme), or 40 mm MgCl2(T. acidophilum enzyme) at 37 °C (L. leichmannii enzyme), 80 °C (T. maritima enzyme), or 55 °C (T. acidophilum enzyme). The reaction was terminated with 1 ml of ice-cold 1 m HClO4, and the amount of [3H]dCMP formed was determined by chromatography on Dowex-50 after 10 min of hydrolysis at 100 °C (22Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Reduction of ADP (ATP) or GDP (GTP) was assayed with14C-labeled substrates under identical incubation conditions except for the allosteric effector. After incubation, the nucleotides were transformed to nucleosides by digestion with alkaline phosphatase, and the labeled deoxyribosides were separated from the ribosides on boronate columns (23Kim J.J. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as 1 nmol of product formed during 1 min. Specific activity is units/mg of protein. Protein was determined colorimetrically (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as the standard. 5–20% linear sucrose gradients in a total volume of 4.6 ml were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. In some experiments, 15 μm adenosylcobalamin and/or 100 μm dATP was present throughout the gradient. Solutions (0.2 ml) of the enzymes containing catalase as an internal marker (s20,w = 11.4 S) were layered onto the gradient and centrifuged in a Beckman SW 50 rotor at 32,000 rpm for 18 h at 20 °C. After the run, the tubes were punctured at the bottom, and a total of 33–38 fractions were collected and analyzed for protein content and catalase activity. The sedimentation coefficients of the proteins were calculated from their positions in the gradient relative to the catalase marker. The method of Ormö and Sjöberg (25Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 182: 674-682Google Scholar) was used at +4 °C as described previously (17Eliasson R. Pontis E. Jordan A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26582-26587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No dephosphorylation of any nucleotide occurred during the course of the experiments as determined by polyethyleneimine chromatography. Enzyme purification as described under “Experimental Procedures” provided large amounts of L. leichmannii and T. maritimareductases, but only limited amounts of the T. acidophilumenzyme. All three enzymes gave rise to a single band on denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) with positions in accordance with their molecular masses of 82, 94, and 97 kDa for the enzymes from L. leichmannii (10Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), T. maritima(14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and T. acidophilum (21Tauer A. Benner S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), respectively, calculated from their amino acid compositions. In the case of the T. maritima reductase, we separated two homogeneous highly active enzymes with different molecular masses: one with a mass of 94 kDa corresponding to the enzyme prepared from T. maritima and a second shorter protein of ∼70 kDa that had apparently arisen through C-terminal processing of the larger protein in E. coli. The large protein was used in our experiments; the properties of the shorter one will be described elsewhere.2The specific activities of the pure L. leichmannii and T. acidophilum enzymes differed from earlier reported values. The L. leichmannii reductase showed only half the activity; the T. acidophilum reductase was 10 times more active. We ascribe this to differences in assay conditions. The reductant in our assays was DTT, whereas thioredoxin from E. coli was employed earlier with the L. leichmanniireductase. In the case of the T. acidophilum reductase, we optimized both the DTT and cation concentrations better than was done in previous work. Extensive experiments from two separate laboratories (9Panagon D. Orr M.D. Dunstone J.R. Blakeley R.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2378-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Chen A.K. Bhan A. Hopper S. Abrams R. Franzen J.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicated that the native L. leichmannii enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass close to 80 kDa. Also the native T. acidophilum enzyme was briefly stated to be a monomer (21Tauer A. Benner S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas the T. maritima enzyme behaved as a high molecular mass oligomer (14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As the oligomeric state of the reductases is important for an understanding of the allosteric effects, we decided to re-determine this parameter. To this purpose, we measured the sedimentation of the enzymes in sucrose gradients under various conditions that might affect their aggregation, including different combinations of adenosylcobalamin, dATP, DTT, and Mg2+. We had used sucrose gradient centrifugation with advantage earlier to determine the oligomeric structures of class I (26Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and III (13Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) ribonucleotide reductases. Gradients were standardized with the R1E protein of Salmonella typhimurium (161 kDa,s20,w = 7.7–7.9 S), aldolase (158 kDa, 7.9 S), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 4.8 S). Irrespective of conditions, the L. leichmannii enzyme (monomer = 82 kDa) sedimented at 5.6–5.7 S, the T. acidophilum enzyme (monomer = 97 kDa) at 8.4–8.6 S, and the T. maritimaenzyme (monomer = 94 kDa) at 10.2 S. All runs were made at room temperature, but the T. maritima enzyme was heated to 80 °C for 10 min in the presence of 20 μmadenosylcobalamin, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm dATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 before centrifugation. The sedimentation coefficients of the three reductases suggest that, in solution, the L. leichmannii enzyme is a monomer, the T. acidophilum enzyme a dimer, and the T. maritima enzyme a higher oligomer. As the T. maritimaenzyme normally operates above 80 °C and centrifugations were at room temperature, more extensive studies are required to establish its true oligomeric state. Our aim was to study the influence of allosteric modulators on the substrate specificity and activity of the reductases under optimal assay conditions. We first optimized the reduction of CDP (CTP) with each enzyme and then used the results to study effector requirements for the reduction of purine ribonucleotides. As reported earlier (9Panagon D. Orr M.D. Dunstone J.R. Blakeley R.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2378-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J.

A. 1997; 94: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the activity of each of the three enzymes is completely dependent on the presence of adenosylcobalamin and high concentrations (100 mm) of DTT. Substrates for the reaction are ribonucleosidediphosphates for the T. acidophilum and T. maritima reductases (14Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbé J.

Translocation of its short acidic periplasmic loop is stimulated by the proton motive force (pmf) and does not require the Sec components. We now find that the pmf becomes increasingly important for the translocation of negatively charged residues within procoat when the hydrophobicity of the signal or membrane anchor is incrementally reduced. In contrast, we find that the pmf inhibits translocation of the periplasmic loop when it contains one or two positively charged residues. This inhibitory effect of the pmf is stronger when the hydrophobicity of the inserting procoat protein is compromised. No pmf effect is observed for translocation of an uncharged periplasmic loop even when the hydrophobicity is reduced. We also show that the ΔΨ component of the pmf is necessary and sufficient for insertion of representative constructs and that the translocation effects of charged residues are primarily due to the ΔΨ component of the pmf and not the pH component.

All membrane proteins must adopt their correct asymmetric orientations in the membrane in order to function correctly. This is achieved according to two major known parameters. The hydrophobic stretches within membrane proteins enable the protein to partition into the membrane and span the bilayer, whereas the hydrophilic regions are retained at the correct face of the membrane as dictated by the “positive inside” rule (1von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This rule states that regions rich in positively charged residues are directed to the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane of Escherichia coli (2von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3von Heijne G. Gavel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The basis for the positive inside rule has not been pursued diligently until recently (4Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,5van Klompenburg W. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4261-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that the proton motive force, ΔμH+(pmf), 1The abbreviations used are: pmf, proton motive force; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; prf, protease-resistant fragment which renders the cytoplasm basic and the periplasm acidic, favors a cytoplasmic location for positively charged amino acids. The electrical component of the pmf, ΔΨ, imposes an “uphill” barrier for positively charged residues to translocate into the periplasm, whereas negatively charged residues move downhill with the pmf (2von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pmf has been shown to drive the insertion of hydrophilic domains of both sec-dependent (6Daniels C.J. Bole D.G. Quay S.C. Oxender D.L.

It was shown that the pmf promotes the translocation of negatively charged residues within a short periplasmic loop (4Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) of a membrane protein. In addition, the pmf appears to impede translocation of an amino-terminal tail when it possesses a positive charge (13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) since the tail inserts more efficiently in the absence of the potential. The pmf also contributes to the topology of the protein, since abolishing the pmf causes a partial topology inversion in various positively charged mutants (4Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, similar studies using the M13 procoat protein showed that a positively charged periplasmic loop inserted slightly less efficiently when the pmf was collapsed (13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether the electrical potential plays a general role in influencing the membrane topology of proteins. Another major factor that drives hydrophilic regions of membrane proteins across the phospholipid bilayer is the hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segments. It has been shown that the hydrophobic amino acids within these transmembrane domains are necessary for carboxyl- and amino-terminal translocation of hydrophilic regions (14Spiess M. Handschin C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2683-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although the importance of hydrophobicity for protein translocation is well known (1von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16von Heijne G. Manoil C. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the relative contributions of the hydrophobicity and the pmf for a type II membrane protein have not been examined. In this study, the role of the pmf in the translocation of positively charged residues was tested. Also, the severity of the barrier of translocating positively charged residues caused by decreasing hydrophobicity of the inserting membrane protein was tested. In addition, we examined whether the pmf can play a primary role for translocation of negatively charged residues across the membrane when hydrophobicity is reduced. We fused an antigenic tag from leader peptidase to the carboxyl terminus of procoat, which enabled us to efficiently immunoprecipitate the proteins with leader peptidase antiserum (17Kuhn A. Kreil G. Wickner W. Nature. 1986; 322: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have constructed a series of deletions within both the relatively hydrophobic signal sequence and the extremely hydrophobic membrane anchor. We found that translocation of basic residues within the periplasmic loop of procoat is increasingly hindered by the pmf as the hydrophobicity was incrementally reduced. This is in contrast to what is observed with negatively charged mutants. Here we observed that the pmf becomes increasingly critical for translocation as the hydrophobicity of the protein was reduced. This directional reaction to the pmf provides more evidence for an electrophoretic insertion mechanism and suggests that the electrical potential may be the basis for the positive inside rule of inner membrane proteins in agreement with Andersson and von Heijne (4Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, our results suggest that a pH gradient is not necessary for insertion of the procoat mutants, and the effects of charged residues on translocation can be attributed to the ΔΨ. E. coli strain MC1061 (ΔlacX74, araD139, Δ(ara, leu)7697,galU, galK, hsr, hsm, strA) was from our laboratory stocks. XL-1 Epicurean coli (supE44, hsdR17,recA1, endA1, gyrA46, thi relA1, lac−) was from Stratagene.

Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which contains the arabinose promoter and arabinose regulatory elements, was used to express procoat-lep mutants. Lysozyme, amino acids, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CCCP were from Sigma. Proteinase K was from Boehringer Mannheim. The Sequenase version 2.0 kit was from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Tran35S-label, a mixture of 85% [35S]methionine and 15% [35S]cysteine was from ICN. Materials for Quikchange were from Stratagene. Deoxynucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Qiagen Midi Plasmid Purification Kit was from Qiagen. PAGE-purified oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. Plasmid preps were accomplished using the Qiagen midi kit. Mutagenesis was carried out according to the Quikchange procedure, with modifications as described (19Delgado-Partin V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9927-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sequencing was done according to the methods of the Sequenase version 2.0 kit. Mutants verified by sequencing were transformed into MC1061 using the calcium chloride method of Cohen et al. (20Cohen S.N. Chang A.C. Boyer H.W. Helling R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3240-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). One milliliter of M9 medium containing 0.5% fructose and 50 μg/ml each amino acid except methionine was inoculated with 20 μl of an overnight MC1061 cell culture bearing the plasmid of interest and allowed to grow for 3 h with shaking at 37 °C. Expression of procoat-lep mutants was induced for 1 h with a final concentration of 0.2% arabinose. The cells were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi of Tran35S-label for 1 min and subsequently transferred to prechilled microcentrifuge tubes. Where indicated, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was added 45 s prior to labeling at a final concentration of 50 μm. The cells were pelleted for 40 s at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and then resuspended in 250 μl of Solution I (Tris acetate, pH 8.2, 0.5m sucrose, and 5 mm EDTA). Spheroplasts were formed by adding lysozyme to a final concentration of 80 μg/ml and 250 μl of ice-cold water immediately thereafter. After a 5-min incubation, MgSO4 was added to a final concentration of 40 mm. The spheroplasts were harvested by spinning again for 40 s and resuspended in 300 μl of Solution II (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmMgSO4). The spheroplasts were split into 3 aliquots. The first aliquot received no protease. 7.5 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K was added to the other two aliquots, and additionally, 30 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added to the third aliquot. The spheroplasts were incubated on ice for 1 h and then the proteinase K was inactivated with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration). 250 μl of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added, and immunoprecipitations were carried out (21Wolfe P.B. Silver P. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7898-7902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 17% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography (22Ito K. Date T. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2123-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One milliliter of M9 media containing 0.5% fructose and 50 μg/ml each amino acid except methionine was inoculated with 20 μl of an overnight MC1061 cell culture containing the mutant plasmid of interest. Growth was allowed to proceed for 3 h, after which expression of the plasmid-encoded protein was induced with 0.2% arabinose. After a 1-h induction, the cells were metabolically labeled for 1 min with 50 μCi of Tran35S-label. Where indicated, CCCP was added at a final concentration of 50 μm, and after 45 s, Tran35S-label was added as before. The cells (500 μl) were transferred to prechilled microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After a 30-min precipitation, the samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography as described above. One-milliliter samples of M9 medium were inoculated with 20 μl of an overnight culture of TolC−cells harboring the plasmid of interest. After allowing growth for 3 h, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh M9 medium having a pH value of either 6.5 or 7.5. Ten microliters of 20% arabinose was added to induce synthesis of the plasmid-encoded proteins, and growth was allowed for 30 min more. The cultures were then labeled with 50 μCi of Tran35S-label for 1 min. Where indicated, 50 μm CCCP (final concentration) was added 45 s prior to labeling. The cells (500 μl) were aliquoted into tubes containing an equal volume prechilled 20% trichloroacetic acid, and immunoprecipitation was performed as before. X-ray films were scanned using an AppleOne Scanner. The insertion efficiencies were then determined by quantitation of the appropriate bands on the film using NIH Image, a public domain program that can be found on-line. 2NIH Image, a public domain program, can be found on-line at the following address:http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. For the signal peptidase cleavage assays, the percent of insertion across the membrane was determined by calculating the percent of the processed band appearing on the gels. For full-length constructs, and leader sequence deletion mutants, two methionines were lost upon signal peptidase cleavage, so we used Equation 1 to determine membrane insertion. Signal peptidase cleavage % =(7/5 processed procoat-lep)7/5 processed procoat-lep + unprocessed procoat-lep×100(Eq. 1) For membrane anchor deletions (Δ48–51, Δ48–53, and Δ48–55), two out of six methionines were lost, so we used Equation 2. Signal peptidase cleavage % =(6/4 processed procoat-lep)6/4 processed procoat-lep + unprocessed procoat-lep×100(Eq. 2) For the protease mapping assays, calculation of insertion efficiencies of procoat-lep was done in a similar manner as above with the following exceptions. The percentage of the protease-resistant fragment (prf) (slightly lower molecular weight than the mature band) was calculated and used as the percentage of membrane insertion. The percentage of cells that were converted to spheroplasts was determined for non-CCCP-treated cells with OmpA and ribulokinase controls and used to calculate the percent of protein that inserted (Equation 3). Spheroplasts (%) = 1−(OmpA remaining after proteinase K treatmentOmpA remaining after proteinase K treatment + untreated OmpA)×100Final insertion (%) = (insertion %/spheroplast %) × 100.(Eq. 3) The summed hydrophobicity (H) of the transmembrane regions of procoat that were manipulated was determined as described (23Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the GES scale (24Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). We calculated H for the wild-type and mutant procoat-lep proteins by adding the hydrophobicity of the uninterrupted stretch of uncharged amino acids within the predicted transmembrane region. The M13 coat protein is synthesized in a precursor form, termed procoat, with a 23-residue signal peptide. Procoat inserts into the membrane as a loop bordered by two hydrophobic domains (25Kuhn A. Rohrer J. Gallusser A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One hydrophobic domain is the signal peptide and the other is a membrane anchor in the mature coat protein. In our studies, the procoat protein contains a leader peptidase fragment of 103 residues fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of procoat, as previously published (13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Kuhn A. Kreil G. Wickner W. Nature. 1986; 322: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This protein is termed procoat-lep (Fig. 1A, lep is depicted by azig-zag line). The wild-type periplasmic domain of procoat-lep (see Fig. 1A) contains the following charged residues: glutamic acid (position 25), aspartic acid (position 27), aspartic acid (position 28), lysine (position 31), and glutamic acid (position 43). Previously, it had been shown that hydrophobic forces play a considerable role in membrane insertion of the wild-type procoat (25Kuhn A. Rohrer J. Gallusser A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,26Soekarjo M. Eisenhawer M. Kuhn A. Vogel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1232-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pmf plays a secondary role for translocation of the acidic loop in the wild-type procoat and only stimulates the membrane insertion across the membrane (13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test whether the pmf can play a primary role in membrane insertion if the hydrophobicity of the signal/membrane anchor is decreased, we first employed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to change the lysine at position 31 and glutamic acid at position 43 to alanines. We termed the resulting construct PClep. All previous studies on the membrane insertion of procoat had utilized constructs that contained the wild-type residues at these positions in order to study the net charge of the loop (13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We next constructed a series of deletion mutants that are deficient in hydrophobic amino acids within either the leader sequence or the membrane anchor sequence, as shown in Fig. 1B. We deleted two, four, and six amino acids in the moderately hydrophobic signal sequence, and four, six, and eight residues in the extremely hydrophobic membrane anchor. The total hydrophobicity for the transmembrane segment from which amino acids were removed was determined (23Lee E. Manoil C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28822-28828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity scale used was the transfer free energy (kcal/mol) of each amino acid side chain from water to a non-polar environment (24Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). We used a protease accessibility assay to analyze the insertion of the procoat mutants into the membrane. We labeled 1 ml of exponentially growing E. coli cells with 100 μCi of Tran35S-label and then converted the cells into spheroplasts using the lysozyme/EDTA method previously described (27Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These cells, or cells lysed with Triton X-100, were digested for 1 h with proteinase K. Aliquots were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to leader peptidase and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Digestion of inserted procoat-lep with the protease results in a protease-resistant fragment (prf) of slightly lower molecular weight than the mature band that is visible after immunoprecipitating with antibody to the carboxyl-terminal leader peptidase epitope, as published previously (13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Kuhn A. Kreil G. Wickner W. Nature. 1986; 322: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We quantitated the relative amount of the precursor form of procoat-lep that remained in the cytoplasm (seeupper band, depicted by p in Fig. 2A, in protease-treated lanes) and compared this to the amount that had inserted across the membrane and was digested with protease (see the protease-resistant lower molecular weight fragment, prf). In addition, the protease-treated samples were compared with an aliquot of spheroplasts which were not subjected to digestion. We also performed a control in which we lysed an aliquot of spheroplasts with Triton X-100 to confirm that the periplasmically situated domains were not protease-resistant. Pulse-chase experiments and studies using IT41 (28Inada T. Court D.L. Ito K. Nakamura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 585-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a temperature-sensitive signal peptidase strain, revealed which bands correspond to the mature and precursor form of the protein (data not shown). The upper band in Fig. 2A(non-protease-treated lanes) represents the precursor protein (p) in the cytoplasm, whereas the lower band(non-protease-treated lanes) corresponds to PClep that had inserted across the membrane and had been cleaved to the mature protein by signal peptidase. In the experiments where deletions were made in the signal sequence, we could not use the processing of procoat to coat by signal peptidase as an indication of insertion. This was due to the reduced efficiency of signal peptidase cleavage caused by the shortened signal peptide. For negatively charged procoat-lep constructs, as the hydrophobicity of each transmembrane segment is incrementally decreased, insertion across the membrane also decreases in stepwise increments (see TableI for percent efficiencies and Fig. 2A for protease mapping data). PClep(−3), the full-length construct, inserts 94% efficiently into the membrane with the pmf present (−CCCP). As can be seen, PC-lep (−3) is efficiently processed by signal peptidase to the mature protein (band below the precursor form). The mature form of PClep (−3) was cleaved to a slightly lower molecular weight form (prf) by proteinase K. For the series of constructs Δ9–10 (−3), Δ9–12(−3), and Δ9–14(−3), which contain increasingly larger deletions in the leader sequence, the amount of prf decreases as the size of the deletion increases (compare lanes 5, 8, and 11 in Fig. 2A). The series of three mutants possessing membrane anchor deletions, Δ48–51(−3), Δ48–53(−3), and Δ48–55(−3) shows the same trend, with the largest deletion almost collapsing insertion at 15%. The major lower bands in the non-protease-treated lanes 1, 4, 7, 13, 16, and 19 are the result of processing by signal peptidase to the mature protein as the periplasmic loop of procoat crosses the membrane. The lowest band seen in lanes 7 and 16is most likely the result of cleavage by an unknown protease. Testing these constructs in the temperature-sensitive signal peptidase strain, showed that the lowest band (f) in these lanes was not the result of signal peptidase cleavage. Fig. 2C shows representative controls for these experiments. We immunoprecipitated an equal portion of sample with antiserum raised against OmpA, a protein that is exported in a pmf-dependent manner to the periplasm (8Zimmermann R. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3920-3925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the pmf, this control shows the degree to which the cells were converted to spheroplasts when comparing the non-protease-treated cells with those that had been digested by proteinase K (compare lanes 1 and 2). We also immunoprecipitated with antiserum to ribulokinase, a cytoplasmic protein. Intact ribulokinase in the protease-treated lanes (seelane 2) indicates that minimal lysis occurred when forming spheroplasts. We had a difficult time obtaining intact spheroplasts for Δ48–55(−3), so the insertion efficiency, when corrected for lysis, is higher than that predicted from the gel (lanes 19 and 20).Table IMutants containing negative charges in the periplasmic loop and their insertion efficiencies with and without the pmfa The constructs contain negatively charged amino acids at positions 25, 27, and 28.b The hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segment under consideration was calculated (24Engelman D.M.

For Δ9–10(−3), Δ9–12(−3), and Δ9–14(−3), H of the signal sequence was determined, and for the other three deletion mutants, H of the signal anchor was calculated.c The insertion efficiencies of each mutant were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab a The constructs contain negatively charged amino acids at positions 25, 27, and 28. b The hydrophobicity of the transmembrane segment under consideration was calculated (24Engelman D.M.

For Δ9–10(−3), Δ9–12(−3), and Δ9–14(−3), H of the signal sequence was determined, and for the other three deletion mutants, H of the signal anchor was calculated. c The insertion efficiencies of each mutant were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We next examined the effects of collapsing the pmf by adding 50 μm CCCP, a protonophore, 45 s before labeling the cells with Tran35S-label. Comparing lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2A with lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2B shows that the insertion of the full-length procoat-lep under these conditions decreases from 95 to about 69%, confirming that this protein is partially dependent on the pmf for insertion (10Zimmermann R. Watts C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6529-6536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), see also Table I. Interestingly, except for the Δ9–10 and Δ9–12 deletion mutants, membrane insertion of the mutants was abolished without a pmf (CCCP-treated cells), as shown by the small amounts of prf produced in the protease-treated lanes. The lower molecular weight band (depicted by a f) in lanes 4–5, 7–8, 10–11, 13–14, 16–17, and 19–20 is most likely the result of proteolysis by an unknown protease within the cytoplasm that occurs downstream of the signal peptidase-processing site. This in vivo proteolytic fragment of procoat does not contain a domain exposed across the membrane since its molecular weight does not shift upon treatment with proteinase K. Even a two-amino acid deletion in the leader sequence (Δ9–10(−3)) has a measurable effect on procoat assembling across the membrane, at 20% (the prf inlane 5 can be discerned directly below the proteolytic fragment f described above). A six amino acid deletion within the signal sequence (Δ9–14(−3)) completely abolishes insertion (lanes 10 and 11). Immunoprecipitating with OmpA antiserum served to confirm that the pmf was actually collapsed (see representative data in Fig. 2C). The precursor form of the protein (proOmpA), which is visible inlanes 4 and 5, is not digested by protease, indicating that this outer membrane protein remained in the cytoplasm. The spheroplasts were mostly intact as shown by immunoprecipitation with antiserum to ribulokinase, a cytoplasmic protein. These results show that the pmf is absolutely required to insert procoat across the membrane when the hydrophobicity is reduced, indicating that the pmf plays a primary role for inserting negatively charged residues across the membrane when the hydrophobic forces of the inserting procoat are compromised. Fig. 3 shows the results of protease accessibility assays on mutants of procoat-lep containing no charges in the periplasmic loop. The glutamic acid residue at position 25 and the aspartic acid residues at positions 27 and 28 were changed to glutamine and asparagine residues, respectively. In addition, the hydrophobic amino acids in the signal and membrane anchor regions (refer to Fig. 1B) were deleted as in the (−3) series of mutants. TableII shows the insertion efficiencies of these seven mutants. As the hydrophobicity is decreased, there is a concomitant decrease in membrane insertion, as evidenced by a decrease in the amount of prf (compare in Fig. 3lanes 4 and 5, and 7 and 8, etc.). These results show hydrophobic forces are important not only to insert a negatively charged region but also to insert an uncharged hydrophilic domain. Next we collapsed the pmf with CCCP. Here, in"

Treatment of cells with the amyloid β-protein, a protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, was found to increase pyrimidine hydrates in mitochondrial DNA (11Bozner P. Grishko V. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Chyan Y.C. Pappolla M.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 1356-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that due to its possible interference with normal DNA metabolism, the presence of TG in DNA could have biological consequences and might contribute to aging and age-related degenerative diseases. In Escherichia coli, TG is repaired by the base excision repair enzyme endonuclease III (EndoIII). This enzyme is a DNA glycosylase/AP-lyase that first removes the TG and then incises the DNA at the resulting abasic site. Recently, eukaryotic homologs of this base excision repair enzyme have been cloned and characterized (12Hilbert T.P. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol.

Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Transcription-coupled repair of TG was reported to be defective in Cockayne syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disease with characteristics of premature aging (19Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Repair of TG was found to be inducible by low doses of ionizing irradiation (20Le X.C. Xing J.Z. Lee J. Leadon S.A. Weinfeld M. Science. 1998; 280: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The fact that a variety of repair mechanisms exist for TG suggests that repair of this DNA lesion is of critical biological importance. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of a 16.5-kilobase pair circular supercoiled genome that encodes components of the electron transport chain. About 85% of the cellular oxygen consumption is consumed by the mitochondrial electron transport chain (reviewed in Ref. 21Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10771-10778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Since mtDNA is localized in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more vulnerable to attack by ROS than nuclear DNA. It is conceivable that the presence of oxidative mtDNA lesions that interfere with mtDNA metabolism leads to mtDNA loss or mutations. Several oxidative DNA lesions have been detected in mtDNA including 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 5-hydroxyhydantoin, 5-hydroxymethylhydantoin, 5-hydroxymethylurea, and 5-hydroxycytosine (22Richter C. Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar, 23Zastawny T.H. Dabrowska M. Jaskolski T. Klimarczyk M. Kulinski L. Koszela A. Szczesniewicz M. Sliwinska M. Witkowski P. Olinski R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1998; 24: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Relatively low levels of EndoIII-sensitive sites have been detected in mtDNA. However, if TG accumulates in mtDNA, mtDNA replication and transcription may be compromised. Consequently, efficient DNA repair of TG may be important for normal mitochondrial function. At present, no study has directly demonstrated the existence of a repair mechanism specific for TG in mitochondria. It has been the notion that mitochondria were devoid of DNA repair since repair of pyrimidine dimers was not observed (24Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2777-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, more recent reports have documented the removal of other types of mtDNA damage including alkylation lesions (25LeDoux S.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these and other studies suggest the existence of mitochondrial base excision repair, little is known about the mechanism of oxidative DNA damage processing in mitochondria. Purification of mtDNA repair enzymes in sufficient amounts to allow detailed characterization of the repair process is difficult, and eukaryotic oxidative DNA damage processing enzymes are generally expressed at low levels. In addition, the isolation of sufficient amounts of pure mitochondria is a limiting factor in the purification procedure. As a result, only a few mitochondrial DNA repair enzymes involved in base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage have been characterized. Tomkinson et al. (30Tomkinson A.E. Bonk R.T. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12532-12537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described two class II AP endonuclease-like activities in mitochondria from mouse plasmacytoma cells. In our laboratory, a mitochondrial enzymatic activity specific for 8-oxodG (mtODE) was recently partially purified from rat liver mitochondria (31Croteau D.L. ap Rhys C.M.J. Hudson E.K. Dianov G.L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) recently reconstituted base excision repair of an AP site with purified Xenopus laevis mitochondrial AP endonuclease, mtDNA ligase, and mtDNA polymerase γ. Tomkinsonet al. (33Tomkinson A.E. Bonk R.T. Kim J. Bartfeld N. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) identified three mitochondrial endonucleases that recognized DNA lesions induced by high levels of UV light. These enzymes were not well characterized, and no specific substrates were reported. Here, we describe the purification and characterization of a mitochondrial enzyme from rat liver that processes TG and abasic sites. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence for the existence of a mitochondrial base excision repair enzyme for TG. The enzyme shares functional similarities with E. coli EndoIII and the mammalian EndoIII homologs. All chemicals were, unless otherwise stated, from Sigma. Livers were obtained from 6-month-old male Wistar rats (Animal Colony of Gerontology Research Center, Baltimore). Percoll and chromatography equipment were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protease inhibitors were from Boehringer Mannheim. [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products and [α-32P]ddATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. NensorbTM-20 nucleic acid purification cartridges were from NEN Life Science Products. Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. E. coli endonuclease III (EndoIII) and E. coli endonuclease IV (EndoIV) were from Trevigen. E. coli Fpg protein was kindly provided by Dr. A. Grollmann (Stony Brook, NY). Uracil DNA glycosylase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. T4-polynucleotide kinase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Terminal nucleotidyltransferase was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Centricon-10 and Centriprep-10 concentrators were obtained from Amicon, Inc. Gel electrophoresis equipment and reagents were from Bio-Rad. pBluescript II KS+ (PKS+) plasmid was obtained from Stratagene. Rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against native EndoIII was a generous gift from Dr. R. Cunningham (Albany, NY). PKS+ plasmid was modified with osmium tetroxide in a reaction mixture (volume, 250 μl) containing 1.2 mm OsO4, 0.4 m NaCl, 50 μg of PKS+ and incubated for 60 min at 70 °C. DNA was precipitated by addition of 0.2 volume of ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in 100 μl of TE, pH 8.0. Supercoiled molecules were isolated from nicked molecules on a sucrose gradient. Plasmid incision assays were performed in the following mixture: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mmKCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng of PKS+, and amounts of protein indicated in the legend of Fig. 1. The reaction mixture was incubated for various times as indicated in Fig. 1. Nicked molecules were separated from supercoiled molecules on a 1% neutral agarose gel and visualized by scanning after ethidium bromide staining using a FluorImagerTM. The intensity of bands representing supercoiled and nicked forms were quantified with ImageQuant software. The number of sites per plasmid were calculated using the formula: −ln(1.4 × intensity of supercoiled form)/(1.4 × intensity of supercoiled form + intensity of nicked form). The presence of OsO4-induced lesions was confirmed by incubating 100 ng of damaged plasmid for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.02–2 units of EndoIII (∼0.8 enzyme-sensitive sites/molecule). TableI shows the sequences of the 28-mer oligonucleotide substrates used in this study. Important features of the oligonucleotide are underlined. The thymine-containing oligonucleotide (T) and its complementary strand were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The 8-oxodG (OG), AP site control (APC) oligonucleotide, uracil-containing oligonucleotide (U), its complementary strand, and the complementary strand to the 8-oxodG-containing oligo were from Midland Certified Reagent Co. Oligonucleotides were purified on a 20% polyacrylamide gel prior to use. To generate the thymine glycol (TG)-containing substrate, 1 μg of thymine-containing oligo was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 15 mmOsO4 and 2% (v/v) pyridine. 3G. Dianov, unpublished observations. Oligonucleotides were separated from unreacted OsO4 and pyridine using NensorbTM-20 nucleic acid purification cartridges. To generate an AP site containing oligo (AP), the uracil-containing oligo (U) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase. To demonstrate that AP sites were generated, the AP oligo was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 unit of EndoIV. About 99% of the AP oligo was incised.Table IOligonucleotides usedNameAbbreviationSequenceThymineT5′ GAA CGA CAG ATG ACA CGA CAG ACA AGC A 3′3′ CTT GCT GTC TAC TGT GCT GTC TGT TCG T 5′Thymine glycolTG5′ GAA CGA CAG ATGG ACA CGA CAG ACA AGC A 3′3′ CTT GCT GTC TAC TGT GCT GTC TGT TCG T 5′UracilU5′ GAA CGA CTG TUA CTT GAC TGC TAC TGA T 3′3′ CTT GCT GAC AAT GAA CTG ACG ATG ACT A 5′AP-site controlAPC5′ GAA CGA CTG TTA CTT GAC TGC TAC TGA T 3′3′ CTT GCT GAC AAT GAA CTG ACG ATG ACT A 5′AP-siteAP5′ GAA CGA CTG TAPA CTT GAC TGC TAC TGA T 3′3′ CTT GCT GAC AAT GAA CTG ACG ATG ACT A 5′GuanineG5′ GAA CGA CTG TGA CTT GAC TGC TAC TGA T 3′3′ CTT GCT GAC ACT GAA CTG ACG ATG ACT A 5′8-Oxo-dGOG5′ GAA CGA CTG TOGA CTT GAC TGC TAC TGA T 3′3′ CTT GCT GAC ACT GAA CTG ACG ATG ACT A 5′ Open table in a new tab For the 5′-end-labeling of the substrates, T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP were used. Terminal nucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]ddATP were used to radiolabel substrates on the 3′-end. NensorbTM-20 nucleic acid purification cartridges were used to separate labeled oligonucleotides from unincorporated nucleoside triphosphates and enzymes. The oligonucleotides were annealed to complementary oligonucleotides by heating to 80 °C in a mixture containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA and subsequently slowly cooling to room temperature. Incision reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl in a mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5.5 nm32P-labeled oligonucleotide duplex, column fractions in the amounts indicated under “Results,” and 5–10% glycerol. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h-18 h depending on the purity of the fraction tested. Oligonucleotides were precipitated by addition of 4 μl of 11 m ammonium acetate, 1 μl of 20 μg/μl glycogen, and 62 μl of 100% ethanol and pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in formamide loading dye consisting of 90% formamide, 0.002% bromphenol blue, and 0.002% xylene cyanol. After heating for 2 min at 80 °C, samples were electrophoresed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, TBE gel. Because of the heat lability of the AP site, samples containing the AP site oligo were heated to 55 °C prior to loading, instead of 80 °C. Gels were first subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C after electrophoresis. PhosphorScreens were exposed to the frozen gel and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager combined with ImageQuant software. 1 unit of mtTGendo activity is defined as 1 fmol of TG-containing oligonucleotide incised during a 4-h incubation at 37 °C. Mitochondria were purified from rat liver as described (31Croteau D.L. ap Rhys C.M.J. Hudson E.K. Dianov G.L. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27338-27344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Mitochondria obtained from 4 rat livers (∼8 g) were pooled and resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A with 300 mm KCl. Buffer A consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.015% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The following protease inhibitors were added prior to use: 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml chymostatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm benzamide hydrochloride, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm E-64. Mitochondria were lysed by slowly adding 10% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%. The mitochondrial lysate was subsequently clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 130,000 ×g in a SW-50.1 rotor (Fraction I). The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was applied to a 25-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column, equilibrated with buffer A containing 300 mm KCl. After application of Fraction I to the matrix, the column was washed with 125 ml of the same buffer. 5-ml fractions were collected, and fractions with an absorbance at 280 nm higher than 0.2 absorption units were pooled, and the salt concentration was adjusted to 100 mm KCl (Fraction II). Fraction II was loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography HR 10/10 Mono S column (equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl). The column was washed with 25 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient from 100 mm to 1 m KCl. 1-ml fractions were collected and dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 100 mmKCl and assayed for mtTGendo activity. Three distinct activities recognizing the TG-containing oligo were detected, and the peaks eluted at ∼410, ∼550, and ∼650 mm KCl, respectively. The most abundant activity eluting at 410 mm KCl was named mtTGendo, and active fractions were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged in a Centricon-10 concentrator for buffer A containing 100 mm KCl without 0.015% Triton X-100. 4 mammonium sulfate (pH 7.6 adjusted with KOH) was slowly added to a final concentration of 1 m (Fraction III), and the sample was applied to a fast protein liquid chromatography HR 5/5 phenyl-Superose column (equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and 1 m ammonium sulfate, without 0.015% Triton X-100). After washing with 5 ml of the same buffer, the column was eluted with a 5-ml linear gradient from 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. 400-μl fractions were collected in tubes that contained 0.6 μl of 10% Triton X-100 (to adjust each fraction to a final concentration of 0.015%). Fractions were dialyzed for ∼4 h against buffer A containing 100 mm KCl and then dialyzed against fresh buffer overnight. mtTGendo activity was assayed, and the peak activity was found to elute at ∼230 mm ammonium sulfate. Active fractions were pooled and the buffer was exchanged in a Centricon-10 concentrator for buffer A containing 300 mm KCl and concentrated to a volume of ∼200 μl (Fraction IV). Fraction IV was loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography HR 10/30 Superdex 75 gel filtration/size exclusion column equilibrated on buffer A containing 300 mm KCl. The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000, albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and ribonuclease A (low molecular weight standards; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with 30 ml of the same buffer, and 400-μl fractions were collected. MtTGendo activity was directly assayed, and active fractions 17 and 18 were pooled and dialyzed against 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.015% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and stored at −20 °C (Fraction V). By using differential centrifugation and Percoll gradient centrifugation purified mitochondria, we identified mitochondrial enzymatic activities that recognize OsO4-induced DNA damage. Initially, we observed nicking of OsO4-modified plasmid upon incubation with a DEAE-fractionated mitochondrial extract. Fig. 1A shows increased conversion of OsO4-modified supercoiled plasmid molecules toward nicked molecules with increasing time of incubation with the DEAE-fractionated extract. In Fig. 1B quantification of the number of sites/plasmids recognized by the DEAE-fractionated mitochondrial extract is shown. A small amount of the observed nicking (∼0.2 sites/plasmid) was nonspecific as observed in the lanes in which unmodified plasmid was incubated with extract. After 24 h of incubation, damage-specific incision was ∼0.4 sites/plasmid (∼50% of the EndoIII-sensitive sites). Incubation of unfractionated extract with plasmid DNA resulted in complete degradation of the substrate, presumably because of mitochondrial endonucleases (34Cummings O.W. King T.C. Holden J.A. Low R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2005-2015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Gerschenson M. Houmiel K.L. Low R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since OsO4 mainly introduces TG (36Higgins S.A. Frenkel K. Cummings A. Teebor G.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the enzymatic activity was followed using a radiolabeled TG-containing oligonucleotide. Upon 32P labeling and digestion of the OsO4-modified thymine-containing oligonucleotide with EndoIII, >80% of the modified oligonucleotide was found to be incised (Fig. 2, lane 6). Migration of the incision product of EndoIII-digested OsO4-modified oligonucleotide was similar to the incision product produced by EndoIII digestion of an oligonucleotide containing a single AP site at the identical position (11th nucleotide relative to the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide, see Fig. 8, A and B, lanes 3 and 5). No other incision products indicative of cytosine modification were observed when the OsO4-modified thymine-containing oligonucleotide was extensively incubated with E. coli EndoIII. This strongly suggests that, in our hands, only the single thymine was converted to TG. No incision was observed upon digestion of the TG oligo with either EndoIV (Fig. 2, lane 7) or Fpg protein (Fig. 2, lane 8) demonstrating that no AP sites or Fpg-sensitive sites were generated during the preparation of the oligonucleotides.Figure 8Determination of the 5′- and 3′-incision products of mtTGendo. A, 5′-labeled oligonucleotide containing either a single thymine glycol or apurinic site was incubated with mtTGendo or with bacterial repair enzymes, and the resulting 10-mers with different 3′-ends were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea, TBE gel sequencing gel.B, region of the gel showing 10-mer incision products.C, 3′-labeled oligonucleotides containing a single thymine or thymine glycol were incubated with mtTGendo or with E. coli endonuclease III. For these experiments, mtTGendo was prepared as described except that the phenyl-Superose column chromatography step was omitted. The left panel shows identical migration of the 17-mer incision products generated by digestion of the 3′-labeled TG oligonucleotide with either EndoIII (lane 2) or mtTGendo (lane 6). Lane 7 (right panel) shows migration of the 10-mer incision product generated by EndoIII digestion of 5′-labeled TG oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purification scheme for the mitochondrial TG endonuclease is summarized in Table II. The mitochondrial lysate (Fraction I) was fractionated on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Fraction II). Fraction II was subjected to fractionation on a Mono S column with a 100–1000 mm KCl linear gradient, and 1-ml fractions were collected. All Mono-S fractions were assayed for incision activity on a TG-containing oligonucleotide. Incision was only observed within Mono-S fractions 18–33. The extent of incision observed in these fractions was quantified and plotted along with the KCl concentration against the fraction number (Fig. 3B). Three separable incision activities that recognize TG were found and the peaks from these activities eluted at ∼410, ∼550, and ∼650 mm KCl. The incision observed was specific for TG, because the oligo does not contain EndoIV or Fpg-sensitive sites (Fig. 2). The most abundant TG-incising fraction eluted at ∼410 mm KCl. The active fractions were pooled, and the KCl concentration was adjusted to 100 mm KCl (Fraction III) and further purified on a phenyl-Superose column (Fraction IV) and a Superdex 75 column (Fraction V). Fraction V was entitled mitochondrial TG endonuclease (mtTGendo). Total and specific activities for each fraction are shown in Table II. We achieved roughly a 450-fold purification.Table IIPurification of mtTGendo from rat liver mitochondriaFractionVolumeProteintotal activityaOne unit of activity is defined as 1 fmol of 28-mer TG-containing oligonucleotide incised per 4-h incubation.specific activityPurificationmlmg103 units103units/mg−foldI.

The dnaB gene from Thermus aquaticus was isolated and cloned, and its gene product was expressed and purified to homogeneity. A helicase assay was developed, and optimal conditions forT. aquaticus DnaB activity were determined using a forked duplex DNA substrate. The activity required a hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate and both 5′- and 3′-single-stranded DNA tail regions. Under conditions of single enzymatic turnover, the lengths of the 5′- and 3′-single-stranded regions were varied, and 6–10 nucleotides of the 5′-single-stranded tail and 21–30 nucleotides of the 3′-single-stranded tail markedly stimulated the unwinding rate. These data suggest that DnaB from T. aquaticus interacts with both DNA single-stranded tails during unwinding and that a greater portion of the 3′-tail is in contact with the protein. Two models are consistent with these data. In one model, the 5′-single stranded region passes through the central hole of the DnaB ring, and the 3′-tail makes extensive contact with the outside of the protein. In the other model, the 3′-single-stranded region passes through the DnaB ring, and the outside of the protein contacts the 5′-tail.

It has been proposed that the protein unwinds double-stranded DNA at a replication fork, providing single-stranded DNA templates for DnaG primase and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (8Baker T.A.

The protein exhibits helicase activityin vitro, catalyzing the conversion of double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA with concomitant hydrolysis of ATP (9Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E.

DnaB is homologous to two other characterized hexameric helicases involved in DNA replication, the gene 4 protein from T7 phage and the gene 41 protein from T4 phage (11Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V.

It has been shown that members of this helicase family unwind DNA with 5′ to 3′ polarity and require both 5′- and 3′-single-stranded tail regions for efficient unwinding of duplex DNA (10LeBowitz J.H.

Electron microscopy studies of Escherichia coli DnaB and gene 4 from T7 have demonstrated that these protein hexamers are ring-shaped with a central hole that is wide enough to fit single-stranded DNA (2Martin M.C.S.

In the case of the T7 gene 4 protein, it has also been shown by electron microscopy that a DNA strand is present in the central hole of the protein ring (20Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S.

We are interested in studying the mechanism of DnaB-catalyzed unwinding by determining the crystal structure of DnaB in complex with forked duplex DNA. Proteins from thermophilic organisms are often easier to purify and may crystallize more readily than their mesophilic counterparts. Therefore, we isolated and cloned the gene forThermus aquaticus dnaB, overexpressed its gene product, and purified the protein to homogeneity. To design DNA substrates for cocrystallization with DnaB and to begin establishing its mechanism, we need to know what single-stranded regions of DNA are contacting the protein during unwinding. To address this issue, we developed a helicase assay using a forked duplex DNA substrate. We then varied the lengths of the single-stranded tail regions and found that the first 6–10 nucleotides of the 5′-tail and the first 21–30 nucleotides of the 3′-tail emanating from the duplex region markedly stimulated the unwinding rate. Thus, these data suggest that the 3′-tail makes more extensive contacts with T. aquaticus DnaB than the 5′-tail. Two models may account for these data. In one, the 5′-single-stranded tail passes through the central hole of the protein hexamer, whereas the 3′-tail makes more extensive contact with the outside of the protein toroid. In the second model, the 3′-tail passes through the central hole, and the 5′-tail makes less extensive contact with the outside of the protein ring. These two alternative models would position the protein ring around the lagging or leading strands of the DNA, respectively, during replication. Genomic DNA from T. aquaticus YT-1 strain was prepared as described previously (22Lawyer F.C. Stoffel S. Saiki R.K. Myambo K. Drummond R. Gelfand D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6427-6437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the initial PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GTPγS, guanosine-5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine product, 50-μl reactions were set up with 50 ng of genomic DNA, 20 μmeach primer, 3.3 mm dGTP and dCTP, 1.7 mm dATP and dTTP, 1× Vent buffer (New England Biolabs), and 1 μl of Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The forward primer was GG(GC)TC(GC)ATCGAGCAGGACGC(GC)GA(CT), which was designed to include the amino acid region corresponding to 406 to 413 of DnaB from E. coli. The reverse primer was 5′-(GC)GG(GC)CCGTT(GC)CGCTG(CT)TT-3′, which was designed to be complementary to residues 439–445. For the PCR, the melting conditions were 1 min at 95 °C, the annealing conditions were 1 min at a temperature that was decreased stepwise from 60 to 45 °C in 0.5 °C increments (31 cycles), and the extension conditions were 2.5 min at 72 °C. To isolate regions 5′ and 3′ to the initial product, inverse PCR was performed. Templates for inverse PCR were prepared by digestingT. aquaticus genomic DNA with various restriction enzymes. The restriction enzymes were chosen to yield products of average size between 500 and 2000 base pairs. The average size product was estimated by determining the frequency of a particular restriction site within all T. aquaticus genomic DNA sequence that had been deposited in the data base. After the restriction enzyme had been heat inactivated, the digest was religated at a low (2 nm) DNA concentration to favor unimolecular reactions, thus yielding circular fragments of genomic DNA. Ligation reactions were performed with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Inverse PCR was performed using primers directed away from each other and against regions of dnaB that had been sequenced. The PCRs were set up as above except that the annealing temperature was decreased in 0.3 °C increments from 70 °C to 60 °C (35 cycles). Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) instead of Deep Vent DNA Polymerase was used in some of these inverse PCRs. To isolate the entire gene, rTth DNA polymerase, XL (Perkin-Elmer) was used. The forward primer contained the N terminus of the gene, and the reverse primer was complementary to a region 3′ to the C terminus. The PCR was performed as above with a 5-min extension time. The full-length gene was cloned into a pET-22b(+) expression vector (Novagen) usingNdeI and SacI restriction sites. The pET22b(+) vector containing the dnaB gene was transformed into BL-21 cells. The transformed cells were grown in 10 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin in a stirred, aerated fermentor at 37 °C. When the cells reached an A600 of 0.6, the temperature was decreased to 30 °C, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 100 μm to induce gene expression. Three hours later, 34 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation. From this point, all manipulations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. The 34 g of cells were resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A, which contained 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. The cells were then lysed with a French press. MgCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm. The lysate was then heated at 65 °C for 20 min followed by chilling on ice for 20 min. The cells were then spun at 38,000 rpm in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman) for 60 min. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.22 μm low protein binding filter (Fraction I). A Q source column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was preequilibrated with Buffer B, which contained 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT. Fraction I was loaded onto the column and the column was then washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer B. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of Buffer B to Buffer B containing an additional 450 mm NaCl. DnaB eluted at 300–345 mm NaCl (Fraction II). Fraction II was dialyzed against Buffer C, which contained 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 0.02% sodium azide. After dialysis, the sample was loaded onto a HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was preequilibrated with Buffer C. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer C followed by elution with a linear gradient of Buffer C to Buffer C containing an additional 450 mm NaCl. DnaB eluted between 200 and 250 mmNaCl (Fraction III). Fraction III was dialyzed against Buffer D, which contained 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 0.02% sodium azide. The sample was then concentrated with an Amicon Ultrafiltration device followed by an Amicon Centricon device. The concentration of protein was 11.1 mg/ml at this point. The final yield was 112 mg of purified protein from a 10-liter cell growth. 80% glycerol was added to the sample to achieve a final concentration of 50% glycerol. The sample was then stored at −20 °C until further use. A reducing, 10–20% polyacrylamide gel was run in SDS using the Laemmli buffer system (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gel was run at a constant 175 V for 45 min and then stained with Coomassie Blue as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Molecular weight marker standards were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (catalog no. 17-0446-01). Accurate protein concentration and amino acid content were determined by performing amino acid analysis on triplicate samples of purified protein. This analysis was carried out by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (Keck Facility) on a Beckman model 6300 ion exchange instrument following acid hydrolysis. All DNA sequencing was performed by the Keck Facility using Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencers. The sequence reactions utilize fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (dRhodamine Terminators) and Taq FS DNA polymerase in a thermal cycling protocol. All DNA oligomers were synthesized by the Keck Facility and gel-purified. The 3′-tailed oligomer was labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The kinase was denatured by heating to 65 °C for 20 min. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed with a G-50 Sephadex spin column. This labeled strand was mixed at a 1:2 ratio with the unlabeled, complementary strand. Identical helicase reaction rates were obtained when this ratio was 1:1 (data not shown), and the excess unlabeled strand was added to enhance annealing. Two equivalent unlabeled strands of the same 1:2 ratio were added to the labeled mixture in a 5-fold excess. The unlabeled mixture was added in excess to ensure that the concentration of substrate was accurate. The strands were then annealed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The strands were then preequilibrated at 55 °C for 3 h. This step ensured that the percentage of duplex remained constant throughout the assay in the absence of enzyme. Standard conditions for the helicase assay were as follows: 500 nm T. aquaticus DnaB helicase, 5 mm GTP, 1 nm DNA substrate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm sodium Bicine, pH 9.0, 50 mmpotassium glutamate, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 55 °C. The reagents in the assay were added in the following order on ice: buffer, DNA substrate, enzyme, and finally GTP. After incubation at 55 °C for the time indicated in the text, the reactions were quenched by placing on ice and adding stop buffer to achieve a final concentration of 1% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. The samples were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C until they were ready for final analysis by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Single strand product was separated from duplex substrate by running the samples through a 12% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide: bis) in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris-Borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 5 W at room temperature for 1–2 h. The variation in time depended upon the lengths of the DNA species in the assay. After the gel was run, it was dried at 50 °C for 40 min. The gel was then exposed to a Bio-Imaging Plate (Fuji Photo Film Co.). Band intensities were quantified and background counts subtracted using the MacBAS software package. The percentage of single strand was typically ∼ 0–10% in an unreacted sample and ∼95–100% in a heat-denatured sample. To normalize for the slight variability in these values, the percentage of product was calculated using the following equation, %Product=(%SSs−%SSd)/(%SSh−%SSd)(Eq. 1) where %SSs is the percentage of single strand in the sample lane of interest, %SSd is the percentage of single strand in the unreacted duplex lane, and %SSh is the percentage of single strand in the heat-denatured lane. The dnaB gene from T. aquaticusisolated and cloned using the technique of PCR. The complete amino acid sequences of DnaB from five other bacterial species had been deposited in the data base at the time of cloning. Based on these sequences and the codon usage frequency of T. aquaticus, degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed (25Dalphin M.E. Brown C.M. Stockwell P.A. Tate W.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Peterson M.G. Tjian R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using genomic DNA as a template, a 120-base pair DNA fragment was initially isolated and sequenced. This fragment encoded an amino acid sequence that it is highly similar to DnaB from other bacterial species within the region between the primers. The technique of inverse PCR was then used to isolate regions 5′ and 3′ to the original sequence (27Silver J. McPherson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 137-146Google Scholar). The N terminus of the gene was identified by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGTAGG) situated 10 base pairs upstream to an ATG initiation codon. This 5′-region was amplified and sequenced in triplicate because it was used as a primer for subsequent PCR gene amplification. The entire gene was PCR-amplified in triplicate using one primer containing the 5′-initiation site and a second primer complementary to a region 3′ to the C terminus. These three products were then cloned and sequenced. Because amplification and sequencing were performed in independent, triplicate experiments the gene sequence was unambiguously confirmed. The predicted amino acid sequence of the dnaB gene product yields a protein of 49 kDa per monomer. The GC content of the gene is 67%, typical of genes from this species. The protein has 48% amino acid identity and 69% amino acid similarity compared with DnaB fromE coli. Regions within this gene that are highly conserved among other species (12Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) are well conserved for T. aquaticusDnaB. The protein has 1 cysteine and 14 methionines, which may be useful in future crystallography work. The T. aquaticus dnaB gene was then cloned into a T7 expression system (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). Induction and purification of the DnaB gene product were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final protein sample was ∼ 95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (not shown). The protein ran according to its predicted molecular weight on this gel. Once purified product was obtained, amino acid analysis was performed to confirm the correct identity of the product and to determine an accurate extinction coefficient, which was calculated to be ε280 = 0.46 liter g−1 cm−1. To determine what 5′- and 3′-tail lengths of a forked duplex DNA substrate are bound by T. aquaticus DnaB during unwinding, we developed a helicase assay. In this assay, the rates of unwinding under conditions of single enzyme turnover are measured for a series of forked duplex DNA substrates with various 5′- and 3′-single-stranded tail lengths. As the tail is shortened beyond a length that is critical for binding and/or unwinding, a marked decrease in helicase rate should be observed. The standard substrate used in this helicase reaction had a 22-base pair duplex region and contained a 30-nucleotide deoxythymidylate (d(pT)30) in each single-stranded tail region (Fig. 1). The duplex region had a melting temperature of ∼65 °C, and the poly(T) base composition of either tail ensured that there was no interaction between the tails. The strand with the 3′-tail was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and the conversion of this strand from duplex to single strand was monitored with native gel electrophoresis. Conditions for the helicase assay were optimized to achieve a maximum rate of product formation. These conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, 500 nm enzyme, 1 nm DNA substrate, and 5 mm GTP were incubated at pH 9.0 at 55 °C for various times. A low substrate concentration was used to slow the rate of product reannealing. Furthermore, enzyme concentration was in vast excess compared with substrate concentration, ensuring that the kinetics observed were for single-enzyme turnover. Multiple-turnover kinetic data can be dominated byKoff rates and may be inadequate to assess productive binding. A time course for this helicase assay was then performed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–13, and Fig. 2B). Nearly 50% of the substrate was converted to product in 2 min in the presence of 5 mm GTP, but there was no observable unwinding without added GTP. Although protein-dependent conversion of double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA is the hallmark of helicase activity, if the substrate and product are in rapid exchange at equilibrium, a reagent with single-stranded binding activity can sequester the product and drive the equilibrium toward product formation. This nonenzymatic activity is seen for single-stranded binding proteins such as E. coli single-stranded binding protein and T4 gp32 (29Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To determine whether this could occur under these assay conditions, a 22-nucleotide single-stranded DNA oligomer that was complementary to the duplex region of the labeled strand was added to the reaction in ≥20-fold excess. This “trap” DNA oligomer contained no 5′-single-stranded tail. If melting occurs, this excess DNA should bind to the released labeled single strand and inhibit the reverse reaction. Because this excess unlabeled strand contained no tail region, its duplex with labeled strand could be electrophoretically separated from substrate. After 2 h, there was only a ∼6% decrease in substrate concentration, suggesting that the substrate and product were not in rapid exchange relative to the time course of the reaction (Fig. 2A, lanes 14–19, and Fig. 2C). Enzymatic unwinding is characterized by coupled hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate. To determine whether the helicase activity mediated byT. aquaticus DnaB was dependent upon nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis, the reaction was performed in the presence of protein and various nucleotide analogs (Fig. 3A). After a 30-min incubation, nearly all of the substrate was converted to product in the presence of 5 mm ATP or GTP. By contrast, incubation with the same concentration of the nucleoside diphosphate GDP yielded no product. Similarly, incubation with the slowly hydrolyzable analogs GTPγS, AMP-PNP, and AMP-PCP yielded only 9, 4, and 3% product, respectively, after 30 min. These data suggest that hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate is required for helicase activity by T. aquaticus DnaB. Incubation with either ADP or ATPγS resulted in accumulation of radiolabel in the well of the gel (“well shift”) that was difficult to reverse. We therefore cannot assess the enzymatic conversion to product in the presence of these analogs. Other nucleoside triphosphates could stimulate the helicase activity of DnaB. As shown in Fig. 3B, any of the ribonucleoside triphosphates resulted in nearly complete conversion to product in 30 min, whereas the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were generally less effective. The protein concentration dependence for the reaction, expressed in hexamers, is shown in Fig. 4A. DnaB at a concentration of 5 nm resulted in nearly 50% product in 30 min, and 50 nm DnaB resulted in nearly 90% conversion to product. These concentrations were in excess of substrate, which was at 1 nm concentration. The large excess of protein required here for activity is atypical for an enzymatic reaction. However, this relationship is typical for the hexameric helicases (10LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12426-12434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also noted a log/linear relationship between protein concentration and activity. Again, this is not typical of most enzymatic reactions, but it has been reported for the T4 gene 41 helicase (13Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12426-12434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unusual concentration dependence for hexameric helicase activity may be explained if the enzyme dissociates at low protein concentrations. There was a steep pH dependence for activity, with the protein was far more active under alkaline conditions (Fig. 4B). Greater than 90% conversion to product was observed at pH 8 or 9. Because the activity increase was largest in the pH range 5–8, it is more likely that some group(s) on the protein was being titrated as opposed to the DNA because DNA has no group with a pK a in this pH range. The salt dependence of the reaction rate was also determined. The addition of 50 mm potassium glutamate resulted in a slight enhancement of activity compared with 0 mm potassium glutamate (Fig. 4C). However, each reaction contained 10 mm NaCl from the protein storage buffer, as well as 25 mm sodium Bicine and 10 mm MgCl2. Higher concentrations of potassium glutamate were inhibitory in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with salt-mediated disruption of a critical ionic interaction, possibly between the protein and the DNA. Replacing potassium glutamate with sodium glutamate, sodium chloride, or potassium chloride resulted in very little change in the percentage of product formed (not shown). To examine the role of the 5′- and 3′-single-stranded tail regions in the reaction, the assay was performed with a substrate containing a d(pT)30-3′-tail and no 5′-tail or with a substrate containing a d(pT)30-5′-tail and no 3′-tail. In either case, there was no conversion to product within a 2-h time course, indicating that both tails are required for activity (not shown). These data further support the claim that DnaB is acting as a helicase and not a single-stranded binding protein because it is unlikely that product binding is two-tail-dependent. A helicase assay is complicated by the fact that the single-stranded products can reanneal to form substrate. Thus, it is important to measure the rate of product reannealing. A substrate containing a d(pT)30-5′-tail and no 3′-tail was heat-denatured and then allowed to reanneal in the absence and presence of protein under the conditions used in these assays. This substrate was chosen because DnaB could not unwind it. Without protein, the half-time for reannealing was ∼30 min (Fig. 5). However, the half-time time for reannealing increased to ∼ 120 min in the presence of DnaB, suggesting that the enzyme inhibits reannealing. This inhibition may be caused by transient protein interaction with the single-stranded products (30Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Arai K.-I. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5260-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the results presented here are based upon the first 30 min of the reaction, product reannealing will not substantially alter the reaction kinetics presented. However, the percentage of product reported will slightly underestimate the total product produced, particularly at 30-min time points. The length of the 5′-tail was then varied stepwise from d(pT)30 to d(pT)0, whereas"
https://openalex.org/W2086467908,"We completely sequenced 13,936 nucleotides (nt) of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of wild rice (W-dsRNA). A single long open reading frame (13,719 nt) containing the conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase was located in the coding strand. The identity between entire nucleotide sequence of W-dsRNA and that of the dsRNA of temperate japonica rice (J-dsRNA, 13,952 nt) was 75.5%. A site-specific discontinuity (nick) was identified at nt 1,197 from the 5′ end of the coding strand of W-dsRNA. This nick is also located at nt 1,211 from the 5′ end in the coding strand of J-dsRNA. The dsRNA copy number was increased more than 10-fold in pollen grains of both rice plants. This remarkable increase may be responsible for the highly efficient transmission of J-dsRNA via pollen that we already reported. J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA were also efficiently transmitted to interspecific F1 hybrids. Seed-mediated dsRNA transmission to F2 plants was also highly efficient when the maternal parent was wild rice. The efficiency of dsRNA transmission to F2 plants was reduced when the maternal parent was temperate japonica rice; however, the reduced rates in F2 plants were returned to high levels in F3 plants.

A site-specific discontinuity (nick) was identified at nt 1,197 from the 5′ end of the coding strand of W-dsRNA. This nick is also located at nt 1,211 from the 5′ end in the coding strand of J-dsRNA. The dsRNA copy number was increased more than 10-fold in pollen grains of both rice plants. This remarkable increase may be responsible for the highly efficient transmission of J-dsRNA via pollen that we already reported. J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA were also efficiently transmitted to interspecific F1 hybrids. Seed-mediated dsRNA transmission to F2 plants was also highly efficient when the maternal parent was wild rice. The efficiency of dsRNA transmission to F2 plants was reduced when the maternal parent was temperate japonica rice; however, the reduced rates in F2 plants were returned to high levels in F3 plants.

Most of these dsRNAs have no obvious effect on the phenotype of the host plant, with the exception of the dsRNA in V. faba, that is associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (4Grill L.K. Garger S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7043-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Turpen T. Grill L.K. Garger S.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These large dsRNAs are not associated with distinct virus-like particles (2Zabalgogeazcoa I.A. Gildow F.E. Plant Sci. 1992; 83: 187-194Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Fukuhara T. Moriyama H. Pak J.Y. Hyakutake T. Nitta T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). They are present at a (low) constant concentration in host plants (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and replicate using their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (5Lefebvre A. Scalla R. Pfeiffer P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although they are usually found in the cytoplasm of host plant cells, they are effectively transmitted to progeny plants via pollen as much as by ova (2Zabalgogeazcoa I.A. Gildow F.E. Plant Sci. 1992; 83: 187-194Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because all attempts (mechanical inoculation, graft transmission, and aphid transmission) other than by seeds failed to transmit dsRNA to dsRNA-free plants, dsRNA is probably transmitted to progeny plants via seeds alone (2Zabalgogeazcoa I.A. Gildow F.E. Plant Sci. 1992; 83: 187-194Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Valverde R.A. Nameth S. Abdalha O. Al-Musa O. Desjardins P. Dodds J.A.

Thus, these endogenous dsRNAs have some intriguing plasmid-like properties that differ from those of conventional plant RNA viruses (16Brown G.G. Finnegan P.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 117: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNA (about 14 kb) is a feature of many strains of temperate and tropical japonica rice (cultivated rice,Oryza sativa) and of one strain of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon W-1714, an ancestor of O. sativa). It is not found in any strains of indica rice (cultivated rice, O. sativa), which rarely hybridizes with japonica rice in the field (13Fukuhara T. Moriyama H. Pak J.Y. Hyakutake T. Nitta T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These dsRNAs occur in every tissue as well as at every developmental stage, and they are transmitted very efficiently (more than 98%) to progeny plants via seeds (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The dsRNAs are maintained at an almost constant concentration (100 copies/cell) by host plants from generation to generation (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, dsRNA copy number increases about 10-fold when host cells are grown in suspension culture (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The entire sequence (13,952 nucleotides (nt)) of the dsRNA from the temperate japonica rice (cv. Nipponbare, J-dsRNA) has been determined. It consists of a long open reading frame (ORF; 13,716 nt, 4,572 amino acid residues) containing the conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase (18Moriyama H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The coding strand of J-dsRNA contains a site-specific discontinuity (nick) at position 1,211 nt from the 5′-end (19Fukuhara T. Moriyama H. Nitta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18147-18149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This nick divides not only the coding strand of the dsRNA molecule into 1,211-nt 5′ and 12,741-nt 3′ fragments but also the long ORF into 1,045-nt (348 amino acids) 5′ and 12,671-nt (4,224 amino acids) 3′ segments. The nucleotides of the dsRNA of tropical japonica rice (cv. Gendjah Gempel, T-dsRNA) and the dsRNA of wild rice (O. rufipogonW-1714, W-dsRNA) have been partially sequenced (17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the core regions of the RdRp domains found in these three dsRNAs indicates that J-dsRNA (temperate japonica rice) is more similar to T-dsRNA (tropical japonica rice) than to W-dsRNA (wild rice). The cytoplasmic inheritance of these dsRNAs is unusual in some F1 hybrids when they are introduced into F1 hybrids by crossing japonica rice (O. sativa) and wild rice (O. rufipogon). The evolutionarily related dsRNAs were incompatible, and the resident dsRNA of an egg cell from cultivated rice was excluded by the incoming dsRNA of a pollen cell from wild rice in some F1 plants. Coexisting dsRNAs in the F1 hybrids segregated from each other in the F2 plants. However, the total amounts of these dsRNAs in the host cells remained constant (approximately 100 copies/cell) even in interspecific hybrid rice (17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Stringent regulation of the dsRNA copy number might be responsible for this unusual type of inheritance. Here we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of the second dsRNA from wild rice (W-dsRNA). We detected a site-specific discontinuity (nick) in the coding strand, then compared it with the dsRNAs of temperate (J-dsRNA) and tropical (T-dsRNA) japonica rice. Furthermore, we discovered remarkable increases in the dsRNA copy number of pollen grains and an unusual mode of dsRNA inheritance in interspecific F2 and F3 hybrids between O. sativa and O. rufipogon. The Nipponbare cultivar (temperate japonica rice, O. sativa), the Gendjah Gempel BHB 721 cultivar (tropical japonica rice, O. sativa), and W-1714 (wild rice,O. rufipogon) were grown in a greenhouse at 28 °C or in fields. Pollen grains of the three rice plants were harvested from about 100 individual plants. The dsRNA were extracted from 14-day-old seedlings or mature leaves using SDS-phenol, fractionated by column chromatography on CF-11 cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) as described by Morris and Dodds (20Morris T.J. Dodds J.A. Phytopathology. 1979; 69: 854-858Crossref Google Scholar), then incubated with DNase I. A series of overlapping cDNA clones that covered the entire sequence of the dsRNA of wild rice (W-1714) was obtained by the method of Gubler and Hoffman (21Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene. 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers synthesized with reference to the J-dsRNA sequence (18Moriyama H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA clones corresponding to the terminal regions of W-dsRNA and T-dsRNA were generated by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (22Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 25-33Google Scholar). The dsRNAs were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.2% denaturing agarose gels containing 20 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 660 mm formaldehyde, and 500 ng/ml ethidium bromide. Resolved dsRNAs were transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-Probe GT membrane; Bio-Rad) and probed using cDNA clones located at nt 770–1,723 (W161) and nt 6,554–8,215 (W149) from the 5′ end of the plus strand of the dsRNA (see Fig. 1). These probes were synthesized by using a BcaBESTTM labeling kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed as described previously (17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fukuhara T. Moriyama H. Nitta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18147-18149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The strand containing the site-specific nick was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Oligonucleotides, WN161 (5′-CCTTGGAGGTGTGGTGTATGT-3′) located at nt 1,067–1087, WN184 (5′-GTCCTTAAATCTAGGGACAACA-3′) complementary to nt 1,702–1,723, and W184 (5′-CTGTGCCAGTGTTATCCCTGA-3′) complementary to nt 1,734–1,754 from the 5′ end of the coding strand of W-dsRNA were used as PCR primers. When the coding strand was the template for cDNA synthesis, W184 was used as the primer for cDNA synthesis, then WN161 and WN184 were used as PCR primers. When the noncoding strand was the template, WN161 was used as the primer for cDNA synthesis, then WN161 and WN184 were used as PCR primers. Products of PCR reactions were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A 25-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CTCTGGTTTGACGCTATTAAACTTG-3′) complementary to nt 1,396–1,420 from the 5′ end of the coding strand of W-dsRNA was synthesized for use in the primer extension reaction. The reaction proceeded in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1 pmol/μl primer, 0.1 μg/μl heat-denatured W-dsRNA as a template, 10 units/μl SuperScript II reverse-transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.037 MBq/μl [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 min at 25 °C. One μl of 10 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP was added to 9 μl of the reaction mixture, then the reaction was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA, and 50% urea. DNA sequences were determined by dideoxynucleotide chain termination using a 7-deaza Sequenase Ver. 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemicals Corp.) or the BigDyeTM Cycle Primer Sequencing FS Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed using the SDC-GENETYX genetic information-processing program (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Secondary structures of 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of three dsRNAs were predicted using the RNAdraw program (23Matzura O. Wennborg A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 247-249PubMed Google Scholar). Seedlings and pollen grains were thoroughly ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle, then total nucleic acids were extracted using SDS-phenol. Total nucleic acids were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, then the gels were stained with ethidium bromide (500 ng/ml). Band intensities of dsRNA and DNA were analyzed using the NIH image program. The dsRNA copy number was estimated from a comparison of the band intensity and genome size of dsRNA (14 × 103 nt) with those of rice DNA (4.3 × 108 nt/haploid genome) (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Matsuo T. Futsuhara Y. Kikuchi F. Yamaguchi H. Science of the Rice Plant. 3. Food and Agriculture Policy Research Center, Tokyo1997Google Scholar). Cultivars Nipponbare (temperate japonica rice, O. sativa) and W-1714 (wild rice, O. rufipogon) were crossed as described (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The dsRNA (J-dsRNA or W-dsRNA) in F1, F2, and F3 plants were identified by Northern hybridization using J-dsRNA- or W-dsRNA-specific probes under high stringency as described previously (17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The specific probes did not cross-hybridize under these conditions. The entire sequence (13, 936 nt) of the dsRNA of wild rice (O. rufipogon W-1714; W-dsRNA) was determined from a series of independent and overlapping cDNA and rapid amplification of cDNA end clones. A single long ORF of 13,719 nt (4, 573 amino acid) was found in one (coding) strand of W-dsRNA. The noncoding region preceding the ORF was 166 nt long, and an AUG codon was located at nt 167–169 from the 5′-end of the coding strand. The termination codon at nucleotide positions 13,885–13,887 from the 5′-end of coding strand was followed by a noncoding region of 48 nt long (Fig. 1). W-dsRNA did not have a poly(A) tail, and no ORF of significant size was found in the other (noncoding) strand. The AU content of W-dsRNA was high (64.95%), and analysis of the codon usage in the ORF indicated a significant bias toward codons with A or U as the third letter (data not shown). Purified W-dsRNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a denaturing agarose gel, then hybridized using two cDNA probes located between nt 770 and 1,723 (W161) and between nt 6,554 and 8,215 (W149) from the 5′ end of the coding strand of dsRNA (Fig. 1). These probes detected both (coding and noncoding) strands that were separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. A 14-kb band was detected in both experiments when either W161 or W149 was the probe (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, a band of about 1.2 kb was detected when probed with W161 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) but not by either Northern hybridization using W149 as a probe (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or by electrophoresis on nondenaturing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide (data not shown). Because J-dsRNA contains a site-specific nick in the coding strand (19Fukuhara T. Moriyama H. Nitta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18147-18149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we considered that two bands (14 and 12.8 kb) should be detected when probed with W149. However, these two bands could not be completely separated by electrophoresis because of having similar molecular masses (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Indeed two bands (14 and 12.8 kb) were detected using W149 when electrophoresis was prolonged (data not shown). Any probes located within the 5′ region from a position nt 1,107 detected both the 1.2- and 14.0-kb bands but not the 12.8-kb band. Alternatively, any probes located in the 3′ region from nt 1,685 detected both the 14.0- and 12.8-kb bands but not the 1.2-kb band (data not shown). These experimental results were very similar to the findings of J-dsRNA, which has a site-specific nick on the coding strand at nt 1,211 from the 5′ end (19Fukuhara T. Moriyama H. Nitta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18147-18149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results indicated that W-dsRNA has a site-specific nick around nt 1,200 from the 5′ end. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments were carried out to determine which strand contained the site-specific nick (see “Experimental Procedures”). When the template for cDNA synthesis was the noncoding strand, PCR products 687 nt long between nt 1,067 and 1,754 were amplified. In contrast, no band was amplified when the coding strand was used as the template (data not shown). These results indicated that the cDNA could be synthesized through the nick point on the noncoding strand as a template but not on the coding strand. Therefore, the coding strand of W-dsRNA contained a site-specific discontinuity (nick). To define the exact site of the nick on the coding strand of W-dsRNA, we synthesized a 25-mer oligonucleotide primer that was complementary to positions between nt 1,396 and 1,420 from the 5′ end of the coding strand and performed primer extension (see “Experimental Procedures”). The main products of the reaction are shown inlane P in Fig. 2B. This result indicates that the nick was located between U at nt 1,197 and G at nt 1,198 from the 5′ end of the coding strand. This nick divides not only the coding strand of W-dsRNA into 1,197-nt 5′ and 12,739-nt 3′ fragments but also the long ORF into 1,031-nt (343 amino acids) 5′ and 12,688-nt (4, 230 amino acids) 3′ segments. The entire sequences of W-dsRNA (13,936 nt) and the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF in W-dsRNA (13,719 nt, 4,573 amino acids) were compared with those of J-dsRNA (13,952 nt) and of the ORF in J-dsRNA (13,716 nt, 4,572 amino acids) (Fig. 3). The identities of the nucleotide sequences of these dsRNAs and the deduced amino acids sequences of the ORFs were 75.5 and 79.6% (similarity: 96.4%), respectively. The consensus motifs of RNA helicase and RdRp domains were found between amino acids 1,505 and 1,748 (nt 4, 679 and 5410) and between amino acids 4,234 and 4,476 (nt 12, 866 and 13, 594) from the N-terminal end of the ORF, respectively. These locations were almost identical to those of the RNA helicase and RdRp domains in J-dsRNA. Identities of the amino acid sequences of the RdRp domain (94.7%) and the RNA helicase domain (83.1%) were much higher than the average of the entire ORF (79.6%). We divided the entire nucleotide sequences of rice dsRNAs by 120 nt from the 5′ end, then compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences between J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA every 120 nt (40 amino acid; Fig. 3). The homology at the amino acid level between J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA in the RdRp region was more conservative than that of other regions except for the nick. The coding strands of J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA had site-specific nicks at nt 1,211 and at a nt 1,197 from their 5′-ends, respectively (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4A, the amino acid sequences around each nick were highly conserved. We investigated the conservation of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences around the nick in detail by comparing the surrounding regions (nt 840–1,560 from the 5′ end, amino acids 226–466 from the N-terminal), which were equivalent in size to the RdRp or RNA helicase domain, between J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were 82.9 and 95.4% identical, respectively. These values were similar to those of RdRp domain and higher than those of the RNA helicase domain, and the highly conservative regions continued across the nick (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, two less conservative regions were found at nt 2,760–3,240 and nt 8040–8520 from the 5′ end. The nucleotide (deduced amino acid) sequences were 58.4% (43.1%) and 51.6% (26.9%) identical, respectively (Fig. 3). In these regions, not only nonsynonymous base substitutions but also deletions and insertions of nucleotides were found, which caused changes in the amino acid sequences of the ORF (Table I). Although many base substitutions and several deletions and insertions of nucleotides were found, no termination codon within either ORF was generated.Table IDeletions and insertions of nucleotides in W-dsRNALocation from the 5′ end (nt)aThe nucleotide sequence of J-dsRNA was used as the standard for comparison.1,987–1,9893,1253,1625,059–5,0618,1028,1098,323–8,3258,358–8,3628,401–8,40213,893–13,91013,944Deletion (−) or insertion (+)3 nt (−)1 nt (−)1 nt (+)3 nt (−)1 nt (−)1 nt (+)3 nt (+)5 nt (−)2 nt (+)18 nt (−)1 nt (−)a The nucleotide sequence of J-dsRNA was used as the standard for comparison. Open table in a new tab The sequences of 5′-noncoding regions (166 nt) and the location of the start codon (AUG) were conserved among the three dsRNAs (J-dsRNA, W-dsRNA, and T-dsRNA; Fig. 4B). Five stem and loop structures (SL1-SL5) in the 5′-noncoding region and one additional stem and loop structure containing a start codon (SL6) of three dsRNAs are shown in Fig. 5. The SL1 and SL2 were not so conservative among the three dsRNAs, and the SL2 was not located in J-dsRNA. The SL3, SL4, SL5, and SL6 were highly conserved among the three dsRNAs. In particular, the SL3 (nt 55–82), which has a remarkably GC-rich stem, was identical among the three dsRNAs. The SL3 must be the most stable among the six stem and loop structures, because the hydrogen bonds of the GC-rich stem are very strong. The 3′-noncoding region of W-dsRNA (48 nt) was shorter than that of J-dsRNA (70 nt) (18Moriyama H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A comparison of the 3′-noncoding sequences between J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA revealed a long deletion (18 nt) in the 3′-noncoding region of W-dsRNA (Fig. 4C). No conservative secondary structure was found in the 3′-noncoding regions. Rice dsRNA (J-dsRNA) is efficiently transmitted to progeny plants via pollen although it is localized in cytoplasm (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol.

A comparison of the amounts of dsRNA and rice DNA showed that the estimated copy numbers of three dsRNAs (J-, T-, and W-dsRNA) in leaves, roots, or seedlings (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3) were about 100 copies/cell (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the copy numbers of these dsRNAs were increased in pollen grains (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6). The band intensity of dsRNA was compared with that of DNA in each sample (lanes 4–6 in Fig. 6). From the genome sizes of rice DNA (4.3 × 108 nt) (24Matsuo T. Futsuhara Y. Kikuchi F. Yamaguchi H. Science of the Rice Plant. 3. Food and Agriculture Policy Research Center, Tokyo1997Google Scholar) and dsRNA (14 × 103 nt), the estimated copy numbers of these dsRNAs in pollen grains were more than 1,000 copies/cell. The concentration of dsRNA was similarly in high samples extracted from the three rice cultivars. Reciprocal crosses between temperate japonica rice (cv. Nipponbare) and wild rice (W-1714) were performed to introduce the two evolutionarily related dsRNAs (J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA) into F1 progeny plants. To identify the dsRNA present in F1 plants, we performed Northern hybridization studies under high stringency conditions (65 °C) using J-dsRNA- or W-dsRNA-specific probes. Different rice dsRNAs were efficiently transmitted to F1 hybrids between cultivated and wild rice, most F1 progeny plants ((23 + 14 + 19)/(23 + 16 + 22) = 91.8%) contained either J-dsRNA, W-dsRNA, or both dsRNAs, and only 5 F1 plants did not contain any dsRNA (TableII). To investigate the inheritance of each dsRNA in hybrids from generation to generation, the dsRNAs in F2 and F3 plants, which were self-pollinated progenies of F1 hybrids, were subjected to Northern analysis under high stringency conditions. When the recipient (maternal parent) was Nipponbare and the pollen donor (paternal parent) was W-1714, the efficiency of seed-mediated transmission of dsRNAs from F1 plants was low in some F2 plants; the rates of dsRNA transmission from individual F1 plants to F2 plants varied from 0 to 100% (Table II). For example, all 18 F2 plants from 1 F1 plant did not contain any dsRNA (0%). By contrast, all 14 F2 plants from another F1 plant contained the dsRNA (100%). The type of dsRNA (J- or W-dsRNA) in F1 plants was not responsible for the unstable transmission to F2 plants (Table II). When the dsRNA-free plants of Nipponbare were used as recipients, the efficiency of transmission was also low in some F2 plants (Table II). Once the F2 plants harbored the dsRNAs, the efficiency of dsRNA transmission to F3 plants increased again (78/84 = 93%). When the recipient was W-1714 and the pollen donor was Nipponbare, only W-dsRNA was detected in F1 plants and the efficiency of seed-mediated transmission of dsRNA from these F1 plants was high in all F2 plants (100%, Table II).Table IIInheritance of J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA by F1, F2 and F3 hybrids between cv.

Furthermore, the stem and loop structures in the 5′-noncoding regions were conserved in both dsRNAs (Fig. 5). Several characteristic stem and loop structures found in the 5′-noncoding region may function as cis-acting elements for their replication, transcription, and/or translation. By contrast, the 3′-noncoding region of W-dsRNA has a long deletion in comparison with J-dsRNA (18 nt, Fig. 4B). In our recent study of J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA inheritance, the ability of W-dsRNA to replicate in F1 plants between temperate japonica rice and wild rice seems to be greater than that of J-dsRNA (17Moriyama H. Horiuchi H. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-noncoding regions of J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA might be responsible for the difference in their ability to replicate, because noncoding (−) strand synthesis must start at the 3′-terminal region of the coding (+) strand. The two dsRNAs differ at the nucleotide level by 3,418 nucleotides (24.5%) of the entire sequence. Because cultivated rice (O. sativa) and wild rice (O. rufipogon) diverged several thousand years ago (24Matsuo T. Futsuhara Y. Kikuchi F. Yamaguchi H. Science of the Rice Plant. 3. Food and Agriculture Policy Research Center, Tokyo1997Google Scholar), about one nucleotide substitution each year has accumulated during the evolution of these dsRNAs. Because the amino acid sequences across the nick (nt 840–1,560 from the 5′ end, amino acids 226–466 from the N-terminal end) were highly conserved, they might be a functional (important) domain of an unknown translational product. The identity of amino acids sequences in this region (95.4%) was similar to that of RdRp domain and higher than that of the RNA helicase domain (Figs. 3 and 4A), an unknown translational product containing this amino acid sequence may be important as well as an RdRp. Once the nick occurs in the coding strand of the dsRNA, the divided coding strand can no longer be used as a template for noncoding (−) strand synthesis in its replication cycle or as an mRNA for the full-length form of its putative functional protein. Some endogenous RNA replicons, such as the yeast 20 S and 23 S RNAs (= yeast T and W dsRNAs), encode single ORFs containing RdRps (25Wickner R.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 250-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although many base substitutions and several deletions and insertions of nucleotides were found in two rice dsRNAs, no termination codon within either ORF was generated (Table I and Fig. 3). It suggests that a single long ORF is also important for the strategy of gene expression (translation) in rice endogenous dsRNAs. The dsRNAs isolated from mature leaves, roots, or seedlings (Fig. 6,lanes 1–3) were detected at a concentration of approximately 100 copies/cell (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The dsRNA copy number increased more than 10-fold in pollen grains of three rice plants (Fig. 6,lanes 4–6). This remarkable increase may explain the high efficiency of J-dsRNA transmission via pollen that we reported (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There is no evidence for the horizontal transmission of rice dsRNAs, so their propagation seems to depend on steady replication before every host cell division (not only mitosis but also meiosis) and their steady (efficient) transmission to the next generation via not only eggs/ova but also pollen. Mating of host plants must be an opportunity for dsRNA propagation. An increase in the dsRNA copy number only in pollen grains must be a reasonable strategy for their efficient transmission to progenies despite their cytoplasmic localization (15Moriyama H. Kanaya K. Wang J.Z. Nitta T. Fukuhara T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may be reminiscent of meiotic derepression of dsRNA copy numbers seen in the 20 S and 23 S RNA replicons of yeast (26Kadowaki K. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 826-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Matsumoto Y. Fishel R. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7628-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These rice dsRNAs could not have the property of horizontal transmission that almost all viruses have; they have the ability of vertical transmission via both eggs and pollen, which almost all viruses do not. The two endogenous dsRNAs in rice (J-dsRNA and W-dsRNA) described here have unique properties, such as the single large ORF and the site-specific nick in the coding strand. The 16.7-kb dsRNA found inV. faba contains the single long ORF and the site-specific nick (28Pfeiffer P. Jung J.L. Heitzler J. Keith G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF is similar to those of the ORFs in rice dsRNAs (29Pfeiffer P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These three large dsRNAs might constitute a novel virus family. Furthermore, large endogenous dsRNAs with unknown sequences identified in other plants (see the Introduction) may also belong to this family. We thank emeritus professor T. Nitta, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, for useful suggestions and valuable advice. We thank Dr. P. Pfeiffer, CNRS, Institut de Biologie Moleculaires des Plantes, for providing us with personal data on the dsRNA of V. faba and Dr. G. S.

Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Klein B. Zhang X.G. Lu Z.Y. Bataille R. Blood. 1995; 85: 863-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is anticipated that selective antagonists of IL-6 action may offer therapeutic benefits in the treatment of IL-6-related diseases. The biological activities of IL-6 are mediated by the IL-6 receptor system which comprises two receptor proteins: the specific ligand-binding α-subunit receptor (IL-6R) and the signal transducing β-subunit, gp130. Gp130 also forms part of the receptor complexes of leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, cardiotrophin-1, and IL-11 (6Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar) which, in part, provides a molecular basis for the functional redundancy of these cytokines. IL-6 first binds the IL-6R with an affinity of ∼1 nm and the IL-6·IL-6R complex then binds gp130 with a resulting affinity of ∼10 pm (7Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The ternary complex of the IL-6 receptor system is a hexamer, comprising two molecules each of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130 (8Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A. Moritz R.L.

This sequence shows 54 and 57% overall amino acid identity with the cDNA sequences for mouse (10Sugita T. Totsuka T. Saito M. Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and rat (11Baumann M. Baumann H. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19853-19862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) IL-6R, respectively. The mature 80-kDa IL-6R is a glycosylated form of the predicted 50-kDa precursor (12Hirata Y. Taga T. Hibi M. Nakano N. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2900-2906PubMed Google Scholar) and contains six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The extracellular region has a modular structure, consisting of three domains of approximately 100 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal domain is characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-like) (13Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Members of this family share a common β-sheet folding topology called a Greek Key (15Richardson J.S. Nature. 1977; 268: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), whereby neighboring β-strands form hydrogen bonds in an anti-parallel fashion to form a β-pleated sheet. Two β-sheets are then packed against each other to produce a hydrophobic core. Similarly, the two COOH-terminal domains of the IL-6R are classified as fibronectin type III-like (FN III) modules, a subclass of the β-sandwich fold (14Vaughn D.E. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The topology of these domains is similar to those of Ig-like modules, with the notable exception of the “sheet switching” of β-strand D from the first β-sheet of an Ig-like domain to form β-strand C′ on the second β-sheet of FN III domains. Together, the two FN III domains form a cytokine-binding domain (CBD) which is characteristic of class I cytokine receptors (16Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar) (e.g. receptors for interleukins-3, -5, -6, -11, gp130, erythropoietin (EPO), ciliary neurotrophic factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL)). Generally, these receptors are characterized by two conserved disulfide bonds located in the NH2-terminal FN III domain and a conserved WSXWS motif located in the COOH-terminal FN III domain. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the IL-6R are not required for IL-6 signaling (17Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and biologically active soluble forms of IL-6R (sIL-6R) are naturally found in low concentrations in human urine (18Novick D.

In contrast to many other soluble cytokine receptors that act as inhibitors by competing for ligand binding with cellular receptors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, -2, -4, interferon-γ, nerve growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, granulocyte-stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor) (for reviews, see Refs. 21Rose-John S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether sIL-6R is generated by proteolytic shedding of membrane-bound IL-6R (23Mullberg J. Schooltink H.

In certain disease states, for example, patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection or multiple myeloma, increased levels of sIL-6R have been reported (26Honda M. Yamamoto S. Cheng M.

Therefore, inhibition of the IL-6·sIL-6R complex has been labeled as a key target to antagonize the in vivo action of IL-6 (28Gaillard J.P. Liautard J. Mani J.C. Fernandez Suarez J.M. Klein B. Brochier J. Immunology. 1996; 89: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).

This form of the sIL-6R contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and 10 cysteine residues. Three cysteines are located in the Ig-like domain, six in the NH2-terminal FN III domain, and one in the COOH-terminal FN III domain. Previously, we have shown that the ligand affinity purified sIL-6R bound IL-6 and gp130 with a 2:2:2 stoichiometry of IL-6, sIL-6R, and sgp130 (8Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K.

Here, reversed-phase HPLC peptide mapping under nonreducing and reducing conditions, in combination with mass spectrometric and NH2-terminal sequence analysis, was used to determine the disulfide structure and carbohydrate attachment sites of sIL-6R. On the basis of these results, we have created a model that depicts the topology of the extracellular region of the IL-6R and predicts its interactions with IL-6 and gp130.

Recombinant sIL-6R (100 μg, 2 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA was treated with 2% (v/v) neuraminidase (37 °C, overnight) and/or endoglycosylase mixture (37 °C, 3 h). Prior to disulfide determination, free cysteine residues in the sIL-6R (200 μg) were treated with a 5-fold molar excess of 4-vinylpyridine in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. The modified protein was purified by gel permeation chromatography on a 100 × 10-mm inner diameter fast desalting column (G-25 Sephadex, Pharmacia). Deglycosylated sIL-6R (200 μg, 4 nmol) was digested with trypsin (1:20 w/w, 0.05 m NaH2PO4, pH 6.0) overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic peptide mixture was fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard Liquid Chromatograph (model HP 1090A) and a Vydac C18 column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter). The column was developed at 0.5 ml/min using a 60-min linear gradient of 0–100% B, where solvent A was aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 60% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid (45 °C). The column eluent was split (∼1:160), post-detector, using a stainless steel Tee-union (Upchurch catalog number U428, Upchurch, Oak Harbor, WA) directing 0.6% of the total flow at 3 μl/min to the mass spectrometer, while the remainder (99.4%) was collected into polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) for further analysis. To identify disulfide-containing fractions, 25% of the digest (1 nmol) was reduced with an equal volume of 10 mm TCEP in 0.2 msodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (65 °C, 10 min) (36Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and then re-chromatographed under identical conditions. On-line MS analysis of peptide fractions was performed on a Finnigan-MAT LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source (San Jose, CA). “Triple play” experiments, consisting of MS/zoom scan/and MS/MS, were performed as described elsewhere (37Courchesne P.L. Jones M.D. Robinson J.H. Spahr C.S. McCracken S. Bently D.L. Luethy R. Patterson S.D. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 956-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Source CID/single ion monitoring (sCID/SIM) was employed to identify S-pyridylethyl cysteine-containing peptides (38Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For sCID/SIM, the relative collision energy in the source region was set at 70% (arbitrary value) and the mass range was scanned from m/z 104.5–107.5 to detectS-pyridylethyl fragment ions (m/z 106). Peptides were identified using the Finnigan PEPMAP™ program, and from their CID product ion spectra using the MS-Tag and MS-Product algorithms (Prospector pacific rim mirror site, http://jpsl.ludwig.edu.au). Automated Edman degradation of proteins and peptides was performed using a HP-G1005A biphasic NH2-terminal protein sequencer (Hewlett-Packard, version 3.0 chemistry) (38Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain of the IL-6R was modeled using the structure of the mouse monoclonal antibody FAB D44.1 VL domain (39Braden B.C. Souchon H. Eisele J.L. Bentley G.A. Bhat T.N. Navaza J. Poljak R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 767-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) which showed 23% sequence identity, the highest for all known Ig three-dimensional structures. The coordinates for the template were taken from the Protein Data Bank (40Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar), entry 1MLB(chain A, residues 1–109). Template structures for the CBD of IL-6R were the CBD of gp130 (41Bravo J. Staunton D. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank entry 1BQU; GHR, chain B (first binding receptor) of Protein Data Bank entry 3HHR (42de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar); EPOR, Protein Data Bank entry 1EBP (43Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); and PRLR, Protein Data Bank entry1BP3 (44Somers W. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment was prepared in two parts. The Ig-like domain of IL-6R was manually aligned with the template FAB D44.1 VL structure. For the CBD, a structure-based multiple sequence alignment was performed manually. The β-sheets of the known CBD structures were superimposed to provide the basis of the alignment. The remaining sequences of unknown structure were manually aligned with these structures, conserving the disulfide patterns, WSXWS motif, and hydrophobic patterns of the β-sheets. The MODELLER program (45Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used to generate separate models of the Ig-like domain and CBD. The quality of the models was assessed as described previously (46Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); in particular using the ProsaII program (47Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). MODELLER was also used to determine the relative orientations of the Ig-like domain and CBD. A disulfide restraint between Cys6 and Cys174 of the Ig-like domain and FN III domain, respectively, was introduced in accordance with our experimental results. Fifty models were generated with a range of orientations between the Ig-like domain and the CBD. The final two models were chosen on the basis of the quality checks described above and agreement with experimental data. The model of the sIL-6R, complexed with the crystal structures of IL-6 (48Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1ALU) and the gp130 CBD (41Bravo J. Staunton D. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was constructed by superimposing these moieties over the human GH receptor complex (42de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the first 20 residues of the purified sIL-6R was in agreement with the published sequence (7Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The purified sIL-6R yielded a single broad band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼52,000 (Fig. 1A, lane 1), a value significantly higher than 36,368 Da calculated from the amino acid composition (7Yamasaki K. Taga T. Hirata Y. Yawata H. Kawanishi Y. Seed B. Taniguchi T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1988; 241: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with either neuraminidase or a combination of neuraminidase and an endoglycosidase mixture, the Mr of the sIL-6R was reduced to ∼50,000 and ∼40,000, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). These data suggest that the increasedMr of sIL-6R (∼12,000) is due to glycosylation of the CHO cell-derived protein. Pronounced charge heterogeneity of the mature sIL-6R was observed upon IEF (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Treatment with neuraminidase (Fig. 1B, lane 2) and neuraminidase plus an endoglycosidase mixture (Fig. 1B, lane 3) reduced this complexity to one or two major bands, respectively, indicating that the heterogeneity of the sIL-6R preparation is primarily due to differential N-linked glycosylation. Free cysteine residues in sIL-6R (∼200 μg) were modified with 4-vinylpridine at pH 8.5. Following enzymatic deglycosylation, the treated sIL-6R was digested with trypsin at pH 6.0, and subjected to RP-HPLC/ESI-IT-MS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The total ion current profiles of nonreduced and reduced tryptic digest of sIL-6R are shown in Fig. 2 (panels A and B, respectively). sCID/SIM of the nonreduced digest forS-pyridylethyl ions (m/z 106) revealed a single peak at retention time 31.42 min (Fig. 2C). The mass spectrum of the peak at retention time 31.42 min (Fig. 2D) revealed the presence of two peptides: peptides T1a and T1b with calculated masses of 2007.3 Da and 1992.5 Da, respectively. Automated CID MS/MS of the doubly charged ion (m/z 1003.8) of peptide T1a (Fig. 2E) identified this peptide as residues 253–268 of the sIL-6R (DLQHHCVIHDAWSGLR) containing an additional mass of 118.9 Da located at Cys258. Upon reduction with TCEP, the mass of peptide T1a decreased by 119.3 Da and was located at 32.20 min (peptide T9, Fig. 2B; see Table I), consistent with cysteinylation of Cys258.Table ICalculated and observed masses of nonreduced and reduced tryptic peptides of the deglycosylated extracellular domain of the human interleukin-6 receptorPeptide fractionaTryptic peptide fractions are labeled according to their order of retention as shown in Fig. 2A.SequencebPeptide sequences identified from MS/MS spectral data using the programs MS-Tag, MS-Product, and manual assignment.

Open table in a new tab Sequence data of peptide T1b was not available due to the low abundance of this ion (∼20% compared with peptide T1a). However, the 14.8-Da difference observed between peptides T1a and T1b is consistent with the difference in mass between cysteinylated (+119 Da) and S-pyridylethylated (+105 Da) Cys258 of peptide Asp253-Arg268. These data suggest that the peak observed in the sCID/SIM profile (Fig. 2C) emanates from anS-pyridylethylated form (Cys258) of peptide T1b. Peptide T1b was also observed (in low abundance) at approximately the same retention time in the TCEP-reduced total ion current profile (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data indicate that the majority of sIL-6R purified from CHO cell conditioned medium contain a modified Cys258 (cysteinylated), and only a small portion (∼20%) remains as the unmodified Cys258 (free sulfhydryl). A portion (25%) of the tryptic digest of deglycosylated/S-pyridylethylated sIL-6R was reduced with 10 mm TCEP at pH 6.0 and subjected to on-line RP-HPLC/ESI-IT-MS analysis (Fig. 2B) using the same chromatographic conditions described for the nonreduced digest. Inspection of the nonreduced and reduced tryptic peptide maps of sIL-6R (Fig. 2, panels A and B) revealed that upon reduction of the digest, the retention times of five peptide fractions (T1-T5) in the nonreduced tryptic map (Fig. 2A) changed with the concomitant appearance of nine peptide fractions (T6-T14) in the reduced tryptic map (Fig. 2B). A summary of peptide masses found in fractions T1-T14 is shown in Table I. As mentioned above, MS analysis of peptide fraction T1 revealed tryptic peptide Asp253-Arg268 (Fig. 2, A,D, and E) containing a cysteinyl-cysteine at position 258 in the sequence (T1a), as well as the small proportion of the peptide that had been reacted with 4-vinylpyridine (T1b).

https://openalex.org/W1531726924,"β-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) is a potent inhibitor of several β-lactamases including TEM-1 β-lactamase (K i = 0.1 nm). The co-crystal structure of TEM-1 β-lactamase and BLIP has been solved, revealing the contact residues involved in the interface between the enzyme and inhibitor. To determine which residues in TEM-1 β-lactamase are critical for binding BLIP, the method of monovalent phage display was employed. Random mutants of TEM-1 β-lactamase in the 99–114 loop-helix and 235–240 B3 β-strand regions were displayed as fusion proteins on the surface of the M13 bacteriophage. Functional mutants were selected based on the ability to bind BLIP. After three rounds of enrichment, the sequences of a collection of functional β-lactamase mutants revealed a consensus sequence for the binding of BLIP. Seven loop-helix residues including Asp-101, Leu-102, Val-103, Ser-106, Pro-107, Thr-109, and His-112 and three B3 β-strand residues including Ser-235, Gly-236, and Gly-238 were found to be critical for tight binding of BLIP. In addition, the selected β-lactamase mutants A113L/T114R and E240K were found to increase binding of BLIP by over 6- and 11-fold, respectively. Combining these substitutions resulted in 550-fold tighter binding between the enzyme and BLIP with aK i of 0.40 pm. These results reveal that the binding between TEM-1 β-lactamase and BLIP can be improved and that there are a large number of sequences consistent with tight binding between BLIP and β-lactamase. β-Lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) is a potent inhibitor of several β-lactamases including TEM-1 β-lactamase (K i = 0.1 nm).

These results reveal that the binding between TEM-1 β-lactamase and BLIP can be improved and that there are a large number of sequences consistent with tight binding between BLIP and β-lactamase. Since the introduction of β-lactam antibiotics, bacterial resistance to these agents has become an increasing problem (1Davies J. Science. 1994; 264: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 2Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). The production of the enzyme β-lactamase by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is the most common mechanism of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (3Medeiros A.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1984; 40: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). β-Lactamases hydrolyze the amide bond of the β-lactam antibiotic to create an ineffective antimicrobial agent (3Medeiros A.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1984; 40: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and have been grouped into four classes (A, B, C, and D) based on primary sequence homology (4Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 5Joris B. Ghuysen J.-M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frère J.-M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 250: 313-324Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Genes encoding these enzymes have been found on plasmids, transposons, and bacterial chromosomes (4Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 6Matthew M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1979; 5: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The most prevalent plasmid-mediated β-lactamase in Gram-negative bacteria is the TEM-1 β-lactamase from class A (7Wiedemann B. Kliebe C. Kresken M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1989; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Like other class A β-lactamases, TEM-1 β-lactamase is capable of hydrolyzing both penicillins and cephalosporins (2Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 8Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Matagene A. Misselyn-Bauduin A.-M. Joris B. Erpicum T. Granier B. Frère J.-M. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To overcome the drug resistance mediated by TEM-1 β-lactamase, extended-spectrum antibiotics, including aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime were developed. However, soon after their introduction, selective pressure resulted in the emergence of variant β-lactamases able to hydrolyze these antibiotics (10Knothe H. Shah P. Krcmery V. Antal M. Mitsuhashi S. Infection. 1983; 11: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Examination of these enzymes revealed that amino acid substitutions such as R164S, G238S, and E240K in TEM-1 β-lactamase resulted in altered substrate specificity of the enzyme (11Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sowek J.A. Singer S.B. Ohringer S. Malley M.F. Dougherty T.J. Gougoutas J.Z.

Biol. 1994; 244: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The emergence of these enzymes is an additional threat to antimicrobial therapy since plasmids encoding these β-lactamase variants are easily transferable to unrelated bacteria (1Davies J. Science. 1994; 264: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). An additional strategy that has been employed to combat antimicrobial resistance is the use of β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam (14Parker R.H. Egggleston M. Infect. Control. 1987; 8: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although not capable of antimicrobial activity themselves, these suicide inhibitors are used in conjunction with various β-lactam antibiotics to bind β-lactamase and prevent the hydrolysis of the antibiotic, thereby restoring the therapeutic value to the antimicrobial agent. Unfortunately, β-lactamase variants have been identified that are resistant to these enzyme inhibitors while still retaining the ability to hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics (15Henquell C. Chanal C. Sirot D. Labia R. Sirot J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Imtiaz U. Manavathu E.K. Monashery S. Lerner S.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The small molecule β-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, was initially purified from the soil bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus (17Reading C. Cole M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1977; 11: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). This organism also produces a protein inhibitor of β-lactamase called the β-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) 1The abbreviations used are: BLIP, β-lactamase inhibitor protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mal, maltose 1The abbreviations used are: BLIP, β-lactamase inhibitor protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mal, maltose (18Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BLIP is a 165-amino acid protein composed of two tandemly repeated domains (19Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagene A. Frère J.-M. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of class A β-lactamases from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including TEM-1 β-lactamase (K i = 0.1 nm) (20Petrosino J. Rudgers G.W. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The co-crystal structure of TEM-1 β-lactamase complexed with BLIP has been solved, revealing the mode of inhibition by BLIP and the contact residues involved in the interface between the enzyme and inhibitor (21Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure shows that BLIP binds to a negatively charged loop-helix region composed of residues 99–112 just outside the active site pocket of TEM-1 β-lactamase (Fig. 1). Sequence alignment of β-lactamases that are inhibited by BLIP reveals an overall lack of amino acid sequence conservation in this region (21Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ability of BLIP to bind to such a variety of class A β-lactamases is believed to be due in part to an extensive layer of water molecules that are trapped between the inhibitor and the 99–112 loop-helix region of the enzyme. The relative importance of the 99–112 residues of TEM-1 β-lactamase for binding BLIP is unknown. It has been proposed, however, that the only critical residues in this region for binding with BLIP are the aromatic residue at position 105 and the conserved proline at position 107 (21Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition to blocking the enzyme-active site by binding the 99–112 loop-helix region of TEM-1 β-lactamase, BLIP also inserts two turns, one from each domain, directly into the active site of the enzyme (21Strynadka N.C.J.

The main contact residues in the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase involve the B3 β-strand residues 234–240 (Fig. 1). The β-hairpin turn of domain 1 of BLIP is stabilized through several van der Waals contacts made with residues 235–238 of β-lactamase in addition to four strong hydrogen bonds made by Asp-49 of BLIP with residues in the enzyme that are critical for substrate binding and catalysis. The turn of domain 2, in particular Phe-142, also makes several contacts with TEM-1 β-lactamase. Since β-lactamases inhibited by BLIP are highly conserved in the 234–240 region, these residues have been hypothesized to be the crucial determinants for the binding and inhibition by BLIP (21Strynadka N.C.J.

In order to circumvent bacterial resistance and thereby continue the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy, new antibiotics and inhibitors are needed. Understanding the molecular details of TEM-1 β-lactamase and BLIP binding may aid in the development of inhibitors and antibiotics designed to mimic the BLIP-β-lactamase interaction (20Petrosino J. Rudgers G.W. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study we have developed and used a phage display system to determine the residues in the 99–112 loop-helix and the 234–240 B3 β-strand of TEM-1 β-lactamase that are critical for the tight binding interaction with BLIP (Fig. 1).

The β-lactamase random libraries encompassing regions 99–114 and 232–240 were previously constructed in the pBG66 plasmid as described (26Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The pBG66 vectors harboring the β-lactamase mutants A237T and the double mutant L113A/T114R were selected from random libraries of β-lactamase as described previously (27Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The phagemid vector pG3-SPT was constructed previously by the insertion of a spectinomycin cassette into the cat gene of pG3-CMP as described (29Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For monovalent phage display of β-lactamase random libraries including regions 99–114 and 232–240, the phagemid vector pG3-CMP was used (29Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-lactamase random library 103–105, consisting of three consecutive randomized codons 5′-NNN-NNN-NNN-3′ (N = A, G, C, or T) in the vector pBG66, was constructed as described previously (30Palzkill T. Botstein D. Methods. 1991; 3: 155-164Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The remaining β-lactamase gene libraries were constructed as described (27Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), each consisting of three consecutive randomized codons 5′-NNS-NNS-NNS-3′ (S = G or C) in vector pBG66. The β-lactamase gene for each library was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the following primers: PD-bla1, 5′-CGGGGAGCTCGTTTCTTAGACGTCAGGTGGC-3′; PD-bla2, 5′-CCCCGTCTAGACCCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAG-3′. Enzyme restriction sites are underlined; the primer PD-bla1 contains a SacI site, and the primer PD-bla2 contains an XbaI site. The polymerase chain reaction product from each β-lactamase random library was digested with SacI and XbaI, gel-purified, and ligated into the SacI/XbaI sites of pG3-CMP to generate pG3-C4 (Fig. 3). Plasmid DNA was electroporated into E. coli XL1-Blue according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, Inc.) and plated on LB agar containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The resulting colonies were pooled using 1 ml of LB medium. To determine that the pool size of each constructed library was large enough to have a 99% probability of containing the least probable sequence combination (e.g.Trp-Trp-Trp), the Poisson distribution was used (26Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A 1/100 volume of the pooled colonies was used to prepare bacteriophage library stocks. For packaging phagemid, E. coli infected with the phagemid to be packaged were inoculated into 25 ml of 2YT containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol along with 1 × 109 VCS M13 helper phage (Stratagene, Inc.). After 15 min incubation at room temperature, the culture was grown shaking overnight at 37 °C. The bacteria were pelleted after overnight growth, and the phages were precipitated from the supernatant with 1/5 volume of 20% PEG-8000, 2.5m NaCl (31Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods. 1991; 3: 205-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The phages were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1/50 of the original volume of STE (0.1 mNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) (31Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods. 1991; 3: 205-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The phage titer was determined by making serial dilutions of the phage stock and adding 0.2 ml to 0.2 ml of an E. coli TG1 mid-log phase culture. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, aliquots of 0.2 ml were plated on LB agar supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After overnight growth at 37 °C, colonies were counted and the titer determined. Titers between 5 × 1012 and 5 × 1013 phages per ml were generally obtained. Purified BLIP was the target for binding of β-lactamase mutants displayed on phage particles. BLIP was expressed and purified as a fusion to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein. Binding experiments demonstrated the mal-BLIP fusion has the sameK i for β-lactamase inhibition as wild-type BLIP. Therefore, the mal-BLIP fusion protein was immobilized as the target for binding enrichment experiments. The only exception to this was the use of an N-terminal 6×-His BLIP protein (20Petrosino J. Rudgers G.W. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) for the panning experiments for the 106–108 and 112–114 libraries that were repeated. BLIP was immobilized for panning by attaching it covalently to oxirane-acrylic beads (Sigma) (31Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods. 1991; 3: 205-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BLIP was suspended at 0.2 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.6, with 50 mg of oxirane-acrylic beads and gently mixed at room temperature for 2 h followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml to block the remaining oxirane sites. Beads were stored at 4 °C. Oxirane-acrylic beads conjugated to polyclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody and to BSA were prepared as described for the BLIP-oxirane-acyrlic beads using a final volume of 0.50 and 2.0 mg/ml, respectively, of each protein. To prepare protein-bound oxirane-acrylic beads for phage panning, 5 mg of each bead solution was washed 4× with 0.8 ml of buffer A (Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.5 g/liter Tween 20) followed by 1 h incubation at room temperature in 1 ml of Superblock (Pierce). The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed an additional 5 times with buffer A. For panning, 1 × 1011 of a β-lactamase phage library and 1 × 1011 pG3-SPT phage were added to the 5 mg of the washed BLIP, polyclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody, or BSA-conjugated oxirane beads in a final volume of 0.8 ml in buffer A. The mixture was gently rocked at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were then washed 10 times in 0.8 ml of buffer A. Bound phage were removed from the beads by incubating with 0.2 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 g/liter Tween 20, 0.1 m KCl) for 15 min. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was removed and neutralized with 25 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The titer of the phage eluted from the beads was determined as described above by plating on LB agar containing chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml) to determine the number of phage encoding β-lactamase and by plating on LB agar containing spectinomycin (50 μg/ml) to determine the number of pG3-SPT phage that do not display a protein. The eluted phage were amplified by adding 0.18 ml of the neutralized elution mixture to 1 ml of mid-log phase E. coli TG1 cells and used to prepare phage particles for the next round of binding enrichment. The TEM-1 β-lactamase mutants L113A/T114R and E240K had previously been constructed in pBG66 (11Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These β-lactamase mutants were used to construct the triple mutant L113A/T114R/E240K. Internal β-lactamase restriction sites,EcoRI and PstI, allowed for the cloning of the mutated L113A/T114R β-lactamase gene fragment into the EcoRI/PstI-digested pBG66 vector harboring the β-lactamase mutation E240K. The sequence of this clone was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The newly constructed vector was named pGR35. DNA sequencing of β–lactamase mutants was performed directly on polymerase chain reaction products ofblaTEM amplified from single colonies (32Hanke M. Wink M. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 858-860PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for DNA sequencing were designed to prime specific sites within bla TEM. The β-lactamase mutants P107I/V108I, L113A/T114R, A237T, and E240K were selected for further characterization based on the phage panning results. For kinetic analysis and inhibition studies, the β-lactamase proteins were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity as described previously (28Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All enzymes were expressed under the control of the constitutive β-lactamase promoter in the non-amber suppressor E. colistrain RB791. Kinetic studies of the purified double mutant P107I/V108I and the single mutant A237T revealed that β-lactamase variants expressed from the pG3-C4 phagemid vector were inactive for unknown reasons. To express functional β-lactamase mutants, alternative expression vectors were utilized. Previous studies by our laboratory (11Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the β-lactamase variant E240K is expressed as an active enzyme from the expression vector pBG66. Based on these findings, the previously constructed β-lactamase mutants E240K and L113A/T114R in pBG66 were used to purify the corresponding β-lactamase enzymes (11Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For expression of the active β-lactamase single mutant A237T and double mutant P107I/V108I, the expression vector pTP123 was used (20Petrosino J. Rudgers G.W. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This vector was utilized since the β–lactamase variants from pG3-C4 could easily be cloned into the multi-cloning site of pTP123 and placed under the control of the inducible Ptrc promoter for increased β-lactamase expression if desired. The β-lactamase variants A237T and P107I/V108I were digested from the pG3-C4 vector with SacI and XbaI to release the β-lactamase promoter and gene (Fig. 3). The fragments were gel-purified and ligated into the SacI/XbaI sites of the expression vector pTP123 to generate pGR34 and pGR36, respectively. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli RB791 and selected on LB medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The β-lactamase mutants were expressed under the β-lactamase constitutive promoter and purified as described with the pBG66 clones. The triple mutant L113A/T114R/E240K was constructed in pBG66 as described above and purified from E. coli RB791. The kinetic parameters of the β-lactamase mutant enzymes were determined with cephaloridine as a substrate using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette as described previously (28Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Values reported are based on velocity measurements at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 μm substrate concentrations. Inhibition assays were performed using the substrate cephaloridine as described previously with the following modifications (20Petrosino J. Rudgers G.W. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the β-lactamase mutants L113A/T114R, E240K, and L113A/T114R/E240K, 0.1 nmβ-lactamase was incubated with varying concentrations of 6× histidine-tagged BLIP. For the wild-type β-lactamase and β-lactamase mutants P107I/V108I and A237T, 1.0 nmβ-lactamase was incubated with varying concentrations of the 6× histidine-tagged BLIP. The crystal structure of the TEM-1 β-lactamase-BLIP complex shows that BLIP associates mainly with the 99–112 loop-helix and the 234–240 B3 β-strand lining the active site pocket of TEM-1 β-lactamase; however, the relative importance of these residues for binding BLIP remains unknown (21Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In previous experiments by this laboratory (27Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) to determine the amino acid residues that are critical for the structure and function of TEM-1 β-lactamase, blocks of three contiguous codons were randomized to create a library containing all possible amino acid substitutions. Constructing a set of 88 individual libraries randomized the entire coding sequence of the gene (263 codons). Nine of these libraries, encompassing residues 99–114 and 232–240, cover the surface of TEM-1 β-lactamase that interacts with BLIP (Fig. 2). To determine which residues in the loop-helix and B3 β-strand regions of TEM-1 β-lactamase are critical for tight binding with BLIP, functional random mutants were selected from these libraries based on the ability to bind BLIP using monovalent phage display. In order to display the β-lactamase variants from the random libraries on the surface of the M13 bacteriophage, the pG3-C4 phagemid was constructed (Fig. 3). This vector encodes a fusion of β-lactamase to the N terminus of the M13 gene III protein (gIIIp), which is transcribed by the constitutive β-lactamase promoter. An amber codon present between the β-lactamase gene and gene III allows for expression of the fusion protein in amber suppressor strains of E. coli and expression of only β-lactamase in non-amber suppressor strains (31Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. Methods. 1991; 3: 205-216Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the vector encodes chloramphenicol resistance, bacteria harboring this vector can be selected on medium containing chloramphenicol. In order to sample all amino acid substitutions in the loop-helix region and B3 β-strand of TEM-1 β-lactamase, each of the nine β-lactamase randomized libraries were inserted into the pG3-C4 vector to create the β-lactamase phage display libraries. To determine the β-lactamase residues important for binding with BLIP, phage from each library were selected based on their ability to bind immobilized BLIP. Three controls were used to show that the phage binding to the immobilized BLIP was dependent on the β-lactamase-BLIP interaction. First, phage displaying a library of β-lactamase mutants were panned on immobilized BSA in addition to the immobilized BLIP. After three rounds of binding and selection of the random library 112–114, over 1600-fold more β-lactamase phage bound to immobilized BLIP than to the BSA control (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the β-lactamase displaying phage can be rapidly enriched when panned against immobilized BLIP and that the enrichment is not due to nonspecific binding to BSA. As a second control, phage displaying libraries of β-lactamase mutants were incubated with immobilized polyclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody. Since the polyclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody is capable of recognizing multiple epitopes on β-lactamase, it was expected that the majority of the displayed β-lactamase molecules would still bind the polyclonal antibody even if they contained substitutions in the BLIP-binding surface. After one round of panning of the 112–114 randomized library, 70-fold more phage bound the polyclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody than bound to BLIP (Fig. 4). However, after three rounds of panning only 5-fold more phage bound the antibodyversus BLIP. Similar results were obtained with the remaining phage displaying random libraries (data not shown). These data indicate that the β-lactamase mutants from the libraries were efficiently displayed on the phage and provide further evidence that after several rounds of panning β–lactamase mutants that bind BLIP can be selected. Finally, an internal control was used in which phage displaying β-lactamase libraries were incubated with an equal number of phage that did not display a protein in the presence of the immobilized targets BLIP, BSA, or polyclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody. The pG3-SPT vector used to produce non-displaying phage is similar to the randomized β-lactamase phage display vector pG3-C4 except the chloramphenicol cassette is replaced with the spectinomycin cassette, and no fusion is made with gene III (29Huang W. Petrosino J. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2893-2897"

In this study, we constructed several chimeric molecules between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits by using rabbit H+,K+-ATPase as a parental molecule. We found that the entire extracellular loop 1 segment between the first and second transmembrane segments (M1 and M2) and the luminal half of the M1 transmembrane segment of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were exchangeable with those of Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively, preserving H+,K+-ATPase activity, and that these segments are not essential for SCH 28080 binding. We found that several amino acid residues, including Glu-822, Thr-825, and Pro-829 in the M6 segment of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit are involved in determining the affinity for this inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that a chimeric H+,K+-ATPase acquired ouabain sensitivity and maintained SCH 28080 sensitivity when the loop 1 segment and Cys-815 in the loop 3 segment of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were simultaneously replaced by the corresponding segment and amino acid residue (Thr) of Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively, indicating that the binding sites of ouabain and SCH 28080 are separate. In this H+,K+-ATPase chimera, 12 amino acid residues in M1, M4, and loop 1–4 that have been suggested to be involved in ouabain binding of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit are present; however, the low ouabain sensitivity indicates the possibility that the sensitivity may be increased by additional amino acid substitutions, which shift the overall structural integrity of this chimeric H+,K+-ATPase toward that of Na+,K+-ATPase. 2-Methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo(1,2-a)pyridine-3acetonitrile (SCH 28080) is a K+ site inhibitor specific for gastric H+,K+-ATPase and seems to be a counterpart of ouabain for Na+,K+-ATPase from the viewpoint of reaction pattern (i.e. reversible binding, K+ antagonism, and binding on the extracellular side).

The corresponding loop in Na+,K+-ATPase is known to be involved in determining the affinity for ouabain (10Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recently, we examined the SCH 28080 binding site by site-directed mutagenesis and found that the putative binding sites of SCH 28080, Phe-126 and Asp-138, are not involved in the interaction with SCH 28080, and we proposed that Glu-822 in the transmembrane segment M6 is involved in determining the affinity for this inhibitor (11Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that when the luminal half of the M1 transmembrane segment of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (Ile99–Ile110) was replaced by the counterpart of gastric H+,K+-ATPase (Val115–Ile126), this chimeric Na+,K+-ATPase showed high affinity for SCH 28080. Here, we newly prepared the opposite chimera, in which the loop 1 segment or the luminal half of the M1 segment of rabbit H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was replaced by the counterparts of sheep Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively, and we also prepared several mutants in the M6 transmembrane segment and studied their sensitivity to the inhibitor.The amino acid residues in Na+,K+-ATPase involved in determining the affinity for ouabain have been proposed to be located on the M1 segment (13Yamamoto S.

Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and on the second, third, and fourth extracellular loops of the α-subunit (16Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we introduced these amino acid residues into the corresponding positions of gastric H+,K+-ATPase and studied the sensitivity of this chimeric H+,K+-ATPase to ouabain.DISCUSSIONSCH 28080 is a specific inhibitor for gastric H+,K+-ATPase, which competitively binds to the K+ site on the luminal side (6Beil W. Hackbarth I. Sewing K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 88: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is a good tool to study the location and the structure of the K+site. We have shown that a chimeric H+,K+-ATPase, Chimera 2, in which the entire loop 1 segment between the first and second transmembrane segments M1 and M2 of the rabbit H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was replaced with the corresponding portion of the sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit, retains sensitivity to SCH 28080 comparable with that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the loop 1 is not the direct binding site of SCH 28080.We have recently proposed that Glu-822 in the M6 segment of gastric H+,K+-ATPase is one of the sites involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080 (11Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we further studied the role of amino acids in the M6 segment around Glu-822 in determining the affinity for SCH 28080. Among them, the side chains of Thr-825 and Pro-829 are newly found to be involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080. The amino acid residue corresponding to Glu-822 is Asp in Na+,K+-ATPase, whereas Thr-825 and Pro-829 are conserved between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. These three residues are located 3 or 4 amino acids apart in the M6 helical domain. It is interesting that these three amino acids determining the affinity for SCH 28080 occupy the adjacent positions on the one side of the helix along the transmembrane direction (Fig. 10).Recently Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the luminal half of the M1 segment of H+,K+-ATPase is a partial determinant of SCH 28080 sensitivity from the finding that when this segment (115Val-126Ile) of rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase was incorporated into the corresponding portion of Na+,K+-ATPase, the chimeric Na+,K+-ATPase showed high affinity for SCH 28080. The amino acid residues of this segment were relatively well conserved between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase; as shown in Fig. 4, 4 of 12 amino acid residues in this segment are identical between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits, and several other replacements are conservative. Here, we prepared a chimeric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (Chimera 4) in which the luminal half of the M1 segment (Val117–Ile128) of H+,K+-ATPase was replaced by the corresponding segment of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Chimera 4 retained the K+-ATPase activity and showed SCH 28080 sensitivity comparable to that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 5), suggesting that the segment Val117–Ile128 is not essential for the binding with SCH 28080 in H+,K+-ATPase. Three mutant H+,K+-ATPases, in which two consecutive amino acids in the M1 segment were replaced by the corresponding amino acids of Na+,K+-ATPase (V117I/A118G, A120V/I121L, and L123F/I124L), also showed SCH 28080 sensitivity similar to that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase. These findings further support our present conclusion. Furthermore, we prepared a chimeric Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (NH12N) that is similar to that prepared by Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and studied the sensitivity of expressed Na+,K+-ATPase activity of the chimeric enzyme to SCH 28080. Na+,K+-ATPase activity of the chimeric enzyme expressed in HEK cells was not inhibited by 50 μm SCH 28080 (Fig. 6), indicating again that the luminal half of the M1 segment of H+,K+-ATPase is not involved in SCH 28080 binding. At present, it is hard to explain why our results are not consistent with the previous result reported by Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that we used rat Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit as a parental molecule, whereas Lyu and Farley used sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and that we transiently expressed the chimeric ATPase in HEK-293 cells, whereas they used the yeast expression system.The present Chimera 5 contains many amino acid residues involved in determining the affinity for ouabain (Fig. 7). This chimera acquired sensitivity to ouabain at the range higher than 1 mm (Fig. 8). The K+-ATPase activity of this chimera was also sensitive to SCH 28080 (Fig. 9). Blostein et al. (29Blostein R. Zhang R. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a chimeric ATPase composed of the amino-terminal half of the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase and the carboxyl-terminal half of the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 was bound with ouabain. (The junction between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves is a fluorescein isothiocyanate-binding site, a part of ATP binding site in the large cytoplasmic loop between the M4 and M5 transmembrane segments.) From this result, they proposed that the localization of determinants for ouabain binding in the Na+,K+-ATPase is not restricted in the amino-terminal half of the α-subunit and that multiple domains are capable of individually supporting low affinity ouabain binding. Their findings are in good agreement with our present findings. Chimera 5 has 12 amino acid residues that have been identified to be involved in ouabain binding in the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase: Cys-104 (position numbers for sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α1) in M1; Gln-111, Pro-118, Asp-121, and Asn-122 in loop 1; Tyr-308 in loop 2; Leu-330 and Ala-331 in M4; Leu-793 and Thr-797 in loop 3; and Phe-863 and Arg-880 in loop 4 (28Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The present sensitivity of Chimera 5 to ouabain is, however, very low compared with that of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase. The low sensitivity of Chimera 5 to ouabain is comparable with that of the chimeric ATPase between Na+,K+-ATPase and SERCA (Ca2+-ATPase) reported by Ishii and Takeyasu (30Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An isoform of H+,K+-ATPase cloned in rat colon (HKα2) also showed low affinity for ouabain (the K i value was 970 μm) (7Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present low sensitivity of Chimera 5 suggests that additional amino acid substitution is necessary to increase ouabain sensitivity, which may shift the overall structural integrity of chimeric H+,K+-ATPase toward that of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase. Tyr-108 in M1, Thr-338 in M4, Phe-786 in loop 3 (or M5), and Phe-982 in M10 are also reported to be involved in determining the affinity for ouabain by random mutagenesis experiments (28Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These residues are not conserved in the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, although there has been no report for the ouabain sensitivity of the mutants in which these residues are mutated to the corresponding amino acids in the H+,K+-ATPase.It is also noticeable that the binding site of SCH 28080 on the H+,K+-ATPase is not a counterpart of ouabain on the Na+,K+-ATPase because the K+-ATPase activity of Chimera 5 acquired ouabain sensitivity and maintained SCH 28080 sensitivity. Chimera 5 has mutations in the loop 1 segment and Cys-815, which are not involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080 in the H+,K+-ATPase.In conclusion, we have shown that the loop 1 and the luminal half of the M1 segments of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit are not essential for the binding with the proton pump inhibitor SCH 28080. Furthermore, incorporation of the loop 1 segment of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and replacement of Cys-815 by Thr in gastric H+,K+-ATPase confer ouabain sensitivity to this chimeric H+,K+-ATPase. This is the first report for the preparation of chimeric H+,K+-ATPase that is sensitive to both SCH 28080 and ouabain. H+,K+-ATPase, the proton pump responsible for gastric acid secretion (1Wallmark B. Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13681-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is the target molecule for proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole (2Morii M. Takata H. Takeguchi N. Gastroenterology. 1989; 96: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), rabeprazole (E3810) (3Morii M. Hamatani K. Takeguchi N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and SCH 28080 1The abbreviations used are: SCH 28080, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo (1,2-a)pyridine-3-acetonitrile; PCR, polymerase chain reaction 1The abbreviations used are: SCH 28080, 2-methyl-8-(phenylmethoxy)imidazo (1,2-a)pyridine-3-acetonitrile; PCR, polymerase chain reaction (4Scott C.K. Sundell E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 112: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SCH 28080 is a reversible inhibitor of gastric H+,K+-ATPase, which competitively binds to the luminal K+ high affinity site of the enzyme (5Keeling D.J. Taylor A.G. Schudt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5545-5551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor discriminates the K+site of H+,K+-ATPase from that of Na+,K+-ATPase, because it has little effect on Na+,K+-ATPase activity (6Beil W. Hackbarth I. Sewing K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 88: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). H+,K+-ATPase isoforms found in rat and guinea pig distal colons are resistant to SCH 28080 (7Cougnon M. Planelles G.

Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 1339-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The binding site of SCH 28080 in the gastric H+,K+-ATPase was previously studied by using a photoaffinity derivative of this inhibitor, 8-[(4-azidophenyl)-methoxy]-1-tritiomethyl-2,3-dimethylamidazo (1,2-a)pyridinium iodide, and it was reported that the binding site was in loop 1 between the transmembrane segments M1 and M2 of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (9Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding site was hypothesized to be Phe-126 and Asp-138, at the edge of the loop 1 segment from the computer-generated model (9Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding loop in Na+,K+-ATPase is known to be involved in determining the affinity for ouabain (10Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Recently, we examined the SCH 28080 binding site by site-directed mutagenesis and found that the putative binding sites of SCH 28080, Phe-126 and Asp-138, are not involved in the interaction with SCH 28080, and we proposed that Glu-822 in the transmembrane segment M6 is involved in determining the affinity for this inhibitor (11Asano S.

The amino acid residues in Na+,K+-ATPase involved in determining the affinity for ouabain have been proposed to be located on the M1 segment (13Yamamoto S. Askew G.R. Heiny J. Masaki H. Yatani A. Am.

DISCUSSIONSCH 28080 is a specific inhibitor for gastric H+,K+-ATPase, which competitively binds to the K+ site on the luminal side (6Beil W. Hackbarth I. Sewing K. Br. J.

These residues are not conserved in the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, although there has been no report for the ouabain sensitivity of the mutants in which these residues are mutated to the corresponding amino acids in the H+,K+-ATPase.It is also noticeable that the binding site of SCH 28080 on the H+,K+-ATPase is not a counterpart of ouabain on the Na+,K+-ATPase because the K+-ATPase activity of Chimera 5 acquired ouabain sensitivity and maintained SCH 28080 sensitivity. Chimera 5 has mutations in the loop 1 segment and Cys-815, which are not involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080 in the H+,K+-ATPase.In conclusion, we have shown that the loop 1 and the luminal half of the M1 segments of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit are not essential for the binding with the proton pump inhibitor SCH 28080. Furthermore, incorporation of the loop 1 segment of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and replacement of Cys-815 by Thr in gastric H+,K+-ATPase confer ouabain sensitivity to this chimeric H+,K+-ATPase. This is the first report for the preparation of chimeric H+,K+-ATPase that is sensitive to both SCH 28080 and ouabain. SCH 28080 is a specific inhibitor for gastric H+,K+-ATPase, which competitively binds to the K+ site on the luminal side (6Beil W. Hackbarth I. Sewing K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 88: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is a good tool to study the location and the structure of the K+site. We have shown that a chimeric H+,K+-ATPase, Chimera 2, in which the entire loop 1 segment between the first and second transmembrane segments M1 and M2 of the rabbit H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was replaced with the corresponding portion of the sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit, retains sensitivity to SCH 28080 comparable with that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the loop 1 is not the direct binding site of SCH 28080. We have recently proposed that Glu-822 in the M6 segment of gastric H+,K+-ATPase is one of the sites involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080 (11Asano S. Matsuda S. Tega Y. Shimizu K. Sakamoto S. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17668-17674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we further studied the role of amino acids in the M6 segment around Glu-822 in determining the affinity for SCH 28080. Among them, the side chains of Thr-825 and Pro-829 are newly found to be involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080. The amino acid residue corresponding to Glu-822 is Asp in Na+,K+-ATPase, whereas Thr-825 and Pro-829 are conserved between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. These three residues are located 3 or 4 amino acids apart in the M6 helical domain. It is interesting that these three amino acids determining the affinity for SCH 28080 occupy the adjacent positions on the one side of the helix along the transmembrane direction (Fig. 10). Recently Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the luminal half of the M1 segment of H+,K+-ATPase is a partial determinant of SCH 28080 sensitivity from the finding that when this segment (115Val-126Ile) of rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase was incorporated into the corresponding portion of Na+,K+-ATPase, the chimeric Na+,K+-ATPase showed high affinity for SCH 28080. The amino acid residues of this segment were relatively well conserved between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase; as shown in Fig. 4, 4 of 12 amino acid residues in this segment are identical between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase α-subunits, and several other replacements are conservative. Here, we prepared a chimeric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (Chimera 4) in which the luminal half of the M1 segment (Val117–Ile128) of H+,K+-ATPase was replaced by the corresponding segment of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Chimera 4 retained the K+-ATPase activity and showed SCH 28080 sensitivity comparable to that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 5), suggesting that the segment Val117–Ile128 is not essential for the binding with SCH 28080 in H+,K+-ATPase. Three mutant H+,K+-ATPases, in which two consecutive amino acids in the M1 segment were replaced by the corresponding amino acids of Na+,K+-ATPase (V117I/A118G, A120V/I121L, and L123F/I124L), also showed SCH 28080 sensitivity similar to that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase. These findings further support our present conclusion. Furthermore, we prepared a chimeric Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (NH12N) that is similar to that prepared by Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and studied the sensitivity of expressed Na+,K+-ATPase activity of the chimeric enzyme to SCH 28080. Na+,K+-ATPase activity of the chimeric enzyme expressed in HEK cells was not inhibited by 50 μm SCH 28080 (Fig. 6), indicating again that the luminal half of the M1 segment of H+,K+-ATPase is not involved in SCH 28080 binding. At present, it is hard to explain why our results are not consistent with the previous result reported by Lyu and Farley (12Lyu R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that we used rat Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit as a parental molecule, whereas Lyu and Farley used sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and that we transiently expressed the chimeric ATPase in HEK-293 cells, whereas they used the yeast expression system. The present Chimera 5 contains many amino acid residues involved in determining the affinity for ouabain (Fig. 7). This chimera acquired sensitivity to ouabain at the range higher than 1 mm (Fig. 8). The K+-ATPase activity of this chimera was also sensitive to SCH 28080 (Fig. 9). Blostein et al. (29Blostein R. Zhang R. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a chimeric ATPase composed of the amino-terminal half of the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase and the carboxyl-terminal half of the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 was bound with ouabain. (The junction between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves is a fluorescein isothiocyanate-binding site, a part of ATP binding site in the large cytoplasmic loop between the M4 and M5 transmembrane segments.) From this result, they proposed that the localization of determinants for ouabain binding in the Na+,K+-ATPase is not restricted in the amino-terminal half of the α-subunit and that multiple domains are capable of individually supporting low affinity ouabain binding. Their findings are in good agreement with our present findings. Chimera 5 has 12 amino acid residues that have been identified to be involved in ouabain binding in the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase: Cys-104 (position numbers for sheep Na+,K+-ATPase α1) in M1; Gln-111, Pro-118, Asp-121, and Asn-122 in loop 1; Tyr-308 in loop 2; Leu-330 and Ala-331 in M4; Leu-793 and Thr-797 in loop 3; and Phe-863 and Arg-880 in loop 4 (28Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The present sensitivity of Chimera 5 to ouabain is, however, very low compared with that of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase. The low sensitivity of Chimera 5 to ouabain is comparable with that of the chimeric ATPase between Na+,K+-ATPase and SERCA (Ca2+-ATPase) reported by Ishii and Takeyasu (30Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An isoform of H+,K+-ATPase cloned in rat colon (HKα2) also showed low affinity for ouabain (the K i value was 970 μm) (7Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The present low sensitivity of Chimera 5 suggests that additional amino acid substitution is necessary to increase ouabain sensitivity, which may shift the overall structural integrity of chimeric H+,K+-ATPase toward that of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase. Tyr-108 in M1, Thr-338 in M4, Phe-786 in loop 3 (or M5), and Phe-982 in M10 are also reported to be involved in determining the affinity for ouabain by random mutagenesis experiments (28Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These residues are not conserved in the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, although there has been no report for the ouabain sensitivity of the mutants in which these residues are mutated to the corresponding amino acids in the H+,K+-ATPase. It is also noticeable that the binding site of SCH 28080 on the H+,K+-ATPase is not a counterpart of ouabain on the Na+,K+-ATPase because the K+-ATPase activity of Chimera 5 acquired ouabain sensitivity and maintained SCH 28080 sensitivity. Chimera 5 has mutations in the loop 1 segment and Cys-815, which are not involved in determining the affinity for SCH 28080 in the H+,K+-ATPase. In conclusion, we have shown that the loop 1 and the luminal half of the M1 segments of H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit are not essential for the binding with the proton pump inhibitor SCH 28080. Furthermore, incorporation of the loop 1 segment of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and replacement of Cys-815 by Thr in gastric H+,K+-ATPase confer ouabain sensitivity to this chimeric H+,K+-ATPase. This is the first report for the preparation of chimeric H+,K+-ATPase that is sensitive to both SCH 28080 and ouabain. We thank Nopparat Thitiwatanakarn for technical assistance.

Our earlier studies established that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) uptake. Studies now have been carried out to determine which type of Na/Pi transporter (Pit-1 or Pit-2) is regulated by PKC and which PKC isotypes are involved in the up-regulation of Na/Pi uptake by the Na/Pi transporter/viral receptor. It was found that the activation of short term (2-min) Na/Pi uptake by PMA is abolished when cells are infected with amphotropic murine retrovirus (binds Pit-2 receptor) but not with gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus (binds Pit-1 receptor), indicating that Pit-2 is the form of Na/Pi transporter/viral receptor regulated by PKC. The PKC-mediated activation of Pit-2 was blocked by pretreating cells with the pan-PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide but not with the conventional PKC isotype inhibitor Gö 6976, suggesting that a novel PKC isotype is required to regulate Pit-2. Overexpression of PKCε, but not of PKCα, -δ, or -ζ, was found to mimic the activation of Na/Pi uptake. To further establish that PKCε is involved in the regulation of Pit-2, cells were treated with PKCε-selective antisense oligonucleotides. Treatment with PKCε antisense oligonucleotides decreased the PMA-induced activation of Na/Pi uptake. These results indicate that PMA-induced stimulation of Na/Pi uptake by Pit-2 is specifically mediated through activation of PKCε.

Protein kinases, including members of the protein kinase C family, regulate numerous biological functions, including intracellular protein trafficking and the activities of different ion transporters (1Nishizuka Y. Nakamura S. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22 Suppl. 1: S202-S203Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) 1The abbreviations used are: Na/Pi, sodium-dependent phosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; A-MuLV, amphotropic murine retrovirus; E-MuLV, ecotropic MuLV; GALV, gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus; AON, antisense oligonucleotide; pε-MTH, pε-metallothionein transport was stimulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibited by protein kinase A in NIH 3T3 cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, was found to cause a rapid (within 10 min) stimulation of short term Na/Pi uptake (2Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, at that time the identity of the Na/Pi transporter stimulated in response to PMA was not known, and this prevented further characterization of the PKC-mediated activation of the transporter. More recently, cell surface receptors for the gibbon ape leukemia virus (Glvr-l and Pit-1) and the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (Ram-1, Ear, and Pit-2) were demonstrated to serve as Na/Pitransporters in the normal cellular physiology of diverse cell types (3Kavanaugh M.P.

Virol. 1995; 69: 534-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence data obtained for the Pit-1 and Pit-2 receptor-transporters has revealed multiple sites potentially susceptible to phosphorylation by protein kinases, including PKC, which are found within the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain of both transporters between residues 250 and 450. Indeed, parathyroid hormone-induced regulation of transporter function mediated through activation of protein kinase A and PKC has been described for type I and II Na/Pi transporters present in kidney brush-border membranes (6Murer H. Werner A. Reshkin S. Wuarin F. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C885-C899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to parathyroid hormone, prostaglandin E2, insulin-like growth factor 1, and vitamin D3 all have been reported to regulate Na/Pi uptake through activation of PKC in osteoblasts, another cell type that uses high levels of inorganic phosphate (7Arao M. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Fukase M. Chihara K. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 131: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Schmid C. Keller C. Schlapfer I. Veldman C. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys.

Schlapfer I. Schmid C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 89-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also has been suggested that a phospholipase Cγ-PKC signaling pathway is responsible for the up-regulated Pi transport observed with platelet-derived growth factor treatment of osteoblast-like cells.

In osteoblasts it is possible that the more ubiquitously expressed type III Na/Pi transporters, such as Pit-1 and Pit-2, might be involved in the PKC-regulated uptake of Pi. Conversely, activation of PKC has been reported to inhibit Pi uptake in opossum kidney cells, which may indicate different regulation of the renal type I and II transporters (6Murer H. Werner A. Reshkin S. Wuarin F. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C885-C899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Quamme G. Biber J. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F967-F973PubMed Google Scholar, 15Quamme G. Pelech S. Biber J. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These differences in PKC-mediated regulation of Pi uptake may be a consequence of different expression patterns of either PKC and/or Na/Pitransporter isotypes in different cell lines. One of the major difficulties in determining which PKC isotypes are involved in regulating Na/Pi transport is that different cell types express various combinations of PKC isoforms. Protein kinase C is a family of at least 11 serine- and threonine-specific phosphotransferase isoenzymes that are characterized by a high degree of homology in their catalytic and cysteine-rich domains (1Nishizuka Y. Nakamura S. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22 Suppl. 1: S202-S203Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the possible role(s) of different PKC isozymes in cell growth and differentiation has been well studied (for review, see Ref. 1Nishizuka Y. Nakamura S. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1995; 22 Suppl. 1: S202-S203Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), much less is known of their potential involvement in modulating intracellular trafficking of transmembrane receptors and up-regulation of ion transporters. In this study we have sought to determine which type of Na/Pi transporter/viral receptor is regulated by PMA activation of PKC and which PKC isotype(s) may be involved in the up-regulation of Na/Pi uptake in NIH 3T3 cells. The results presented in this communication indicate that the Pit-2 Na/Pi transporter/viral receptor is specifically activated by PMA stimulation of PKCε. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum were purchased from Biofluids Inc. (Rockville, MD). PMA, bisindolylmaleimide, and Gö 6976 were products of Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 32P-Labeled monopotassium phosphate was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The PKC isotype-specific antisense and scrambled oligonucleotides (ISIS 17260, PKCε antisense; ISIS 17261, PKCε scrambled control) were from ISIS Pharmaceuticals. PKCε isotype-specific polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; PKCα-specific monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and PKCδ- and PKCζ-specific monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Retrovirus-infected and vector-transduced NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After the cells reached confluency, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM for 24 h. To induce overexpression of any ectopic gene products, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μm zinc acetate, as indicated, to induce the up-regulation of the metallothionein promoter of the pεMTH vector (16Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The construction of expression vectors and establishment of PKC overproducer cell lines were carried out as described previously (17Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The PKCa, -δ, -ε, and -ζ plasmid constructs were prepared in the pεMTH vector, and overexpressor cell lines were established following protocols described elsewhere (18Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individually picked colonies (10 from each transfection) were selected and combined for further studies to eliminate potential cloning artifacts. These mixed populations of overexpressor cells were used only through 12–14 passages in culture to negate possible outgrowth of one particular clone. Sodium-dependent phosphate uptake was determined as described previously (2Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts and mink lung fibroblasts (ATCC CCL 64) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 cells were infected with wild type amphotropic murine retrovirus (A-MuLV) strain 4070A or the 57A Friend strain of ecotropic MuLV (E-MuLV). Mink fibroblasts expressing gibbon ape leukemia retrovirus (GALV)-competent PiT-1 were infected with wild type A-MuLV strain 4070A or infected with a GALV strain (SEATO), as described previously (4Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Eiden M.V. Wilson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25426-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Productive infection was monitored by measuring the reverse transcriptase activity found in the cell media of the infected cells (19Wilson C.A. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in 150-mm tissue culture dishes until they reached ∼80% confluency. The cells then were harvested by trypsinization, washed with DMEM, and resuspended in 400 μl of cytosalt electroporation buffer (75% cytosalts (120 mm KCI, 0.15 mm CaC12, 10 mmK2HP04, pH 7.6, 6.5 mmMgCl2) and 25% Opti-MEM I). Twenty-μl aliquots of PKC isotype-specific or scrambled control oligonucleotides were added to the cells resuspended in prechilled BTX disposable electroporation cuvettes (P/N 640; 4-mm gap) to reach the indicated concentrations and then incubated on ice for 5 min. The oligonucleotides indicated were introduced into the cells by electroporation with a BTX Electro Square Porator (settings: low voltage mode, 99 msec; charge voltage, 475 V; pulse length, 1 msec; number of pulses, 4). The electroporated cells were kept at room temperature for 10 min and then seeded onto 100-mm tissue culture plates for immunoblot studies and onto 24-well plates for Pi uptake measurements. Western blot analysis of PKC isotypes and Pi uptake studies were carried out 24 h after introduction of the antisense oligonucleotides. Proteins were separated by precast 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Owl Separation Systems, Portsmouth, NH) electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto Protran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH), and immunoreactive proteins were detected as described elsewhere (16Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most retroviruses have been found to use distinct cell surface receptors for specific cellular recognition and infection (for review, see Ref. 20Weiss R.A. Tailor C.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies have revealed that the normal cellular function of a number of these viral receptors is to serve as membrane transport proteins (20Weiss R.A. Tailor C.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells have been found to express several of these viral receptor/transporters, including Pit-1, Pit-2, and the cationic amino acid transporter CAT/y+, as determined by viral infection studies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. NIH 3T3 cells are susceptible to infection by A-MuLV via Pit-2 and to infection with E-MuLV via the CAT/y+ amino acid transporter. However, because of the presence of specific point mutations in the endogenous murine Pit-1, Pit-1 is not functional as a GALV receptor in NIH 3T3 cells. Previous studies have established that infection of cells with retroviruses that selectively recognize either Pit-1 or Pit-2 resulted in the specific down-modulation of phosphate uptake mediated by that receptor/transporter (3Kavanaugh M.P.

Lehel C. Olah Z. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 534-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon has been observed to occur with the E-MuLV CAT/y+ receptor (21Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 22Wang H. Dechant E. Kavanaugh M. North R.A. Kabat D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23617-23624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine which of the viral receptor/Pi transporters are subject to regulation by PMA activation of PKC, studies were carried out with NIH 3T3 cells infected with different C-type retroviruses. The results presented in Fig. 1Ademonstrate that infection with A-MuLV decreased short term (2-min) basal Na/Pi transport (from 900 ± 91 to 404 ± 28 pmol of Pi/min/mg of protein) and, importantly, completely abolished the activation of Pi transport noted with exposure of cells to PMA. Infection of cells with E-MuLV would not be expected to alter Pi uptake, because this virus binds to a distinct cell surface cationic amino acid transporter (21Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A.

Thus, to control for possible pleiotropic effects of retrovirus infection on Na/Pi transport, Pi uptake experiments were carried out with NIH 3T3 cells infected with E-MuLV (Fig. 1B). The results indicated that infection with E-MuLV did not alter either basal or PMA-induced Na/Pi transport. As noted, GALV binds to the Pit-1 receptor of mink fibroblasts and selectively down-modulates Pi uptake caused by Pit-1 (4Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Eiden M.V. Wilson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25426-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Na/Pi transport mediated by Pit-1 or Pit-2 is stimulated by activation of PKC, Pi uptake was measured in mink cells infected with either A-MuLV or GALV. Infection of these cells with A-MuLV again completely abolished the activation of Pi transport noted with exposure of cells to PMA (Fig. 1C). Although GALV infection did result in an ∼25% decrease in basal Na/Pi transport, which apparently is attributable to down-modulation of Pit-1, it did not decrease the PMA-induced stimulation of Pi uptake noted in these cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results obtained with C-type retrovirus-infected cells indicate that Pit-2 is the Pi transporter/viral receptor that is up-regulated with exposure of cells to PMA. Although studies have established a general role for PKC in the regulation of several membrane transport mechanisms, little is known concerning the functional role(s) of specific PKC isotypes in these regulatory processes. Thus, studies were initiated to determine which PKC isotype(s) are involved in mediating the PMA-induced up-regulation of the Pit-2 transporter/receptor in NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells express a limited, but representative, set of different PKC isozymes (PKCα, PKCδ, PKCε, and PKCζ) (18Lehel C. Olah Z. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4761-4766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PMA does not directly activate atypical PKCζ, this isotype would not appear to be involved in the short term PMA-induced activation of Pit-2 Pi transport. Thus, experiments were initiated to address which class of PKC isoform stimulates Pi transport in response to activation by PMA. Two different PKC inhibitors were used to determine whether the PMA-induced activation of Na/Pi transport in NIH 3T3 cells was mediated via a conventional, Ca2+-dependent (PKCα), or a novel, Ca2+-independent (PKCδ and PKCε), isotype. Addition of the pan-specific bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor, which inhibits both classical and novel isotypes, resulted in pronounced inhibition of the PMA-induced activation of Na/Pi uptake (Fig. 2). Conversely, treatment of the cells with the Gö 6976 PKC inhibitor, which selectively inhibits only the classical PKC isotypes, did not cause significant inhibition of the PMA-induced up-regulation of Pi transport. These results suggested that the classical PKCα isoform likely was not involved in mediating the activation of Na/Pi uptake by Pit-2 with exposure of NIH 3T3 cells to PMA. To further resolve which of the PKC isotype(s) may be involved in mediating the PMA activation of the Na/Pi uptake, we used NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing PKCα, -δ, -ε, or -ζ isozymes to determine the ability of each isotype to enhance Pit-2 Pi transport activity in the absence of PMA treatment. The cell cultures were shifted to serum-free media and incubated in the presence of 20 μm zinc acetate for 24 h to enhance expression of the indicated PKC isotype directed by the metallothionein promoter of the pε-MTH vector. Overexpression of PKCε was found to increase Na/Pi uptake, whereas overexpression of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCζ did not appreciably alter the level of Pi transport relative to the level determined in vector control cells (Fig. 3A). Exposure of the PKCε overexpressor cells to 1 μm PMA resulted in only an additional 15–20% increase in Pitransport. 2Z. Jobbagy, M. V. Eiden, and W. B. Anderson, unpublished results. Western blot analysis showed that the level of expression was similar for each of the ε epitope-tagged PKC isotypes (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the selective overexpression of PKCε alone can mimic the stimulation of Na/Pi uptake observed with PMA treatment of wild type cells. To further support the findings that PKCε is the isotype involved in mediating the PMA-induced activation of the Pit-2 Pi transporter, studies were carried out with PKCε-selective antisense oligonucleotide (AON) to specifically inhibit PKC-ε in the cell. As shown in Fig. 4A, pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with increasing concentrations of PKCε-AON significantly decreased the expressed levels of PKCε and had no effect on the levels of PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCζ. Densitometric scanning to quantitate the intensity of the PKCε bands of cells treated with PKCε-AON relative to AON scrambled controls indicated relative band densities of 1.0, 0.59, and 0.28 with 0.24, 1.2, and 2.4 mmoligonucleotide treatment, respectively. Importantly, treatment of the cells with PKCε-AON did result in inhibition of PMA-induced up-regulation of Pi transport (Fig. 4B). Treatment of cells with scrambled oligonucleotides did not have any effect on either the intracellular level of PKCε or PMA activation of Na/Pi uptake. Similar experiments with PKCδ-AON (ISIS 17254) caused a significant decrease in the levels of PKCδ but had no effect on PMA-induced stimulation of Pi uptake (data not shown). These data provide additional evidence to support the exclusive involvement of PKCε in mediating PMA activation of Pit-2. The suggestion that different PKC isotypes play distinct functional roles in the cell by phosphorylating either isoform- or subcellular compartment-specific substrates is widely accepted. However, few studies have been reported that establish that a specific PKC isotype may selectively regulate a given biological function. Although a role for PKC has been implicated in the regulation of numerous membrane transport mechanisms (10Veldman C.M. Schlapfer I. Schmid C.

Karim et al. (28Karim Z. Defontaine N. Paillard M. Poggioli J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C134-C140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) attributed the modulation of the Na/H antiport to both PKCα and PKCε. PKCε also has been implicated in the stimulation of anionic amino acid transport (29Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Bussolati O. Gazzola G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26124-26130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to PKCδ has been shown to block the α1-adrenergic activation of Na-K-2Cl cotransport (30Liedtke C.M. Cole T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1632-C1640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence reported here indicates that PKCε is involved in mediating the PMA-induced up-regulation of Na/Pi uptake by the Pit-2 transporter/viral receptor. The Pit-1 and Pit-2 viral receptor/Pi transporters share 56% amino acid identity (31van Zeijl M. Johann S.V. Closs E. Cunningham J. Eddy R. Shows T.B. O'Hara B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of Pit-1 and Pit-2 suggested the presence of at least two clusters of putative transmembrane-spanning sequences, along with a large intracellular hydrophilic domain located between the sixth and seventh transmembrane helices (4Olah Z. Lehel C. Anderson W.B. Eiden M.V. Wilson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25426-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wilson C.A. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are a number of consensus phosphorylation sites in both Pit-1 and Pit-2, particularly within the hydrophilic loop domain. Thus, it is likely that PKCε may directly phosphorylate Pit-2 to stimulate Na/Pi uptake. However, another mechanism of regulation found with other transporters is induced redistribution of the transporter from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane. For example, insulin has been reported to regulate the intracellular trafficking of glucose transporter 4 (32Hudson A.W. Ruiz M. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that PKCε can regulate Golgi-related functions, including protein trafficking and secretion (17Lehel C. Olah Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, studies were carried out to determine whether PMA still was able to enhance Pi uptake under conditions in which vesicle trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane was blocked by incubating cells at room temperature and by treatment of cells with nocodazole (to disrupt microtubules) and cytochalasin D (to disrupt actin filaments). It was found that these treatments did not block PMA-induced activation of Pi uptake.2Although these results indicate that PKCε does not act by modulating the trafficking of PiT-2 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, they do not fully rule out the possibility that PKCε might act to mediate the rapid recruitment (fusion) of an existing pool of Pit-2-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. In addition to their role as representative members of an important family of phosphate transporters, Pit-1 and Pit-2 are of particular interest as the cell surface receptors for the GALV and A-MuLV retroviruses, respectively. Many current gene therapy protocols use GALV- or A-MuLV-enveloped vectors (33Barquinero J. Kiem H.P. von Kalle C. Darovsky B. Goehle S. Graham T. Seidel K. Storb R. Schuening F.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 959-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A basic knowledge of murine leukemia virus receptor regulation and trafficking is likely to be useful in the development and improvement of gene therapy protocols based on the use of these retroviral vectors. Although our results clearly indicate that PKCε is involved in regulating Na/Pi uptake by Pit-2, it remains to be determined whether PKCε-mediated regulation of the Pit-2 transporter/viral receptor might influence recognition of the viral envelope protein and viral entry into the cell.

https://openalex.org/W1998507912,"The fidelity of protein synthesis requires efficient discrimination of amino acid substrates by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Accurate discrimination of the structurally similar amino acids, valine and isoleucine, by isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) results, in part, from a hydrolytic editing reaction, which prevents misactivated valine from being stably joined to tRNAIle. The editing reaction is dependent on the presence of tRNAIle, which contains discrete D-loop nucleotides that are necessary to promote editing of misactivated valine. RNA minihelices comprised of just the acceptor-TΨC helix of tRNAIle are substrates for specific aminoacylation by IleRS. These substrates lack the aforementioned D-loop nucleotides. Because minihelices contain determinants for aminoacylation, we thought that they might also play a role in editing that has not previously been recognized. Here we show that, in contrast to tRNAIle, minihelixIle is unable to trigger the hydrolysis of misactivated valine and, in fact, is mischarged with valine. In addition, mutations in minihelixIle that enhance or suppress charging with isoleucine do the same with valine. Thus, minihelixIle contains signals for charging (by IleRS) that are independent of the amino acid and, by itself, minihelixIle provides no determinants for editing. An RNA hairpin that mimics the D-stem/loop of tRNAIle is also unable to induce the hydrolysis of misactivated valine, both by itself and in combination with minihelixIle. Thus, the native tertiary fold of tRNAIle is required to promote efficient editing. Considering that the minihelix is thought to be the more ancestral part of the tRNA structure, these results are consistent with the idea that, during the development of the genetic code, RNA determinants for editing were added after the establishment of an aminoacylation system.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases establish the genetic code by attaching amino acids to their cognate tRNAs (1Lapointe J. Giegé R. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 35-69Google Scholar, 2Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

These reactions are comprised of two steps. Initially the amino acid is condensed with ATP to give an activated aminoacyl adenylate. Subsequently, the aminoacyl moiety of this reactive intermediate is transesterified to the 3′ terminus of the tRNA. The fidelity of the genetic code depends upon the precise molecular recognition of both the amino acid and tRNA substrates by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. It has long been recognized that the accurate transduction of molecular information is made increasingly difficult when the molecular structures of two candidate substrates are highly similar (4Pauling L. Festschrift fuer Prof. Dr. Arthur Stoll. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1958: 597-602Google Scholar, 5Cramer F. Englisch U. Freist W. Sternbach H.

A prominent example of the need to discriminate between closely related substrates is in the recognition of isoleucine over valine by IleRS. 1The abbreviations used are: IleRS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase; Ile-AMP, isoleucyl adenylate; Val-AMP, valyl adenylate Valine, which differs from isoleucine by a single methylene unit, is activated byEscherichia coli IleRS at a rate approximately 180-fold slower than that of isoleucine (8Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). IleRS prevents this relatively high error rate from being realized in protein synthesis through two editing reactions that result in the net hydrolysis of misactivated valine (7Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 355-358Google Scholar,9Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol.

These reactions provide a second “sieve” (11Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) of discrimination against valine and indeed occur at a second, “editing” active site on IleRS (8Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11204-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Editing of misactivated valine has a strict requirement for tRNAIle (9Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the absence of tRNAIle, enzymatically generated Ile-AMP and Val-AMP remain sequestered in the active site. Upon addition of tRNAIle to the IleRS·Ile-AMP complex, the aminoacyl group is stably attached to tRNAIle. In contrast, addition of tRNAIle to the IleRS·Val-AMP complex results in immediate hydrolysis of the valyl adenylate. This occurs partly through a pretransfer editing reaction where misactivated Val-AMP is directly hydrolyzed. Alternatively, the valyl moiety of Val-AMP is transferred to tRNAIle to make a transient Val-tRNAIleintermediate that is rapidly hydrolyzed. The net result of either pathway is an abortive cycle of valine activation followed by tRNAIle-dependent hydrolysis that continues until all available ATP is consumed. In contrast to nucleotide determinants for charging that are located in the anticodon loop and acceptor stem of tRNAIle (14Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C. Giegé R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 710-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), nucleotides in the D-loop of tRNAIle trigger the editing reaction (13Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, replacement of G-16, D-20, and D-21 in the D-loop of tRNAIle with their counterparts from tRNAVal has little effect on aminoacylation. In contrast, these substitutions abolish the editing response. Conversely, transfer of the three D-loop nucleotides from tRNAIle into the framework of a specially designed tRNAVal confers editing activity to the chimerized tRNA. Thus, tRNA determinants for editing and aminoacylation are discrete. Similarly, a single (G56A) mutation in the active site (for aminoacylation) of IleRS eliminates the discrimination between isoleucine and valine in amino acid activation (8Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the G56A mutant enzyme still discriminates between isoleucine and valine in the post-transfer editing reaction. These and other mutational analyses, along with chemical cross-linking data (12Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11204-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 11985-11994Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), showed that the editing and aminoacylation sites are physically distinct and functionally independent. Specifically, the editing site is located within a large insertion known as CP1 (connective polypeptide 1) (16Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This 277-amino acid insertion divides the characteristic class I catalytic domain in half (17Starzyk R.M. Webster T.A. Schimmel P. Science. 1987; 237: 1614-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A recently determined x-ray structure places the two active sites about 25-Å apart (18Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A present working hypothesis is that specific nucleotides in the D-loop of tRNAIle trigger the translocation of the valyl group from the aminoacylation to the editing site. Here we tested whether the presumptive translocation and editing response could be recreated by dividing the critical domains of tRNAIle into two pieces. One piece is an oligonucleotide substrate that recreates the acceptor stem of the tRNA in the form of a minihelix. Previous work showed that IleRS could charge minihelixIle with isoleucine (19Nureki O. Niimi T. Muto Y. Kanno H. Kohno T. Muramatsu T. Kawai G. Miyazawa T. Giegé R. Florentz C. Yokoyama S.

Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12214-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The other piece is an RNA hairpin ligand designed after the D-loop of tRNAIle. Thus, we asked whether the two pieces in concert could reproduce the editing reaction or whether continuity of the tRNA structure was required. If the editing response requires the full tRNAIle structure and if the D-loop provides critical determinants only within the context of the full tRNA, then we imagined that minihelixIle might be a good substrate for mischarging with valine. In that event, we wondered whether mischarging depended on the same nucleotide determinants as those required for correct aminoacylation. This part of the analysis was motivated by the prospect of discovering acceptor stem determinants that modulate discrimination against valine. Wild-type E. coli IleRS was overexpressed in the E. coli strain MV1184 harboring the multicopy plasmid pKS21 (21Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein purification was essentially as described previously (22Shepard A. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RNA concentrations were determined using absorbance at 260 nm at room temperature. Extinction coefficients were estimated using the Biopolymer Calculator available online. 2A. Schepartz, web page address:http://paris.chem.yale.edu/extinct.html. Mature E. coli tRNA1Ile (GAU) was isolated from E. coli strain MV1184 containing the plasmid pES300, which allows for the lac-inducible overexpression of tRNAIle (24.Schmidt, E., Amino Acid Recognition by a Class I tRNA Synthetase.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The RNA-dependent hydrolysis of valyl adenylate was assayed by following the consumption of [γ-32P]ATP using a protocol that has been described in detail elsewhere (26Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2755-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 140 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm[γ-32P]ATP (25 μCi/μmol), 1 mm valine, 75 nm inorganic pyrophosphatase, 5 μm IleRS, and either 40 μm tRNAIle or 200 μm minihelixIle and/or D-loopIle. Reactions with no RNA were used to control for a small background rate of hydrolysis (typically about 1% of the tRNAIle-dependent rate). The IleRS-catalyzed isoleucylation or valylation of RNA substrates was followed using the trichloroacetic acid precipitation method of Shepard and co-workers (22Shepard A. Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9964-9968Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at room temperature in a solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 10 nm inorganic pyrophosphatase, 5 μm [3H]amino acid (∼20 mCi/μmol), and 5 μm IleRS. RNA minihelices were used at a concentration of 50–500 μm and tRNAIle at a concentration of 10–40 μm. No-RNA controls were used to correct for background rates. The L-shaped tRNAIle structure (Fig. 1, top right) is composed of two helical domains (27Kim S.H. Suddath F.L. Quigley G.J. McPherson A. Sussman J.L. Wang A.H. Seeman N.C. Rich A.

Coaxial stacking of the acceptor and TΨC stems gives rise to the hairpin minihelix domain as the upper arm of the L-shape. The second domain is a “dumbbell” formed by the anticodon and D-stem/loops. Specific hydrogen bonds between the TΨC and D-loops link the two helical domains at the corner of the L-shaped tRNA. Interactions at the corner are crucial for establishing the canonical tRNA fold, and thus the nucleotides that form these interactions are well conserved among all tRNA species. This junction forms an obvious connection through which signals might be transmitted from one domain to the other. D-loop nucleotides previously identified as essential for editing are marked with arrows in Fig. 1. These nucleotides are not among those needed for the universal connections between the two domains. At least half of the tRNA synthetases charge minihelices based on the acceptor-TΨC stem of their cognate tRNAs (30Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Söll D.

J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16527-16530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and seryl-tRNA synthetase (35Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar)), many others interact with both the acceptor stem and anticodon. In the latter cases, the enzymes can still aminoacylate their associated minihelices, although the efficiency is generally severely reduced relative to the full tRNA. (In the E. coliisoleucine system studied here, the minihelix is ∼106-fold less active than tRNAIle.) Nevertheless, aminoacylation of minihelices generally retains the same sequence specificity for acceptor stem nucleotides as seen in the charging of tRNAs. For this reason, minihelices are thought to interact with the active site in a way that closely parallels the full tRNA. MinihelixIle (Fig. 1, bottom) contains determinants for aminoacylation by IleRS (19Nureki O. Niimi T. Muto Y. Kanno H. Kohno T. Muramatsu T. Kawai G. Miyazawa T. Giegé R. Florentz C. Yokoyama S.

Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12214-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Previously, this domain of tRNAIle had not been investigated for its ability to stimulate editing of misactivated valine. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the addition of tRNAIle to a mixture of IleRS, ATP, and valine rapidly leads to the complete consumption of available ATP. In contrast, minihelixIle is unable to stimulate the hydrolytic editing of misactivated valine, even at the high concentration of 200 μm. Next we tested whether the addition of an isolated D-stem/loop domain of tRNAIle could induce editing. For this purpose, we constructed a 9-base pair RNA hairpin that extends the D-stem by pairing nucleotide G-26 and including 4 base pairs of the anticodon stem (D-loopIle, Fig. 1, top left). This D-stem/loop RNA hairpin did not induce editing (see Fig. 2). Finally, we obtained no evidence for an editing response when minihelixIle and D-loopIle were used in combination (data not shown for clarity). These results suggest that continuity of the tRNAIle structure is required for the editing response. Because minihelixIle is capable of being aminoacylated with isoleucine and yet is unable to induce editing, we tested its ability to be aminoacylated with valine. As shown in Fig. 3, minihelixIle is a relatively robust substrate for mischarging with valine. This level of mischarging was not observed with mature tRNAIle, as the editing reaction prevents the stable attachment of valine to tRNAIle. We tried to force misacylation of tRNAIle by using concentrations (40 μm) well above the K m (∼5 μm, Ref. 14Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C. Giegé R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 710-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Still, no misacylation of the full tRNA could be detected. Thus, although minihelixIle is significantly less active than tRNAIle for charging with isoleucine, it is far more active in mischarging with valine. Despite the reduced activity of minihelixIle for charging with isoleucine, this aminoacylation is specific. For example, substitution of the A-73 discriminator with G results in a minihelix that is 8.4-fold less active in charging with isoleucine. A qualitatively similar effect is seen when the same substitution is made in the full tRNA (14Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C. Giegé R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 710-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here we found that mischarging A73G minihelixIlewith valine showed the same rate reduction that was observed for charging with isoleucine (Fig. 4). In addition, we investigated a variant of minihelixIledesignated Δ1 minihelixIle, in which the 5′-terminal A-1 nucleotide has been deleted. Recently, we discovered that this deletion enhances charging with isoleucine (20Alexander R.W. Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12214-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Presumably, this disruption of the first base pair increases the flexibility of the single-stranded 3′ terminus. (The 3′-end of bound tRNAGln in the co-crystal with glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is folded back into the active site (36Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Söll D. Steitz T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Because glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and IleRS are structurally related, the enhanced flexibility of the Δ1 substrate is thought to ease passage of the minihelix acceptor terminus into the transition state for catalysis.) The enhancement observed in charging Δ1 minihelixIle with isoleucine was exactly paralleled in misacylation with valine (Fig. 4). Thus, the determinants for charging of minihelixIle are independent of which amino acid is used as the substrate. These results rule out the possibility that the acceptor stem plays a role in amino acid discrimination. A direct comparison of the initial rates of aminoacylation with both isoleucine and valine reveals that isoleucine is only a 3-fold better substrate under these conditions. This level of discrimination was observed over a large concentration range (50–500 μm) of minihelix substrate (data not shown), showing that the nature of the amino acid does not modulate minihelix binding. Because the rates of Ile-AMP and Val-AMP synthesis are greater than the rate of aminoacylation of minihelix substrates, it is likely that the aminoacyl adenylates (of both isoleucine and valine) accumulate in the active site to similar levels. Under these circumstances, the rate of aminoacyl-RNA formation should be most correlated to the transfer rate of the aminoacyl group from the adenylate to the minihelix. The small difference between the isoleucylation and valylation rate of minihelixIle may represent a lack of discrimination toward the amino acid side chain in the transfer step. The ability of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase to discriminate against valine is enhanced in the presence of tRNAIle. In charging of minihelix substrates, this discrimination is reduced to a mere 3-fold preference for isoleucine. This outcome is expected for substrates that have significantly reduced editing activity and yet have retained some charging activity. The mischarging of a minihelix reinforces the evidence that the D-loop of tRNAIle is indispensable for proper discrimination against valine (13Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To some extent this finding has been puzzling, as it is thought that IleRS makes little contact with the D-loop of tRNAIle; for example, none of the D-loop nucleotides critical for editing are protected by bound IleRS in phosphate ethylation experiments (14Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C. Giegé R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 710-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Considering the available evidence, we propose that the effect of the D-loop is derived from its presumed role in transducing conformational information between the two domains of tRNAIle. Long range information transfer through the tRNA structure is also suggested from studies of the aminoacylation of tRNAIle by IleRS. For example, mutations in the anticodon of tRNAIle (which interacts directly with IleRS) do not affect binding but rather diminish the kcat for charging. In a model for aminoacylation of wild-type tRNAIle, binding of the correct anticodon enables conformational changes that accurately orient the acceptor terminus in the distant active site (14Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C. Giegé R. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 710-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The charging of minihelices by IleRS provides a model aminoacylation system where one or more of the discriminatory “sieves” has been attenuated. It should be noted that the notion of doublesieve discrimination is actually semantic in that editing by IleRS is known to involve two editing reactions (i.e. pre- and post-transfer). Considering the initial activation sieve, there are at least three functional sieves. In theory, discrimination against valine could involve numerous other sieves, each acting at a unique kinetic step along the aminoacylation reaction coordinate. One such step that could enhance discrimination against valine is the transfer of the aminoacyl group from the activated adenylate to the accepting 2′-OH of the RNA. However, our results suggest that this is not the case. In the aminoacylation of minihelices (where the aminoacylation rate is likely to reflect the transfer rate) the preference for isoleucine is quite small. Mutations in minihelix substrates that affect the aminoacylation rate do so independently of the amino acid side chain. At least for the Δ1 minihelixIle mutation, we obtained evidence that the mutation directly affects the transfer rate with little or no effect on binding. Although the high K mvalues (>200 μm) for these substrates make this parameter difficult to measure precisely, approximateK m values for minihelixIle and Δ1 minihelixIle are within 20% of each other (data not shown). In contrast, the kcat value for Δ1 minihelixIle is more than 3-fold higher than that for minihelixIle in charging with both isoleucine and valine. These experiments offer further evidence that transfer of the aminoacyl group from the activated adenylate to the RNA does not provide significant discrimination against valine. Several considerations have led to the hypothesis that minihelices were evolutionary precursors to modern tRNAs (37Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7383-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 38Maizels N. Weiner A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 983-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and had an origin distinct from that of the anticodon-containing domain (41Noller H.F. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 137-156Google Scholar). The correlation of acceptor stem nucleotides in minihelices with the charging of specific amino acids constitutes an operational RNA code (that could have preceded the anticodon-dependent genetic code (42Rodin S. Rodin A. Ohno S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4537-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) for amino acids (39Schimmel P. Giegé R. Moras D. Yokoyama S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8763-8768Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is interesting to wonder whether the relaxed amino acid specificity in the aminoacylation of minihelixIle reported here is indicative of more primitive aminoacylation systems in general. Perhaps during the early development of an operational RNA code aminoacylation systems with greater net catalytic activity had a selective advantage over those with lower, yet more specific catalytic activity. Subsequently, as aminoacylation systems became more robust, specificity could have become a greater selective advantage. At this point, determinants for editing may have been appended to the tRNA structure."

These heterotropic functional effects have been previously investigated in thermodynamic (5Imai K. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2227-2231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Doyle M.L. Di Cera E. Robert C.H. Gill S.J. J. Mol.

Chem. 1971; 245: 2914-2921Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) terms, leading to the evidence of a network of interplays among different sites, such that linkage relationships can be put in evidence between different heterotropic ligands. However, a quantitative investigation of these effects has never been performed since the information is usually obtained through a differential influence of the non-heme binding properties for the deoxygenated and oxygenated derivatives of HbA0. We have recently reported on the IHP binding properties to some heme ligated forms of ferrous HbA0 in the presence of 0.1m chloride, showing the existence of two binding sites for IHP with a similar affinity independently of the heme ligand (8Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Santucci R. Amiconi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent thermodynamic study has been carried out on the interaction of IHP with oxygenated HbA0 (9Messana I. Angeletti M. Castagnola M. De Sanctis G. Di Stasio E. Giardina B. Pucciarelli S. Coletta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15329-15334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), leading to the evidence that the inter-relationship between protons and IHP is regulated by the pK a shift of three classes of residues in HbA0, and it is characterized by a proton-linked balancing between the enthalpic and entropic contribution. Furthermore, in the last few years particular interest has been addressed toward the effect of bezafibrate (BZF) (see Fig. 1) on the O2-binding properties of HbA0, and mostly on the original observation that its effect is potentiated by the presence of organic phosphates (10Perutz M.F. Poyart C. Lancet. 1983; : 881-882Abstract PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that the two heterotropic ligands bind to different sites (12Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This observation is interesting, since it underlies the existence of communication pathway(s) between different domains of HbA0, allowing the formulation of a series of linkage relationships among different heterotropic ligands and with respect to the ligand binding at the heme. Additional data have shown that the simultaneous presence of IHP and BZF brings about in human HbCO a dramatic shift of the allosteric equilibrium, such that even the fully liganded tetramer appears to be in a T-like conformation (13Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,14Gill S.J. Doyle M.L. Simmons J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); this phenomenon has also been observed on the carbonylated derivative of dromedary Hb (15Amiconi G. Santucci R. Coletta M.

Therefore, starting from the detailed information on the thermodynamics of IHP binding to HbA0 (9Messana I. Angeletti M. Castagnola M. De Sanctis G. Di Stasio E. Giardina B. Pucciarelli S. Coletta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15329-15334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we have undertaken a quantitative study on the linkage between O2, IHP, and BZF. The investigation should give fairly detailed thermodynamic information on these inter-relationships for the first and the fourth O2 binding step, envisaging a somewhat different interaction mode between the two heterotropic ligands along the binding pathway. This is only the first step toward a deeper comprehension of the complex inter-relationships between O2, protons, IHP, and BZF, aiming at a better understanding of the intramolecular pathway(s) responsible for the energy transmission between different functional domains of a protein. Human HbA0 has been prepared from freshly drawn blood according to the method reported by Williams and Tsay (16Williams R.C. Tsay K. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Organic polyphosphates and other low-molecular mass contaminants have been removed, as reported for “stripping” of hemoglobin (17Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Concentration of oxy-HbA0 solution was determined spectrophotometrically employing the extinction coefficient ε = 13.8 mm−1 cm−1 (per heme) at 541 nm, assuming that the absorption spectrum of fully oxygenated HbA0 was the same in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors. The heme's iron oxidation state has been qualitatively checked on the basis of the absorbance ratio at 576/541 nm, taking 1.14 as a normal ratio value. In all experiments, the concentration of the ferric form has been monitored, as previously reported (18Giardina B. Amiconi G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and data displaying a percentage exceeding 1% have been discarded. Spectral deconvolution of absorption spectra of HbO2 has been carried out with the software MATLAB (Mathworks, South Natick, MA) on a desktop computer. Spectral smoothing has been performed by using the singular value decomposition algorithm (19Henry E.R. Hofrichter J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and spectral deconvolution has been obtained starting from reference spectra (of oxy-, deoxy-, and ferric HbA0) by using the left division option, provided by MATLAB. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco-500A spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco DP-500 processor. The molar ellipticity θM is expressed as deg·cm2·dmol−1. Resonance Raman spectra have been obtained at room temperature with CW excitation from an Ar+ laser (Coherent, Innova 90/5). The back-scattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focussed into a computer-controlled double monochromator (Jobin-Yvon HG2S/2000) equipped with a cooled photomultiplier (RCA C31034A) and photon counting electronics. The spectra were calibrated in frequency with indene and CCl4 as standards to an accuracy of ±1 cm−1 for the intense, isolated bands. The iron K-edge x-ray spectra have been collected in the fluorescence mode at the LURE DCI synchrotron radiation facility (Orsay, France), operating at 1.8 GeV energy and a current of 270 mA. A Si(111) double crystal used as channel-cut single crystal was employed as a monochromator. The energy resolution at the iron K-edge is about 2 eV, and energy shifts of resolved absorption peaks of 0.5 eV can be detected. Harmonic contamination was rejected by using a total reflection mirror after the monochromator. Each spectrum represents a total signal averaging of 4 s/point, collected at room temperature by using a 7-element energy-resolving Ge detector from Canberra industries. The samples were mounted in a 1-mm thick Teflon cell with mylar windows, oriented with an angle of 45° with respect to the x-ray beam, with the detector positioned perpendicular to the beam direction. The specimen concentration was 8 mm heme, in the absence and presence of allosteric effectors, and no protein damage has been detected after x-ray exposure. Kinetic experiments have been carried out on a Gibson-Durrum rapid-mixing stopped-flow apparatus interfaced with a fast data collection system (On Line Instrument Service, Jefferson, GA). Typical experiments have been undertaken mixing oxy-HbA0 (0.1 mm heme after mixing), in the absence and presence of varying amounts of allosteric effectors, with a solution of CO-saturated or degassed buffer containing the same amount of allosteric effectors and 20 mg/ml sodium dithionite. Such experiments, followed at λ = 543 nm, allowed the determination of the rate of the irreversible (because of the sodium dithionite) O2replacement by CO. The observed rate did not depend either on the CO concentration (for [CO] = 50–500 μm) or on the sodium dithionite concentration (at least between 5 and 50 mg/ml), indicating that the observed process indeed refers to the O2dissociation from the fully oxygenated HbA0. O2 binding isotherms to HbA0, in the absence and presence of varying amounts of effectors, have been carried out employing a high-precision thin layer dilution technique (20Dolman D. Gill S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The experiments have been performed using [Hb] = 3 mm in heme at 293 K. Data have been analyzed according to the Adair formalism (21Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), employing the following equation, Y=(β1x+2β2x2+3β3x3+4β4x4)/4(1+β1x+β2x2+β3x3+β4x4)(Eq. 1) where βi (i = 1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponds to the equilibrium association constant for the binding ofi molecules of O2 to the HbA0molecule, i.e. the reaction, HbA0+iO2=HbA0(O2)i(Eq. 2) The relative percentage of five different populations have been calculated according to the following relationships, α0=1/P,α1=β1x/P;α2=β2x2/P,α3=β3x3/P,α4=β4x4/P(Eq. 3) where P = 1 + β1 x + β2 x2 + β3 x3 + β4 x4 is the O2 binding polynomial to HbA0 under different experimental conditions. The present investigation has been focussed on the inter-relationships between O2 association and IHP and BZF binding to HbA0, trying to characterize (i) the spectroscopic properties of HbA0 in the presence of IHP or of BZF alone and when they are added together; (ii) the kinetic effect on the gaseous ligand dissociation exerted by IHP and BZF alone and when they are added together; and (iii) the individual and coupled effect of IHP and BZF on the thermodynamics of O2binding. In order to give a quantitative estimate of the various aspects of the energetic inter-relationships, high-precision O2 binding isotherms have been carried out on human HbA0 in the absence of allosteric effectors, as well as in the presence of IHP, BZF alone, and of both IHP and BZF (see Fig. 2). The analysis of these data has been carried out employing the phenomenological Adair equation (see Equation 1) (21Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). From the equilibrium parameters, reported in TableI, it comes out that IHP and BZF indeed seem to always alter the apparent association equilibrium constants for different O2 binding steps (see βi in TableI).Table IThermodynamic parameters for O2 binding to human HbA0(3 mm heme concentration) under different experimental conditions at pH 7.0 and 20 °Cβ1β2β3β4m−1m−2m−3m−4HbA05.2 (±2.0)E69.2 (±2.7)E124.6 (±2.2)E183.7 (±1.4)E24(K1 = 1.3E6)(K2 = 1.2E6)(K3 = 7.5E5)(K4 = 3.2E6)HbA0 + 10 mm IHP1.0 (±0.4)E51.1 (±0.2)E105.3 (±10.0)E131.6 (±0.4)E19(K1 = 2.5E4)(K2 = 7.3E4)(K3 = 7.2E3)(K4 = 1.2E6)HbA0 + 35 mm BZF7.1 (±2.2)E44.9 (±1.3)E81.0 (±0.2)E138.0 (±2.1)E17(K1 = 1.8E4)(K2 = 4.6E3)(K3 = 3.1E4)(K4 = 3.2E5)HbA0 + 1.0 mm IHP6.3 (±2.1)E47.4 (±1.7)E85.4 (±1.8)E123.9 (±0.5)E16+10 mmBZF(K1 = 1.6E4)(K2 = 7.9E3)(K3 = 1.1E4)(K4 = 2.9E4)We report the experimental binding constants obtained by data fitting according to Equation 1, and by parentheses the stepwise binding constants (expressed as m−1), as from the following relationship (βi = f=iπf=1 Kf where i (= 1, 2, 3, 4) is the number of liganded hemes, n = 4 is the total number of binding sites of the macromolecule.

A. 1983; 80: 6202-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this is possible for oxy-HbA0 by a kinetic approach, since the dependence of O2 dissociation rate constant from fully ligated HbA0 as a function of non-heme ligand concentration reflects the interaction of heterotropic ligand(s) with oxy-HbA0 (9Messana I. Angeletti M. Castagnola M. De Sanctis G. Di Stasio E. Giardina B. Pucciarelli S. Coletta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15329-15334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fig. 3displays the effect of IHP, BZF, and BZF added in the presence of saturating amounts of IHP (i.e. 1 mm IHP) on the O2 dissociation rate constant of fully oxygenated HbA0. It is worth outlining that under these conditions (i.e. no NaCl) no evidence of a second binding site for IHP is reported also in view of the much higher affinity for IHP in the absence of salt (8Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Santucci R. Amiconi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the presence of IHP the kinetic effect induced by BZF is exerted only on the slow phase (which amounts to ≈50% of the total ligand dissociation curve, see also Ref. 8Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Santucci R. Amiconi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that under these conditions the interaction energy induces a structural transition that is transmitted from the binding pocket to only one type of subunit in the tetramer. Therefore, for the sake of clarity only the rate constant calculated from the slow phase is reported in Fig. 3 also for the interaction of BZF and IHP alone. Unfortunately, BZF cannot be used at concentrations exceeding 50 mm, since, aside from its relatively low solubility, beyond this value it begins to induce a very slow but detectable irreversible denaturation of HbA0. Therefore, even though we are aware that under these conditions HbO2 is not fully saturated with BZF alone, we never used concentrations above 40 mm, a value at which the functional behavior of HbA0 is stable for at least 1 day. From the experiments reported in Fig. 3 we can derive the binding constants to oxy-HbA0 of BZF, IHP, and BZF in the presence of saturating amounts of IHP (see Table III). The enhancement of the BZF binding constant when IHP is already present appears evident (see Fig. 3 and Table III), envisaging a relevant free energy increase of ≈16 kJ/mol (1 joule = 4.184 cal).Table IIIEffector binding parameters in 0.1 m HEPES pH 7.0 and 20 °C for the three- and four-ligated HbA0 (see Scheme 1 and Table I)HbA00K4IHP(m−1)5.9 (±1.2)E4aExperimentally measured.0K4BZF (m−1)2.5 (±1.0)E1aExperimentally measured.IHPK4BZF(m−1)1.8 (±0.6)E4aExperimentally measured.BZFK4IHP (m−1)4.2 (±2.4)E7bCalculated on the basis of energetic relationships sketched in Scheme I.0K3IHP(m−1)1.6 (±1.1)E5bCalculated on the basis of energetic relationships sketched in Scheme I.0K3BZF (m−1)2.6 (±2.0)E2bCalculated on the basis of energetic relationships sketched in Scheme I.IHPK3BZF(m−1)7.4 (±4.3)E5bCalculated on the basis of energetic relationships sketched in Scheme I.BZFK3IHP (m−1)4.5 (±3.4)E8bCalculated on the basis of energetic relationships sketched in Scheme I.a Experimentally measured.b Calculated on the basis of energetic relationships sketched in Scheme I.

Open table in a new tab The fraction of oxidized HbA0 was always ≪0.01. In the case of the ferrous nitrosylated form of HbA0 (24Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Coletta M. Desideri A. Giardina B. Polizio F. Santucci R. Scatena R. Amiconi G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1993; 50: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we detected a ≈15-fold increase of BZF affinity constant when IHP is already bound to its cleft in the β-dyad axis (thus resulting an interaction energy ΔG ≅ 7.5 kJ/mol). It definitely indicates that, unlike IHP binding to ligated HbA0 (which is scarcely affected by the type of heme's ligand, see Ref. 8Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Santucci R. Amiconi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the intramolecular interaction energy between the two heterotropic binding sites is markedly dependent on the heme's ligand (i.e.O2 versus NO), underlying a preferential ligand-linked communication pathway between the different portions of the macromolecule. This occurrence has been observed also in the case of IHP and BZF on ferrous nitrosylated iron-cobalt hybrids of HbA0. Thus, in this case the two allosteric effectors have been shown to affect in a drastically different fashion the intersubunit communication pathway, envisaging a different mode for the synergistic effect in the NO-bound Fe-Co hybrids (25De Sanctis G. Priori A.M. Polizio F. Ascenzi P. Coletta M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 135-139Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). An additional effect concerns the absorption spectroscopic behavior of oxy-HbA0 upon addition of IHP and/or BZF. Thus, while the individual addition of one of the two effectors either does not bring about any meaningful change in the absorption spectra of oxy-HbA0 (e.g. for IHP) or it shows a very limited influence (e.g. for BZF), the simultaneous presence of IHP and BZF leads to a variation of the absorption spectra (Fig. 4), which can be accounted for by a progressive partial deoxygenation of HbA0 molecule even at atmospheric oxygen pressure (11Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Table II reports the calculated O2 saturation degrees at several concentrations of IHP and BZF, showing that at 20 °C and pO2 ≅ 150 torr a progressive deoxygenation of oxy-HbA0 takes place when BZF is added in the presence of IHP (e.g. 0.5 mm), tending to level off at about 40% of deoxygenation (see Table II). Such behavior is in keeping with the previous observation that IHP and BZF together act synergistically, bringing about a tertiary and/or a quaternary shift toward a low-affinity conformation (13Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Gill S.J. Doyle M.L. Simmons J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1993; 50: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), provided that the pH is held constant. This behavior is shared by all vertebrate hemoglobins in the heme-ligated state (e.g. dromedary Hb, see Ref. 15Amiconi G. Santucci R. Coletta M. Congiu Castellano A. Giovannelli A. Dell'Ariccia M. Della Longa S. Barteri M. Burattini E. Bianconi A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8547-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) The electronic absorption spectroscopic feature is mirrored by circular dichroism spectroscopic changes both in the near ultraviolet range and in the Soret region. The very small spectral variations observed in the 280–300-nm region (Fig. 5A) indicate that at atmospheric pressure the environment of Trpβ37(C3), located at the α1β2 contact surface and considered a spectroscopic marker for the R ⇔ T quaternary transition (26Perutz M.F. Fersht M.R. Simon F.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2174-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), is very slightly affected (if any) by the simultaneous addition of IHP and BZF, despite the presumed interaction of this residue with BZF in the deoxygenated form (12Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (but not necessarily in the oxygenated species), suggesting therefore that the quaternaryR structure of the tetramer is mostly maintained. On the other hand, the ellipticity measured in the Soret region (Fig. 5B) in the presence of both heterotropic ligands corresponds mainly to that of the deoxygenated form of HbA0, and, accordingly, the heme conformation should conform to that typical of a low-affinity structure. As a whole, these results indicate that IHP and BZF induce only a tertiary conformational change, suggesting the (at least partial) stabilization of a tertiary T-like conformation within a quaternary R-like intermediate structure (hereafter referred as rRt state, according to the standard terminology (27Ackers G.K. Doyle M.L. Myers D. Daugherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)). Therefore, these data seem to support the idea that, in the presence of IHP and BZF, oxy-HbA0 is shifted toward a structure different from that observed for the carbonylated HbA0 and dromedary Hb (13Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Gill S.J. Doyle M.L. Simmons J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bianconi A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8547-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Such behavior is well in keeping with the concept of allosteric core (28Gelin R.G. Lee A.W.-M. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 489-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), as well as allosteric nesting (29Wyman J. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1984; 17: 453-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that IHP and BZF do not alter to a significant extent the intersubunit contacts, at least in the oxygenated form, but they only exert their effect on the tertiary conformations of subunits, inducing a shift toward a low-affinity form of the R quaternary state. This effect is also documented by XANES spectroscopy observations, a technique uniquely suited (30Pin S. Alpert B. Congiu Castellano A. Della Longa S. Bianconi A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 266-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) for probing structural modifications around the iron atom (Fig. 5C). In the presence of 1 mm IHP and 10 mm BZF XANES spectra of oxy-HbA0 under atmospheric air pressure (i.e. pO2 = 150 torr) display a fraction of unliganded hemes, which is fully consistent with observations by electronic absorption spectroscopy (see Fig. 4), and they can be accounted for simply by a linear combination of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemes, without implying any distortion of the local geometry. Likewise, resonance Raman spectra in the high frequency region of oxy-HbA0 in the presence of 1 mm IHP and 10 mm BZF display a combination of frequencies belonging to either oxy- or deoxy-HbA0 without any variation for the respective frequencies (data not shown), clearly indicating that no relevant changes are involving the stereochemistry of the porphyrin core. As a whole, reported data allow two main considerations to be drawn on the aggregation state of human HbO2 when IHP and BZF are present together, namely (i) the dichroic features at 287 nm strongly indicate that only O2-bound R-like tetramers (or dimers) are present, and this despite previous observations that allosteric effectors with molecular structure reminiscent of that of BZF stabilize a tetraoxygenated T-state in crystals (31Abraham D.J. Peascoe R.A. Randad R.S. Panikker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and (ii) deoxy-type stereochemical changes of the heme (as from XANES and resonance Raman observations) allow to rule out a significant contribution from dimers under our experimental conditions, even though it is known that polyanions may stabilize oxygenated dimers (32Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Kwong S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,33Schõnert H. Stoll B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The general outcome of this spectroscopic investigation may be summarized by stating that (i) the quaternary structure is not the unique dominant factor determining the tertiary environment around the heme, and (ii) the transition from a tense to a relaxed conformation (34Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6057) Google Scholar) is in line with a multistep model in which a quaternary transition may be associated to several tertiary relaxations (35Borgstahl G.F.O. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The kinetic behavior of the stabilized intermediate species (i.e. HbA0 in the presence of both IHP and BZF) has been investigated, and Fig. 6 reports the O2 dissociation kinetics by sodium dithionite, in the absence and presence of 1 mm IHP and 10 mm BZF.

The three 40-base pair sequences consisted of a consensus DNA (conDNA) duplex derived from the CRP-binding site sequences of the operons activated by CRP and two DNA sequences based on the CRP-binding site sequences of the lac operon (lacDNA) and of the gal operon (galDNA). The mutants of CRP consisted of a T127L mutant, a S128A mutant, and a mutant containing both mutations (CRP*) which not only alter the transcriptional activity of the CRP complexes but also are involved in the monomer-monomer interfacial interactions of the CRP dimer. The binding reactions of the DNA duplexes to the fully cNMP-ligated CRP-mutant complexes were endothermic with binding constants as high as 6.6 ± 1.1 × 106m−1 (conDNA·CRP(cAMP)2). ConDNA binding to the unligated T127L and CRP* mutants was observed as well as conDNA and lacDNA binding to CRP with cAMP bound to only one monomer.

Reduction of the DNA binding constants upon substitution of D2O for H2O in the buffer, the large heat capacity changes, and the enthalpy-entropy compensation exhibited by the binding reactions indicate the importance of dehydration in the binding reaction.

The transcription of over 20 different operons encoded for enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism in Esherichia coli is activated by the binding of 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; cIMP, 3′,5′-cyclic inosine monophosphate; CRP*, T127L and S128A mutant of CRP; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SANS, small angle neutron scattering; MOPS, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid to the operon. CRP is a 45,000 g mol−1 dimer, consisting of a 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-binding site in the amino-terminal domain and an α-helical DNA-binding region in the carboxyl-terminal domain of each monomer. Upon binding of cAMP to CRP, CRP undergoes a change to a conformation which binds specifically to the operon and results in bending of the operon around the RNA polymerase. The nature of this conformational change is not clear but may be induced by a stronger monomer-monomer interaction in CRP since this interaction is enhanced in the presence of cAMP (1Brown A.M. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7387-7391Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies of the CRP(cAMP)2 complex show that the sequence at the monomer-monomer interface is similar to that of the leucine zipper motif and that a serine (Ser128) from the other monomer crosses over the interface and forms a hydrogen bond with the cAMP (2). More recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the CRP(cAMP)2 complexed with DNA (3Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 4Parkinson G. Wilson C. Gunasekera A. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.E. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 280: 395-408Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) show that the DNA is symmetrically bound across the α-helices of the two monomers of CRP. Mutations at the monomer-monomer interface of CRP alter the activity of CRP in the cell as is evident by a doubly mutated (T127L/S128A) CRP mutant (CRP*) which activates transcription in the absence of cAMP, a CRP (T127L) mutant which also activates transcription in the presence of an analog of cAMP, 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and a CRP (S128A) mutant which does not activate transcription in vivo (5.Moore, J. L., The Mechanism of Activation of the Escheichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMPPh.D. thesis, 1993, The George Washington University, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar). Since it has been shown from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements that changes in the in vivo transcriptional activity arising from these interfacial mutations are not dependent on the binding affinity of the cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP) to the CRP-mutant (6Moore J.L. Gorshkova I. Brown J.W. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21273-21278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the transcriptional activity of cNMP-ligated CRP-mutants may depend on the influence of these interfacial mutations on the binding of the operon to CRP. It is, thus, important to determine the thermodynamics of DNA binding to CRP and its T127L, S128A, and CRP* mutants. Heretofore, indirect measurement techniques based on filter binding assays and shifts in gel electrophoresis bands have been employed to determine the operon binding affinities for CRP with often contradictory results. Equilibrium constants for binding of lac operon fragments to cAMP-ligated CRP range from 2.3 ± 0.1 × 10 9m−1 for a 216-base pair fragment (7) to 8.4 × 1010m–1 for a 203-base pair fragment (8Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) at ambient temperatures. Since it has been shown that the CRP-binding site on the lac operon requires a minimum of 28 base pairs for full binding affinity (9Lui-Johnson H.N. Gartenburg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), the binding of shorter lac operon fragments consisting of 40–41 base pairs was determined and, again, the binding constants ranged from 6 × 10 6m−1 in gel electrophoresis measurements at 310 K (9Lui-Johnson H.N. Gartenburg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) to 3.2 ± 0.1 × 10 8m−1 from filter binding assays (10Ebright R.H. Ebright Y.W. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA binding constants determined from these indirect techniques exhibit a large decrease with increase in salt concentration (11Gunasekera A. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in contrary to in vivotranscriptional assays which show high yields even at high salt concentrations (12Richey B. Cayley D.S.

To investigate the effect of monomeric interfacial mutations on specific DNA binding, ITC was employed to determine the binding constant (K b) and the changes in enthalpy (ΔH b0) and entropy (ΔS b0) for the binding of DNA to cAMP, cGMP, and 3′,5′-cyclic inosine monophosphate (cIMP)-ligated CRP, T127L, S128A, and CRP*, DNA+CRP(cNMP)2↔DNA·CRP(cNMP)2(Eq. 1) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.15m KCl (KPB buffer).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and are identical from the 1 to 5′ terminus and from 23 to the 3′ terminus, using the numbering system from Ebright et al.(10Ebright R.H. Ebright Y.W. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For comparison, galDNA was constructed so that bases from 1 to 21 are the same as the CRP-binding site of the gal operon (29Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although the DNA binding was determined at cyclic nucleoside concentrations where both sites of the CRP-mutants were occupied, the binding of conDNA and lacDNA to CRP was also investigated at subsaturate concentrations of cAMP where significant concentrations of singly occupied CRP, CRP(cAMP), as calculated from previous measurements (13Gorshkova I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were present to determine if the DNA binds to CRP(cAMP). In addition, the binding reactions of lacDNA and conDNA with CRP(cAMP)2 were investigated as a function of salt concentration and with D2O substituted for water in the KPB buffer since dehydration has been shown to be involved in the binding reaction (7). A preliminary analysis of the bending of the lacDNA bound to the CRP(cAMP)2 complex in water and D2O was performed by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) since the neutron scattering from the DNA can be characterized separately from the protein in H2O/D2O mixtures of the buffer. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the thermodynamics of DNA binding to proteins since bending of the DNA, the α helical structure of the DNA-binding site, and the presence of a leucine zipper between the protein subunits are characteristic properties of other DNA-protein complexes. The DNA sequences were synthesized by Oligos, Inc. and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The DNA was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and an analytical ion exchange column and found to be at a purity level >90%. Gel electrophoresis of the single strands revealed essentially one intense band at 12,000 g mol−1, the molecular mass of the strand. A procedure similar to that described by Ebright et al. (10Ebright R.H. Ebright Y.W. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was followed to prepare the duplexes from the single strand DNA sequences. Briefly, milligram quantities of the lyophilized powdered DNA strands were dissolved in 4 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mNaCl at pH 7.5. Equal amounts of the DNA strand and its complementary strand were mixed together, heated up slowly to 368 K, held at 368 K for about 10 min, and then cooled very slowly at a rate of 10 K h−1 to ambient temperature. Gel electrophoresis measurements on aliquots of the DNA solution showed the presence of only one band at the molecular mass of the duplex. The DNA duplex solutions were then concentrated up to 0.3–0.6 mm by centrifugation, dialyzed in the KPB buffer used for dialysis of the protein, and stored in a freezer at 253 K. Prior to the ITC measurements, the DNA duplex concentrations were determined from optical density measurements at 260 nm using the extinction coefficient of 1.32 × 104m−1 cm–1 per base pair (8Fried M.G.

The production from E. coli of CRP and mutants and their purification have been described previously (5.Moore, J. L., The Mechanism of Activation of the Escheichia coli Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein by Cyclic AMPPh.D. thesis, 1993, The George Washington University, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar) and their activities were checked by an in vitro transcription assay as described by Zhang et al.(14Zhang X. Zhou Y. Ebright Y. Ebright R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8136-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the CRP-mutants was determined from UV measurements at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 3.5 × 104m−1 cm –1 (15Anderson W. Schneider A.B. Emmer M. Perlman R. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5929-5937Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The potassium phosphate salts, KCl, Tris, MgCl2, and sodium salts of cAMP, cGMP, and cIMP were reagent grade from Sigma. The dithiothreitol was Ultra-pure brand from Life Technologies, Inc. and the NaEDTA was from Serva Co. The D2O was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All calorimetric titrations were preformed according to the methods of Wiseman et al. (16Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar) and Schwarzet al. (17Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Bhat R.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. The Omega titration calorimeter consists of a matched pair of sample and reference vessels (1.374 ml) containing the protein solution in the phosphate buffer and the buffer solution, respectively. Four to 10-μl aliquots of the DNA solution at concentrations × 10–20 the protein concentration of 0.01–0.05 mm in the sample vessel were added 3–4 min apart. A separate titration of the DNA solution into the buffer was performed to determine any DNA heat of dilution which was then subtracted from the heats obtained during the titration of the DNA solution into the protein solution. A nonlinear, least squares minimization performed by Microcal Origin scientific plotting software was used to fit the incremental heat of the ith titration (ΔQ(i)) of the total heat,Q t, to the total DNA titrant concentration,X t, according to the following equations (16Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar,18Yang C.P. Omega Data in Origin.

Binding entropies, ΔSb0, were calculated using the following equation of thermodynamics, ΔSb0=(ΔHb0−ΔGb0)/T(Eq. 4) where ΔGb0=−RTln(Kb)(Eq. 5) and r = 8.31451 J mol−1K−1. Two methods were employed to determine the dependence of DNA binding on the subsaturate concentration of cAMP in the solution. In one method, aliquots of cAMP in KPB buffer were titrated into CRP solutions containing the DNA duplex and the amount of heat exchanged was monitored as a function of the relative CRP(cAMP) and CRP(cAMP)2 concentrations. Separate ITC runs with just CRP in the protein solution showed very little contribution of the heat of binding of cAMP to CRP under these titration conditions and any observed heat exchange would be from the binding of DNA to CRP(cAMP)2 and perhaps to CRP(cAMP). In the second method, the amount of cAMP added to the CRP solution prior to the DNA titration was well below saturation so that the CRP contained about equal concentrations of CRP(cAMP) and CRP(cAMP)2. In both methods, the concentrations of CRP(cAMP) and CRP(cAMP)2were determined by solving the following equations, whereK1 and K2 are the macroscopic cAMP to CRP binding constants from Gorshkova et al. (13Gorshkova I. Moore J.L. McKenney K.H. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21679-21683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), K1=[CRP(cAMP)]/[CRP][cAMP](Eq. 6) K2=[CRP(cAMP)2]/[CRP(cAMP)][cAMP](Eq. 7) So that [CRP(cAMP)]=K1[Ct][cAMP]/P(Eq. 8) and [CRP(cAMP)2]=K1K2[cAMP]2[Ct]/P(Eq. 9) where P=1+K1[cAMP]+K1K2[cAMP]2(Eq. 10) [cAMP]t=[cAMP]+CtK1[cAMP]/P+2CtK1K2[cAMP]2/P(Eq. 11) [cAMP]t is the total cAMP concentration in the sample. The concentration of CRP(cAMP)2 thus determined was then employed with the total DNA concentration in the sample to determine if the total observed amount of heat exchanged could be attributed solely to the CRP(cAMP)2 complex. In this latter calculation, the binding constant and binding enthalpy for DNA binding to CRP(cAMP)2 obtained at saturating concentrations of cAMP were employed. In the alternative procedure where DNA is titrated into solutions of CRP at subsaturate cAMP concentrations, the DNA binding constant and binding enthalpy were determined employing Equations 2 and 3 and compared with the DNA binding quantities determined at fully saturated CRP(cAMP)2 concentrations. The standard uncertainties in the values of K b and ΔH b0 were determined by combining in a quadrature the standard deviations of several determinations of each value with estimates of their systematic standard uncertainties. The systematic standard uncertainties are 0.03 K b and 0.03 ΔH b0 resulting from uncertainty in the solution concentrations, 0.01 K b and 0.01ΔH b0 resulting from uncertainty in the ITC calibration, and 0.005 K b and 0.005 ΔH b0 resulting from uncertainty in the titrant and cell volumes. The lacDNA·CRP(cAMP)2product from an ITC measurement was concentrated up to a concentration of 0.085 mm and 0.5-ml aliquots of the solution were dialyzed in 100, 70, 30, and 0% (v/v) D2O KBS buffer. The neutron scattering intensity from each of the four solutions was measured as a function of the scattering angle on the NG3 30-m SANS instrument at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. At high water concentrations the major component of the scattering intensity is from the nucleic bases of the DNA and at high D2O concentrations the major component is from the cAMP-ligated CRP complex. Thus, by solving a set of simultaneous equations defined by the measured neutron intensities as a function of water concentration, the neutron intensities of the CRP and DNA can be separately identified (19Krueger S. Physica B. 1998; 243: 1131Google Scholar). Details of the subsequent analysis of the data have been described previously by Krueger et al. (20Krueger S. Gorshkova I. Brown J. Hoskins J. McKenney K.H.

The x-ray crystallographic structure of the DNA complexed to the cAMP-ligated CRP determined by Schultz et al. (3Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar) was used as the scattering model for the lacDNA·CRP(cAMP)2. The change in the solvent-accessible surface on formation of the DNA·CRP(cAMP)2 complex (ΔAs) was calculated with “NACCESS,” a computer program from Hubbard (21Hubbard S.J. Thorteon J.M. NACCESS, Computer Program, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. University College, London1993Google Scholar), which conveniently divides the change into polar (ΔAsp) and non-polar area changes(ΔAsn). The ΔAs was calculated as, ΔAs=ΔAsp(CRP in complex­CRP(cAMP)2)(Eq. 12) +ΔAsn(CRP in complex­CRP(cAMP)2)=Asp(CRP in complex) −Asp(CRP(cAMP)2)+Asn(CRP in complex)−Asn(CRP(cAMP)2Here As(CRP in complex) refers to the solvent-accessible surface area of the CRP in the DNA·CRP(cAMP)2 complex and As(CRP(cAMP)2) refers to the solvent-accessible area of the unligated CRP. Asp(CRP) and Asn(CRP) were calculated from the atomic coordinates from the Protein Data Bank file 3GAP; while Asp(complex) and Asn(complex) were calculated by using both PDB file 1CGP and 1RUN. Average solvent-accessible surface area changes were determined to be −626 (angstrom)2 = ΔAsn(complex-CRP) and −2008 (angstrom)2 = ΔAsp(complex-CRP) yielding a total solvent accessible surface area change of −2633(angstrom)2. Results of a typical ITC measurement consisting of titrating 5.0-μl aliquots of 0.250 mm conDNA into a solution of 0.020 mmCRP(cAMP)2 complex at 295.6 K along with the binding isotherm are presented in Fig. 1. Prior to this titration, a 10 mm cAMP solution was first titrated into the 0.020 mm CRP solution to completely (99%) ligate the CRP with cAMP. The stoichiometry of the binding reaction as determined by the binding results was always close to one (0.90 ± 0.05). Similar results were obtained with the other cNMP-ligated CRP-mutant complexes and are summarized in TableI for all 12 complexes including binding of conDNA to unligated L127 and unligated CRP*. Binding of the conDNA duplex with unligated CRP and S128A was not observed. The thermodynamic quantities in Table I are average values of at least two ITC scans with different concentrations of ligand and protein and the average stoichiometry was again close to one. As shown in Table I, all the conDNA binding reactions are endothermic with binding enthalpies ranging from 84.1 ± 0.3 kJ mol−1 for binding to CRP(cAMP)2 to 166 ± 12 kJ mol−1 for binding to L127(cGMP)2 and binding constants ranging from 8.1 ± 0.9 × 104m−1for binding to S128A(cGMP)2 to 6.6 ± 1.1 × 106m−1 for binding to CRP(cAMP)2 at room temperature. The enthalpy change for binding of conDNA to CRP(cAMP)2 is close to the literature value of 80 ± 17 kJ mol−1 obtained from a van't Hoff analysis of the binding constants determined from filter binding assays in a 10 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.3 containing 0.2 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg ml–1 serum albumin, and 0.2 mm cAMP, while the corresponding binding constant is much higher, 3.9 ± 0.3 × 1010m−1 (10Ebright R.H. Ebright Y.W. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The reason for this large discrepancy is unknown except to emphasize that ITC is a direct measurement of the binding event. The heat capacity change accompanying the conDNA to cAMP-CRP binding reaction, determined from the dependence of the binding enthalpy on the temperature (Fig. 2), is −4.0 ± 0.4 kJ mol−1 K−1, close to an estimate of −2.85 kJ mol−1 K−1 (22) from filter binding assays by Ebright et al.

For comparison, the thermodynamics of binding of the lacDNA and galDNA duplexes to the fully cAMP-ligated CRP, T127L, S128A, and CRP* complexes and to T127L(cGMP)2 and CRP*(cIMP)2were determined from ITC measurements and are presented in TableII. Typical ITC titrations at 296 K of 10-μl aliquots of 0.250 mm lacDNA into 0.024 mm CRP(cAMP)2 and 10-μl aliquots of 0.90 mm galDNA into 0.052 mm L127(cGMP)2are shown, respectively, in Figs. 3 and 4. The binding constants of lacDNA and galDNA are at least an order of magnitude lower than their corresponding conDNA binding constant, the stoichiometries are again close to one, and the binding reactions are all endothermic. For lacDNA, the binding constants range from 3.3 ± 1.5 × 104m−1 for binding to CRP*(cIMP)2 to 4.0 ± 0.6 × 105m−1 for binding to CRP(cAMP)2, while the binding enthalpies range from 98 ± 4 kJ mol−1 for binding to CRP(cAMP)2 to 163 ± 8 kJ mol−1 for binding to CRP*(cAMP)2. The binding constant for lacDNA binding to CRP(cAMP)2 as reported by Ebright et al. (10Ebright R.H. Ebright Y.W. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) is 7.6 ± 0.6 × 107m−1, about 160 times greater than the binding constant in Table II. However, the binding constant of a 41-base pair lacDNA fragment of 6 × 106m−1 determined at 310 K from gel electrophoresis measurements (9Lui-Johnson H.N. Gartenburg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) is also less by a factor of 50 than the value of 3.2 ± 0.1 × 108m−1 determined by Ebright et al.(10Ebright R.H. Ebright Y.W. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For galDNA, the binding constants range from 1.7 ± 0.4 × 104m−1 for binding to CRP*(cIMP)2 to 1.11 ± 0.21 × 106m−1 for binding to CRP(cAMP)2, while the binding enthalpies ranged from 85 ± 3 kJ mol−1 for binding to CRP(cAMP)2 to 174 ± 4 kJ mol−1 for binding to T127L(cAMP)2. For lacDNA binding to CRP(cAMP)2, the heat capacity change of −5.7 ± 1.6 kJ mol−1 K−1 is the same as the heat capacity change observed for binding of conDNA to CRP(cAMP)2 (−4.0 ± 0.4 kJ mol−1K−1). All the DNA binding reactions exhibited enthalpy-entropy compensation as shown in Fig. 5 where the slopes of the TΔS b0 versusΔH b0 plots are 0.95 ± 0.5 for conDNA, 0.95 ± 0.06 for lacDNA, and 0.98 ± 0.06 for galDNA binding to CRP-mutant(cNMP)2. A comparison of all the DNA binding constants is shown in Fig. 6 where it is observed that the naturally occurring sequences exhibit a greater range of values, i.e.specificity than the synthetic conDNA.Table IIThermodynamic quantities of lacDNA and galDNA binding to cNMP-ligated CRP complexesCRP mutantcNMPTK b × 10−4−ΔG b0ΔH b0TΔS b0Km−1kJ mol−1lacDNACRPcAMP295.5 ± 0.140 ± 631.7 ± 0.498 ± 4130 ± 4T127LcAMP295.8 ± 0.110 ± 228.3 ± 0.4122 ± 7150 ± 7cGMP295.5 ± 0.85.6 ± 1.126.9 ± 0.5118 ± 21145 ± 21S128AcAMP296.0 ± 0.123 ± 530.4 ± 0.5103 ± 5133 ± 5CRP*cAMP295.2 ± 0.112 ± 228.7 ± 0.3163 ± 8192 ± 8cIMP295.6 ± 0.13.3 ± 1.525.6 ± 1.1127 ± 32153 ± 32galDNACRPcAMP295.9 ± 0.1111 ± 2134.2 ± 0.585 ± 3119 ± 3T127LcAMP296.2 ± 0.67.9 ± 0.627.8 ± 0.2174 ± 4202 ± 4cGMP295.7 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.225.7 ± 0.3130 ± 11156 ± 11S128AcAMP295.9 ± 0.69.6 ± 0.328.2 ± 0.1114 ± 4142 ± 4CRP*cAMP296.5 ± 0.110.2 ± 0.628.4 ± 0.1113 ± 7141 ± 7cIMP296.0 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.424.0 ± 0.674 ± 2298 ± 22 Open table in a new tab Figure 4a, an ITC scan consisting of the addition of 10-μl aliquots of 0.90 mm galDNA into 0.052 mm T127L(cGMP)2 in KPB buffer at 295.6 K.b, the binding isotherm for this titration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Enthalpy-entropy compensation plots for the DNA-CRP/mutant (cNMP)2 binding reactions at 296 K where the solid points and solid line are conDNA, triangles are lacDNA, and circles are galDNA binding.

https://openalex.org/W1979636421,"The activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) depends on the binding of its neuronal specific activator Nck5a. The minimal activation domain of Nck5a is located in the region of amino acid residues 150 to 291 (Tang, D., Chun, A. C. S., Zhang, M., and Wang, J. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 12318–12327). In this work we show that a 29-residue peptide, denoted as the αN peptide, encompassing amino acid residues Gln145 to Asp173 of Nck5a is capable of binding Cdk5 to result in kinase inhibition. This peptide also inhibits an active phospho-Cdk2-cyclin A complex, with a similar potency. Direct competition experiments have shown that this inhibitory peptide does not compete with Nck5a or cyclin A for Cdk5 or Cdk2, respectively. Steady state kinetic analysis has indicated that the αN peptide acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of Cdk5·Nck5a complex with respect to the peptide substrate. To understand the molecular basis of kinase inhibition by the peptide, we determined the structure of the peptide in solution by circular dichroism and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. The peptide adopts an amphipathic α-helical structure from residues Ser149 to Arg162 which can be further stabilized by the helix-stabilizing solvent trifluoroethanol.

The activation of a Cdk depends on its association with its specific cyclin partners. The activity of these enzymes is further regulated by an intricate system of protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Members of the Cdk family are closely related by sharing a high level of amino acid sequence identity (40–70%). In contrast, cyclins are a family of molecules of diverse molecular mass and low sequence identity. Sequence alignments have shown that cyclins share a somewhat conserved region of approximately 100 amino acids in the center of the molecule, and this region is called the cyclin box (2Nugent J.A. Alfa C.E. Young T. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 674-699Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of cyclin A and cyclin H have shown that the cyclin box sequence forms a compact 5-helix domain called the cyclin fold (3Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F.

However, there is virtually no sequence similarity between the two cyclin fold domains. Theoretical predictions have suggested that other members of the cyclin family also contain two cyclin folds (3Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B.

Loss of regulation of Cdk5 has been suggested to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (16Lew J. Wang J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Active Cdk5 was first purified from brain extracts as a heterodimer with subunit molecular masses of 33- and 25-kDa, respectively (8Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M.

The 33-kDa subunit was later identified as Cdk5, and the 25-kDa activator (neuronal Cdk5 activator, Nck5a) was a novel protein with no sequence similarity to any other known proteins. The 25-kDa subunit was later found to be a proteolytic product of a larger 35-kDa protein (17Lew J. Huang Q.-Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Despite their functional similarity in terms of binding and activation of a Cdk, the Cdk5 activators share little sequence similarity to cyclins. Moreover, while the activation of the well characterized Cdks such as Cdk1 and Cdk2 by cyclins depends on the phosphorylation of the Cdk at a specific threonine residue, Cdk5 activation by its activator is phosphorylation-independent (20Qi Z.

Recently, the activation domain of Nck5a was precisely mapped to amino acid residues from Glu150 to Asn291 (21Poon R.Y.C. Lew J. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Extensive truncation and site-directed mutation studies of Nck5a, together with computer modeling, strongly suggested that the 142-residue activation domain of Nck5a adopts a cyclin fold structure (3Brown N.R.

In this work, we describe the discovery of a 29-residue Cdk inhibitory peptide which is derived from an internal fragment of Nck5a. This peptide is able to bind to and hence to inhibit the kinase activities of Cdk5·Nck5a and Cdk2·cyclin A complexes in a non-competitive manner. The solution structure of the peptide determined by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy showed that a large part of the peptide adopts an amphipathic α-helical structure, and this helix is likely to be the main binding surface of the peptide to the enzyme complexes. A 28-residue peptide (ASTSELLRCLGEFLCRRCYRLKHLSPTD) corresponding to peptide fragment Ala146 to Asp173 of Nck5a was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model A431 automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc-based chemistry (Fig. 1). A 31-residue peptide (DYHEDIHTYLREMEVKCKPKVGYMKKQPDIT) corresponding to the sequence Asp177 to Thr207 of human cyclin A was synthesized in the same manner (Fig. 1). After cleavage from the solid support, the peptides were purified by gel filtration and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to a purity greater than 95%. All of the peptide purifications were carried out in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (v/v) as low pH can prevent the oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of the Cys residues in the peptides. Trifluoroacetic acid was removed from the peptide by dissolving the lyophilized peptide powder in pre-chilled Milli-Q water before re-lyophilization. The authenticity of the peptides was checked using mass spectrometry as described earlier (23Cheng H.-C. Bjorge J.D. Aebersold R. Fujita D.J. Wang J.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11874-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GST-Cdk5 and GST-Nck5a were prepared as described previously (20Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The N-terminal histidine-tagged Cdk5 (H6-Cdk5) was expressed in and purified fromEscherichia coli cells (strain M15 from Qiagen). The host cells, harboring a H6-Cdk5-containing expression plasmid, were cultured in 6 liters of tryptone/phosphate-rich medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to A600 ≈ 1.0 before induction of protein expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm). The cell culture was subsequently incubated for 10 h at 22 °C. The pelleted cells were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were then lysed in the French press in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and the lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 38,700 × g for 30 min. The pH of the resulting supernatant was adjusted to 7.9, and this was then incubated with 3 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Ni2+-NTA) beads for 1 h with stirring. The resin was packed onto a column and then washed with 50 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) and 30 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mm imidazole). H6-Cdk5 was then eluted with about 18 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mNaCl, and 1 m imidazole). The C-terminal histidine-tagged human cyclin A (cyclin A-H6) was expressed and purified in essentially the same manner as described for H6-Cdk5. Briefly, the expression plasmid pET21d containing a cyclin A gene lacking the N-terminal 173 amino acids was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. The host cells were cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and cyclin A expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The induction of cyclin A expression was for 3 h at 30 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100, and then lysed in the French press. The subsequent purification of cyclin A using a Ni2+-NTA column was carried out in a manner identical to that described for the purification of H6-Cdk5. The monomeric, active form of cyclin A-H6 was further purified by passing the cyclin A-H6-containing eluent through a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). H6-Cdk5 (about 3 μg) and 15 μg of GST-p25 were premixed in 300 μl of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Some 50-μl quantities of the mixture was taken out to mix with various concentrations of the αN peptide (from serial dilutions made from a 2.0 mm stock solution), and the total volume of the mixture was adjusted to 150 μl using Buffer R (1 × phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 15 h. GST-Nck5a·H6-Cdk5 complex was then precipitated by the addition of 40 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads pre-equilibrated with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (50%, v/v). The GSH-Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and subsequently resuspended in 20 μl of water and 20 μl of 2 × protein sample treatment buffer. The co-precipitated H6-Cdk5 was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against Cdk5 (22Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The binding of the αN peptide to the GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6 complex was studied in a similar manner to that described above for H6-Cdk5. Briefly, 3 μg of GST-Cdk2 and 10 μg of cyclin A-H6 were reconstituted in Buffer R with various concentrations of the αN peptide at 4 °C for 15 h. GST-Cdk2 was then precipitated by the addition of 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads. After washing, the co-precipitated cyclin A-H6 was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against cyclin A (Santa Cruz). Cdk5 kinase activity was assayed essentially as described previously (20Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,22Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), except that for each Cdk5 kinase reaction 1 μg of GST-Cdk5 was reconstituted with 2 μg of GST-Nck5a, and 1 μg of GST-Cdk2 was mixed with 3 μg of cyclin A-H6 in Cdk2 assays. The reconstituted complexes were added, in duplicate, to an assay mixture containing 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 μm of the histone H1 peptide, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and various concentrations of various peptides at 30 °C for 30 min before measuring the Cdk5 and Cdk2 kinase activities. All assay conditions were the same as in the inhibition assay described above, except that the reaction time was kept at 15 min so that the product formed was less than 5% of the total substrate concentration used. To determine suitable concentrations of the substrate and the inhibitor for the steady state kinetic experiments, the K m value of GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a complex and a concentration-dependent inhibition profile of the enzyme by the αN peptide were determined. Four different concentrations of the histone H1 peptide (7.5, 10, 15, and 30 μm) were used in the kinetic analysis of the enzyme inhibition. For each substrate concentration, four concentrations of the αN peptide (0, 10, 20, and 30 μm) were used in the inhibition assay. Concentrations of the αNpeptide stock solutions were determined by the UV absorption of the single Tyr residue at 280 nm. For CD measurement, the αNpeptide was dissolved in a 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing various concentrations of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). The concentration of the peptide was fixed at 50 μmthroughout the experiment. CD spectra were collected at 35 °C on a JASCO J-720 CD spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab temperature controller using a cell path length of 1 mm. For NMR studies, the αNpeptide was dissolved in unbuffered 90% H2O, 10% D2O, or 99.99% D2O containing various concentrations of deuterated TFE-d3 (0∼30%,v/v), and 2 mm deuterated dithiothreitol-d10 at pH (or pD) 4.0. The concentration of the αN peptide was approximately 2.0 mm. All 1H NMR data were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer at a 1H frequency of 500.11 MHz. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 6000 Hz in both dimensions (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The “WET” pulse sequence was employed for solvent suppression (25Smallcombe S.H. Patt S.L. Keifer P.A. J. Magn. Reson. Sect. A. 1995; 117: 295-303Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar) of the peptide samples in H2O. FID data matrices were composed of 512 × 2048 (t1 × t2) data points. The mixing times used in NOESY experiments were 150 and 300 ms. TOCSY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 75 ms using the MLEV17 spin lock sequence (26Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). All NMR data were processed and displayed using the nmrPipe software package (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Preifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 6: 277-293Google Scholar). In the course of studying the structure and function relationship of the activation domain of Nck5a, we created a series of truncated forms of GST-Nck5a mutants. One such GST fusion mutant, which contains a 29-residue peptide fragment corresponding to residues Gln145 to Asp173 of Nck5a (termed αN as it represents the N-terminal α-helix of Nck5a, see “Discussion”) was found to inhibit Cdk5 kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). About 50% kinase activity was inhibited at a GST-αN concentration of 5 μm. The inhibition of Cdk5 activity originated solely from the peptide fragment as GST did not have any effect on the kinase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 2B). Release of the peptide from the fusion protein by thrombin had no effect on the inhibitory activity (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the addition of GST-αN before or after the reconstitution of GST-Cdk5 with GST-Nck5a gave rise to the same inhibition profiles (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the peptide does not compete with Nck5a for Cdk5 (see below for more details). We also tested the inhibitory effect of GST-αN toward the GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6 complex, and found that GST-αN also inhibited the kinase activity of Cdk2. As expected, the inhibition of the Cdk2·cyclin A complex originated from the αN peptide portion of the fusion protein, as seen in the case of Cdk5 (data not shown, see also below for results obtained with the synthetic peptide). Low expression level (about 1 mg/ml of soluble GST-αN) and poor homogeneity of the GST fusion product prevented us from a detailed characterization of this inhibitory peptide. To overcome these problems, we decided to use a synthetic peptide instead of the GST fusion protein. A 28-residue peptide corresponding to amino acid residues Ala146 to Asp173 of Nck5a (abbreviated as the αN peptide) was synthesized and purified to homogeneity. The N-terminal Gln residue (Gln145) was deleted from the synthetic peptide sequence to avoid complication from its cyclization to form gyroglutamate. The titration curves shown in Figs. 2 and 3A revealed that both the recombinant and synthetic inhibitory peptides inhibit GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a complex with similar potencies. In order to assess whether the αN peptide was a specific inhibitor of Cdk5 and Cdk2, we synthesized a 31-residue peptide corresponding to Asp177 to Thr207 of cyclin A (the cyclin A peptide, Fig. 1), and tested for its ability to inhibit GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a. This region of cyclin A was previously shown to align with the αN peptide based on the sequences, the secondary structures, and the functions of the two proteins (22Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the cyclin A peptide could adopt an α-helical conformation similar to that seen in its crystal structure (28Fan J.-S. Cheng H.-C. Zhang M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the cyclin A peptide inhibited neither GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a nor GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6 (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is likely that the unique amino acid sequence of the αN peptide entails its inhibition of Cdk5 and Cdk2. In addition, the αN peptide was shown to adopt an amphipathic α-helical structure in solution (see below), we tested the Cdk inhibitory effect of another amphipathic peptide, a 26-residue peptide fragment comprising the calmodulin-binding domain of myosin light kinase (the MLCK peptide) (29Blumenthal D.K. Takio K. Edelman A.M. Charbonneau H. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3187-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30Zhang M. Yuan T. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although MLCK peptide was indeed able to inhibit the activities of both GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a and GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6, its inhibitory efficiency is significantly lower than that of the αN peptide (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is suggested that the potent and efficient inhibitory activity of the αN peptide is due to the unique amino acid sequence. The inhibition of Cdk5 and Cdk2 by the αNpeptide shown in Fig. 3 may result from a direct competition of the peptide with GST-Nck5a and cyclin A-H6 for GST-Cdk5 and GST-Cdk2, respectively, or from the binding of the peptide to the binary complexes of GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a and GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6. To discriminate between these possibilities, we performed direct binding competition experiments. Various concentrations of the peptides were added to a H6-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a mixture, and GST-Nck5a was then precipitated using GSH-agarose beads. The amount of H6-Cdk5 in complex with GST-Nck5a was determined by Western blotting of the enzyme co-precipitated by GSH-agarose beads. The amount of H6-Cdk5 and cyclin A-H6 used in the experiment described in Fig. 4, A and B, were chosen to ensure that their respective antibodies would be in excess. The addition of various amounts of the αN peptide (corresponding to approximately 10, 50, and 90% inhibition of the Cdk5 activity) did not lead to a dissociation of GST-Nck5a from H6-Cdk5 (Fig. 4A), indicating that the αN peptide was able to bind to and hence inhibit the binary complex of H6-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a. Similarly, the inhibition of GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6 activity by the αN peptide also resulted from the formation of a ternary complex between the αN peptide and GST-Cdk2·cyclin A-H6 rather than from a direct competition between the αN peptide and cyclin A for Cdk2 (Fig. 4B). The activity of the Cdk5·Nck5a complex could be inhibited immediately upon the addition of the αN peptide (Fig. 2C), further indicating that the αNpeptide can bind to and inhibit Cdk5 without the dissociation of its activator. To further prove that the αN peptide does not compete with Nck5a for Cdk5, we performed a direct competition experiment. First, GST-Cdk5 was reconstituted with various concentrations of its activator. Then, we assayed the inhibition of the reconstituted GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a complexes by the αN peptide (50 μm, a concentration which leads to about 90% inhibition of the enzyme, see Fig. 3). If the inhibitory peptide were to compete with Nck5a for Cdk5, the large excess of Nck5a would mask the inhibition of the kinase by the peptide at low concentrations. However, data in Fig. 5 show that the presence of a large excess of GST-Nck5a has no significant effect on the enzyme inhibition profile by the αN peptide, further supporting the contention that the inhibitory peptide does not compete with Nck5a for Cdk5. We also analyzed the kinetic properties of the αN peptide with respect to the kinase substrate, the histone H1 peptide. The double-reciprocal plot shown in Fig. 6A demonstrates that the peptide acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme complex with respect to its substrate. Dixon plot analysis of the data reveals that the K i for the αN peptide inhibition of the GST-Cdk5·GST-Nck5a complex is approximately 25 μm (Fig. 6B). Linearity of the Dixon plots indicates that the αN peptide is a dead end inhibitor (i.e. the kinase-inhibitor complex is catalytically inactive) (31Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. Wiley-VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1975: 101-258Google Scholar). This notion is further supported by the near complete inhibition of the kinase by an excess amount (i.e. 400 μm) of the αN peptide (data not shown). In order to understand the structural basis of Cdk5 and Cdk2 inhibition by the αN peptide, we determined the structure of the peptide by NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of the αN peptide in aqueous solution showed reasonable chemical shift dispersion (data not shown). However, careful inspection of the spectra revealed that the majority of resonance in both the amide and aliphatic regions had exceptionally broad line widths for a peptide of only 28 amino acid residues. These results indicated that the peptide might be in equilibrium between multiple conformers or in an aggregated state. A number of amide protons throughout the peptide displayed more than one cross-peak to their α protons in a TOCSY spectrum of the peptide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 4.0, at 30 °C (data not shown). When the pH of the sample was raised to 4.5 or above, the line widths of the NMR signals broadened further, and the TOCSY spectra were more complicated. Changing the sample temperature (from 8 to 35 °C) or concentration (from 0.5 to 3.5 mm) did not improve the quality of the NMR spectra. CD studies also showed that the molar ellipticity of the peptide at 222 nm remained constant when the concentration of the peptide was varied from 8 μm to 0.2 mm (data not shown). These results indicated that the αN peptide in aqueous solution has multiple conformational states that are exchanging at slow to intermediate rates. Such multi-conformational equilibrium prevented us from a detailed structural characterization of the peptide in aqueous solution, although we were still able to obtain nearly complete backbone assignment of the peptide at pH 4, 35 °C. To overcome the complications encountered in aqueous solution, we used TFE as a co-solvent for the structural characterization of the peptide. Fig. 7 shows CD spectra of the αN peptide at various concentrations of TFE. The CD spectrum of the peptide in the absence of TFE did not show the well defined double minima at 222 and 208 nm which are characteristics of an ordered α-helix in aqueous solution. However, the shape of the CD curve does suggest a measurable population of α-helix (32Dyson J.H. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 519-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). For the samples dissolved in 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30% (v/v) TFE/H2O mixtures, the CD spectra showed increasingly clearer double minima at 222 and 208 nm, indicating an increasing amount of ordered α-helix. The CD spectra of the peptide in 5 to 30% TFE (v/v) solution had a common intersection at 204 nm, indicating that the peptide was undergoing a two-state conformational transition (Fig. 7), whereas the CD curve of the peptide in aqueous solution did not join this intersection ("

Rates of photophosphorylation and ATPase-driven proton translocation measured in coupled thylakoids purified from βT168D, βT168C, and βT168L mutants had <10% of the wild type rates, as did rates of Mg2+-ATPase activity of purified chloroplast F1-ATPase (CF1). The EPR spectra of VO2+-ATP bound to Site 3 of CF1 from wild type and mutants showed that EPR species C, formed exclusively upon activation, was altered in CF1 from each mutant in both signal intensity and in 51V hyperfine parameters that depend on the equatorial VO2+ ligands. These data provide the first direct evidence that Site 3 is a catalytic site. No significant differences between wild type and mutants were observed in EPR species B, the predominant form of the latent enzyme. Thus, the phosphate-binding loop threonine is an equatorial metal ligand in the activated conformation but not in the latent conformation of Site 3. The metal-nucleotide conformation that gives rise to species B is consistent with the Mg2+-ADP complex that becomes entrapped in a catalytic site in a manner that regulates enzymatic activity. The lack of catalytic function of CF1 with entrapped Mg2+-ADP may be explained in part by the absence of the phosphate-binding loop threonine as a metal ligand.

The F1F0-ATP synthase uses a nonequilibrium transmembrane proton gradient to synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate to form a nonequilibrium chemical gradient of productsversus substrates (1Weber J.

The proton-motive force drives two sequential conformational changes of the catalytic site that decrease the affinity of the enzyme for ATP relative to ADP, thereby facilitating the selective dissociation of ATP to generate the chemical gradient. The conformation of each of three catalytic sites on the enzyme is staggered such that the enzyme contains a catalytic site in each of the three sequential conformations at any instant. The nucleotides bind the catalytic site as a complex with Mg2+ (3Frasch W.D. Selman B.R.

Several metals will substitute in a functional manner for Mg2+ including Mn2+, Ca2+, and VO2+ (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the absence of Mg2+, the three catalytic sites of F1 from Escherichia coli bind ATP with the same affinity (5Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of each site for the Mg2+-ATP complex changes such that there is a difference of more than 5 orders of magnitude between the sites with highest and lowest affinity. This strongly suggests that the changes in coordination of the metal at the catalytic site play a critical role in the protein conformational changes that promote the selective release of ATP from the enzyme. The catalytic activity of chloroplast F1 purified from F0 and the thylakoid membrane is latent, although ATPase activity can be activated via reduction of a disulfide bond on the γ-subunit (6Frasch W.D. Bryant D. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer, The Netherlands1994: 361-380Crossref Google Scholar). The oxidation state of this disulfide provides one of multiple levels of interrelated mechanisms to regulate the enzyme to minimize ATPase activity once the proton gradient dissipates in the absence of light-driven proton translocation. The dark decay of ATPase activity in thylakoids is accelerated by the addition of ADP that becomes tightly bound in the latent state (7Smith J.P. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4314-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8.Schumann, J., Strotmann, H., Proceedings of the 5th International Photosynthesis Congress, Akoyunoglou, G., 2, 1980, 881, 892, Balban, Philadelphia, PA.Google Scholar, 9Dunham K.R. Selman B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 212-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of this tightly bound ADP and inhibition of ATPase activity only occur upon the addition of Mg2+ (10Zhou J.M. Xue Z. Du Z. Melese T. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Mg2+ apparently induces the formation of a Mg2+-ADP complex at the catalytic site that is bound to the enzyme in a manner that prevents further catalysis. This binding of Mg2+-ADP has been found to serve a regulatory function in the F1-ATPases from other organisms as well (11Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 319-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the six possible metal ligands at each catalytic site of the bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase, only the oxygens from the nucleotide phosphates and from T156 on the β-subunit were within 2.5 Å of the metal in the crystal structure of the enzyme from bovine mitochondria (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). This residue is part of the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) motif GXXXXGKT that is common to many enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP (14Walker J.E. Fearnley I. Gay N. Gibson B. Northrup F. Powell S. Runswick M. Saraste M. Tybulewicz V. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Based on available crystal structures, the hydroxyl group of the threonine typically coordinates to the Mg2+ cofactor of the enzyme-bound Mg2+-nucleotide complex (15Jurnak F.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue in the β-subunit of EF1 decreases the Mg2+-dependent binding affinity of nucleotide (21Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although several other residues have been suggested to serve as metal ligands at the catalytic site of F1 based on site-directed mutagenesis studies, these side chains are all at least 5 Å away from the metal in the crystal structure (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). Recently, vanadyl has been used as a direct probe to identify the types of groups that serve as metal ligands at one catalytic site (Site 3) of the latent and activated forms of the chloroplast F1-ATPase (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Vanadyl (VIV=O)2+ is a cation composed of vanadium (IV) double-bonded to oxygen to give a net charge of 2+, such that it has four equatorial ligands and one axial ligand that is trans to the vanadium-oxygen bond. Vanadyl has a single unpaired electron and a nuclear spin (I = 7/2) that gives rise to a 16-line EPR spectrum due to the anisotropy resulting from the V=O bond. The 51V hyperfine parameters of VO2+are sensitive to the type of groups that serve as equatorial ligands. Each of these four ligands contributes independently to the 51V hyperfine parameters such that the overall coupling is the average of couplings observed for a uniform environment, weighted by the number of each type of ligand. Purified CF1 contains four tightly bound metal-nucleotides (24Shapiro A.B. Huber A.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The metal-nucleotide bound to the site designated Site 3 can be removed by gel filtration chromatography, whereas depletion of Site 2 requires partial unfolding of CF1 by precipitation in ammonium sulfate and EDTA (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and depletion of Sites 1 and 4 requires the removal of the ε-subunit (26Xiao J. McCarty R.E. Biochim. Biophpys. Acta. 1989; 976: 203-209Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sites 1 and 3 have been postulated to be catalytic, whereas Site 2 has been suggested to be noncatalytic (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements using 2ı́(3ı́)-trinitrophenyl-nucleotides enabled the positions of Sites 1–3 relative to each other and to locations of fluorescent groups covalently modified to unique locations on CF1 to be mapped (27McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 234-237Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The observation of unique, identifiable locations for Sites 1–3 and the closeness with which the fluorescence resonance energy transfer map corresponds to the locations of the metal-nucleotides in the crystal structure of F1 from bovine mitochondria indicate that each of the metal-nucleotide binding Sites 1–3 can be selectively filled with metal-nucleotide complex (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). When Site 2 of latent CF1 is filled with VO2+-nucleotide, the bound VO2+-ATP gives rise to EPR species A (22Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). At Site 3, the majority of VO2+-nucleotide binds in a ligand environment that gives rise to EPR species B, whereas a smaller fraction binds to Site 3 in a form that gives rise to EPR species C (22Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon activation of the enzyme, all of species B converts to species C, indicating that the latter results from the metal ligands responsible for catalytic competence. The titration of VO2+-nucleotide to CF1 that had been depleted of metal-nucleotide only from Site 3 showed that the VO2+ had bound selectively to a single site (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The best fits of the 51V hyperfine coupling parameters to EPR species at Site 3 strongly suggest that this site contains hydroxyl groups from serine or threonine as metal ligands in both the latent and activated states. We have now characterized site-directed mutants of the P-loop threonine in the β-subunit of CF1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (βT168). The effects of these mutations on the EPR spectra of VO2+ bound to Site 3 of CF1 were examined to determine whether changes could be observed in a manner that would indicate that this residue is a metal ligand. The results indicate that βT168 contributes a hydroxyl group as an equatorial metal ligand when VO2+ binds to Site 3 in the manner that gives rise to EPR species C, the activated enzyme conformation. This is the first direct evidence to indicate that Site 3 is a catalytic site. However, this group is not an equatorial ligand to VO2+under conditions that give rise to EPR species B, the predominant form in the latent state. The recombinant plasmid carrying wild type geneatpB of C. reinhardtii was constructed as described by Hu et al. (28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The 5.3-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment of the chloroplast genome containing atpB was cloned into pUC18, and then a 1.4-kbatpA-aadA cassette was inserted into the plasmid at a KpnI site of the 5.3-kb fragment. The final recombinant plasmid was named pBam 10.3-spec and used as the template to make mutants. The atpA-aadA cassette included the promoter of the atpA gene and aadA that encodes a protein against the antibiotic spectinomycin. Stratagene kit 200508 was used to generate atpB mutations on pBam 10.3-spec following the provided protocol that required two primers for each mutant. The mutagenesis primers were as follows: βT179D, 5′- TTCGGTGCCGGTGTAGGCAAAGACGTTTTAATTATG-3′; βT179C, 5′-TTCGGTGCCGGTGTAGGCAAATGTGTTTTAATTATG-3′; and βT179L, 5′-GTGTAGGCAAATTAGTTTTAATTATGGAAC-3′. The selective primer that changed restriction site Xmnl to BamHI was Ps (5′-CGCCCCGAAGAACGGATCCCAATGATGAGCAC-3′). Sequences of DNA were obtained using ABI PRISM automatic sequencing to confirm the mutations in the plasmids. The sequence primer was 5′-CCGTACAGCTCCTGCTTTCG-3′. The mutated plasmids were purified by ultracentrifugation with cesium chloride and diluted to 1 mg/ml. The CC-373 and CC-125 strains of C. reinhardtii were obtained from the Chlamydomonas culture collection center at Duke University. The CC-373 strain has a 2.5-kb deletion that starts close to the 5′-end of atpB. The transformation of CC-373 with mutated pBam 10.3-spec was performed using the PDS-1000 particle delivery system (DuPont New England Nuclear) as described by Huet al. (28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Southern blots were done as described by Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.55Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled pBam 10.3-spec as the probe to determine that the mutants were homoplasmic. The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing the PCR product from the chloroplast genome of each mutant. Methods to measure photoautotrophic growth curves, to prepare coupled thylakoid membranes, and to purify CF1 from strains of Chlamydomonas were carried out as described by Huet al. (28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Assays of photosystem I-dependent electron transfer activity, photophosphorylation activity with coupled thylakoids, and ATPase activity with purified CF1 were also performed as described by Hu et al. (28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The ability of purified thylakoids to generate a light-driven proton gradient was monitored using 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tricine (pH 8.3), 10 mm NaCl, 0.08 mm phenazine methylsulfate, 0.5 μm 9-aminoacridine, and 30 μg of chlorophyll in a total volume of 2 ml. Fluorescence quenching was measured at room temperature with a Spex FluoroMax Model DM3000 with excitation at 400 nm and emission at 450 nm. Actinic light was supplied by an Oriel-66181 lamp using a 600 nm cut-off filter via a light pipe. To measure ATPase-driven proton pumping, thylakoid membranes were suspended in 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.3, and 50 mmKCl. The membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min after the addition of 9-aminoacridine to a final concentration of 5 μm. The membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.3, and 50 mm KCl. The thylakoid membranes were then diluted to a final chlorophyll concentration of 5 mg chlorophyll/ml. Fluorescence quenching was measured as described above. The initial rate of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching was measured with 2 ml of reaction buffer that contained 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml valinomycin, 20 μg of chlorophyll, and the indicated concentration of Mg2+-ATP. To purify CF1 from Chlamydomonas thylakoids, thylakoids were incubated with 0.75 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 15 min at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 20 min to remove the thylakoids. This EDTA extraction was repeated three times. DEAE-Sephadex A-50 that had been pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-NaOH (pH 8.0), 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 1 mm EDTA was added to the combined supernatants containing CF1. The suspension was stirred slowly for 30 min at room temperature and then loaded into a chromatography column. The protein was eluted from this column with 300 ml of buffer that contained 20 mm Tris-NaOH (pH 8.0), 1.0 mm ATP, 2 mm EDTA, and 500 mmNaCl. The fractions that contained CF1 were concentrated by pressure dialysis using an Amicon YM-100 membrane to a volume of about 3 ml. It has been shown previously (24Shapiro A.B. Huber A.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that CF1 purified in this manner contains about four tightly bound Mg2+-nucleotides. The purified CF1 was depleted of the Mg2+-nucleotide from Site 3 by chromatography on a 3 × 30-cm Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mm ATP, and 500 mm NaCl. The eluent was concentrated again via pressure dialysis using a YM-100 membrane to a volume of about 1 ml. The sample was then diluted in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) to a final NaCl concentration of 175 mm. This treatment has been shown to deplete CF1 of Site 3 without removing significant amounts of metal-nucleotide from the other tight binding sites (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to 0.3 ml, and the extinction coefficient of 0.483 mg CF1/ml (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used to determine the concentration. A 1:1 mole ratio solution of VO2+-ATP, prepared as described by Houseman et al. (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), was added to the Site 3-depleted CF1 samples to a final mole ratio of VO2+:CF1 of 1:1. The CF1concentration of the EPR samples prepared in this manner was typically about 0.3 mm. The millimolar concentration of vanadyl bound to CF1 was determined as described by Houseman et al. (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as 3.247 times the integrated area of the −5/2 line of the EPR signal intensity per scan at a gain of 105. EPR experiments were carried out at X-band (9 GHz) using a Bruker 300E spectrometer and a liquid nitrogen flow cryostat operating at 100 K. Simulations of these spectra were made as described by Housemanet al. (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the QPOWA program (30.Nilges, M.

M., Acquisition of Anisotropíc Information by Computational Analysis of Isotropic EPR Spectra.Ph.D. thesis, 1981, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL.Google Scholar). The yield of CF1 purified from each of the βT168 mutants of Chlamydomonas was approximately the same as that isolated from the wild type. The subunit composition of the CF1 from wild type and mutants was compared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 1. Preparations of the enzyme from the mutant and wild type contained all five subunits including the δ-subunit, which is known to dissociate easily fromChlamydomonas CF1 (28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mutations do not affect the synthesis and assembly of the enzyme significantly. The relative ability of the mutant and wild type strains ofChlamydomonas to grow under photoautotrophic conditions is shown in Table I. The site-directed mutants of βT168 were essentially incapable of photoautotrophic growth. The rates of phenazine methosulfate-dependent photophosphorylation of thylakoids from the wild type and mutant preparations are also summarized in Table I. Although the rates remained linear in all cases for up to 5 min, the ATP synthase activity of the mutants was <10% that of the wild type. The results are consistent with the inability of the mutants to grow photoautotrophically.Table IFunctional comparison of wild-type and mutantsStrainPhotoautotrophic growth rateaPhotoautotrophic growth curves of wild-type and mutant strains of Chlamydomonas were obtained by growing cells at 25°C with a light intensity of 80 μE ·m−2 · s−1 and measured as the optical density (cell scattering) of the liquid culture at 720 nm.

Open table in a new tab The low rates of photophosphorylation were not the result of the inability of the thylakoids to form a light-driven proton gradient. Fig. 2 shows the relative fluorescence quenching of 9-aminoacridine in the wild type and mutant thylakoids upon illumination. The rate and extent of fluorescence quenching in each of the mutants were about the same as in the wild type. Thus, none of the mutations caused the membranes to become uncoupled. Combined with the observations that the yield and subunit composition of the mutant proteins are the same as those of the wild type, it is unlikely that any of the mutations caused a large conformational change that interferes with the folding and assembly of the CF1F0 complex. A single eq of VO2+ was added to CF1 as a complex with ATP under conditions in which all other higher affinity binding sites for metal-nucleotides were filled with Mg2+-nucleotide complexes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3shows the parallel features of the EPR spectra of VO2+bound in this manner to the CF1 from wild type and mutantChlamydomonas. The differences in EPR species B and C between wild type and mutants are clearly resolved with the +5/2∥ line. None of the mutations was found to change the 51V hyperfine parameters of EPR species B. However, EPR species C was altered from the wild type in each of the mutants examined. The values of A∥ and g∥ derived from each spectrum in Fig. 3 by simulation of the entire spectrum are summarized in TableII. The total amount of bound VO2+ can be measured from the EPR signal intensity under nonsaturating conditions based on the proportion of the signal intensity to the amount of CF1-bound vanadium as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4910-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TableIII shows the amount of VO2+per CF1 bound upon the addition of 1 eq of VO2+as a complex with ATP. The addition of 1 eq of VO2+ to wild type CF1 under the conditions described here resulted in about 30% occupancy of Site 3 (Table III). The ratio of the amplitudes of the simulated spectra for species B and C from each mutant that, when summed, reproduced the experimental spectra is shown in Table III. Based on these data, the mole ratios of bound VO2+:CF1 as species B or species C were calculated.Table IIVO2+ coordination at Site N3 in CF1 from wild-type and mutantsStrainEPR speciesExperimental parametersaExperimental parameters were obtained from simulations to the actual spectra using the QPOWA program.Calculated parametersbCalculated parameters were derived from Equation 1 based upon the most probable ligand set shown.Most probable VO2+ equatorial ligand setsA∥g∥A∥g∥Wild typeB498.21.948498.81.9461ROH, 1H2O, 1RCOOH, 1PiC456.51.957456.31.9582ROH, 1RArOH, 1PiβT168CB500.21.947498.81.9461ROH, 1H2O, 1RCOOH, 1PiC469.51.957468.31.9561RSH, 1RArOH, 2PiβT168DB498.21.945498.81.9461ROH, 1H2O, 1RCOOH, 1PiC461.51.957βT168LB497.21.947498.81.9461ROH, 1H2O, 1RCOOH, 1PiCEmptya Experimental parameters were obtained from simulations to the actual spectra using the QPOWA program.b Calculated parameters were derived from Equation 1 based upon the most probable ligand set shown.

Open table in a new tab In the βT168C mutant, the value of A∥ increased by about 13 MHz. In addition, the EPR signal intensity of species C relative to species B decreased by about 2-fold. The βT168D mutant increased A∥ of species C by about 4 MHz but had little effect on the ratio of the species C to species B signal intensities. When leucine was substituted for the P-loop threonine, the amount of VO2+ bound to the latent protein in the conformation that gives rise to species C was insignificant. Substitution of hydrophobic leucine for the P-loop threonine did not affect the total amount of VO2+ bound to Site 3, but all of the bound VO2+ was in the form that gives rise to species B (Table III). Mutations that introduced either the sulfhydryl or carboxyl groups were found to bind the form of VO2+ that gives rise to species C to the same extent as the wild type enzyme. However, these mutations increased the amount of VO2+ bound in the species B form such that there was a net increase in the occupancy of Site 3 upon the addition of a single equivalent of the metal. The effects of the mutations on the ability of CF1F0 to catalyze ATPase-driven proton translocation was determined by fluorescence quenching of 9-aminoacridine using thylakoids purified from wild type and mutant strains of Chlamydomonas. Shown as a function of the Mg2+-ATP concentration (Fig. 4), the initial rate of proton translocation was severely affected in thylakoids purified from the mutants such that there was little difference in fluorescence quenching between thylakoids from the mutants and the azide-inhibited wild type. These results were similar to the rates of Mg2+-ATPase activity observed with CF1 purified from each mutant (data not shown). Vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups that serve as metal-ligands in F1-ATPase (4Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) because the g and A tensors of the 51V hyperfine couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors from each type of group that contributes an equatorial ligand (33.Holyk, N., An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study of Model Oxovanadium (IV) Complexes in Aqueous Solution: Correlation of Magnetic Properties with Ligand Type and Metal Chelate Structure.M.Sc. thesis, 1979, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH.Google Scholar, 34Chasteen N.D.

The results presented here show for the first time that site-directed mutations of a metal ligand on F1-ATPase will cause measurable changes in the EPR spectrum of enzyme-bound VO2+and thereby provide direct evidence of a specific residue as a metal ligand. The presence of hydroxyl groups from serine or threonine were suggested as equatorial ligands to VO2+ bound at Site 3 of CF1 in the forms that predominate in both the latent and activated states (23Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have now shown that one of the putative hydroxyl ligands in the activated enzyme form is the P-loop threonine of the β-subunit (βT168). This concurs with the role of the P-loop threonine inferred from the crystal structure of F1-ATPase from bovine mitochondria (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). Site 3 was previously suggested to be a catalytic site (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The results presented here show conclusively that this assignment is correct. The crystal structure of mitochondrial F1 is not able to provide information concerning the conformation of the metal-nucleotide bound to CF1 in the latent state. The results presented here indicate that the P-loop threonine is not an equatorial ligand to VO2+ bound as the VO2+-ATP complex at Site 3 in the ligand environment that predominates in the latent enzyme conformation (EPR species B). In addition to the changes observed to the 51V hyperfine coupling of VO2+ bound at Site 3, the mutations of the P-loop threonine of CF1 to a carboxyl, sulfhydryl, or leucine side chain significantly affected the function of the enzyme. The E. coli F1 P-loop mutations βT156D, βT156C, and βT156A also decreased the ability of EF1F0 to catalyze ATP synthesis and ATPase-dependent proton translocation, as well as the ability of purified EF1 to catalyze ATP hydrolysis (35Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20571-20576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the magnitude of the decrease in ATP-dependent H+-gradient formation was comparable between the mutants of EF1F0 and ChlamydomonasCF1F0, the mutations of the former enzyme were 100-fold more effective in eliminating the other activities. The EPR data in Fig. 4 and Table II that result from VO2+bound to Site 3 of mutant CF1 also provide insight into the metal ligation responsible for the functional changes in each of these mutants. Based on the measured coupling constants ofA∥ from model studies (34Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar, 36Hamstra B.J. Houseman A.L. Colpas G.J. Kampf J.W. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Pecoraro V.L. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 36: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the hyperfine coupling for a given group of equatorial ligands can be calculated from the equation A∥calc=ΣniA∥i/4i=1(Eq. 1) where i counts the different types of equatorial ligand donor groups, n i(n i = 1–4) is the number of ligands of type i, and A ∥iis the measured coupling constant for the equatorial ligand donor group of type i (34Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar). Similar equations can be written forg∥ and for Aiso, although the changes in A∥ are the largest and most easily discerned. Table II shows the values of A∥ and g∥ calculated from Equation 1 that give the closest fit to the experimental data derived from simulation of the spectra and summarizes the equatorial ligands used for these calculations. When VO2+ was bound to Site 3 of CF1 from wild type and the βT168C mutant, values ofA∥ were 457.5 and 469.5 MHz, respectively. As published previously (23Houseman A.L.P. LoBrutto R. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Hu C.-Y. Houseman A.L.P. Morgan L. Webber A.N. Frasch W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12201-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), species C is best fit to an equatorial ligand set that contains two hydroxyl groups from serine or threonine. The ligand set that gives the best fit to the data from the βT168C mutant contains a sulfhydryl and a phosphate or carboxyl oxygen as ligands in lieu of the hydroxyl oxygens. Additional information (e.g. superhyperfine coupling from 31P) is required to distinguish phosphate and carboxyl oxygens as ligands to VO2+. If the βT168D mutation were to result solely in the substitution of a carboxyl for a hydroxyl oxygen, an increase inA∥ of about 22 MHz would be expected. Whereas an increase in A∥ was observed in this mutant, it only increased by 4–461.5 MHz. The closest fit of the data is derived from an equatorial ligand set of three imidazole-nitrogens (histidines) and one sulfhydryl (cysteine). This makes no sense when compared with the side chains available at the catalytic site in the crystal structure of mitochondrial F1 from bovine mitochondria, nor can it be explained via unconserved residues unique to CF1 from Chlamydomonas. The closest set of equatorial ligands that makes any sense with regard to the known groups in the site is when the oxygens from a hydroxyl, and the carboxyl/phosphate of the wild type are substituted for two amine nitrogens. These substitutions result in A∥ of 462.6 MHz, which is within 1.1 MHz of that observed experimentally. With the information currently available, we can not assign a set of equatorial ligands for this one mutant. Clearly, the βT168D mutation has caused profound changes in the equatorial ligands of VO2+ bound at catalytic Site 3. The introduction of a hydrophobic leucine side chain at position β168 reduced the amount of VO2+ bound to Site 3 in the EPR species C conformation by more than 95% relative to that of the wild type enzyme. Consequently, the signal intensity of the residual species C was insufficient to suggest a possible equatorial ligand set. In EF1, these mutants decreased the affinity of the catalytic sites for ATP under unisite conditions and multisite conditions (21Weber J. Hammond S.T. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,35Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20571-20576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EPR results presented here were obtained under conditions in which the amount of VO2+-ATP added was stoichiometric to metal-nucleotide-depleted, catalytic Site 3 when the enzyme contained Mg2+-nucleotide bound to at least one other catalytic site. 2Under the experimental conditions, Sites 1, 2, and 4 contain Mg2+-nucleotide. Because the data presented here confirm that Site 3 is catalytic, a comparison of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer map of CF1 with the crystal structure of F1 from bovine mitochondria indicates that Sites 1 and 2 are catalytic and noncatalytic, respectively. Because Site 4 does not bind 2ı́(3ı́)-trinitrophenyl-nucleotides, its location relative to Sites 1–3 has not been determined. Data available at this time suggest that Site 4 is also a catalytic site. Under these conditions, the T168L mutant bound the same total amount of vanadyl, but all of it was in the form that gave rise to EPR species B. This supports previous results that species B and C are derived from VO2+ bound in two conformations at the same location. Whereas substitution of the P-loop threonine with a hydrophobic side chain did not affect the affinity of Site 3 for VO2+, the presence of a charged or polar group did. In the T168D or T168C mutants, the amount of VO2+ bound in the species B form increased. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of the P-loop T→S mutation in F1 or F1-subcomplexes has also been characterized in several organisms. In yeast (37Mueller D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28818-28824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and Chlamydomonas (40Hu D. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this mutation, which maintained a polar group in this position, increased the Vmax of purified F1 Mg2+-ATPase activity severalfold above that of wild type. Evidence suggests that the capacity to entrap inhibitory Mg2+-ADP in a catalytic site is significantly impaired in the α3β3γ subcomplex of thermophilic bacterial F1 with this substitution. The mutations to the P-loop threonine reported here cause a loss of catalytic activity concurrent with an increase in the proportion of VO2+ that binds to Site 3 in the species B form relative to species C. This implies that the bound VO2+-nucleotide complex that gives rise to species B may be the form that is entrapped as part of the regulatory mechanism. Hu et al. (40Hu D. Strotmann H. Shavit N. Leu S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that the P-loop T→S substitution in Chlamydomonas CF1 had a much higher Mg2+-ATPase activity in the absence of dithiothreitol than did the wild type. Although data suggested that this mutation in CF1 also interferes with the entrapment of tightly bound Mg2+-ADP by a catalytic site that regulates ATPase activity, at least one ADP remains tightly bound to the purified enzyme. This strongly implies that catalytic Site 1 (25Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and perhaps Site 4 are not the site(s) of entrapment. Rather, this suggests that the catalytic Site 3, and thus the VO2+-ADP conformation that gives rise to EPR species B, is the regulatory site. More experiments need to be done to test this hypothesis.

Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8 Suppl. 1: 221-236Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Keyt B.A. Paoni N.F. Bennett W.F. Cleland J.L. Craik C.S. Protein Engineering: Principles and Practice.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The striking substrate specificity of t-PA is mediated in part by interactions of both the enzyme and its substrate with the co-factor fibrin (6Madison E.L. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8 Suppl. 1: 221-236Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Keyt B.A. Paoni N.F. Bennett W.F. Cleland J.L. Craik C.S. Protein Engineering: Principles and Practice. Wiley-Liss, New York1996: 435-466Google Scholar). However, even in the absence of a co-factor, t-PA maintains strict specificity for plasminogen, the primary physiological substrate, and we have shown that this specificity is an inherent property of the isolated protease domain of t-PA (17Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent structural investigations of the protease domain of t-PA have confirmed the expected close similarity of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme to that of trypsin, a nonspecific protease (18Lamba D.

For example, these investigators have shown that the variant thrombin/E192Q activates protein C approximately 20 times more rapidly than wild type thrombin (21Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the variants factor Xa/Q192E and factor Xa/Q192M activate prethrombin 1 approximately 10 times less efficiently than factor Xa (21Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, replacement of Glu-192 of activated protein C with a glutamine residue increased the rate of inhibition of the enzyme by the serpin α1-proteinase inhibitor by a factor of approximately 300 (22Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).By contrast to the coagulation proteases, the role of residue 192 in mediating specificity of the fibrinolytic proteases has not been explored. Consequently, we created new variants of the fibrinolytic protease t-PA in which Gln-192 2The standard chymotrypsin numbering system is used throughout this article. Arg-15, Ile-16, and Gln-192 in this numbering system correspond to Arg-275, Ile-276, and Gln-475 in the t-PA numbering system. 2The standard chymotrypsin numbering system is used throughout this article. Arg-15, Ile-16, and Gln-192 in this numbering system correspond to Arg-275, Ile-276, and Gln-475 in the t-PA numbering system. was replaced either with a glutamic acid residue, as in thrombin and protein C, or a methionine, as in chymotrypsin. We examined the effect of these mutations on the reactivity of the single- and two-chain forms of t-PA toward four distinct synthetic substrates, the physiological substrate plasminogen both in the presence and absence of a fibrin co-factor, and the physiological inhibitor PAI-1. Unlike with the coagulation proteases, mutation of residue 192 did not dramatically alter the reactivity of t-PA toward physiological inhibitors. Furthermore, in the presence of fibrin, both the single- and two-chain forms of the mutated enzymes retained high catalytic activity toward plasminogen. These results suggest that residue 192 does not contribute significantly to the specificity of fibrinolytic proteases in physiologically relevant reactions and consequently that subtle but clear distinctions may exist between the molecular determinants of specificity for coagulation and fibrinolytic proteases.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo investigate the functional significance of Gln-192 of t-PA, we used oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to replace this residue with either the isosteric residue glutamic acid, which is present at position 192 of the related enzyme thrombin, or methionine, which occupies the analogous position in chymotrypsin. Accurate measurement of the catalytic activity of the single-chain form of these variants toward the physiological substrate plasminogen was difficult, however, because plasmin produced during this assay rapidly and efficiently converted the variants into their mature, two-chain forms by cleaving the Arg-15–Ile-16 bond of the single-chain t-PA. Consequently, to overcome this technical difficulty, we also constructed noncleavable forms of the two mutated enzymes by introducing the additional mutation R15E into the new variants, a strategy that was first described by Tate et al. (37Tate K.M. Higgins D.L. Holmes W.E. Winkler M.E. Heyneker H.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The activity of the two-chain form of t-PA, t-PA/Q192E, and t-PA/Q192M toward the small chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme t-PA varied by less than 30% (Table I). IndividualK m and kcat values toward the synthetic substrate varied by less than a factor of 1.7 compared with the wild type enzyme for both variants. Gln-192 of t-PA, therefore, does not significantly modulate the activity of the enzyme toward the chromogenic substrate. However, because Spectrozyme t-PA contains ad- rather than an l-amino acid residue at the P3 position, this result is consistent with expectations.Table IKinetic constants for cleavage of the chromogenic substrates by single- and two-chain t-PA variantsEnzymekcatKmkcat/Kms−1mmm−1s−1Spectrozyme t-PATwo-chain formt-PA540.381.4 × 105t-PA/Q192M320.261.3 × 105t-PA/Q192E600.611.0 × 105Single-chain formt-PA/R15E150.602.6 × 104t-PA/R15E,Q192M130.562.4 × 104t-PA/R15E,Q192E140.702.1 × 104Spectrozyme UKTwo-chain formt-PA280.93.2 × 104t-PA/Q192M100.532.0 × 104t-PA/Q192E140.662.2 × 104Single-chain formt-PA/R15E7.10.957.5 × 103t-PA/R15E,Q192M2.70.873.3 × 103t-PA/R15E,Q192E2.80.47.5 × 103S-2765Two-chain formt-PA22.41.22.0 × 104t-PA/Q192M6.90.461.5 × 104t-PA/Q192E17.11.41.2 × 104Single-chain formt-PA/R15E141.11.2 × 104t-PA/R15E,Q192M161.69.6 × 103t-PA/R15E,Q192E8.51.46.5 × 103S-2444Two-chain formt-PA302.11.5 × 104t-PA/Q192M221.61.4 × 104t-PA/Q192E232.21.1 × 104Single-chain formt-PA/R15E6.72.33.0 × 103t-PA/R15E,Q192M4.92.62.0 × 103t-PA/R15E,Q192E7.12.92.5 × 103 Open table in a new tab The activities of single-chain t-PA/R15E, t-PA/R15E,Q192E, and t-PA/R15E,Q192M in the direct assay are even more similar than those of the corresponding two-chain enzymes (Table I). Individualkcat, K m, and kcat/K m values for the two variants carrying point mutations at position 192 are all within 20% of the corresponding values for single-chain t-PA/R15E.Similar data were obtained using three additional, small chromogenic substrates (Table I). Compared with the corresponding wild type enzyme, two-chain t-PA/Q192M maintained 93, 75, or 63% activity toward the substrates S-2444, S-2765, and Spectrozyme UK, respectively. The catalytic activity of two-chain t-PA/Q192E toward these same substrates was 73, 60, or 69%, respectively, of two-chain t-PA. The single-chain t-PA variants also maintained high activity toward these chromogenic substrates, ranging from 100% activity for single-chain t-PA/Q192E toward Spectrozyme UK to 44% activity for single-chain t-PA/Q192M toward the same substrate. Mutation of residue 192 of t-PA, therefore, did not substantially alter the activity of either the single- or two-chain enzyme toward synthetic substrates containing ad-, l-, or unnatural amino acid at the P3 position.In contrast to Spectrozyme t-PA, plasminogen, the primary physiological substrate of t-PA, contains an l-amino acid at the P3 position and also occupies subsites on the primed side of the scissile bond, including the P3′ position. Because Le Bonniec and Esmon (20Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7371-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have suggested that residue 192 of the coagulation proteases may interact directly with the P3 and/or the P3′ residue of natural substrates, the effects of mutations at position 192 of t-PA might be expected to be more pronounced in indirect assays of plasminogen activation than in the direct assays described above. The results of indirect assays, in the absence of a fibrin co-factor, of wild type t-PA and the four mutated enzymes confirmed this expectation. Compared with the corresponding wild type enzyme, the catalytic efficiency toward plasminogen of the single-chain form of the variants was reduced by a factor of 2.4 (Q192M) or 5.2 (Q192E), and plasminogen activation by the two-chain form of the variants was reduced by a factor of 3.4 (Q192M) or 15 (Q192E) (Table II). For all four mutated enzymes, the observed decrease in catalytic efficiency resulted exclusively from a reduced kcat.K m values of all four variants were actually improved by factors of approximately 2–5.Table IIKinetic analysis of plasminogen activation by single- and two-chain variants of t-PAEnzymeFibrinkcatK mkcat/K mFibrin stimulation factors−1μmm−1s−1Two-chain formt-PA−0.20219.5 × 103t-PA/Q192M−0.031112.8 × 103t-PA/Q192E−0.003766.2 × 102t-PA+0.0540.00935.8 × 106610t-PA/Q192M+0.0490.014.9 × 1061,800t-PA/Q192E+0.0480.0143.4 × 1065,500Single-chain formt-PA/R15E−0.029319.4 × 102t-PA/R15E,Q192M−0.003284.0 × 102t-PA/R15E,Q192E−0.001161.8 × 102t-PA/R15E+0.0650.0125.4 × 1065,700t-PA/R15E,Q192M+0.0750.0116.8 × 10617,000t-PA/R15E,Q192E+0.0540.0252.2 × 10612,000 Open table in a new tab Mutation of Gln-192 of t-PA compromised plasminogen activation in the presence of the fibrin monomer DESAFIB significantly less than in the absence of a co-factor (Table II). For example, in the presence of fibrin, the activity of both the single- and two-chain forms of the Q192M variant varies by less than 30% from that of the corresponding wild type enzyme (Table II). Consistent with the results of both assays described above, the Q192E mutation had a larger effect in this assay than the Q192M mutation. However, even with the Q192E mutation, the observed effects were still modest. The catalytic activity of two-chain t-PA/Q192E was approximately 60% of two-chain t-PA, whereas the activity of single-chain t-PA/R15E,Q192E was approximately 40% of single-chain t-PA/R15E (Table II).In the presence of a fibrin co-factor, plasminogen activation is an efficient and complicated reaction that apparently proceeds following formation of a ternary complex involving multiple sites of interaction between enzyme, substrate, and co-factor (17Madison E.L.

Interactions between t-PA and fibrin in the ternary complex appear to be particularly complex; regions within all five structural domains of t-PA may participate in this interaction (6Madison E.L. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8 Suppl. 1: 221-236Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Keyt B.A. Paoni N.F. Bennett W.F. Cleland J.L. Craik C.S. Protein Engineering: Principles and Practice.

Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, the interaction between fibrin and plasminogen apparently involves multiple sites of contact between the two proteins and, in addition, a large conformational transition of plasminogen (42Lucas M.A. Fretto L.J. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4249-4256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Suenson E. Thorsen S. Biochem.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 495-515Google Scholar). By contrast, the importance and precise role of direct contacts between t-PA and plasminogen in the ternary complex, other than that of the catalytic triad of t-PA and the scissile bond of plasminogen, remain uncertain.In the absence of fibrin, the stringent specificity of t-PA for plasminogen must be dictated by direct contacts between the two proteins (17Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, consistent with our experimental observations, the loss of a single interaction between t-PA and plasminogen is expected to have a more significant effect on plasminogen activation in the absence rather than the presence of fibrin. However, because plasminogen activation by t-PA in vivo presumably occurs almost exclusively in the presence of a fibrin(ogen) co-factor, our observations suggest that Gln-192 of the enzyme does not contribute significantly to the substrate specificity of physiologically relevant catalysis by t-PA.Because the presence of a fibrin co-factor can overcome the modest catalytic defect of the t-PA variants in which Gln-192 was replaced by either methionine or glutamate, these mutated enzymes are stimulated by fibrin to a greater extent than wild type t-PA. The fibrin stimulation factor, defined as the ratio of the catalytic efficiencies toward plasminogen in the presence and absence of fibrin, is approximately 610 for two-chain, wild type t-PA (Table II). This stimulation factor increases to a value of 1800 or 5500 for two-chain t-PA/Q192M or t-PA/Q192E, respectively (Table II).Fibrin stimulation of two-chain t-PA is believed to result primarily from a catalytically productive juxtaposition of enzyme and substrate as both proteins bind the co-factor. Single-chain, wild type t-PA, with a fibrin stimulation factor of 5700 (Table II), is stimulated to a substantially greater degree than two-chain t-PA, reflecting the ability of fibrin to stimulate the single-chain enzyme not only through a templating mechanism but also by inducing nonproteolytic zymogen activation. Fibrin stimulation of single-chain t-PA is further enhanced by mutation of Gln-192. The catalytic efficiency of plasminogen activation by single-chain t-PA/R15E,Q192M or t-PA/R15E,Q192E is increased by fibrin by a factor of 17,000 or 12,000, respectively (Table II).Because the catalytic activity of t-PA/R15E,Q192M is stimulated by fibrin to a significantly greater extent than wild type t-PA, this enzyme would be expected to exhibit enhanced “clot selectivity”in vivo because of reduced activity in the circulation but full thrombolytic potency at sites of fibrin deposition. Whether enhanced clot selectivity would improve t-PA as a thrombolytic agent remains an extremely controversial issue that merits additional investigation. Moreover, the clot selectivity of t-PA may assume additional importance as variants with a prolonged circulating half-life are administered in high concentrations as a single bolus. The availability of variants of t-PA with enhanced fibrin specificity, such as t-PA/R15E,Q192E, should facilitate examination of the relationship, if any, between the clot selectivity and the potency and/or safety of the enzyme as a thrombolytic agent.Replacement of Gln-192 of t-PA with a methionine residue had little effect upon the interaction of t-PA and the serpin PAI-1, the primary physiological inhibitor of this enzyme (TableIII). As observed in activity assays toward both synthetic and natural substrates (Tables I and II), however, the Q192E mutation was more disruptive than the Q192M mutation. Nevertheless, enzymes containing the Q192E mutation were rapidly inhibited by PAI-1. The second order rate constant for inhibition of two-chain t-PA/Q192E by PAI-1 was reduced by a factor of approximately 4 compared with that of two-chain t-PA, and single-chain t-PA/R15E,Q192E was inhibited approximately 5-fold less rapidly than single-chain t-PA/R15E (Table III). These data are in striking contrast to those obtained by Rezaie and Esmon (21Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for similar variants of proteases that participate in the coagulation cascade. For example, the mutation Q192E decreased the affinity of factor Xa for tissue factor pathway inhibitor by a factor of 121. In addition, the mutation E192Q increased the second order rate constant for inhibition of thrombin by α1-proteinase inhibitor by a factor of greater than 700 (21Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, the E192Q mutation increased the second order rate constant for inhibition of activated protein C by α1-proteinase inhibitor by a factor of approximately 300 (22Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIIInhibition of wild type and variants of t-PA by PAI-1EnzymeSecond order rate constantm−1 s−1Two-chain formt-PA2 × 106t-PA/Q192M2 × 106t-PA/Q192E5 × 105Single-chain formt-PA/R15E1 × 106t-PA/R15E,Q192M1 × 106t-PA/R15E,Q192E2 × 105 Open table in a new tab The results of these studies suggest that, in contrast to the coagulation proteases, residue 192 does not contribute significantly to the substrate or inhibitor specificity of fibrinolytic proteases in physiologically relevant reactions. Consequently, subtle but clear distinctions appear to exist between the molecular determinants of specificity for the enzymes that participate in these two important proteolytic cascades. A detailed understanding of these distinct specificity determinants will provide new insights into the divergent evolution of coagulation and fibrinolytic proteases and may facilitate the rational design of new serine proteases with novel, highly stringent specificities. Appreciation that thrombotic disorders are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries sparked intense interest in the human fibrinolytic system, which normally provides a counterbalance to the blood coagulation cascade (1Collen D.
