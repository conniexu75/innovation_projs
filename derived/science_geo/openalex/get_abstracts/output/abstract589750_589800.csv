https://openalex.org/W2724943347,"Knowledge of the prevalence of ESBL enzymes among P. aeruginosa strains compared to the Enterobacteraiceae family is limited. The phenotypic tests recommended by EUCAST for the detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are not always suited for P. aeruginosa strains. This is mainly due to the presence of other families of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa isolates more often than in Enterobacteriaceae, production of natural AmpC cephalosporinase and its overexpression, and co-production of metallo-β-lactamases. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa isolated from patients from hospitals in Warsaw, to evaluate the ESBL production of these isolates using currently available phenotypic tests, their modifications, multiplex PCR and molecular typing of ESBL-positive isolates by PFGE. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected in 2000-2014 from four Warsaw hospitals. Based on the data obtained in this study, we suggest using three DDST methods with inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam and imipenem, to detect ESBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains. Depending on the appearance of the plates, we suggest a reduction in the distance between discs with antibiotics to 15 mm and the addition of boronic acid at 0.4 mg per disc. The analysed isolates carried genes encoding ESBL from the families VEB (69 isolates with VEB-9), GES (6 with GES-1, 1 GES-5, 5 GES-13 and 2 with GES-15), OXA-2 (12 with OXA-15, 1 OXA-141, 1 OXA-210, 1 OXA-543 and 1 with OXA-544) and OXA-10 (5 isolates with OXA-74 and one with OXA-142). The most important result of this study was the discovery of three new genes, blaGES-15, blaOXA-141 and blaOXA-142; their nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the NCBI GenBank. It is also very important to note that this is the first report on the epidemiological problem of VEB-9-producing bacterial strains, not only in Poland but also worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2726213598,"Noroviruses are a leading cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide. The norovirus genotype GII.4 is the most prevalent genotype in the human population and has caused six pandemics since 1995. A novel norovirus lineage containing the GII.P16 polymerase and pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 capsid was recently detected in Asia and Germany. We demonstrate that this lineage is also circulating within the UK and USA and has been circulating since October 2014 or earlier. While the lineage does not contain unique substitutions in the capsid, it does contain polymerase substitutions close to positions known to influence polymerase function and virus transmission. These polymerase substitutions are shared with a GII.P16-GII.2 virus that dominated outbreaks in Germany in Winter 2016. We suggest that the substitutions in the polymerase may have resulted in a more transmissible virus and the combination of this polymerase and the pandemic GII.4 capsid may result in a highly transmissible virus. Further surveillance efforts will be required to determine whether the GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney 2012 lineage increases in frequency over the coming months."

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various cellular events, their functions in SMC differentiation remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the lncRNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) suppresses TGF-β/Smad3 signaling in smooth muscle cell differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells. We found that forced expression of GAS5 blocked, but knockdown of GAS5 increased, the expression of SMC contractile proteins. Mechanistically, GAS5 competitively bound Smad3 protein via multiple RNA Smad–binding elements (rSBEs), which prevented Smad3 from binding to SBE DNA in TGF-β–responsive SMC gene promoters, resulting in suppression of SMC marker gene transcription and, consequently, in inhibition of TGF-β/Smad3-mediated SMC differentiation. Importantly, other lncRNAs or artificially synthesized RNA molecules that contained rSBEs also effectively inhibited TGF-β/Smad3 signaling, suggesting that lncRNA–rSBE may be a general mechanism used by cells to fine-tune Smad3 activity in both basal and TGF-β–stimulated states. Taken together, our results have uncovered an lncRNA-based mechanism that modulates TGF-β/Smad3 signaling during SMC differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2729848502,"Background This study explores the relationship between BMI and national-wealth and the cross-level interaction effect of national-wealth and individual household-wealth using multilevel analysis. Methods Data from the World Health Survey conducted in 2002–2004, across 70 low-, middle- and high-income countries was used. Participants aged 18 years and over were selected using multistage, stratified cluster sampling. BMI was used as outcome variable. The potential determinants of individual-level BMI were participants’ sex, age, marital-status, education, occupation, household-wealth and location(rural/urban) at the individual-level. The country-level factors used were average national income (GNI-PPP) and income inequality (Gini-index). A two-level random-intercepts and fixed-slopes model structure with individuals nested within countries was fitted, treating BMI as a continuous outcome. Results The weighted mean BMI and standard-error of the 206,266 people from 70-countries was 23.90 (4.84). All the low-income countries were below the 25.0 mean BMI level and most of the high-income countries were above. All wealthier quintiles of household-wealth had higher scores in BMI than lowest quintile. Each USD10000 increase in GNI-PPP was associated with a 0.4 unit increase in BMI. The Gini-index was not associated with BMI. All these variables explained 28.1% of country-level, 4.9% of individual-level and 7.7% of total variance in BMI. The cross-level interaction effect between GNI-PPP and household-wealth was significant. BMI increased as the GNI-PPP increased in first four quintiles of household-wealth. However, the BMI of the wealthiest people decreased as the GNI-PPP increased. Conclusion Both individual-level and country-level factors made an independent contribution to the BMI of the people. Household-wealth and national-income had significant interaction effects."
https://openalex.org/W2734029929,"Background Arsenic and cadmium are environmental pollutants, and although the evidence for adverse immune effects after prenatal arsenic and cadmium exposures is increasing, little is known about the underlying immunological mechanisms. Methods We investigated the relationship between prenatal arsenic and cadmium exposures and a variety of T cell subpopulations measured in cord blood for 63 participants in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Post-partum toenail concentrations of arsenic and cadmium were used as an estimate of maternal exposure during pregnancy. The characteristics of cord blood proportions of T lymphocytes and subpopulations (expression of markers for Th1, Th2, Th17, Th1Th17, induced and natural regulatory T cells and NKTs) are presented. Results In regression analyses, maternal arsenic exposure levels were inversely associated with cord blood T helper memory cells (-21%, 95% CI: -36%, -3%) and the association was found to be stronger in females. They were also inversely associated with activated T helper memory cells, particularly in males (-26%, 95% CI: -43%, -3%). Similarly, inverse associations were observed between cadmium exposure levels and activated T helper memory cells (-16%, 95% CI: -30%, -1%) and also for T helper memory cells in females (-20%, 95% CI: -35%, -3%). Conclusion The results suggest that prenatal exposures to relatively low levels of arsenic and cadmium may contribute to altered distribution of T cell populations at birth. These changes in theory, could have contributed to the previously reported immunosuppressive effects observed later in infancy/childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2729576061,"Background To evaluate the clinical outcomes 12 months after systemic administration of amoxicillin (AMX) and metronidazole (MET) adjunctive to subgingival debridement (SD) in patients with severe chronic periodontitis (sChP). Material and methods 102 patients with sChP were treated randomly as follows: SD within 2 consecutive days and placebo for 7 days (group A), SD+AMX+MET (both 500mg x3 times daily TID) for 3 days (group B), SD+AMX+MET (both 500mg x 3 TID) for 7 days (group C). At baseline, at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-treatment probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), furcation involvement, bleeding on probing (BOP), full-mouth plaque score (FMPS) were determined. The reduction in the number of sites with PD≥6mm was defined as main outcome variable. Results 75 patients completed the study. At 12 months, all three treatment groups showed statistically significant improvements (p<0.001) of mean PD, CAL, BOP and number of sites with PD≥6mm compared to baseline. Mean residual PD were statistically significantly lower and CAL gain statistically significantly greater in the two antibiotic groups as compared to placebo. While PD reductions (p = 0.012) and CAL gain (p = 0.017) were statistically significantly higher in group C compared to group A, only the 3-day AB group showed statistically significantly fewer sites with PD≥6mm at 12 m (p = 0.003). The reduction in the number of sites with PD≥6 mm (primary outcome) showed no statistical significant differences between the 3 treatment groups. However, in both antibiotic groups significantly more patients compared to the placebo group reached a low risk for disease progression at 12 months (≤4 sites with PD≥5mm). Conclusion At 12 months, both adjunctive antibiotic protocols resulted in statistically significantly greater clinical improvements compared to placebo."
https://openalex.org/W2731898189,"S-palmitoylation, the covalent attachment of 16-carbon palmitic acids to a cysteine residue via a thioester linkage, is an important reversible lipid modification that plays a regulatory role in a variety of physiological and biological processes. As the number of experimentally identified S-palmitoylated peptides increases, it is imperative to investigate substrate motifs to facilitate the study of protein S-palmitoylation. Based on 710 non-homologous S-palmitoylation sites obtained from published databases and the literature, we carried out a bioinformatics investigation of S-palmitoylation sites based on amino acid composition. Two Sample Logo indicates that positively charged and polar amino acids surrounding S-palmitoylated sites may be associated with the substrate site specificity of protein S-palmitoylation. Additionally, maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) was applied to explore the motif signatures of S-palmitoylation sites by categorizing a large-scale dataset into subgroups with statistically significant conservation of amino acids. Single features such as amino acid composition (AAC), amino acid pair composition (AAPC), position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), position weight matrix (PWM), amino acid substitution matrix (BLOSUM62), and accessible surface area (ASA) were considered, along with the effectiveness of incorporating MDD-identified substrate motifs into a two-layered prediction model. Evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that a hybrid of AAC and PSSM performs best at discriminating between S-palmitoylation and non-S-palmitoylation sites, according to the support vector machine (SVM). The two-layered SVM model integrating MDD-identified substrate motifs performed well, with a sensitivity of 0.79, specificity of 0.80, accuracy of 0.80, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) value of 0.45. Using an independent testing dataset (613 S-palmitoylated and 5412 non-S-palmitoylated sites) obtained from the literature, we demonstrated that the two-layered SVM model could outperform other prediction tools, yielding a balanced sensitivity and specificity of 0.690 and 0.694, respectively. This two-layered SVM model has been implemented as a web-based system (MDD-Palm), which is now freely available at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MDDPalm/."
https://openalex.org/W2727655534,"The oldest-known air-breathing land animal is the millipede Pneumodesmus newmani, found in the Cowie Harbour Fish Bed at Stonehaven, Scotland. Here we report the youngest, most concordant 238U-206Pb zircon age from ash below the fish bed of 413.7±4.4 Ma (±2σ), whereas the youngest age from a tuffaceous sandstone above the fish bed is statistically indistinguishable at 414.3±7.1 Ma. The Cowie Harbour Fish Bed thus appears to be lowermost Devonian (Lochkovian), contrary to the previously accepted mid-Silurian age based on palynomorphs from adjacent exposures. This has implications for the evolutionary timetable of land colonization, as the Cowie ages overlap late Lochkovian zircon ages reported elsewhere for andesite below the nearby (~50 mi) Rhynie Chert, which has more advanced terrestrial biota. The results postdate the possible late Silurian Ludford Lane locality in Shropshire, England. Pneumodesmus newmani is thus not the earliest air-breathing land animal, unless the Ludford Lane locality is younger than presently assigned."
https://openalex.org/W2728747845,"The aim of this study was to explore the reasons behind medicine shortages from the perspective of pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical wholesalers in Finland. The study took the form of semi-structured interviews. Forty-one pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical wholesalers were invited to participate in the study. The pharmaceutical companies were the member organizations of Pharma Industry Finland (PIF) (N = 30) and the Finnish Generic Pharmaceutical Association (FGPA) (N = 7). One company which is a central player in the pharmaceutical market in Finland but does not belong to PIF or FGPA was also invited. The pharmaceutical wholesalers were those with a nationwide distribution network (N = 3). A total of 30 interviews were conducted between March and June 2016. The data were subjected to qualitative thematic analysis. The most common reasons behind medicine shortages in Finland were the small size of the pharmaceutical market (29/30), sudden or fluctuating demand (28/30), small stock sizes (25/30), long delivery time (23/30) and a long or complex production chain (23/30). The reasons for the medicine shortages were supply-related more often than demand-related. However, the reasons were often complex and there was more than one reason behind a shortage. Supply-related reasons behind shortages commonly interfaced with the country-specific characteristics of Finland, whereas demand-related reasons were commonly associated with the predictability and attractiveness of the market. Some reasons, such as raw material shortages, were considered global and thus had similar effects on other countries."
https://openalex.org/W2726710120,"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is a commercially important crop, vulnerable to fungal disease red rot caused by Colletotrichum falcatum Went. The pathogen attacks sucrose accumulating parenchyma cells of cane stalk leading to severe losses in cane yield and sugar recovery. We report development of red rot resistant transgenic sugarcane through expression of β-1,3-glucanase gene from Trichoderma spp. The transgene integration and its expression were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in first clonal generation raised from T0 plants revealing up to 4.4-fold higher expression, in comparison to non-transgenic sugarcane. Bioassay of transgenic plants with two virulent C. falcatum pathotypes, Cf 08 and Cf 09 causing red rot disease demonstrated that some plants were resistant to Cf 08 and moderately resistant to Cf 09. The electron micrographs of sucrose storing stalk parenchyma cells from these plants displayed characteristic sucrose-filled cells inhibiting Cf 08 hyphae and lysis of Cf 09 hyphae; in contrast, the cells of susceptible plants were sucrose depleted and prone to both the pathotypes. The transgene expression was up-regulated (up to 2.0-fold in leaves and 5.0-fold in roots) after infection, as compared to before infection in resistant plants. The transgene was successfully transmitted to second clonal generation raised from resistant transgenic plants. β-1,3-glucanase protein structural model revealed that active sites Glutamate 628 and Aspartate 569 of the catalytic domain acted as proton donor and nucleophile having role in cleaving β-1,3-glycosidic bonds and pathogen hyphal lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2729211906,"The past decades have been characterized by a growing number of climatic anomalies. As these anomalies tend to occur suddenly and unexpectedly, it is often difficult to procure empirical evidence of their effects on natural populations. We analysed how the recent sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the northeastern Pacific Ocean affects body condition, nutritional status, and immune competence of California sea lion pups. We found that pup body condition and blood glucose levels of the pups were lower during high SST events, although other biomarkers of malnutrition remained unchanged, suggesting that pups were experiencing early stages of starvation. Glucose-dependent immune responses were affected by the SST anomaly; specifically, pups born during high SST events had lower serum concentrations of IgG and IgA, and were unable to respond to an immune challenge. This means that not only were pups that were born during the SST anomaly less able to synthesize protective antibodies; they were also limited in their ability to respond rapidly to nonspecific immune challenges. Our study provides empirical evidence that atypical climatic conditions can limit energetic reserves and compromise physiological responses that are essential for the survival of a marine top predator."
https://openalex.org/W2732331585,"Nitric oxide (NO) modulates many physiological events through production of cGMP from its receptor, the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC1). NO also appears to function in a cGMP-independent manner, via S-nitrosation (SNO), a redox-based modification of cysteine thiols. Previously, we have shown that S-nitrosated GC1 (SNO-GC1) is desensitized to NO stimulation following prolonged NO exposure or under oxidative/nitrosative stress. In animal models of nitrate tolerance and angiotensin II-induced hypertension, decreased vasodilation in response to NO correlates with GC1 thiol oxidation, but the physiological mechanism that resensitizes GC1 to NO and restores basal activity is unknown. Because GC1 interacts with the oxidoreductase protein-disulfide isomerase, we hypothesized that thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), a cytosolic oxidoreductase, could be involved in restoring GC1 basal activity and NO sensitivity because the Trx/thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) system maintains thiol redox homeostasis. Here, by manipulating activity and levels of the Trx1/TrxR system and by using a Trx1-Trap assay, we demonstrate that Trx1 modulates cGMP synthesis through an association between Trx1 and GC1 via a mixed disulfide. A proximity ligation assay confirmed the endogenous Trx1-GC1 complex in cells. Mutational analysis suggested that Cys609 in GC1 is involved in the Trx1-GC1 association and modulation of GC1 activity. Functionally, we established that Trx1 protects GC1 from S-nitrosocysteine-induced desensitization. A computational model of Trx1-GC1 interaction illustrates a possible mechanism for Trx1 to maintain basal GC1 activity and prevent/rescue GC1 desensitization to NO. The etiology of some oxidative vascular diseases may very well be explained by the dysfunction of the Trx1-GC1 association."
https://openalex.org/W2733655365,"Since 2012, the WHO recommends Option B+ for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. This approach entails the initiation of lifelong antiretroviral therapy in all HIV-positive pregnant women, also implying protection during breastfeeding for 12 months or longer. Research on long-term adherence to Option B+ throughout breastfeeding is scarce to date. Therefore, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study in Fort Portal, Western Uganda, to assess adherence to Option B+ until 18 months postpartum. In 2013, we recruited 67 HIV-positive, Option B+ enrolled women six weeks after giving birth and scheduled them for follow-up study visits after six, twelve and 18 months. Two adherence measures, self-reported drug intake and amount of drug refill visits, were combined to define adherence, and were assessed together with feeding information at all study visits. At six months postpartum, 51% of the enrolled women were considered to be adherent. Until twelve and 18 months postpartum, adherence for the respective follow-up interval decreased to 19% and 20.5% respectively. No woman was completely adherent until 18 months. At the same time, 76.5% of the women breastfed for ≥12 months. Drug adherence was associated with younger age (p<0.01), lower travel costs (p = 0.02), and lower number of previous deliveries (p = 0.04). Long-term adherence to Option B+ seems to be challenging. Considering that in our cohort, prolonged breastfeeding until ≥12 months was widely applied while postpartum adherence until the end of breastfeeding was poor, a potential risk of postpartum vertical transmission needs to be taken seriously into account for Option B+ implementation."

In this study, we investigated human adipose stem cells (hASCs) for osteogenic, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity effects of an innovative collagen/hydroxylapatite hybrid scaffold. In hASCs that were grown on this scaffold, osteogenic genes were analyzed for their expression profiles, together with adhesion and extracellular matrix genes. In hASC integrins, basement membrane constituents and collagens were up-regulated, together with cell proliferation. In addition, expression of osteopontin and activated focal adhesion kinase was studied at the protein level.

https://openalex.org/W2724971793,"Hair sheep of Caribbean origin have become an important part of the U.S. sheep industry. Their lack of wool eliminates a number of health concerns and drastically reduces the cost of production. More importantly, Caribbean hair sheep demonstrate robust production performance even in the presence of drug-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes, a rising concern to the industry. Despite the growing importance of hair sheep in the Americas their genetic origins have remained speculative. Prior to this report no genetic studies were able to identify a unique geographical origin of hair sheep in the New World. Our study clarifies the African and European ancestry of Caribbean hair sheep. Whole-genome structural analysis was conducted on four established breeds of hair sheep from the Caribbean region. Using breeds representing Africa and Europe we establish an objective measure indicating Caribbean hair sheep are derived from Iberian and West African origins. Caribbean hair sheep result from West African introgression into established ecotypes of Iberian descent. Genotypes from 47,750 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 290 animals were used to characterize the population structure of the St. Croix, Barbados Blackbelly, Morada Nova, and Santa Ines. Principal components, admixture, and phylogenetic analyses results correlate with historical patterns of colonization and trade. These patterns support co-migration of these sheep with humans."
https://openalex.org/W2728801906,"The pathophysiology of myocardial injury that results from cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) is incompletely understood. Experimental evidence from murine models indicates that innate immune mechanisms including complement activation via the classical and lectin pathways are crucial. Whether factor B (fB), a component of the alternative complement pathway required for amplification of complement cascade activation, participates in the pathophysiology of myocardial I/R injury has not been addressed. We induced regional myocardial I/R injury by transient coronary ligation in WT C57BL/6 mice, a manipulation that resulted in marked myocardial necrosis associated with activation of fB protein and myocardial deposition of C3 activation products. In contrast, in fB-/- mice, the same procedure resulted in significantly reduced myocardial necrosis (% ventricular tissue necrotic; fB-/- mice, 20 ± 4%; WT mice, 45 ± 3%; P < 0.05) and diminished deposition of C3 activation products in the myocardial tissue (fB-/- mice, 0 ± 0%; WT mice, 31 ± 6%; P<0.05). Reconstitution of fB-/- mice with WT serum followed by cardiac I/R restored the myocardial necrosis and activated C3 deposition in the myocardium. In translational human studies we measured levels of activated fB (Bb) in intracoronary blood samples obtained during cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery before and after aortic cross clamping (AXCL), during which global heart ischemia was induced. Intracoronary Bb increased immediately after AXCL, and the levels were directly correlated with peripheral blood levels of cardiac troponin I, an established biomarker of myocardial necrosis (Spearman coefficient = 0.465, P < 0.01). Taken together, our results support the conclusion that circulating fB is a crucial pathophysiological amplifier of I/R-induced, complement-dependent myocardial necrosis and identify fB as a potential therapeutic target for prevention of human myocardial I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2731873846,"The cerebellar system helps modulate and fine-tune motor action. Purkinje cells (PCs) provide the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, therefore, any cerebellar involvement in motor activity must be driven by changes in PC firing rates. Several different cell types influence PC activity including excitatory input from parallel fibers and inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). Similar to PCs, MLI activity is driven by parallel fibers, therefore, MLIs provide feed-forward inhibition onto PCs. To aid in the experimental assessment of how molecular layer inhibition contributes to cerebellar function and motor behavior, we characterized a new knock-in mouse line with Cre recombinase expression under control of endogenous c-kit transcriptional machinery. Using these engineered c-Kit mice, we were able to obtain high levels of conditional MLI transduction in adult mice using Cre-dependent viral vectors without any PC or granule cell labeling. We then used the mouse line to target MLIs for activity perturbation in vitro using opto- and chemogenetics."

Analysis by HPLC-DAD identified two organic dyestuffs, Rubia tinctorum L. and indigotin, from a plant source (probably Isatis tinctoria L.). They are among the earliest plants known in the dyeing craft and cultivated primarily for this purpose. This study provides the earliest evidence of textiles dyed utilizing a chemical dyeing process based on an industrial dyeing plant from the Levant. Moreover, our results shed new light on the society operating the copper mines at the time, suggesting the existence of an elite that was interested in these high quality textiles and invested efforts in procuring them by long-distance trade."
https://openalex.org/W2729905310,"With the surge of interest in metabolism and the appreciation of its diverse roles in numerous biomedical contexts, the number of metabolomics studies using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approaches has increased dramatically in recent years. However, variation that occurs independently of biological signal and noise (i.e. batch effects) in metabolomics data can be substantial. Standard protocols for data normalization that allow for cross-study comparisons are lacking. Here, we investigate a number of algorithms for batch effect correction and differential abundance analysis, and compare their performance. We show that linear mixed effects models, which account for latent (i.e. not directly measurable) factors, produce satisfactory results in the presence of batch effects without the need for internal controls or prior knowledge about the nature and sources of unwanted variation in metabolomics data. We further introduce an algorithm—RRmix—within the family of latent factor models and illustrate its suitability for differential abundance analysis in the presence of strong batch effects. Together this analysis provides a framework for systematically standardizing metabolomics data."

https://openalex.org/W2730068799,"Public reporting of measures of hospital performance is an important component of quality improvement efforts in many countries. However, it can be challenging to provide an overall characterization of hospital performance because there are many measures of quality. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports over 100 measures that describe various domains of hospital quality, such as outcomes, the patient experience and whether established processes of care are followed. Although individual quality measures provide important insight, it is challenging to understand hospital performance as characterized by multiple quality measures. Accordingly, we developed a novel approach for characterizing hospital performance that highlights the similarities and differences between hospitals and identifies common patterns of hospital performance. Specifically, we built a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm and applied it to the publicly-available quality measures for 1,614 U.S. hospitals to graphically and quantitatively characterize hospital performance. In the resulting visualization, the varying density of hospitals demonstrates that there are key clusters of hospitals that share specific performance profiles, while there are other performance profiles that are rare. Several popular hospital rating systems aggregate some of the quality measures included in our study to produce a composite score; however, hospitals that were top-ranked by such systems were scattered across our visualization, indicating that these top-ranked hospitals actually excel in many different ways. Our application of a novel graph analytics method to data describing U.S. hospitals revealed nuanced differences in performance that are obscured in existing hospital rating systems."
https://openalex.org/W2732500098,"Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene polymorphisms have been strongly associated with psoriasis susceptibility. In this study, we investigate how TNFAIP3, also known as A20, may regulate psoriasis susceptibility. We found that haplo-insufficient A20+/- mice develop severe toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced skin inflammation compared to wild type mice owing to amplified production of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23. Examination of TNFAIP3 mRNA expression in skin biopsies from patients with psoriasis revealed reduced expression in both involved and uninvolved skin. Our results demonstrate the clinical importance of reduced dermal expression of A20 in psoriasis and suggest that A20 restriction of the IL-23/17 axis protects against psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2733761921,"Fish stocks can be defined by differences in their distribution, life history, and genetics. Managing fish based on stock structure is integral to successful management of a species because fishing may affect stocks disproportionately. Genetic and environmental differences can affect the shape and growth of otoliths and these differences may be indicative of stock structure. To investigate the potential for speciation or stock structure in giant grenadier, Albatrossia pectoralis, we quantified the shape of female giant grenadier otoliths and compared body growth rates for fish with three otolith shapes; shape types were classified visually by an experienced giant grenadier age reader, and were not defined by known distribution or life history differences. We found extreme variation in otolith shape among individuals; however, the shapes were a gradation and not clearly defined into three groups. The two more extreme shapes, visually defined as ""hatchet"" and ""comb"", were discernable based on principal component analyses of elliptical Fourier descriptors, and the ""mixed"" shape overlapped both of the extreme shapes. Fish with hatchet-shaped otoliths grew faster than fish with comb-shaped otoliths. A genetic test (cytochrome c oxidase 1 used by the Fish Barcode of Life Initiative) showed almost no variability among samples, indicating that the samples were all from one species. The lack of young specimens makes it difficult to link otolith shape and growth difference to life history. In addition, shape could not be correlated with adult movement patterns because giant grenadiers experience 100% mortality after capture and, therefore, cannot be tagged and released. Despite these limitations, the link between body growth and otolith shape indicates measurable differences that deserve more study."
https://openalex.org/W2730270303,"To evaluate choroidal changes in eyes with acute anterior uveitis associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27.In 44 patients with first-onset, unilateral, acute-onset (<1 week) anterior uveitis for which diagnostic work-ups revealed positivity only for HLA-B27, wide-field three-dimensional volumetric raster scan using swept-source optical coherence tomography was performed for both eyes. Choroidal thickness was measured by automated segmentation and thickness mapping and compared between eyes with uveitis and the fellow eyes at baseline. Choroidal thickness was compared before and after topical and/or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Relative choroidal thickening was defined as the choroidal thickness of the uveitic eye minus that of the corresponding eye and correlated with the degree of intraocular inflammation.Compared to the fellow eyes, eyes with acute anterior uveitis showed significant choroidal thickening on the subfoveal and parafoveal areas at baseline (all P <0.05). En face choroidal imaging showed dilation of large choroidal vessels on the macula. Relative choroidal thickening significantly correlated with the degree of anterior chamber inflammation at baseline (correlation coefficient = 0.341, P = 0.023). After treating inflammation, the choroid on the macula thinned significantly (from 262.1 ± 66.5 to 239.5 ± 61.0 μm in the subfoveal choroid, P<0.001).Eyes with HLA-B27-associated anterior uveitis showed significant choroidal thickening at acute phase that subsequently decreased after treatment, indicating subclinical choroidal inflammation in the eyes. Choroidal thickness might indicate disease activity in acute anterior uveitis associated with HLA-B27."
https://openalex.org/W2725749459,"In decapod crustaceans, the antennal gland (AnG) is a major primary source of externally secreted biomolecules, and some may act as pheromones that play a major role in aquatic animal communication. In aquatic crustaceans, sex pheromones regulate reproductive behaviours, yet they remain largely unidentified besides the N-acetylglucosamine-1,5-lactone (NAGL) that stimulates male to female attraction. In this study, we used an AnG transcriptome of the female giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) to predict the secretion of 226 proteins, including the most abundantly expressed transcripts encoding the Spaetzle protein, a serine protease inhibitor, and an arthropodial cuticle protein AMP 8.1. A quantitative proteome analysis of the female AnG at intermolt, premolt and postmolt, identified numerous proteins of different abundances, such as the hemocyanin subunit 1 that is most abundant at intermolt. We also show that hemocyanin subunit 1 is present within water surrounding females. Of those metabolites identified, we demonstrate that the NAGL and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) can bind with high affinity to hemocyanin subunit 1. In summary, this study has revealed components of the female giant freshwater prawn AnG that are released and contribute to further research towards understanding crustacean conspecific signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2733271439,"Bacteria exposed to host serum are subject to the antibacterial effects to the complement system. However, pathogenic microorganisms have evolved mechanisms of evading this immune attack. We have previously demonstrated that at least two R. conorii antigens, RC1281/Adr1 and OmpB β-peptide, contribute to the evasion of complement-mediated killing by binding the complement regulatory proteins vitronectin and factor H. RC1282/Adr2, a protein related to Adr1, is predicted to share similar structural features, suggesting that this protein may also contribute to evasion of complement-mediated killing. Interestingly, the R. prowazekii Adr1 and Adr2(RP828) proteins were originally found to interact with host cell surface proteins, suggesting their putative roles as adhesins in this pathogenic rickettsial species. In this study, we expressed both R. conorii and R. prowazekii Adr2 on the surface of a non-adherent, serum-sensitive strain of E. coli to examine the potential role of this protein to mediate evasion of complement-mediated killing and adherence to host cells. We demonstrate that, similar to R. conorii Adr1, R. conorii and R. prowazekii Adr2 are sufficient to mediate serum resistance and to promote interaction with the host complement regulator vitronectin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of Adr2 in a non-adherent strain of E. coli is insufficient to mediate adherence to cultured mammalian endothelial cells. Together, our data demonstrate that the R. conorii and R. prowazekii Adr2 protein does not participate in the interactions with mammalian cells, but rather, participates in the evasion of killing by complement."
https://openalex.org/W2728761227,"Aposematism is an evolved, cross-species association between a preys' unprofitability and the presence of conspicuous signals. Avian predators have been widely employed to understand the evolution of these warning signals However, insect predators are abundant, diverse, and highly visual foragers that have been shown to be capable of learned aversion. Therefore, it is likely that their behaviour also shapes the nature of anti-predator traits. In this study, we evaluated the rates of attack of a community (13 species) of mature adult dragonflies (Odonata) on artificial prey of varying size (2.5-31 mm lengthwise) and colour pattern (black, black/yellow striped). The relative attack rates of dragonflies on prey increased as prey size decreased, but there was no evidence that the attack rates by dragonflies were affected by prey colour pattern and no evidence for an interaction between colour pattern and size. To investigate prey selection by specific predator species under field conditions, we compared the time to attack distributions of black-painted prey presented to two common dragonflies: Leucorrhinia intacta and the larger, Libellula pulchella. We found that the two dragonfly species, as well as the two sexes, had different foraging responses. L. pulchella was more likely to attack larger prey, and females of both species more likely to attack prey than males. Collectively, our results indicate that dragonflies are highly size selective. However, while the nature of this selectivity varies among dragonfly species, there is little evidence that classic black/yellow warning signals deter attack by these aerial invertebrate predators."
https://openalex.org/W2683232119,"Camu-camu [Myrciaria dubia (Kunth) McVaugh] is currently an important and promising fruit species grown in the Peruvian Amazon, as well as in Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia. The species is valued for its high content of fruit-based vitamin C. Large plantations have been established only in the last two decades, and a substantial part of the production is still obtained by collecting fruits from the wild. Domestication of the species is at an early stage; most farmers cultivate the plants without any breeding, or only through a simple mass selection process. The main objective of the study was to characterize morphological and genetic variation within and among cultivated and natural populations of camu-camu in the Peruvian Amazon. In total, we sampled 13 populations: ten wild in the Iquitos region, and three cultivated in the Pucallpa region in the Peruvian Amazon. To assess the genetic diversity using seven microsatellite loci, we analyzed samples from ten individual trees per each population (n = 126). Morphological data was collected from five trees from each population (n = 65). The analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences for most of the morphological descriptors. For wild and cultivated populations, the observed heterozygosity was 0.347 and 0.404 (expected 0.516 and 0.506), and the fixation index was 0.328 and 0.200, respectively. Wild populations could be divided into two groups according to the UPGMA and STRUCTURE analysis. In cultivated populations, their approximate origin was determined. Our findings indicate a high genetic diversity among the populations, but also a high degree of inbreeding within the populations. This can be explained by either the isolation of these populations from each other or the low number of individuals in some populations. This high level of genetic diversity can be explored for the selection of superior individuals for further breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2725164026,"In this paper, an optimal longitudinal slip ratio system for real-time identification of electric vehicle (EV) with motored wheels is proposed based on the adhesion between tire and road surface. First and foremost, the optimal longitudinal slip rate torque control can be identified in real time by calculating the derivative and slip rate of the adhesion coefficient. Secondly, the vehicle speed estimation method is also brought. Thirdly, an ideal vehicle simulation model is proposed to verify the algorithm with simulation, and we find that the slip ratio corresponds to the detection of the adhesion limit in real time. Finally, the proposed strategy is applied to traction control system (TCS). The results showed that the method can effectively identify the state of wheel and calculate the optimal slip ratio without wheel speed sensor; in the meantime, it can improve the accelerated stability of electric vehicle with traction control system (TCS)."
https://openalex.org/W2727650206,"Objective This trial was conducted to evaluate the ability of pazopanib to overcome therapeutic 131I resistance. Materials, methods and patients This phase 1 trial assesses the combination of pazopanib and escalating doses of radioiodine (131I) in patients with recurrent or metastatic thyroid cancer that are borderline or relatively iodine refractory. Radioiodine uptake scans were assessed post therapy and compared to historical pre-treatment scans. Patients underwent FDG PET/CT before and after the initial pazopanib treatment to identify the impact of pazopanib on the cancer prior to 131I therapy. Results A dose limiting toxicity (cardiac arrhythmia and grade 3 fatigue) in the first patient in the first cohort prompted expansion to a total of 6 patients. Additional grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity and low accrual in the expanded cohort led to the decision not to pursue further study of the regimen. In patients with measurable disease 4/5 (80%) achieved stable disease. Median progression free survival was 6.7 months. At 3 years of follow up, one patient died due to progressive disease, two are being treated with systemic therapy and 3 continue without requiring subsequent therapy at 15, 27 and 35 months from the last dose of pazopanib. There was no convincing impact of pazopanib on iodine uptake in scans performed pre- and post-therapy compared to scans from historical 131I treatments without pazopanib. Conclusion Despite a suggestion of therapeutic efficacy, combined pazopanib and 131I resulted in increased toxicity. There was no convincing evidence that the administration of pazopanib improved iodine uptake or retention. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01413113"

DTI metrics were obtained from selected WMT using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method. This was followed by binary logistic regression to investigate the clinical variables that could act as confounding elements on the outcomes. The TBSS analysis was then repeated, but this time including all significant predictor variables from the regression analysis as TBSS covariates.The mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) and to a lesser extent radial diffusivity (RD) values of the projection fibers and commissural bundles were significantly different in fallers (p < 0.05) compared to non-fallers. However, the final logistic regression model obtained showed that only functional reach, white matter lesion volume, hypertension and orthostatic hypotension demonstrated statistical significant differences between fallers and non-fallers. No significant differences were found in the DTI metrics when taking into account age and the four variables as covariates in the repeated analysis.This DTI study of 85 subjects, do not support DTI metrics as a singular factor that contributes independently to the fall outcomes.

In previous studies, we achieved a one-step biosynthesis of KIC from l-leucine, using an Escherichia coli whole-cell biocatalyst expressing an l-amino acid deaminase (l-AAD) from Proteus vulgaris. Herein, we report the fine-tuning of l-AAD gene expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) at the transcriptional and translational levels to improve the KIC titer. By optimizing the plasmid origin with different copy numbers, modulating messenger RNA structure downstream of the initiation codon, and designing the sequences at the ribosome binding site, we increased biocatalyst activity to 31.77%, 24.89%, and 30.20%, respectively, above that achieved with BL21/pet28a-lad. The highest KIC titers reached 76.47 g·L-1, 80.29 g·L-1, and 81.41 g·L-1, respectively. Additionally, the integration of these three engineering strategies achieved an even higher KIC production of 86.55 g·L-1 and a higher l-leucine conversion rate of 94.25%.

https://openalex.org/W2728957964,"The development of new reference evapotranspiration (ETo) methods hold significant promise for improving our quantitative understanding of climatic impacts on water loss from the land to the atmosphere. To address the challenge of estimating ETo in tropical and subtropical regions where direct measurements are scarce we tested a new method based on geographical patterns of extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) and atmospheric water potential (Ψair). Our approach consisted of generating daily estimates of ETo across several climate zones in Brazil-as a model system-which we compared with standard EToPM (Penman-Monteith) estimates. In contrast with EToPM, the simplified method (EToMJS) relies solely on Ψair calculated from widely available air temperature (oC) and relative humidity (%) data, which combined with Ra data resulted in reliable estimates of equivalent evaporation (Ee) and ETo. We used regression analyses of Ψair vs EToPM and Ee vs EToPM to calibrate the EToMJS(Ψair) and EToMJS estimates from 2004 to 2014 and between seasons and climatic zone. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the new method based on the coefficient of determination (R2) and correlation (R), index of agreement ""d"", mean absolute error (MAE) and mean reason (MR). This evaluation confirmed the suitability of the EToMJS method for application in tropical and subtropical regions, where the climatic information needed for the standard EToPM calculation is absent."

Method of study Stathmin-1 (STMN1), p53, and tristetraprolin (TTP) expression in paraffin-embedded villus tissue was determined using immunohistochemistry. HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with doxorubicin to activate p53; STMN1 and TTP levels were detected by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR and western blotting. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to investigate STMN1 expression after TTP overexpression or knockdown in HTR-8 cells. Results STMN1 was downregulated and p53 was upregulated in the villus tissue from patients with RSA. Doxorubicin decreased STMN1 expression but enhanced TTP expression in HTR-8 cells. In vitro, TTP overexpression inhibited STMN1 production; TTP knockdown promoted it. TTP downregulated STMN1 expression in trophoblasts by directly binding its 3ʹ untranslated region. Conclusions TTP modulates trophoblast function and interacts with STMN1 and p53, and is related to pregnancy outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2733837379,"Comparative functional genomic studies require the proper identification of gene orthologs to properly exploit animal biomedical research models. To identify gene orthologs, comprehensive, conserved gene synteny analyses are necessary to unwind gene histories that are convoluted by two rounds of early vertebrate genome duplication, and in the case of the teleosts, a third round, the teleost genome duplication (TGD). Recently, the genome of the spotted gar, a holostean outgroup to the teleosts that did not undergo this third genome duplication, was sequenced and applied as an orthology bridge to facilitate the identification of teleost orthologs to human genes and to enhance the power of teleosts as biomedical models. In this study, we apply the spotted gar orthology bridge to help describe the gene history of the vertebrate TNFAIP8 family. Members of the TNFAIP8 gene family have been linked to regulation of immune function and homeostasis and the development of multiple cancer types. Through a conserved gene synteny analysis, we identified zebrafish orthologs to human TNFAIP8L1 and TNFAIP8L3 genes and two co-orthologs to human TNFAIP8L2, but failed to identify an ortholog to human TNFAIP8. Through the application of the orthology bridge, we determined that teleost orthologs to human TNFAIP8 genes were likely lost in a genome inversion event after their divergence from their common ancestor with spotted gar. These findings demonstrate the value of this enhanced approach to gene history analysis and support the development of teleost models to study complex questions related to an array of biomedical issues, including immunity and cancer."

VEGF-blockage was used as an anti-angiogenic treatment, while normoxia- and hypoxia-conditioned media from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells was used as an angiogenic-inducer in this model. Iris vasculature was determined in vivo by noninvasive methods. Iris blood vessels were stained for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and vascular sprouts were counted as markers of angiogenesis. Expression of angiogenic and inflammatory factors in the puncture-induced model were determined by qPCR and western blot.Punctures led to increased neovascularization and sprouting of the iris. qPCR and protein analysis showed an increase of angiogenic factors, particularly in the plasminogen-activating receptor and inflammatory systems. VEGF-blockage partly reduced iris neovascularization, and treatment with hypoxia-conditioned RPE medium led to a statistically significant increase in iris neovascularization.This study presents the first evidence of a puncture-induced iris angiogenesis model in the mouse. In a broader context, this novel in vivo model of neovascularization has the potential for noninvasive evaluation of angiogenesis modulating substances."
https://openalex.org/W2727893020,"Peer review is important to the scientific process. However, the present system has been criticised and accused of bias, lack of transparency, failure to detect significant breakthrough and error. At the British Journal of Surgery (BJS), after surveying authors' and reviewers' opinions on peer review, we piloted an open online forum with the aim of improving the peer review process.In December 2014, a web-based survey assessing attitudes towards open online review was sent to reviewers with a BJS account in Scholar One. From April to June 2015, authors were invited to allow their manuscripts to undergo online peer review in addition to the standard peer review process. The quality of each review was evaluated by editors and editorial assistants using a validated instrument based on a Likert scale.The survey was sent to 6635 reviewers. In all, 1454 (21.9%) responded. Support for online peer review was strong, with only 10% stating that they would not subject their manuscripts to online peer review. The most prevalent concern was about intellectual property, being highlighted in 118 of 284 comments (41.5%). Out of 265 eligible manuscripts, 110 were included in the online peer review trial. Around 7000 potential reviewers were invited to review each manuscript. In all, 44 of 110 manuscripts (40%) received 100 reviews from 59 reviewers, alongside 115 conventional reviews. The quality of the open forum reviews was lower than for conventional reviews (2.13 (± 0.75) versus 2.84 (± 0.71), P<0.001).Open online peer review is feasible in this setting, but it attracts few reviews, of lower quality than conventional peer reviews."

The expression, tissue localization, regulation, and function of MCT14 are unknown. In mouse MCT14 mRNA abundance is highest in kidney. Using a newly developed and validated antibody, MCT14 was localized to the luminal membrane of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle colocalizing in the same cells with uromodulin and NKCC2. MCT14 mRNA and protein was found to be highly regulated by dietary phosphate intake in mice being increased by high dietary phosphate intake at both mRNA and protein level. In order to identify the transport substrate(s), we expressed MCT14 in Xenopus laevis oocytes where MCT14 was integrated into the plasma membrane. However, no transport was discovered for the classic substrates of the SLC16 family nor for phosphate. In summary, MCT14 is an orphan transporter regulated by phosphate and highly enriched in kidney localizing to the luminal membrane of one specific nephron segment."

Infection rates with Chlamydia trachomatis are higher in new arrivals to a community and in travelers who leave for extended periods, suggesting they are sources of re-infection. This community-randomized, clinical trial was designed to determine if a surveillance program that targeted newcomers and travelers, identified weekly, would result in more communities achieving levels of infection of ≤1%.52 communities were randomly allocated 1:1 to the control (annual MDA alone if warranted) or intervention arm (annual MDA if warranted, plus a surveillance program to identify and treat newcomers and travelers). In each community, surveys were completed every six months on a random sample of 100 children ages 1-9 years for trachoma and infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of communities in the intervention arm, compared to the control arm, which had a prevalence of infection at ≤1% by 24 months. Registered: clinicaltrials.gov(NCT01767506).Intervention communities experienced an average of 110 surveillance events per month.

The myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 acts as a main adaptor molecule for the signaling cascades initiated from Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R). MyD88 has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis in many inflammation-associated cancer models. In this study, we sought to better define the role of MyD88 in neoplastic cells using a murine melanoma model. Herein, we have demonstrated that MyD88 expression is required to maintain the angiogenic switch that supports B16 melanoma growth. By knocking down MyD88 we reduced TLR-mediated NF-κB activation with no evident effects over cell proliferation and survival. In addition, MyD88 downregulation was associated with a decrease of HIF1α levels and its target gene VEGF, in correlation with an impaired capability to induce capillary sprouting and tube formation of endothelial cells. Melanomas developed from cells lacking MyD88 showed an enhanced secretion of chemoattractant ligands such as CCL2, CXCL10 and CXCL1 and have an improved infiltration of macrophages to the tumor site. Our results imply that cell-autonomous signaling through MyD88 is required to sustain tumor growth and underscore its function as an important positive modulator of tumor angiogenesis."

Cytoglobin was first discovered in 2001 by proteomic analysis in rat stellate cells and was reported to play an important role in controlling tissue fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which cytoglobin inhibits or reverses the progression of fibrosis remains unclear. The present study examines the effect of recombinant human cytoblobin (rhCygb) in a rat model of liver fibrosis. Proteomic approaches were employed to identify differentially expressed proteins in the fibrosis model. Optimized conditions for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were developed to provide improved protein detection and separation. A total of 43 spots were obtained and, through the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, 30 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Gene ontology term annotation and KEGG pathway analysis allowed us to explore the function of the represented proteins. Based on these results, we provide a theory of the molecular mechanism related to rhCygb reversion of fibrosis and which will assist in the identification of biomarkers in patient serum to improve early diagnosis of liver fibrosis."

The nuclear accident that occurred more than 30 years ago in Chernobyl resulted in significant changes in diversity and richness of microbial communities that could influence characteristics of animal-bacteria interactions, including host immune responses and competitive interference by bacteria. Given the high mortality rate of birds breeding in radioactively contaminated zones, those with stronger defences against infections should experience significant fitness advantages.Here we characterized antimicrobial capacity of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from different Ukrainian populations (subject to a gradient of ionizing radiation) against 12 bacterial species. We also quantified constitutive innate immunity, which is the non-specific first barrier of protection of hosts against microbial parasites. We found a positive association between specific antimicrobial capacity of individual hosts and radiation levels in breeding habitats even after controlling for other confounding variables such as sex and age. However, no significant relationship was found between immunocompetence (non-specific response) and background radiation.These results suggest that radiation selects for broad antimicrobial spectra of barn swallows, although not for all bacterial strains. We discuss these results in the framework of host-parasite evolution under extreme environmental conditions."
