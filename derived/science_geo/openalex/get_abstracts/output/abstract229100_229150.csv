https://openalex.org/W2069414088,"FoxO Forkhead transcription factors are shown here to act as signal transducers at the confluence of Smad, PI3K, and FoxG1 pathways. Smad proteins activated by TGF-beta form a complex with FoxO proteins to turn on the growth inhibitory gene p21Cip1. This process is negatively controlled by the PI3K pathway, a known inhibitor of FoxO localization in the nucleus, and by the telencephalic development factor FoxG1, which we show binds to FoxO-Smad complexes and blocks p21Cip1 expression. We suggest that the activity of this network confers resistance to TGF-beta-mediated cytostasis during the development of the telencephalic neuroepithelium and in glioblastoma brain tumor cells."

We investigated the pathological relationship between phosphoylated-Akt (Akt-p) and FOXO3a in primary tumors. Surprisingly, FOXO3a was found to be excluded from the nuclei of some tumors lacking Akt-p, suggesting an Akt-independent mechanism of regulating FOXO3a localization. We provide evidence for such a mechanism by showing that IκB kinase (IKK) physically interacts with, phosphorylates, and inhibits FOXO3a independent of Akt and causes proteolysis of FOXO3a via the Ub-dependent proteasome pathway. Cytoplasmic FOXO3a correlates with expression of IKKβ or Akt-p in many tumors and associates with poor survival in breast cancer. Further, constitutive expression of IKKβ promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis that can be overridden by FOXO3a. These results suggest the negative regulation of FOXO factors by IKK as a key mechanism for promoting cell growth and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081100902,"During illness and stress, the immune system can suffer a considerable loss of T cells (lymphopenia). The remaining T cells undergo vigorous compensatory expansion, known as homeostatic proliferation, to reconstitute the immune system. Interestingly, human diseases of autoimmune etiology often present with immune deficiencies such as lymphopenia. In this study, we show that reduced T cell numbers and the resulting exaggerated homeostatic-type proliferation of T cells generate autoimmunity. The cycling T cell population is short lived, and the depleted memory compartment fuels the generation of new effector T cells. A catalyst for these phenomena is the increased responses to the cytokine IL-21, a mediator that regulates T cell turnover. We conclude that poor T cell survival and lymphopenia precipitate autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2073727170,"We describe a systematic genome-wide approach for learning the complex combinatorial code underlying gene expression. Our probabilistic approach identifies local DNA-sequence elements and the positional and combinatorial constraints that determine their context-dependent role in transcriptional regulation. The inferred regulatory rules correctly predict expression patterns for 73% of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, utilizing microarray expression data and sequences in the 800 bp upstream of genes. Application to Caenorhabditis elegans identifies predictive regulatory elements and combinatorial rules that control the phased temporal expression of transcription factors, histones, and germline specific genes. Successful prediction requires diverse and complex rules utilizing AND, OR, and NOT logic, with significant constraints on motif strength, orientation, and relative position. This system generates a large number of mechanistic hypotheses for focused experimental validation, and establishes a predictive dynamical framework for understanding cellular behavior from genomic sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2101345386,"Commissural axons in vertebrates and insects are initially attracted to the nervous system midline, but once they reach this intermediate target they undergo a dramatic switch, becoming responsive to repellent Slit proteins at the midline, which expel them onto the next leg of their trajectory. We have unexpectedly implicated a divergent member of the Robo family, Rig-1 (or Robo3), in preventing premature Slit sensitivity in mammals. Expression of Rig-1 protein by commissural axons is inversely correlated with Slit sensitivity. Removal of Rig-1 results in a total failure of commissural axons to cross. Genetic and in vitro analyses indicate that Rig-1 functions to repress Slit responsiveness similarly to Commissureless (Comm) in Drosophila. Unlike Comm, however, Rig-1 does not produce its effect by downregulating Robo receptors on precrossing commissural axon membranes. These results identify a mechanism for regulating Slit repulsion that helps choreograph the precise switch from attraction to repulsion at a key intermediate axonal target."
https://openalex.org/W2163243408,"Transdifferentiation is a process whereby one cell type committed to and progressing along a specific developmental lineage switches into another cell type of a different lineage through genetic reprogramming. Even though this process has been well studied and established in amphibian systems, it is unclear if mammalian cells possess the same potential. Recent in vivo transplantation studies showed that adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were able to differentiate into mesoderm-derived cell types as well as cells with neuroectodermal and endodermal characteristics, suggesting that transdifferentiation occurs in mammalian systems. However, there are concerns over these findings because of the possibility of progenitor cell contamination and cell fusion. In this study, we have developed an in vitro differentiation strategy to assess if human MSCs that have differentiated into a given mesenchyme cell lineage can transdifferentiate into other cell types in response to inductive extracellular cues. Our results showed that fully differentiated cells from hMSCs were capable of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation into cells of another developmental lineage at single cell levels."
https://openalex.org/W2045577106,"Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a consequence of injury, illness, surgery, and muscle disuse, impacting appreciably on health care costs and patient quality of life, particularly in the absence of appropriate rehabilitation. The molecular mechanisms that regulate muscle mass during atrophy and rehabilitation in humans have not been elucidated, despite several robust candidate pathways being identified. Here, we induced skeletal muscle atrophy in healthy volunteers using two weeks of limb immobilization, and then stimulated the restoration of muscle mass with six weeks of supervised exercise rehabilitation. We determined muscle mass and function and performed targeted gene expression analysis at prescribed time points during immobilization and rehabilitation. For the first time, we have identified novel changes in gene expression following immobilization-induced atrophy and during a program of rehabilitative exercise that restored muscle mass and function. Furthermore, we have shown that exercise performed immediately following immobilization induces profound changes in the expression of a number of genes in favor of the restoration of muscle mass, within 24 h. This information will be of considerable importance to our understanding of how immobilization and contraction stimulate muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, respectively, and to the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining or restoring muscle mass."
https://openalex.org/W1973891258,"Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into a variety of cell types during tissue development and regeneration. However, it is still unclear whether bone marrow-derived stem cells can migrate across the blood-brain barrier in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and if these cells can readily differentiate into functional parenchymal microglia. We thus studied the differentiation fate of bone marrow stem cells upon immigration into the CNS. To this end, we systemically transplanted stem cells that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) into lethally irradiated mice and found that these cells immigrated into the brain parenchyma of many regions of the CNS. Nearly all of the infiltrating cells had a highly ramified morphology and colocalized with the microglial marker iba1. Moreover, these cells expressed high levels of the protein CD11c, indicating that microglia of bone marrow origin may be potent antigen presenting cells. These data suggest that microglia of blood origin could activate cells of the adaptive immune system and cause harm to the CNS. Therefore, these results may have great clinical relevance for both immune-derived neuronal disorders and cancer patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1982603542,"G0 is a physiological state occupied by resting or terminally differentiated cells that have exited the cell cycle. In contrast to the well-characterized cyclin/cdk-mediated inactivation of pRb that controls the G1/S transition, little is known about regulation of the G0/G1 transition. However, pRb is likely to participate in this process because its acute somatic inactivation is sufficient for G0-arrested cells to re-enter the cell cycle. One physiological regulator of this event may be cyclin C because its highest mRNA levels occur during G0 exit. Here we show that a non-cdk8-associated cellular pool of cyclin C combines with cdk3 to stimulate pRb phosphorylation at S807/811 during the G0/G1 transition, and that this phosphorylation is required for cells to exit G0 efficiently. Thus, G1 entry is regulated in an analogous fashion to S phase entry, but involves a distinct cyclin/cdk combination."
https://openalex.org/W1992256434,"Trigger factor and DnaK protect nascent protein chains from misfolding and aggregation in the E. coli cytosol, but how these chaperones affect the mechanism of de novo protein folding is not yet understood. Upon expression under chaperone-depleted conditions, multidomain proteins such as bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and eukaryotic luciferase fold by a rapid but inefficient default pathway, tightly coupled to translation. Trigger factor and DnaK improve the folding yield of these proteins but markedly delay the folding process both in vivo and in vitro. This effect requires the dynamic recruitment of additional trigger factor molecules to translating ribosomes. While beta-galactosidase uses this chaperone mechanism effectively, luciferase folding in E. coli remains inefficient. The efficient cotranslational domain folding of luciferase observed in the eukaryotic system is not compatible with the bacterial chaperone system. These findings suggest important differences in the coupling of translation and folding between bacterial and eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2131806711,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. Angiogenesis is a critical component of these pathological processes, and expanding adipose tissue represents one of the few sites of active angiogenesis in the adult. Despite the potential importance of angiogenesis in obesity, little is known about underlying mechanisms. This problem is magnified by the absence of useful quantitative model systems. In this report, we examine the angiogenic process using the 3T3-F442A model of adipose tissue development. In this model, 3T3-F442A preadipocytes are implanted subcutaneously into athymic Balb/c nude mice. We show that these cells develop into highly vascularized fat pads over the next 14-21 days, and that these fat pads are morphologically similar to normal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Histological studies demonstrate that a new microvasculature is evident as early as 5 days after cell implantation, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses show that the expression of endothelial cell markers and adipogenesis markers increase in parallel during fat pad development. Finally, these preliminary studies suggest that the neovasculature originates by sprouting from larger, host-derived blood vessels that run parallel to peripheral nerves and that endothelial progenitor cells play little, if any, role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2079975206,"Epidemiological studies have consistently associated high intakes of lycopene or vitamin E with a reduced prostate cancer risk. Both compounds were tested in the MatLyLu Dunning prostate cancer model to gain insight into the in vivo action of lycopene and vitamin E. Supplementation for 4 weeks with 200 ppm lycopene, 540 ppm vitamin E, or both led to plasma levels comparable with those in humans. Both compounds also accumulated in tumor tissue. Macroscopic evaluation of the tumors by magnetic resonance imaging showed a significant increase in necrotic area in the vitamin E and the lycopene treatment groups. Microarray analysis of tumor tissues revealed that both compounds regulated local gene expression. Vitamin E reduced androgen signaling without affecting androgen metabolism. Lycopene interfered with local testosterone activation by down-regulating 5-alpha-reductase and consequently reduced steroid target genes expression (cystatin-related protein 1 and 2, prostatic spermine binding protein, prostatic steroid binding protein C1, C2 and C3 chain, probasin). In addition, lycopene down-regulated prostatic IGF-I and IL-6 expression. Based on these findings, we suggest that lycopene and vitamin E contribute to the reduction of prostate cancer by interfering with internal autocrine or paracrine loops of sex steroid hormone and growth factor activation/synthesis and signaling in the prostate."
https://openalex.org/W1964990390,"Growing evidence connects a cumulative formation of 3-nitrotyrosyl adducts in proteins as a marker for oxidative damage with the pathogenesis of various diseases and pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress. A physiological signaling role for protein nitration has also been suggested. Controlled “denitration” would be essential for such a contribution of protein nitration to cellular regulatory processes. Thus, we further characterized such a potentially controlled, reversible tyrosine nitration that occurs in respiring mitochondria during oxygen deprivation followed by reoxygenation, which we recently discovered. Mitochondria constitute cellular centers of protein nitration and are leading candidates for a “nitrative” regulation. Mitochondria are capable of completely eliminating 3-nitrotyrosyl adducts during 20 min of hypoxia-anoxia and undergoing a selective partial reduction after only 5 min. This denitration is independent of protein degradation but depends on the oxygen tension. Reoxygenation re-establishes protein tyrosine nitration patterns that are almost identical to the pattern that occurs before hypoxia-anoxia, with nitration levels that depend on the duration of hypoxia-anoxia. The identified mitochondrial targets of this process are critical for energy and antioxidant homeostasis and, therefore, cell and tissue viability. This cycle of protein nitration and denitration shows analogies to protein phosphorylation, and we demonstrate that the cycle meets most of the criteria for a cellular signaling mechanism. Taken together, our data reveal that protein tyrosine nitration in mitochondria can be controlled, is target-selective and rapid, and is dynamic enough to serve as a nitrative regulatory signaling process that likely affects cellular energy, redox homeostasis, and pathological conditions when these features become disturbed.

The covalent addition of a nitro group to protein tyrosine in vivo, forming 3-nitro-l-tyrosine, is a selective post-translational process targeting a few tyrosine residues in a limited number of proteins (1Ischiropoulos H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Even though biological nitration yields are relatively low (100–500 μmol of nitrotyrosine/mol of tyrosine under inflammatory conditions) (2Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mitochondria constitute a primary locus for intracellular superoxide radical generation and are exposed to ⋅NO by intramitochondrial production via a splice variant of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (13Giulivi C.

Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The simultaneous presence of superoxide and ⋅NO can lead to the formation of peroxynitrite, which is considered a source of protein nitration in mitochondria that is further enhanced by carbon dioxide or transition metals in proteins (Fig. 1) (14Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The resulting high probability of protein nitration, especially in the mitochondrial matrix (15Ghafourifar P. Colton C.A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), is reflected by the fact that a substantial number of the proteins identified as nitrated in vivo are localized in mitochondria (6Aulak K.S. Miyagi M. Yan L. West K.A. Massillon D. Crabb J.W. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 7Turko I.V. Marcondes M. Murad F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2289-H2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the potential of protein nitration to impede protein function, recent data raise the issue of whether protein nitration might also be a cellular signaling mechanism (1Ischiropoulos H.

To be considered a cellular signaling mechanism, protein nitration must meet four basic criteria: controlled rates of formation, specificity, modification of target protein and cell function, and reversibility (16Schopfer F.J.

We recently discovered that isolated rat liver mitochondria are capable of nitrotyrosine clearance during a 20-min episode of hypoxia-anoxia and that nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity reappears during reoxygenation in an l-arginine-dependent way at protein spots that matched the spots before hypoxia-anoxia (18Aulak K.S.

In the present study, we show that mitochondrial nitrotyrosine clearance starts to take place within a few minutes, is selective during the early phase, depends on oxygen deprivation, and is not performed through proteolysis by contamination with proteasomes or lysosomes. We further demonstrate that nitration during reoxygenation is also selective and depends on the duration of hypoxia-anoxia and, therefore, on the degree of nitrotyrosine clearance. We identify the modified proteins, having verified that all main nitrated proteins before hypoxia-anoxia and after reoxygenation are identical, thus markedly increasing the possibility that nitrotyrosine clearance is indeed a protein denitration process involved in a nitrative-signaling mechanism. The metabolic pathways potentially affected by the nitrative signaling are shown. Isolation and Treatment of Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats using differential centrifugation, as described previously in detail (25Guerra F.C. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Fleischer S. Kervina M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 6-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and preserved on ice until use, in solution at a concentration of 30 mg protein/ml. The respiratory control number of the preparations used in this study was 5.0 or above. The respiratory control number was determined using 3 mg/ml mitochondrial protein, 5 mm glutamate, 2.5 mm malate, and 1 mm ADP in a reaction medium (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm d-glucose, 40 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors aprotinin (5 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and Pefabloc SC (24 μg/ml)) at 25 °C in isotemp circulator chambers. Oxygen levels were assessed using a YSI 5300A biological oxygen monitor (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH) connected to a computer through an RS-232 interface and Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrodes. For hypoxia-anoxia-reoxygenation experiments (Fig. 2), 1.5 mm NADPH and 1 mm l-arginine or d-arginine were added. Hypoxia-anoxia was induced by sealing the chambers with the electrodes. At selected times, aliquots were removed and immediately added to an equal volume of denaturating buffer (1% Triton X-100, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea) or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. One-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed essentially according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), with 15 μg of mitochondrial protein per lane. After SDS-PAGE, the acrylamide gels were soaked for 20 min in a transfer buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol), and then proteins were electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semidry transfer apparatus, according to the manufacturer. Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (GelCode blue stain, Pierce). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed with an isoelectric focusing system (Bio-Rad) after adding 1% CHAPS, 1% dithiothreitol, and 1% immobilized pH gradient ampholytes (Bio-Lyte 3/10, Bio-Rad) to each sample. The first dimension used 7-cm nonlinear (pH 3–10), immobilized pH gradient strips, loading 145 μg of protein. Immobilized pH gradient strips were actively rehydrated with the sample at 50 V for 14 h, and then isoelectric focusing was performed by a linear increase to 250 V over 30 min followed by a linear increase to 8000 V over 1 h. The current was maintained at 8000 V until a total of 15 kVh was reached. For the second dimension, the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 12 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue and then for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% idoacetamide, and bromphenol blue. The strips were then embedded in 1% (w/v) agarose on top of 12% acrylamide gels containing a 4% stacking gel. The second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed essentially according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the acrylamide gels were soaked for 20 min in a transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, and 20% methanol) and then partially electro-transferred onto a PVDF membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus according to the manufacturer. The gels were then stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (GelCode blue stain). Western Blot Analysis—PVDF membranes were blocked for 60 min using blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Tween 20, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin). Membranes were probed for 60 min at 27.5 °C with monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (1: 5000 for two-dimensional gels, clone 1A6, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), polyclonal anti-20 S proteasome antibody (1:2000 for one-dimensional gels, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), polyclonal anti-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) antibody (1:1000 for one-dimensional gels), monoclonal anti-histone H1 antibody (1:1000 for one-dimensional gels), and monoclonal anti-GM130 antibody (1:1000 for one-dimensional gels) or monoclonal anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) antibody (1:5 for one-dimensional gels) in blocking buffer and washed four times for 10 min in a washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Tween 20). Anti-IP3R1, anti-histone H1, anti-GM130, and anti-LAMP2 antibodies were kind gifts of Dr. Alan Wolfman. Membranes were then probed for 60 min with a goat anti-mouse antibody (horseradish peroxidase conjugate, 1:8000; Sigma) and washed four times for 15 min in the washing buffer, and immunopositive spots were visualized by using ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments in which samples needed to be compared, the membranes were placed on the same film and exposed simultaneously. Two-dimensional Fluorescence Difference Gel Electrophoresis (Ettan DIGE)—DIGE CyDyes (Amersham Biosciences) were warmed to room temperature for 5 min, vortexed, and centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 rpm. Then, 3 μl of CyDyes were mixed for 30 min in the dark with 4.5 μl of anhydrous dimethylformamide to reach a concentration of 400 μm. 50 μg of mitochondrial protein from samples taken before 20 min of hypoxia-anoxia and after 20 min of reoxygenation were separately labeled with DIGE CyDye Cy5 (blue) and Cy3 (red), respectively. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 10 mm lysine, and the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 rpm. Both samples were mixed together, and proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously. Labeled proteins were visualized using the Typhoon variable mode imager, and the images were analyzed (ImageQuant Software, Amersham Biosciences). Protein Identification—Nitrotyrosine immunoreactive protein spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometric analysis of in-gel tryptic digest of nitrotyrosine immunopositive spots as described previously in detail (6Aulak K.S. Miyagi M. Yan L. West K.A. Massillon D. Crabb J.W. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). All searches were performed with a mass tolerance of 0.005% error (50 ppm) and a minimum of four matching peptides. To verify antibody specificity for nitrotyrosine, proteins transferred onto PVDF membrane were tested for nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity after reduction with sodium hydrosulfite (6Aulak K.S. Miyagi M. Yan L. West K.A. Massillon D. Crabb J.W. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Quantification of Total Nitrotyrosine and Tyrosine—The snap-frozen samples were thawed and analyzed by stable isotope dilution high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, as described previously in detail, using 300 μg of protein per analysis (28Brennan M.-L. Wu W. Fu X. Shen Z. Song W. Frost H. Vadseth C. Narine L. Lenkiewicz E. Borchers M.T. Lusis A.J. Lee J.J. Lee N.A. Abu-Soud H.M. Ischiropoulos H. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

The influence of hypoxia-anoxia followed by reoxygenation (for a schematic view, see Fig. 2) on protein nitration was tested in isolated, intact rat liver mitochondria respiring at respiration state 3. The rat liver preparations showed no contamination with nuclei (using histone H1 as a marker) (29Zlatanova J.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 92: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Golgi (GM130 as marker) (30Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis & T.E. Warren G. J.

Fuertes G. Murray R.Z. Bose S. Knecht E. Rechsteiner M.C. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. Dyson J. Rivett J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Freshly isolated mitochondria showed a background protein tyrosine nitration that was consistent for all preparations. l-arginine (1 mm) was used to support ⋅NO generation (33Elfering S.L. Haynes V.L. Traaseth N.J. Ettl A. Giulivi C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H22-H29Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Manzo-Avalos S. Perez-Vazquez V. Ramirez J. Aguilera-Aguirre L.

Amino Acids (Vienna). 2002; 22: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Compared with the protein nitration pattern of freshly isolated mitochondria (control) (Fig. 3a), the patterns after a hypoxic-anoxic phase of 5 min (approximately 2 min of anoxia) (Fig. 3b) or 20 min (approximately 17 min of anoxia) (Fig. 3c) both demonstrated extensively decreased intensities of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. Five minutes of hypoxia resulted in a selective alteration of the nitration pattern. The decrease in signal intensity for most of the immunoreactive protein spots ranged from approximately 25 to 75% (Fig. 3b, spots S1, S2, S4, and S5). The signals of other immunoreactive proteins almost completely disappeared (Fig. 3b, spot S3). After 20 min of hypoxia-anoxia, the mitochondria showed a complete loss of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. It was shown recently (33Elfering S.L. Haynes V.L. Traaseth N.J. Ettl A. Giulivi C. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H22-H29Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that, in the absence of protease inhibitors, the removal of nitrated proteins in isolated mitochondria is caused by increased turnover, with protein half-lives decreasing from 142–14 h to 3.8–0.5 h. within 0.5 h. In the present study, however, a substantial decrease in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity occurred within a few minutes and in the presence of protease inhibitors. Moreover, we verified the absence of 20 S and, therefore, 26 S proteasomes as well as lysosomes. The 20 S proteasome appears to be the predominant cellular pathway for the degradation of soluble and membrane-bound, mildly oxidized proteins (proteins with ≤9 modified amino acids), alone and in cooperation with the lysosomal system (35Davies K.J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 36Dunlop R.A. Rodgers K.J. Dean R.T. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 894-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, if present, the 20 S proteasome would be a prime candidate for the observed loss of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity because it selectively recognizes and degrades present oxidized proteins, even during ongoing oxidative stress as in hypoxia and reoxygenation (35Davies K.J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 36Dunlop R.A. Rodgers K.J. Dean R.T. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 894-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mitochondria contain an autonomous proteolytic system, which includes ATP-dependent Lon and Lon-like serine proteases in the matrix as well as two ATP-dependent AAA metalloproteases that are an integral part of the inner membrane (37Käser M. Langer T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Among these proteases, degradation of oxidatively modified proteins has been shown only for the Lon protease (38Bota D.A. Van Remmen H. Davies K.J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, even in the presence of the activator ATP (39Bota D.A. Davies K.J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Therefore, Lon and Lon-like proteases should be inhibited by the Pefabloc SC that was added to all mitochondrial preparations. Thus, the clearance of the nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is more likely performed by a protein denitration process then by protein degradation. The steady state abundance of the proteins in the isolated mitochondria generally depends on protein degradation and mitochondrial protein synthesis; however, except for the AAA metalloproteases, all known mitochondrial proteases were inhibited, and the mitochondrial protein synthesis is limited to proteins encoded in the mitochondrial DNA, which are all subunits of enzyme complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system (40Taanman J.-W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 103-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test for any alteration in the abundance of the mitochondrial proteins and especially for remaining proteolytic degradation by mitochondrial proteases, we performed two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). We compared samples before hypoxia-anoxia (Fig. 4a, blue fluorescing protein spots) and after 20 min of reoxygenation (Fig. 4a, red fluorescing protein spots). No differences in protein expression patterns and levels were observed (Fig. 4a, overlay of the two samples shown). This further raises the probability that a protein denitration process is responsible for the loss of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, but because of the limitations of the method, a specific degradation of the nitrated proteins by an unidentified protease at subdetection limits (between 1 and <10%) cannot be fully ruled out. In contrast to the mitochondrial denitration observed in our experiments, total protein nitration in whole organs increases during ischemic hypoxia (9Walker L.M. York J.L. Imam S.Z. Ali S.F. Muldrew K.L. Mayeux P.R. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 63: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which is consistent with amplified cellular levels of superoxide in the presence of ⋅NO and CO2 (14Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R.

Thus, mitochondrial nitrotyrosine clearance may be part of an organelle-specific defense mechanism against oxidative and nitrative stress under conditions of decreasing oxygen tension, because one of the main sources of reactive oxygen species are complexes I–III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (42Paddenberg R. Ishaq B. Goldenberg A. Faulhammer P. Rose F. Weissmann N. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Kummer W. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L710-L719Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). If a protein denitration mechanism is responsible for this clearance of nitrotyrosine, it likely involves either reduction of nitrotyrosine to aminotyrosine or full removal of the nitro group from the tyrosine residue. Nitrotyrosine may be chemically reduced to aminotyrosine (43Balabanli B. Kamisaki Y. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13136-13141Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but removal of the nitro group would require an enzymatic process (17Kuo W.-N. Kanadia R.N. Shanbhag V.P. Toro R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 201: 11-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kuo W.N. Kocis J.M. Mewar M. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Biophys. 2002; 6: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Reoxygenation of oxygen-deprived mitochondria resulted in altered protein nitration (Fig. 3, d–f). To examine the contribution of ⋅NO to the nitration process, we exposed mitochondria to hypoxia-anoxia and reoxygenation in the presence of either l-arginine or d-arginine. d-arginine is not a substrate for mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase (45Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and neither l-arginine nor d-arginine affects the transmembrane potential or the oxygen consumption at respiration state 3, at the concentrations used (data not shown) (46Gonzalez-Hernandez J.C. Aguilera-Aguirre L. Perez-Vazquez V. Ramirez J. Clemente-Guerrero M. Cortes-Rojo C. Saavedra-Molina A. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2003; 24: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the presence of l-arginine, nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity changed relative to the duration of hypoxia-anoxia (Fig. 3, d and e), whereas in the presence of d-arginine, reoxygenation resulted in virtually no increase in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity (Fig. 3f), verifying that ⋅NO synthesis is essential for protein nitration during reoxygenation. Reoxygenation in the presence of l-arginine after the incomplete denitration during 5 min of hypoxia-anoxia resulted in selective nitration, with almost unchanged nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity for some proteins (compare Fig. 3, d and b, spots S2 and S4) and increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity for other proteins as well (compare Fig. 3, d and b, spots S1, S3, and S5) in a few immunoreactive spots seen only after reoxygenation (Fig. 3, d and e, spot S6, arginase 1). Reoxygenation after the complete denitration during 20 min of hypoxia-anoxia resulted in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivities that were generally notably higher by approximately 150% (Fig. 3e) than the immunoreactivites in mitochondria before hypoxia-anoxia (Fig. 3e, spots S1, S2, S4, and S5). A few immunoreactivities, however, remained below those in mitochondria before hypoxiaanoxia (Fig. 3e, spot S3). These results were verified by excluding nonspecific nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity using nitrotyrosine to aminotyrosine reduction (Fig. 4b). In contrast to the nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity intensities, the patterns after reoxygenation in the presence of l-arginine were independent of the duration of hypoxia-anoxia and mirrored the pattern exhibited by mitochondria before hypoxia-anoxia. These results suggest that the same proteins become selectively nitrated during reoxygenation, a condition of oxidative and nitrative stress (23Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 24Ferdinandy P. Schulz R. Br. J.

Physiol. 2001; 280: H2126-H2135PubMed Google Scholar) generated via excessive superoxide formation (20Gu G. Mouithys-Mickalad A. Sluse F.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) along with the full recovery of ⋅NO production (34Manzo-Avalos S. Perez-Vazquez V. Ramirez J. Aguilera-Aguirre L. Gonzalez-Hernandez J.C. Clemente-Guerrero M. Villalobos-Molina R. Saavedra-Molina A. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2002; 22: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the high selectivity and rapid turnover of the nitro groups at the target proteins during a “denitration-nitration” cycle suggest that this process is more than simply oxidant damage and clearance. To reveal the oxygen dependence of the denitration process, the alterations in the nitrotyrosine and tyrosine content in oxygenated mitochondria versus mitochondria exposed to hypoxiaanoxia as well as in mitochondria reoxygenated after hypoxiaanoxia were determined in the presence of l- or d-arginine (Fig. 5). The almost complete decline of the nitrotyrosine content during 20 min of hypoxia-anoxia and increase after the reoxygenation of the mitochondria in the presence of l-arginine further verify the results from the Western blot analysis with the antinitrotyrosine antibody. In contrast, the nitrotyrosine content in oxygenated mitochondria increased over a period of 20 min in the presence of l-arginine, which suggests that the denitration process functions only under conditions of oxygen deprivation. No significant increase or decrease of nitrotyrosine occurred in oxygenated mitochondria in the presence of d-arginine, indicating that even in unstressed, oxygenated mitochondria, de novo⋅NO synthesis sustains protein nitration, and further support an oxygen-regulated protein denitration process instead of degradation of the nitrated proteins. As an approach to establish potential functions for the rapid and selective denitration and nitration process and to verify that the same proteins are nitrated before hypoxia-anoxia and after reoxygenation, we identified the proteins that are nitrated under the different conditions shown in Fig. 3. All Coomassie-stained protein spots of the gels (Fig. 6, mitochondria are shown before hypoxia-anoxia) that matched the nitrotyrosine immunoreactive spots in the autoradiographs were analyzed. Corresponding nitrotyrosine immunoreactive spots from the different conditions were identified as the same proteins. It is not clear, however, if certain protein molecules undergo a full denitration-renitration cycle or if different molecules of the same protein are denitrated during hypoxia-anoxia and nitrated during reoxygenation. Among these reversibly nitrated proteins are a major antioxidant enzyme (manganese superoxide dismutase), two proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation (enoyl-CoA hydratase and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase), a key electron acceptor for multiple pathways (electron transport flavoprotein), and a protein of the citric acid cycle (malate dehydrogenase). Thus, in addition to the mitochondrial antioxidant defense that is potentially altered by nitrative inhibition of manganese superoxide dismutase (48Macmillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), major mechanisms of energy homeostasis, including the electron transfer between various flavoprotein dehydrogenases (amino acid and choline catabolism) and the respiratory chain (see Ref. 49Parker A. Engel P.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and references therein), are affected (Fig. 7). The denitration of these enzymes during the hypoxic-anoxic phase likely helps to sustain mitochondrial ATP production and an increased antioxidant capacity, which is important for the prevention of metabolic failure and cell death during oxygen deprivation. In this context, it is important to note that damage caused by oxygen deprivation in tissues depends on the duration of hypoxia or anoxia, with 5 min of hypoxia-anoxia conferring protective ischemic preconditioning (24Ferdinandy P. Schulz R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and extended hypoxia-anoxia causing severe tissue injury during reperfusion (50Li C. Jackson R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C227-C241Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The periods of hypoxia-anoxia and reoxygenation applied in this study cover the conditions for both ischemic preconditioning and extended hypoxia-anoxia. Our data suggest that the partial denitration and/or partial de novo nitration observed after 5 min of hypoxia-anoxia and the reoxygenation that follows may be important for that biologically different outcome. In summary, this is the first comprehensive study demonstrating that protein tyrosine nitration can operate as a rapid, reversible, and target-selective cycle of denitration and nitration in mitochondria. The analogue of protein denitration and de novo nitration with protein phosphorylation and the involvement of critical antioxidant and metabolic enzymes as targets imply that protein nitration participates in an oxygen-dependent regulatory pathway in hypoxia and reoxygenation. In contrast to protein phosphorylation, the nitrative regulatory signaling pathway we describe here is likely manifested through chemical nitration and enzymatic or chemical denitration, potentially linking it to oxidative stress. A physiological function of protein denitration and nitration may be the beneficial adjustment of mitochondrial metabolic rates and antioxidant defense during short periods of oxygen deprivation and reoxygenation. Excessive nitration that occurs during reoxygenation after prolonged hypoxia, however, may be involved in mitochondrial damage associated with circulatory shock, myocardial ischemia, stroke, and transplantation of organs.

In higher eukaryotes, calcium/calmodulin-mediated activation of calcineurin facilitates direct dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). Recently, controversy has surrounded the role of calcineurin in mediating skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy. Here we examined the ability of calcineurin-deficient mice to undergo skeletal muscle hypertrophic growth following mechanical overload (MOV) stimulation or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) stimulation. Two distinct models of calcineurin deficiency were employed: calcineurin Aβ gene-targeted mice, which show a ≈50% reduction in total calcineurin, and calcineurin B1-LoxP-targeted mice crossed with a myosin light chain 1f cre knock-in allele, which show a greater than 80% loss of total calcineurin only in skeletal muscle. Calcineurin Aβ-/- and calcineurin B1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre mice show essentially no defects in muscle growth in response to IGF-1 treatment or MOV stimulation, although calcineurin Aβ-/- mice show a basal defect in total fiber number in the plantaris and a mild secondary reduction in growth, consistent with a developmental defect in myogenesis. Both groups of gene-targeted mice show normal increases in Akt activation following MOV or IGF-1 stimulation. However, overload-mediated fiber-type switching was dramatically impaired in calcineurin B1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre mice. NFAT-luciferase reporter transgenic mice failed to show a correlation between IGF-1- or MOV-induced hypertrophy and calcineurin-NFAT-dependent signaling in vivo.

Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated serine-threonine phosphatase, is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit with a molecular mass of ∼59 kDa (CnA), 1The abbreviations used are: CnA, calcineurin A subunit; CnB calcineurin B subunit; GH, growth hormone; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; MLC, myosin light chain; MOV, mechanical overload; MyHC, myosin heavy chain; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; MW, muscle weight; TL, tibia length; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and a regulatory subunit with a molecular mass of 19 kDa (CnB). The CnA subunit contains a phosphatase domain, a CnB-binding domain, a calmodulin-binding domain, and an autoinhibitory loop. The autoinhibitory loop normally obscures the phosphatase domain and is displaced upon binding of CnB and Ca2+/calmodulin to CnA resulting in the full activation of calcineurin (1Bassel-Duby R.

Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue possessing the ability to adapt to alterations in neuromuscular activity, loading, hormones, substrate supply and environmental stress. Adaptation of skeletal muscle in response to such stimuli involves a molecular reprogramming of gene expression coupled with alterations in protein translational activities and/or protein turnover, thereby facilitating structural remodeling of skeletal muscle (hypertrophy or atrophy) and the transformation of individual muscle fibers. Specific changes involve modifications in expression of the myosin heavy and light chain components of the sarcomere, adaptations in metabolic and oxygen utilization factors, and adaptations in neuromuscular innervation properties (6Pette D. Staron R.S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 7Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J. Appl.

For example, slow/oxidative skeletal muscle fibers predominantly express the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) I with some varied proportion of IIA, the slowest of the fast MyHCs. Slow/oxidative fibers also possess metabolic enzymes geared toward sustained energy production, have increased myoglobin content, and have more mitochondria to enhance ATP generation. Fast/glycolytic muscle fibers in rodent skeletal muscle predominantly express two fast isoforms, MyHC IIX and IIB, and contain a full complement of metabolic enzymes geared toward rapid substrate utilization (6Pette D. Staron R.S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 7Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 77: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, MyHC I fibers are characterized by a low velocity of shortening and high resistance to fatigue, whereas type IIX/B fibers show high velocity of shortening and low resistance to fatigue. The fiber-type program of adult skeletal muscle is highly plastic and dynamically regulated by motor nerve activity, which is associated with altered intracellular calcium handling. Slow/oxidative fibers are induced by a profile of sustained contractile activity and cytosolic Ca2+ levels between 100 and 300 nm (8Hennig R. Lomo T. Nature. 1985; 314: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 9Chin E.R. Physiologist. 1996; 39: A-75Google Scholar). Fast/glycolytic fibers are characterized by infrequent yet powerful bursts of contractile work, with resting Ca2+ levels of ≤50 nm (10Westerblad H. Allen D.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is predominantly activated in response to sustained elevations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, consistent with its hypothesized role in regulating skeletal muscle fiber-type switching (1Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, calcineurin has been shown to selectively activate expression of MyHC I (11Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell.

Also, transgenic mice overexpressing an activated form of calcineurin in skeletal muscle show increased numbers of slow/oxidative muscle fibers (14Naya F.J. Mercer B. Shelton J. Richardson J.A.

Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 308: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to activating the slow/oxidative fiber-type program, calcineurin has also been hypothesized to regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophic growth. This hypothesis originally stemmed from the observation that expression of activated calcineurin induces a profound hypertrophic response in the heart, another striated muscle (23Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in the myocardium, two groups reported a functional role for calcineurin-NFAT signaling in mediating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy/growth (24Semsarian C.

Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Likewise, the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A was observed to reduce compensatory hypertrophy following functional overload in vivo (26Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas another study showed that plantaris muscle regrowth was mostly inhibited with cyclosporine A (27Mitchell P.O. Mills S.T. Pavlath G.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C984-C992Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, others have not observed a growth inhibitory effect with cyclosporine A (21Serrano A.L. Murgia M. Pallafacchina G. Calabria E. Coniglio P. Lomo T. Schiaffino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), consistent with the lack of calcineurin up-regulation during hypertrophy (30Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O.

More recent studies on skeletal muscle hypertrophy have shown compelling evidence for the importance of an altogether different signaling pathway that utilizes IGF-1-phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulatory constituents (19Pallafacchina G.

Given the controversy surrounding the functional role for calcineurin as a regulator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and the issue of nonspecific effects associated with cyclosporine A, here we examined skeletal muscle hypertrophy in two distinct models of calcineurin disruption. Whereas calcineurin was observed to be essential for overload-mediated fiber-type switching toward the slow/oxidative phenotype, there was essentially no direct effect on skeletal muscle hypertrophy. These results provide clear evidence that calcineurin expression is not required for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in the adult. Animals—CnAα-/- (16Parsons S.A. Wilkins B.J. Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D.

Immunity. 2004; 20: 244-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and NFAT luciferase reporter mice (NFAT site from the interleukin-4 promoter) have also been previously described (36Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1081-1095Crossref Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the myosin light chain 1f (MLC1f) genomic locus (knock-in) were generously provided by Steven Burden (Skirball Institute, NYU) and were previously described (37Bothe G.W. Haspel J.A. Smith C.L. Wiener H.H. Burden S.J. Genesis. 2000; 26: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). β-MyHC-cre transgenic mice were generated that express the Cre recombinase in slow skeletal and embryonic cardiac muscle. The Cre coding sequence was linked to the 5.6-kb mouse β-myosin heavy chain promoter (38Colbert M.C. Hall D.G. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A. Lorenz J.N. Kirby M.L. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and SV40 small t-intron and polyadenylation sequences. The transgene was released using SfiI and NotI and used for pronuclear microinjection. All animals had free access to food and water, and all experimentation was performed in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation animal care facility in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female mice ∼8-10 weeks of age were used for all analyses. IGF-1/Growth Hormone (GH) Administration—IGF-1-GH administration was carried out as previously described (39Tanaka N. Ryoke T. Hongo M. Mao L. Rockman H.A. Clark R.G. Ross Jr., J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H393-H399PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized long R3 IGF-1 (JRH Biosciences) was resuspended in a solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.1 m glacial acetic acid and 150 mm NaOH. IGF-1 and recombinant human GH (Nutropin AQ®, Genentech, Inc.) was administered via subcutaneous injection twice daily, at a dosage totaling 8 mg/kg per day. Some mice were also given an acute injection of IGF-1 and sacrificed 1 h afterward for analysis of phospho-Akt (serine 473). Mice in growth study groups were treated for 14 days. Western Blotting—Extracts were prepared in cell lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg of leupeptin per ml, 10 μg of aprotinin per ml, 10 μg of pepstatin per ml, 10 μg of N-α-tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) per ml, 10 μg of N-α-tosyllysyl chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) per ml), and proteins were resolved on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-8% polyacrylamide gel (5% for NFAT proteins), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunodetected using an enhanced chemifluorescence kit as specified by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The following antibodies were used: calcineurin pan-A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CnB1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), CnB2 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Akt serine 473 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate, Waltham, MA), GAPDH mAb (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) and isoform-specific CnA rabbit polyclonal antibodies that were custom synthesized in rabbits and affinity-purified by Zymed Laboratories, Inc., against the CnAα epitope NH2-CSETNGTDSNGSNSSNIQ-COOH and the CnAβ epitope NH2-CHTTENHGTGNHTPQCOOH. Western blot reactivity was visualized using a Storm860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ) using ImageQuant software. For MyHC Western blotting, extracts were prepared as described previously (16Parsons S.A. Wilkins B.J. Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4331-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised muscles were homogenized in Isotris (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (7.5 μl per 100 μl of isotris/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the homogenate. The samples were vortexed, boiled, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and used for Western blotting. Proteins were resolved and blotted as stated above. The following antibodies were used: NOQ7.5.4D, MyHC I mAb (Sigma); BF-F3, MyHC IIB mAb; SC-71, MyHCIIA-IIX mAb (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures). Luciferase Assay—Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (36Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1081-1095Crossref Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Frozen muscle samples were embedded in O.C.T. compound from Tissue-Tek (Torrence, CA) and sectioned into 7-μm thick slices, dried for 15 min, and washed briefly in PBS. Muscle sections were blocked in 10% horse serum-1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies NOQ7.5.4D, MyHC I, BF-F3, and SC-71 mAb were diluted 1:200 in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Tissue sections were washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, followed by incubation in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Secondary antibody was diluted 1:400 in blocking solution, and tissue sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were then washed three times with PBS and mounted with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and coverslips. Surgical Procedure—The procedure used to induce work overload on the plantaris and soleus muscles of mice has been previously described in detail (40Tsika R.W. Hauschka S.D. Gao L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C665-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sham surgery was performed on all control animals, and these animals were used in comparison with overloaded animals. The experimental period was conducted over a 6-week time course. Fiber Cross-sectional Area—Plantaris muscles from mice were collected, fixed in 10% formalin containing PBS, and embedded in paraffin. Muscles were cut crosswise through the thickest part of the muscle, and embedded cut side down. Muscle sections were cut at a thickness of 7 μm. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in dilutions of ethanol. To visualize fibers, sections were incubated with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (50 μg/ml in 1× PBS; Sigma) for 1 h, washed three times for 10 min each in PBS, and mounted with VectaShield and coverslips. Fiber cross-sectional areas were determined from ∼220 fibers per plantaris muscle per mouse. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—RNA was isolated from quadriceps muscle from two separate wild-type, CnAα-/-, CnAβ-/-, and CnB1(fl/fl)-MLC-cre mice using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperScript™ III First-Strand synthesis system for RTPCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using GeneChoice® Taq DNA polymerase with standard buffer (1.5 mm MgCl2 final concentration) (PGC Scientifics, Frederick, MD). For each reaction, 4 μl of cDNA template was used, and cycling conditions consisted of 96 °C for 25 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Approximately 9 μl of product was collected every 4 cycles beginning at cycle 23 and run on a 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA-2% agarose gel. Primer sets were as follows: CnAα (5′-ACTGGCATGCTCCCCAGCGGA-3′ and 5′-GTGCCGTTAGTCTCTGAGGCG-3′), CnAβ (5′-CCACAGGGATGTTGCCTAGTG-3′ and 5′-GTCCCGTGGTTCTCAGTGGTA-3′), and L7 (5′-GAAGCTCATCTATGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-AAGACGAAGGAGCTGCAGAAC-3′). Products were visualized using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of the means. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test at the p < 0.05 level. Decreased Expression of CnA or CnB1 In Vivo Leads to Concomitant Reduction in Remaining Calcineurin Protein—Considerable controversy persists regarding the role of calcineurin as a regulator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, in part because of variables associated with cyclosporine A treatment. To overcome this limitation, here we analyzed the phenotype of two distinct gene-targeted mouse models lacking calcineurin. The first model consists of a global disruption of the CnAβ gene, which we have previously shown constitutes between 40 and 50% of the total calcineurin protein in skeletal muscle (16Parsons S.A. Wilkins B.J. Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4331-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The second model consists of a skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the CnB1 gene, which is targeted with LoxP sites, in conjunction with mice harboring a cre recombinase knock-in within the MLC1f locus (35Neilson J.R. Winslow M.M. Hur E.M. Crabtree G.R. Immunity. 2004; 20: 244-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Bothe G.W. Haspel J.A. Smith C.L. Wiener H.H. Burden S.J. Genesis. 2000; 26: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It should be noted that whereas the MLC1f locus restricts cre expression to fast/glycolytic fibers; muscle in the mouse is overwhelmingly fast/glycolytic, with the exception of the soleus. CnB1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre mice showed no reduction in CnB1 protein levels in the brain, kidney, cardiac atria, cardiac ventricle, or the slow/oxidative soleus muscle (Fig. 1A). However, nearly all other muscles examined showed a dramatic loss of CnB1 protein levels; such as a greater than 90% loss in the biceps or gastrocnemius (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, loss of CnB1 led to a stoichiometric reduction in CnA protein levels, whereas α-tubulin Western blotting showed equal protein loading (Fig. 1B). By comparison, mRNA levels for CnAα and CnAβ were not reduced by the loss of CnB1, indicating no change in expression of either gene product (Fig. 1C). Conversely, loss of either CnAα-/- or CnAβ-/- produced a stoichiometric reduction (≈50%) in CnB1 protein levels in skeletal muscle, collectively suggesting that CnA and CnB mutually stabilize one another (Fig. 1B). These results also indicate that loss of CnB1 will dramatically compromise overall calcineurin activity in skeletal muscle (more so than either CnAβ or CnAα gene targeting). The CnB2 gene was not expressed in skeletal muscle, nor was it ectopically induced in the absence of CnB1, indicating that loss of CnB1 is fully penetrant (data not shown). CnAβ-/- Mice, but Not CnB1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre Mice, Display a Reduction in Relative Muscle Weight (MW) Caused by Decreased Fiber Number—When determining size and relative muscle weights of CnAβ-/- and CnB1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre mice, we observed a subtle but significant difference between males and females. In a previous report, we did not detect any significant differences in muscle weight-to-tibia length (TL) ratios between wild-type and CnAβ-/- mice, although the mice were smaller on average, and a mix of males and females was used (16Parsons S.A. Wilkins B.J. Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4331-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, here we detected a significant reduction in relative muscle weights from female CnAβ-/- mice compared with strain- and age-matched controls (Table I). No significant reductions were observed in relative muscle weights of CnB1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre females when compared with wild-type control females (Table I). Whereas tissue-specific targeting of CnB1 produced a much greater overall reduction in calcineurin, this reduction is restricted to post-differentiated myotubes given the expression characteristics of the MLC-cre allele, whereas CnAβ gene deletion eliminates ∼40-50% of calcineurin in all cells, including early myogenic progenitors and myoblasts.Table IRelative muscle weights in female mice Relative muscle weights (muscle weight normalized to tibia length) were determined for various skeletal muscles from wild type (n = 24), CnAβ-/- (n = 14), and CnB1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-cre mice (n = 12). Only female mice were analyzed for consistency.Wild typeCnAβ-/-CnB1-LoxP(fl/fl)-MLC-creGastrocnemius3.79 ± 0.0503.19 ± 0.080ap < 0.01"
https://openalex.org/W2086520150,"Caveolae, by virtue of their unique lipid environment, serve as signaling platforms that regulate cellular events. Perturbations in caveolae lipid composition have been shown in vitro to displace proteins from lipid microdomains, thereby altering their functionality and subsequent downstream signaling. Because membrane remodeling may not be accurately represented by using pharmacological treatments and in vitro models, we investigated the in vivo ability of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to alter caveolae lipid environment and the compartmentalization of resident proteins in mouse colonic mucosa. n-3 PUFA were examined for their chemoprotective, membrane lipid-modifying properties. Colonic caveolae in mice fed n-6 or n-3 PUFA enriched diets were characteristically enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and caveolin-1. n-3 PUFA feeding, compared with n-6 PUFA, significantly altered colonic caveolae microenvironment by increasing phospholipid n-3 fatty acyl content and reducing both cholesterol (by 46%) and caveolin-1 (by 53%), without altering total cellular levels. Concomitantly, localization of caveolae-resident signaling proteins H-Ras and eNOS in colonic caveolae was decreased by n-3 PUFA, by 45 and 56%, respectively. The distribution of non-caveolae proteins K-Ras and clathrin was unaffected. Moreover, EGF-stimulated H-Ras, but not K-Ras activation was significantly suppressed following n-3 PUFA feeding, in parallel with the selective alterations in their microlocalization. These findings reveal a novel modality by which n-3 PUFA remodel membrane microdomains in vivo and thereby alter caveolae protein localization and functionality."
https://openalex.org/W1980753190,"Seven transmembrane receptors mediate diverse physiological responses including hormone action, olfaction, neurotransmission, and chemotaxis. Human D6 is a non-signaling seven-transmembrane receptor expressed on lymphatic endothelium interacting with most inflammatory CC-chemokines resulting in their rapid internalization. Here, we demonstrate that this scavenging activity is mediated by continuous internalization and constant surface expression of the receptor, a process involving the clathrin-coated pit-dependent pathway. D6 constitutively associates with the cytoplasmic adaptor β-arrestin, and this interaction is essential for D6 internalization. An acidic region, but not the putative phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail of D6, is critical for receptor interaction with β-arrestin and subsequent internalization. Neither the native D6 nor mutants uncoupled from β-arrestin activate any G-protein-mediated signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1988349464,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in many organs. We previously demonstrated in renal proximal tubular cells that the engagement of the extracellular polysaccharide hyaluronan with its receptor CD44 attenuated TGF-β1 signaling. In the current study we examined the potential mechanism by which the interaction between hyaluronan (HA) and CD44 regulates TGF-β receptor function. Affinity labeling of TGF-β receptors demonstrated that in the unstimulated cells the majority of the receptor partitioned into EEA-1-associated non-lipid raft-associated membrane pools. In the presence of exogenous HA, the majority of the receptors partitioned into caveolin-1 lipid raft-associated pools. TGF-β1 increased the association of activated/phosphorylated Smad proteins with EEA-1, consistent with activation of TGF-β1 signaling following endosomal internalization. Following addition of HA, caveolin-1 associated with the inhibitory Smad protein Smad7, consistent with the raft pools mediating receptor turnover, which was facilitated by HA. Antagonism of TGF-β1-dependent Smad signaling and the effect of HA on TGF-β receptor associations were inhibited by depletion of membrane cholesterol using nystatin and augmented by inhibition of endocytosis. The effect of HA on TGF-β receptor trafficking was inhibited by inhibition of HA-CD44 interactions, using blocking antibody to CD44 or inhibition of MAP kinase activation. In conclusion, we have proposed a model by which HA engagement of CD44 leads to MAP kinase-dependent increased trafficking of TGF-β receptors to lipid raft-associated pools, which facilitates increased receptor turnover and attenuation of TGF-β1-dependent alteration in proximal tubular cell function. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in many organs. We previously demonstrated in renal proximal tubular cells that the engagement of the extracellular polysaccharide hyaluronan with its receptor CD44 attenuated TGF-β1 signaling. In the current study we examined the potential mechanism by which the interaction between hyaluronan (HA) and CD44 regulates TGF-β receptor function. Affinity labeling of TGF-β receptors demonstrated that in the unstimulated cells the majority of the receptor partitioned into EEA-1-associated non-lipid raft-associated membrane pools. In the presence of exogenous HA, the majority of the receptors partitioned into caveolin-1 lipid raft-associated pools. TGF-β1 increased the association of activated/phosphorylated Smad proteins with EEA-1, consistent with activation of TGF-β1 signaling following endosomal internalization. Following addition of HA, caveolin-1 associated with the inhibitory Smad protein Smad7, consistent with the raft pools mediating receptor turnover, which was facilitated by HA. Antagonism of TGF-β1-dependent Smad signaling and the effect of HA on TGF-β receptor associations were inhibited by depletion of membrane cholesterol using nystatin and augmented by inhibition of endocytosis. The effect of HA on TGF-β receptor trafficking was inhibited by inhibition of HA-CD44 interactions, using blocking antibody to CD44 or inhibition of MAP kinase activation. In conclusion, we have proposed a model by which HA engagement of CD44 leads to MAP kinase-dependent increased trafficking of TGF-β receptors to lipid raft-associated pools, which facilitates increased receptor turnover and attenuation of TGF-β1-dependent alteration in proximal tubular cell function. IntroductionTransforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; RI, II and III, receptor types I, II, III; HA, hyaluronan; PTC, proximal tubular cell; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Cav-1, caveolin-1. is a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in maintenance of normal homeostasis. It is important in development and tissue differentiation and normal wound healing through its effects on cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Roberts A.B. Flanders K.C. Kondaiah P. Thompson N.L. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Wakefield L. Rossi P. De Crombrugghe B. Heine U. Sporn M.B. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1988; 44: 157-197PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is a critical regulator of the normal inflammatory response as illustrated by the death of TGF-β1 -/- mice of a multifocal inflammatory syndrome soon after weaning (2Kulkarni A.B. Karlsson S. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar). Its growth inhibitory effect explains its role as a tumor suppressor, although its expression by tumor cells contributes to cancer progression and metastasis at later stages of disease (3Tang B. Vu M. Booker T. Santner S.J. Miller F.R. Anver M.R. Wakefield L.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 4Tang B. Böttinger E.P. Jakowlew S.B. Bagnall K.M. Mariano J. Anver M.R. Letterio J.J. Wakefield L.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is also important in the pathological process of fibrosis and subsequent organ failure, leading to the concept of fibrotic disease as “the dark side of tissue repair” (5Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 6Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). These different actions of TGF-β1 are related to altered epithelial cell responses to it in different cellular contexts (7Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 8Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4737) Google Scholar).Sustained production of TGF-β1 is a key determinant of tissue fibrosis (6Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar), including renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (9Border W.A. Noble N.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1388-1396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In chronic renal disease the severity of tubulointerstitial fibrosis is an excellent predictor of progression to end-stage renal failure (10Bohle A. Mackensen-Haen S. Gise H. Am. J. Nephrol. 1987; 6: 421-433Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 11Mackensen-Haen S. Bader R. Grund K.E. Bohle A. Clin. Nephrol. 1981; 15: 167-1721PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate the expression of three isoforms of TGF-β in the kidney (TGF-β1, 2, and 3), and although all three isoforms alter mesangial, interstitial fibroblast, and proximal tubular epithelial cell function the effects of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 are mediated at least in part by stimulation of TGF-β1 protein synthesis (12Yu L. Border W.A. Huang Y. Noble N.A. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 844-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Much of our work has focused on the mechanisms that regulate TGF-β1 generation and function in the kidney and, more specifically, in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells.TGF-βs elicit their signaling effects by binding mainly to three cell-surface receptors: types I (RI), II (RII), and III (RIII). RI and RII are serine/threonine kinases that form heteromeric complexes and are necessary for TGF-β signaling, which is initiated when the ligand induces assembly of a heteromeric complex of type II and type I receptors. The RII kinase then phosphorylates RI on a conserved glycine-serine-rich domain. This activates the RI kinase, which subsequently recognizes and phosphorylates members of the intracellular receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) signal transduction pathway. For TGF-β1 these include Smad2 and 3. This causes dissociation of the R-Smads from the receptor, stimulates the assembly of a heteromeric complex between the phosphorylated R-Smad and the Co-Smad Smad4, and induces the nuclear accumulation of this heteromeric Smad complex (reviewed in Ref. 13Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar).Endocytosis of cell surface receptors is an important regulatory event in signal transduction. TGF-β1 receptors internalize into both caveolin- and EEA-1-positive vesicles and reside in both lipid raft and non-raft membrane domains (14Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent internalization into the EEA1-positive endosome promotes TGF-β1 signaling. In contrast, the lipid raft-caveolar internalization pathway contains Smad7-bound receptor and is required for receptor turnover. Segregation of TGF-β1 receptors into distinct compartments, therefore, regulates TGF-β1 receptor signaling and turnover.Many studies have demonstrated an association between alteration in the generation of the extracellular matrix polysaccharide, hyaluronan (HA), and renal injury diseases (15Lewington A.J.P. Padanilam B.J. Martin D.R. Hammeramn M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: R247-R254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sibalic V. Fan X. Loffing J. Würthrich R.P. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1997; 12: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Wells A. Larsson E. Hanas E. Laurent T. Hallgren R. Tufvesson G.

Transplantation. 1990; 50: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this, however, is not clear. HA promotes the signaling interaction between the principle cell surface receptor for HA, CD44, and the TGF-β type I receptor in metastatic breast tumor cells (19Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Zhu H. Zhou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39703-39712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our studies with renal proximal tubular cells (PTC) have recently demonstrated that co-localization of CD44 and TGF-β receptors facilitates modulation of both Smad- and non-Smad-dependent TGF-β1-mediated events by HA (20Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). This suggests that alteration of HA synthesis may represent an endogenous mechanism to limit renal injury. The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of HA on TGF-β1 receptor compartmentalization in PTC. More specifically, we have examined the hypothesis that HA-mediated down-regulation of TGF-β1 signaling was the result of increased segregation of TGF-β1 receptors into a lipid raft-caveolar compartment away from the endosomal signaling compartment.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials—Antibodies for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation and the final working dilution were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-TGF-β type I receptor antibody (dilution 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-Smad7 antibody (dilution 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; goat polyclonal anti-p-Smad2/3 antibody (dilution 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal anticaveolin-1 antibody (dilution 1:500; Transduction Laboratories, Oxford, UK); mouse monoclonal anti-EEA-1 antibody (dilution 1:500; Transduction Laboratories); all horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1:10,000; Sigma).Other Reagents—Other reagents were: recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Oxford, UK); mouse monoclonal anti-CD44 blocking antibody (Ancell, Bayport, MN); MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem); nystatin (Sigma); cholesterol, water soluble (Sigma); [125I]TGF-β1 (Amersham Biosciences). Hyaluronan (MW 2 × 106) in the form of freeze-dried white powder was kindly provided by Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K., Japan.Cell Culture—HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells immortalized by transduction with human papilloma virus 16 E6/E7 genes) (21Ryan M.J. Johnson G. Kirk J. Fuerstenberg S.M. Zager R.A. Torok-Storb B. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 48-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries Ltd., Cumbernauld, UK), 2 μm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 20 mm HEPES buffer (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), 40 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Fresh growth medium was added to cells every 3–4 days until confluent. Cells were grown to confluence and serum-deprived for 48 h prior to experimental manipulation. In all experiments cells were stimulated with recombinant TGF-β1 and/or HA under serum-free conditions.In all aspects of cell biology that we have previously studied, HK-2 cells respond in an identical fashion to primary cultures of human proximal tubular cells (22Fraser D.J. Wakefield L. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Janssen U. Thomas G. Glant T. Phillips A.O.

Pathol. 2001; 159: 1905-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HK-2 cells are therefore a good model from which general conclusions can be drawn in terms of proximal tubular cell biology.Transient Transfection—The Smad-responsive promoter (SBE)4-Lux (26Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and constitutively active Alk5 (27Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) were gifts from Aristidis Moustakas. For transfection of the reporter construct, 80 × 103 cells/well were seeded onto a 12-well plate (this density of cells produced an 80% confluence monolayer the following day). The next day cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the Smad-responsive promoter-luciferase construct (or the constitutively active Alk5 construct) using the mixed lipofection reagent FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 1.5 μl of FuGene to 0.5 μg of DNA in serum-free and insulin-free medium. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with either TGF-β1 or the combination of TGF-β1 and HA. Following lysis of the cells in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), luciferase content was quantified by glow-type luminescence assay (Bright-Glo; Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was determined by commercial assay (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity.Affinity Labeling of TGF-β1 Receptors—HK-2 cells and ALK5-transfected HK-2 cells were incubated with 250 pm [125I]TGF-β1 at 37 °C for 1 h, and receptors were cross-linked to ligand with disuccinimidyl suberateas (Pierce) as previously described (28Massague J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Detergent-free Purification of Lipid Raft-rich Membrane Fraction— HK-2 cells and ALK5-transfected HK-2 cells were grown to near confluence in 100-mm dishes and affinity-labeled as described above. After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, two confluent dishes were scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. Homogenization was carried out with 10 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer followed by three 10-s bursts of a tissue homogenizer (Powergen 125; Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK), followed by three 20-s bursts of Ultrasonic disintegrator, (Soniprep 150; Fisher Scientific) to disrupt cellular membranes as previously described (29Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The homogenates were adjusted to 45% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline, 25 mm 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 35% sucrose, 4 ml of 5% sucrose, both prepared in MBS) was formed above and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in an SW40 TI rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). A light-scattering band was observed at the 3–35% sucrose interface. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tubes, and a portion of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A 330-kDa band (125I-labeled TGF-β-receptor complex) was detectable on autoradiography, and this was quantified by densitometry (Chemi Doc; Bio Rad). Data are expressed as percentage of the total [125I]-labeled TGF-β-receptor complex for that experiment in each fraction.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting/Western Analysis— Briefly, confluent monolayers were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), scraped, and rinsed into 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 10 min, cell pellets were extracted in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.01% NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Samples were centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 30 min, and then the supernatant (Triton-soluble components, including membrane and cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a separate tube and kept at -70 °C until use.Immunoprecipitation was performed by standard methodologies. Briefly, cell protein samples (200 μg) were precleared with 25 μl of packed protein A-cross-linked 4% beaded agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min) and the supernatant collected. Primary antibody (2 μg/ml) was added to the cleared supernatant and incubated at 4 °C with constant mixing for 4 h. The immune complex was captured by the addition of packed agarose protein A beads (50 μl) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). 30 μl of sample buffer was then added prior to boiling for 5 min. Separation of the beads was achieved by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min) and the supernatant removed. Specificity of immunoprecipitation was confirmed by negative control reactions performed with either no primary antibody or IgG control.Subsequently, samples were subject to immunoblot/Western analysis. Briefly, equal amounts of sample were prepared in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 60 mm Tris, and 0.05% v/v mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min prior to loading onto 10% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions according to the procedure of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat powdered milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline-Tween) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were subsequently washed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and then incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSHA Increases TGF-β1 Receptor Segregation into Lipid Rafts, Associated with Cav-1—Previous studies have demonstrated co-localization of TGF-β receptors into both caveolin- and EEA-1-containing compartments. Caveolin associates with choles-terol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane domains called lipid rafts (31Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). To examine alterations in receptor partitioning, we adopted two experimental approaches: affinity labeling of endogenous TGF-β1 receptors on HK-2 cells with [125I]TGF-β1 and affinity labeling of HK-2 cells transiently transfected with the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor Alk5 (TGF0β-I/T204D). Subsequently, rafts were fractionated by sucrose density centrifugation (32McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3601-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following addition of [125I]TGF-β1 (250 pm), receptors were found in both the raft and non-raft fractions (Fig. 1A). Scanning densitometry of the results of three separate experiments confirmed that following addition of [125I]TGF-β1, 66% of the total TGF-β receptor partitioned into the non-raft fractions (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis with antibodies to either caveolin-1 (Cav-1) or EEA-1 confirmed partitioning of lipid rafts because the presumptive raft fractions contained Cav-1 and the non-raft fractions contained EEA-1 (Fig. 1C).In contrast, addition of [125I]TGF-β1 in the presence of 25 μg/ml HA led to a significant increase in TGF-β receptor detected in the raft fraction. Under these conditions, 58% of total TGF-β receptor partitioned into the raft fractions (mean of n = 3, p = 0.003). Disruption of cholesterol by pretreatment of cells with 50 μg/ml nystatin (31Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 1 h prevented a HA-mediated shift of TGF-β receptor into the raft fraction (Fig. 1A). Following nystatin pretreatment and addition of [125I]TGF-β1 in the presence of 25 μg/ml HA, only 39% of total TGF-β receptor was found in the raft fractions (Fig. 1C). This was not significantly different from that seen following addition of [125I]TGF-β1 alone. The effect of nystatin was dependent on cholesterol sequestration because it was prevented by addition of cholesterol (25 μg/ml) together with nystatin to cells at 37 °C for 1 h prior to addition of TGF-β1 together with HA. This resulted in 55% of the total TGF-β receptor partitioning into the raft fractions. Statistically this was no different from the amount of receptor detected in the raft fraction when [125I]TGF-β1 together with HA were added to cells in the absence of nystatin.Previously we have demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of CD44 that both types I and II TGF-β1 receptors associate with CD44 (20Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). In metastatic breast tumor cells, however, the association was predominantly with the type I receptor. Because TGF-β1 receptor heterodimers form upon receptor ligand interaction, we sought to clarify the nature of CD44-TGF-β1 trafficking by using a constitutively active TGF-β1 type I receptor construct. HK-2 cells were transfected with the Alk5 construct and TGF-β receptors affinity-labeled by the addition of [125I]TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of exogenous HA. As with endogenous TGF-β receptors, trafficking of transfected constitutively active type I receptor Alk5 was altered by the presence of HA (Fig. 2A). In transiently transfected cells, in the presence of 250 pM [125I]TGF-β1 alone, 30% of total receptor was detected in the raft fractions. When cells were incubated with [125I]TGF-β1 together with HA (25 mg/ml), this increased to 62% (Fig. 2B). Disruption of cholesterol by pretreatment with nystatin also prevented an HA-dependent increase in receptor segregation into the raft fractions. Pretreatment of cells with nystatin prior to addition of [125I]TGF-β1 together with HA resulted in only 31% of the total TGF-β receptor being associated with the raft fractions, which was no different from that seen when [125I]TGF-β1 was added in the absence of HA. As with expression of endogenous receptors, the effect of nystatin was dependent on cholesterol sequestration because it was prevented by addition of cholesterol (25 μg/ml) together with nystatin to cells at 37 °C for 1 h prior to addition of TGF-β1 together with HA. This resulted in 52% of the total TGF-β receptor partitioning into the raft fractions. Statistically, this was no different from the amount of receptor detected in the raft fraction when [125I]TGF-β1 together with HA were added to cells in the absence of nystatin.Fig. 2HA-mediated alteration in distribution of transfected Alk5. HK-2 cells transiently transfected with the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor, Alk5, were affinity labeled with [125I]TGF-β1 and subjected to sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation to separate lipid rafts from other cellular components. The effect of HA on trafficking of TGF-β receptors was assessed by comparison of distribution in transfected cells exposed to either 250 pm radiolabeled TGF-β1 (T) alone or radiolabeled TGF-β1 in the presence of 25 μg/ml HA molecular weight 2 × 106 (T+HA). Subcellular fractionation was performed 24 h after addition of the stimuli in all experiments. To disrupt lipid rafts, cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml nystatin at 37 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of radiolabeled TGF-β1 together with HA for a further 24 h (T+HA+N). The contribution of lipid rafts was further examined by pretreatment of cells with 50 μg/ml nystatin for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of radiolabeled TGF-β1 together with HA in the presence of 25 μg/liter of cholesterol for a further 24 h (T+HA+N+C). An equal volume from each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. B, following scanning densitometry of autoradiographs, the distribution of TGF-β receptor into the raft (fractions 5 and 6) and non-raft (fractions 7–10) was quantified and the data from three separate experiments expressed graphically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Alterations in TGF-β Type 1 Receptor Associations—To determine the functional consequence of alteration in receptor partitioning, we stimulated cells with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of HA (25 μg/ml). Subsequently, we examined the association of TGF-β type I receptor with either EEA-1 or Cav-1 by immunoprecipitation of the TGF-β receptor and Western analysis of the latter two proteins.Stimulation of cells with recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) and immunoprecipitation of TGF-β type I receptor led to an increase in association of EEA-1 with the receptor (Fig. 3A). This increase in association of TGF-β1 type I receptor with EEA-1 following addition of recombinant TGF-β1 was not seen when cells were stimulated by recombinant TGF-β1 in the presence of HA (25 μg/ml). Scanning densitometry of three separate experiments confirmed a statistically significant increase in association of EEA-1 with TGF-β type I receptor, which was abrogated by the presence of HA (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Alteration in association of TGF-β receptor with EEA-1 and Cav-1. Confluent growth-arrested HK-2 cells were stimulated with recombinant TGF-β1 or HA for 24 h as indicated in the presence or absence of either blocking antibody to CD44 (αCD44) or the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (MEKi). Subsequently, TGF-β type I receptor was immunoprecipitated as described under “Materials and Methods” and EEA-1 or Cav-1 expression in the precipitate examined by Western analysis (A). Following scanning densitometry, alteration in EEA-1 (B) or Cav-1 (C) was expressed as fold increase in densitometric ratio compared with control. The data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast, immunoprecipitation of TGF-β type I receptor and Western analysis of Cav-1 demonstrated that addition of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) decreased the association of the two proteins (Fig. 3A). HA (25 μg/ml) alone increased association of TGF-β type I receptor and Cav-1. Furthermore, when cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 in the presence of HA, increased association of TGF-β type 1 receptor and Cav-1 was also apparent. Scanning densitometry confirmed the statistical significance of these changes (Fig. 3C).Previously, we have demonstrated that HA-dependent inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling was inhibited by co-incubation with a blocking antibody to CD44. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that addition of HA led to CD44-mediated activation of MEK activity and that inhibition of MEK by the inhibitor PD98059 also prevented the effects of HA on TGF-β1 signaling. In keeping with these observations, HA-mediated decreased association of EEA-1 with TGF-β type I receptor following addition of TGF-β1 was prevented by co-incubation with either blocking antibody to CD44 or the inhibitor of MEK, PD98059 (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly co-incubation of HA with blocking antibody to CD44 or PD98059 and stimulation with recombinant TGF-β1 prevented the increased association of TGF-β type I receptor and Cav-1 seen when cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 in the presence of HA in the absence of either the blocking antibody to CD44 or PD98059 (Fig. 3, A and C).

To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for TGF-β1 response on collagenase-3 promoter activity, a functional analysis of the promoter region of the collagenase-3 gene was carried out, and we identified the distal runt domain (RD) and proximal RD/activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites as necessary for full TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity. Gel shift, real time reverse transcriptase-PCR, and Western blot analyses showed increased levels of c-Jun, JunB, and Cbfa1/Runx2 upon TGF-β1 treatment in MDA-MB231 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation in vitro studies identified no physical interaction between JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2, whereas Smad3 interacted with both. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interaction of Smad3 with JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2. Under basal conditions, Cbfa1/Runx2 bound to both the proximal RD/AP-1 and distal RD sites. In response to TGF-β1, Cbfa1/Runx2 was seen only at the distal RD site, whereas JunB occupied the proximal RD/AP-1 site. An assemblage of Smad3, JunB, and Cbfa1/Runx2 at the distal RD site of the collagenase-3 promoter occurred in response to TGF-β1 in MDA-MB231 cells. Co-transfection of Smad3, JunB, and Cbfa1/Runx2 constructs along with a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor construct identified functional interaction of these proteins and transcriptional activation of the collagenase-3 gene by TGF-β1. Taken together, our results suggest that TGF-β1 stimulated JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2 to bind to their respective DNA consensus sites and that Smad3 is likely to stabilize their interaction to confer functional TGF-β1-stimulation of collagenase-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), 1The abbreviations used are as follows: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; AP-1, activator protein-1; RD, runt domain; RT, reverse transcriptase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; cbfa, core binding factor α. a family of secreted or transmembrane proteinases (1D'Alonzo R.C.D.

Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Since MMPs are important contributors to tumor progression and metastasis, they provide a rationale for developing new cancer drugs that target MMP activity (3Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). An intensive drug discovery program led to many clinical trials of MMP inhibitors for cancer therapy. However, these trials have largely been disappointing (4Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 5Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 509-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control MMP transcription, activation, and inhibition will provide several new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Recent studies have shown that collagenase-3, one of the MMPs (MMP-13), is overexpressed in a variety of malignant tumors. Human collagenase-3 was originally identified in human breast carcinoma cells (6Freije J.M. Diez-Itza I. Balbin M. Sanchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is homologous to rat collagenase-3 (7Quinn C.O. Scott D.K. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Jeffrey J.J. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22342-22347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently due to the wide substrate specificity of collagenase-3, its physiological expression is limited to situations in which rapid and effective extracellular matrix remodeling is required. Also, the expression of collagenase-3 is very restricted and appears to be subjected to stringent regulatory mechanisms. During tumor growth, these controls are lost, and tumor cells acquire the ability to produce this protease under stimulation by different factors, including cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. Among them, IL-1α and IL-1β are potential candidates for inducing the expression of this MMP gene in breast carcinomas (8Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 9Uria J.A. Jimenez M.G. Balbin M. Freije J.M. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9769-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Bone is one of the major sites for formation of breast cancer metastases, and bone matrix is enriched with several growth factors and cytokines (e.g. TGF-β1). Alterations in TGF-β-signaling can result in various fibrotic as well as malignant diseases (10Roberts A.B. Flanders K.C. Heine U.I. Jakowlew S. Kondaiah P. Kim S.J. Sporn M.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 327: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin.

Smad proteins have been demonstrated to be downstream mediators of the TGF-β-signaling pathway from the serine/threonine kinase receptors to the nucleus (13Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 14Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A typical resistance to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 in highly invasive and metastatic human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) is due to selective loss of the c-Myc down-regulation response (15Chen C.R. Kang Y. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, with breast cancer cells, TGF-β1 stimulates invasion (16Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and formation of TGF-β1-dependent bone metastases in an animal model system (17Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 could promote breast cancer metastasis by acting directly on the tumor cells (17Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. Massague J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) via production of parathyroid hormone-related protein that is the critical mediator of bone destruction. The molecular mechanisms responsible for osteolytic metastases are complex and involve bidirectional interactions between tumor cells and bone. One of the possible ways that TGF-β1 is involved in bone destruction is via regulation of MMP activity in metastasizing bone cancer cells. Recently, we have shown that TGF-β1 stimulated collagenase-3 expression in the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231 (18Selvamurugan N. Fung Z. Partridge N.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since collagenase-3 is characterized by its ability to degrade the extracellular matrix and is stimulated by TGF-β1 in MDAMB231 cells, collagenase-3-driven extracellular matrix proteolysis may support cancer cell growth both biochemically, by exposing mitogenic factors, and physically, by providing space for the proliferating cells. To delineate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this stimulation of collagenase-3 by TGF-β1 in these cells, a functional analysis of the collagenase-3 promoter was carried out, and we have identified that the distal runt domain (RD) and proximal RD/activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites are necessary for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity. The RD site is identical to that previously reported as an AML (acute myeloid leukemia)/Cbfa (core binding factor α)/Runx binding site (18Selvamurugan N. Fung Z. Partridge N.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The proteins binding to the AP-1 site are AP-1 dimers that consist of two subunits formed either by heterodimerization of a Fos family protein (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, Fra2) with a Jun family protein (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) or homodimerization of the Jun family members. Similarly, the RD site is bound by members of the core binding factor α (Cbfa) family (Cbfa1, Cbfa2, and Cbfa3, now renamed Runx-2, -1, and -3). Dominant negative inhibitors of Cbfa/Runx defined its role in TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity in MDAMB231 cells. Smad3, an intracellular mediator of TGF-β signaling, interacts with both JunB and Cbfa1/Runx2 in vitro and in vivo, and the assemblage of this protein complex on human collagenase-3 promoter may confer functional TGF-β1 stimulation of collagenase-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells. Materials—TGF-β1 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Tissue culture media and reagents were also obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-Cbfa1, -Smad3, -c-Myc, -Fos, and -Jun antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-Smad4 antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—MDA-MB231 and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified essential medium/F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12) or in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. MDAMB231 cells were serum-starved in 0.1% DMEM/F-12 medium for 16 h before TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) treatment. Transient Transfection and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Activity—Previously, we cloned and characterized the rat genomic clone 600-10, which contains the 5′-end of the gene (7Quinn C.O.

From this, the -148 collagenase-3 promoter construct was subcloned upstream of a CAT reporter gene in pSV0 (Promega). The mutations in the rat collagenase-3 promoter constructs were carried out by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The constructs were verified by sequencing at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School core DNA automatic sequencing facility. The plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates in either DMEM/F-12 or DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 per well in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM/F-12. After 16 h, 1 ml of DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. After 24 h, the cells were treated with either control or TGF-β1-containing media for 24 h. CAT activity was measured by reacting 50 μl of cell lysate in duplicate in a 100-μl reaction volume consisting of final concentrations of 250 μmn-butyryl-coenzyme A and 23 mm [14C]chloramphenicol (0.125 μCi/assay). The values were normalized to protein as determined by the Bradford dye binding (Bio-Rad) method. A standard curve using purified CAT was performed in every experiment to determine the linear range of the enzyme assay. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (19Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 μg of extracts were incubated in a volume of 20 μl containing binding buffer (final concentrations: 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 100 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and antisera or competitor DNA at room temperature for 30 min. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the reaction immediately following the above reagents. The incubation was carried out for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10× gel loading dye. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in TGE buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 1.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5). The protein-DNA complexes were visualized by auto-radiography. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study were as follows: wRD/wAP-1, 5′-TAAGTGATGACTCACCATTGC-3′; wRD/mAP-1, AAGTGATGGCGCACCATTGC-3′; mRD/wAP-1, 5′-TAAGTGATGACTCTGCATTGC-3′. The mutated nucleotides are in boldface type. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using the Taqman Reverse Transcription reagents (Roche Applied Science). PCRs were performed according to the real time PCR machine manufacturer's instructions (DNA Engine Opticon, MJ Research Inc.), which allow real time quantitative detection of the PCR product by measuring the increase in SYBR green fluorescence caused by binding of SYBR green to double-stranded DNA. The SYBR kit for PCRs was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primers for human AP-1, Cbfa1/Runx2, and β-actin were designed using the PrimerExpress software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

DNA-protein complexes were collected by precipitation with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) for 2 h, washed three times with HKMG buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis.

The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking in Tween-Tris-buffered saline (0.1% Tween 20, 138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was exposed to primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with appropriate eukaryotic expression vectors. Then cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were scraped and were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was precleared by the addition of either 1 μg of rabbit IgG or 1 μg of mouse IgG and 20 μl of protein AG-agarose, incubating for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuging to pellet the agarose. Equal amounts of lysates were mixed with either 1 μg of monoclonal or 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies and 20 μl of protein AG-agarose. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer. Next, the samples were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min. Both precleared lysates and immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies as described above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was carried out using the ChIP kit from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with medium containing 1% formaldehyde. Cells were then washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors for 10 min on ice. Samples were sonicated to reduce the DNA length to 0.1-0.6 kbp, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad reagent. Prior to chromatin immunoprecipitations, the samples were precleared with 100 μl of a 25% (v/v) suspension of DNA-coated protein A/G-agarose. The supernatant was recovered and used directly for immunoprecipitation experiments with appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were mixed with 100 μl of a 25% precoated protein A/G-agarose suspension followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was saved and used for subsequent rechromatin immunoprecipitations. Beads were collected and sequentially washed with 1 ml each of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, and LiCl wash buffer. The beads were then washed twice using 1 ml of TE buffer. The proteins from the immunocomplexes were eluted with SDS-protein loading dye, boiled, and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. For PCR analysis, aliquots (1:100) of total chromatin DNA before immunoprecipitation were saved (input). After immunoprecipitation, the beads were sequentially washed with 1 ml each of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, and LiCl wash buffer as mentioned above. The beads were then washed twice using 1 ml of TE buffer. The immunocomplexes were eluted two times by adding a 250-μl aliquot of a freshly prepared solution of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. The samples were added with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl, and the cross-linking reaction was reversed by a 6-h incubation at 65 °C. Further, the samples were digested with proteinase K (10 mg/ml) at 42 °C for 1 h, and DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extractions. The DNA was precipitated with two volumes of ethanol using 1 μl of 20 mg/ml glycogen as carrier. The input lysates were also processed as above. The DNA was resuspended in water and used for semiquantitative PCR. The sequences of the oligonucleotides of the human collagenase-3 promoter used in this study were as follows: proximal RD/AP-1 (sense), 5′-GTCGCCACGTAAGCATGTTT-3′; proximal RD/AP-1 (antisense), 5′-CATCTTGAATGGTGGTGCCT-3′; distal RD (sense), 5′-CCATAAATATGCTGAGGCCG-3′; and distal RD (antisense), 5′-GGTTTCCACTTCCTAGTCAC-3′. The RD and AP-1 Sites Are Necessary for TGF-β1-stimulated Collagenase-3 Promoter Activity—We have previously shown that TGF-β1 stimulates collagenase-3 expression in MDAMB231 cells and that this also requires de novo protein synthesis (18Selvamurugan N. Fung Z. Partridge N.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we show the molecular mechanisms responsible for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity in these cells. The collagenase-3 promoter region includes consensus binding sites for several DNA-binding proteins, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, Smad binding element, RD, p53, PEA-3, AP-2, and AP-1. Previously, we deleted regions of the rat collagenase-3 promoter from the 5′-end and placed the resulting promoter sequences 5′ of the CAT gene (19Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the TGF-β1-responsive region in the collagenase-3 promoter, we have transiently transfected longer collagenase-3 promoter constructs into MDA-MB231 cells, and CAT assays were carried out. We have found that the TGF-β1 response region was retained only within the 148 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional site (18Selvamurugan N. Fung Z. Partridge N.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the -148 collagenase-3 promoter region, there are four consensus sites, namely a RD site, a p53 site, a PEA-3 site, and an AP-1 site, which are highly conserved both in sequence and location in both the human and rat collagenase-3 promoters. The RD binding site is identical to a Cbfa/Runx binding site, and the Cbfa/Runx transcription factors can bind to this site (18Selvamurugan N. Fung Z. Partridge N.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol.

The collagenase-3 promoter also contains another RD site (proximal) overlapping with the AP-1 site, and its sequences (ACCAC) are similar to the Cbfa/Runx consensus site, ACC(A/G)CA. Although the AP-1 site is conserved among the human and rat collagenase-3 genes, the proximal RD site overlapping with the AP-1 site is located in the opposite orientation and on the opposite strand (Fig. 1A). Since the RD site acts as an enhancer (23Banerjee C. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4968-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the proximal RD site could also be a functional element in mediating the TGF-β1 response. In order to analyze the specific response elements involved in TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity in MDAMB231 cells, we have made collagenase-3 promoter constructs having mutations at either the distal RD or the proximal RD or the AP-1 sites. These promoter constructs were transiently transfected into MDA-MB231 cells, and CAT activity was assessed in these cells. Mutation of both the proximal RD and AP-1 sites inhibited basal expression, whereas mutation of any one of the sites (the distal RD site or the proximal RD site or the AP-1 site) was enough to cause a significant loss of TGF-β1 response for collagenase-3 promoter activity in the breast cancer cells (Fig. 1B). Hence, these results suggest that the distal RD and the proximal RD/AP-1 sites are necessary for full TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity in MDAMB231 cells. It is also interesting to note from the transfection experiments that mutation of any one of the sites (distal RD, proximal RD, and AP-1) abolished TGF-β1 response, suggesting that TGF-β1 stimulates differential gene expression and formation of a stable protein complex between these sites. TGF-β1 Stimulates Differential Expression of the AP-1 Factors at the Proximal RD/AP-1 Site—To define the contributions of transcription factors binding to the proximal RD/AP-1 site for TGF-β1-stimulated collagenase-3 promoter activity, nuclear extracts were prepared from control or TGF-β1-treated (1 h) MDA-MB231 cells, and gel mobility assays were performed with labeled human proximal RD/AP-1 site probe. Fig. 2A demonstrates that proteins in both control and TGF-β1-treated nuclear extracts were able to bind to the human collagenase-3 RD/AP-1 site, but significantly more protein-DNA complex was produced when extract from TGF-β1-treated cells was used, as evidenced by the greater intensity of the two shifted complexes. To investigate differential expression of Fos and Jun family members bound to the RD/AP-1 site, nuclear extracts were preincubated with an antibody specific to either Fos or Jun family members. Among the Fos family members, c-Fos, Fra1, and Fra2 were neither significantly down-regulated nor up-regulated by TGF-β1, as evidenced by no significant changes in the level of shifted complexes. There was a marginal decrease in the amount of shifted complexes by FosB antibody in TGF-β1-treated nuclear extracts. The Fra1 antibody increased the amount of shifted complexes only in the control nuclear extracts. Among the Jun family members, the antibody specific to c-Jun caused a supershift complex in both control and TGF-β"
https://openalex.org/W2162471107,"Many types of cells compensate for induced alterations in the length of one cell cycle phase (G1, S, or G2) by altering the lengths of the other phases. Here we show that, when cells in Drosophila wing discs are delayed in G1, they maintain normal division rates by accelerating passage through S and G2. Similarly, when G2-->M progression is retarded, G1-->S progression accelerates. This compensation mechanism employs negative feedback in which the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk1 and Cdk2 downregulate the transcription factor dE2F1. dE2F1, in turn, positively regulates cyclin E and string/cdc25, which activate the Cdks to drive cell cycle progression. This homeostatic mechanism coordinates rates of G1-->S and G2-->M progression, maintaining normal rates of proliferation when cell cycle controls are perturbed (e.g., by ectopic Dacapo, dWee1, dMyc, or Rheb). Without dE2F1, the compensatory mechanism fails, and treatments that alter Cdk activity cause aberrant cell cycle timing and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1986754406,"Although regulation of chondrogenesis and cartilage development by Wnt signaling is well established, the function of Wnt in the maintenance and destruction of cartilage remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the involvement and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling in cartilage destruction. We found that interleukin-1β, the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction, induces expression of Wnt-5a and -7a in primary culture articular chondrocytes. The level of β-catenin was also increased in chondrocytes of arthritic cartilage, suggesting the association of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with arthritic cartilage destruction. In addition, our results show that Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation and inhibits NO-induced apoptosis of primary culture articular chondrocytes. Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating transcriptional activity of β-catenin, whereas NO-induced apoptosis is inhibited via the activation of cell survival signaling, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, which block apoptotic signaling cascade. Our results collectively suggest that Wnt-7a is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via different mechanisms.

Our results collectively suggest that Wnt-7a is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via different mechanisms. Cartilage development is initiated by the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes. Chondrogenesis is induced by precartilage condensation, which requires increased cell-cell adhesion mediated by N-cadherin (1DeLise A.M. Fisher L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Precartilage condensation develops into cartilage nodules in which differentiated chondrocytes are located. Chondrocytes express cartilage-specific matrix molecules, such as type II collagen, with a loss of cell-cell contacts (1DeLise A.M. Fisher L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Both cell-cell adhesion (2Oberlender S.A. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and loss of cell-cell contacts (3Tufan A.C. Tuan R.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) during precartilage condensation and cartilage nodule formation appear necessary for chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis is additionally regulated by a variety of soluble factors including the Wnt family of proteins (1DeLise A.M. Fisher L. Tuan R.S. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 309-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Several members of Wnt family are expressed and differentially regulate cartilage development (1DeLise A.M. Fisher L. Tuan R.S.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Rudnicki J.A. Brown A.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Tufan A.C. Daumer K.M. DeLise A.M. Tuan R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is suggested that stabilization of cell-cell adhesion by the sustained expression of N-cadherin and β-catenin induced by Wnt-7a is responsible for the inhibition of chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells (3Tufan A.C. Tuan R.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Tufan A.C. Daumer K.M. DeLise A.M. Tuan R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, many of cellular effects regulated by Wnt signals are exerted by the modulation of β-catenin, which acts as a transcriptional co-activator (10Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Wnt signals inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3β, which inhibits proteolysis and facilitates cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin. Accumulated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus in association with members of the T cell factor (Tcf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tcf, T cell factor; Lef, lymphoid enhancer factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; I-κB, inhibitory κB; PI, phosphatidylinositol; RT, reverse transcription; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated nick end labeling; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKC, protein kinase C; OA, osteoarthritic; IL, interleukin.1The abbreviations used are: Tcf, T cell factor; Lef, lymphoid enhancer factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; I-κB, inhibitory κB; PI, phosphatidylinositol; RT, reverse transcription; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated nick end labeling; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKC, protein kinase C; OA, osteoarthritic; IL, interleukin./lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef) family of transcription factors to stimulate transcription of target genes.Differentiated chondrocytes in articular cartilage maintain homeostasis by synthesizing cartilage-specific matrix molecules. However, this homeostasis is destroyed during pathogenesis of cartilage disease, such as arthritis. Cartilage destruction during arthritis involves the loss of differentiated phenotype (dedifferentiation) and apoptotic death of chondrocytes, which is caused by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine such as interleukin (IL)-1β (12Sandell L.J. Aigner T. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 13Ghosh P. Smith M. Biogerontology. 2002; 3: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is believed that production of NO by pro-inflammatory cytokines plays an important role in apoptosis and dedifferentiation of arthritic articular chondrocytes (14Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Abramson S.B. Attur M. Amin A.R. Clancy R. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2001; 3: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Previous reports from our group show that apoptosis and dedifferentiation induced by NO are regulated by a complicated protein kinase signaling cascade, including down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt, activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase, and inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) α and ζ (16Kim S.-J.

This possibility is indirectly supported by the observation that several Wnt proteins (Wnt-1, -2, -5a, -10b, -11, and -13) and frizzled receptors (frizzled-2, -3, -5, -6, and -7) are expressed in synovial tissue of arthritic cartilage (22Sen M. Lauterbach K. El-Gabalawy H. Firestein G.S. Corr M. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2791-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, a secreted frizzled-related protein (FrzB-2) that acts as an antagonist for the frizzled receptor is strongly expressed in osteoarthritic cartilage and may regulate chondrocyte apoptosis (23James I.E. Kumar S. Barnes M.R. Gress C.J. Hand A.T. Dodds R.A. Connor J.R. Bradley B.R. Campbell D.A. Grabill S.E. Williams K. Blake S.M. Gowen M. Lark M.W. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 452-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A previous report from our group also indicated that chondrocytes express low level of β-catenin, and accumulation of β-catenin is sufficient to cause dedifferentiation of chondrocytes (24Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that Wnt signaling is involved in cartilage destruction. A number of earlier studies also demonstrate that the Wnt signal prevents apoptosis in various cell types (25Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 26Longo K.A. Kennell J.A. Ochocinska M.J. Ross S.E. Wright W.S. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol.

However, there is currently no evidence to confirm direct roles for Wnt proteins in cartilage destruction, such as involvement in regulation of apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. In this study, we investigated the roles and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt-7a in the maintenance of differentiated phenotype of primary culture rabbit articular chondrocytes and NO-induced apoptosis of articular chondrocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Specimens—Human osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage was obtained from 13 female patients (aged between 51 and 72 years) undergoing arthroplasty for the osteoarthritic knee joints. Transfer of material was approved by the appropriate Human Subjects Committees. All of the cases satisfied the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee (27Altman R. Asch E. Bloch D. Bole G. Borenstein D. Brandt K. Christy W. Cooke T.D. Greenwald R. Hochberg M. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar), and cases of secondary osteoarthritis and inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. Cartilage tissues were sampled down to the subchondral bone from tibial plateau of each specimen within 60 min of operation and treated for immunohistochemistry as described below.Primary Culture of Articular Chondrocytes—Articular chondrocytes from cartilage slices of 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits were isolated with 0.2% collagenase type II, as reported previously (28Yoon Y.-M.

The cells were treated with Wnt-7a conditioned medium in the absence or presence of various pharmacological reagents, as specified in each experiment. Redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocyte by a serial subculture was induced by three-dimensional culture in alginate gel beads, as described earlier (28Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W.

De- and re-differentiation of chondrocytes were determined by examining the suppression of type II collagen and the onset of type I collagen expression with Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal antibody against type II collagen (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes was caused by maintaining primary chondrocytes as micromass culture as described by Stanton et al. (33Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and subsequent determination of type X collagen expression (29Kitagaki J. Iwamoto M. Liu J.G. Tamamura Y. Pacifci M.

Briefly, stable mouse fibroblast L929 cell lines expressing mouse Wnt-7a or empty vector were generated by transfection of L929 cells with Wnt-7a cDNA and empty vector, respectively. Expression of Wnt-7a was confirmed by RT-PCR. After growing to 90% confluency, control and Wnt-expressing L929 cells were washed and maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 36 h. The conditioned media were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min followed by filtration (0.2-μm pore size) and concentrated 20 times by ultrafiltration in Amicon-stirred cells (Millipore) using a YM membrane with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off.Immunocytochemistry and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cartilage tissue and alginate gel beads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated with graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4-μm thickness. The sections were stained by standard procedures using mouse monoclonal antibodies against type II collagen (Chemicon) or β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and visualized by developing with a kit purchased from DAKO Co. (Carpinteria, CA) (24Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S.

Sequence of primers and PCR conditions were summarized in Table I. In case of Wnt genes, the primers were designed based on the sequence of human homologue and sequencing of PCR products for Wnt-5a and -7a showed 92 and 94% homology to human Wnt-5a and -7a, respectively (data not shown).Table IOligonucleotide primers and PCR conditionsGeneSequenceProductTmbp°CType I collagenSense5′-ggctttcctggagagaaagg-3′44162Antisense5′-atagaaccagcagggccagg-3′Type II collagenSense5′-gaccccatgcagtacatgcg-3′37062Antisense5′-agccgccattgatggtctcc-3′Type X collagenSense5′-tgagaggagaacaaggtattcctgga-3′40850Antisense5′-tttcccctttctgtccactcacacca-3′Wnt-5aSense5′-acgctaagggttcctatgaga-3′45252Antisense5′-catagcagcaccagtgaaact-3′Wnt-7aSense5′-aagatcctggaggagaacatgaagctggag-3′45251Antisense5′-gctgcacgtgttacacttgacatagcagc-3′GAPDHSense5′-tcaccatcttccaggagcga-3′29950Antisense5′-cacaatgccgaagtggtcgt-3′ Open table in a new tab Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Plasmids (2 μg) bearing dominant negative Tcf-4, a deletion mutant lacking the N-terminal 30 amino acids (31Korinek V Barker N.

Adenovirus expressing full-length Lef-1 and green fluorescent protein under different cytomegalovirus promoters was constructed using the adenovirus construction kit provided by Dr. B. Bogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). Infected or transfected cells were cultured for 36 h prior to treatment with other reagents. To determine β-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity, the cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of Tcf/Lef reporter gene, TOPFLASH (optimal Lef-binding site) or FOPFLASH (mutated Lef-binding site) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and l μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity (24Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K.

In this study, apoptotic cells were determined by TUNEL assay or quantified by counting surviving cells using a methylthiazoletetrazolium assay kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Activation of caspase-3 in articular chondrocytes was determined by measuring absorbance of the cleaved synthetic substrate of caspase-3, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chromophore p-nitroaniline, as described earlier (16Kim S.-J.

Following centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, 500 μg of proteins from supernatant were incubated overnight with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). PI 3-kinase activity was determined by using the immune complex, as described previously (20Oh C.-D. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

Briefly, immune complexes were resuspended in 45 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA), and the kinase reaction was initiated by adding 200 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample) at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. The reaction products were extracted using 200 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1) and resolved on a thin layer chromatography silica plate coated with potassium oxalate in solvent containing CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). The PI 3-kinase reaction product (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) was identified by autoradiography.Western Blot Analysis—Chondrocytes were lysed on ice for 30 min with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors, as described above. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies were employed to detect proteins: mouse anti-type II collagen monoclonal (Chemicon), mouse monoclonal antibodies against β-catenin, ERK-1/-2 or PKCα (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal antibody against I-κB or PKCζ, mouse monoclonal against p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal antibody against Akt, phosphorylated Akt, and phosphorylated p38 kinase from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).RESULTSExpression of Wnt and β-Catenin in Articular Chondrocytes and Cartilage—In addition to the regulation of chondrogenesis and limb development, several lines of evidence indirectly suggest that Wnt signaling is involved in cartilage destruction (22Sen M.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 452-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous observation indicated that chondrocytes express low levels of β-catenin, a downstream molecule of Wnt signaling, and accumulation of β-catenin causes dedifferentiation of chondrocytes (24Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, there is currently no evidence to confirm direct roles for Wnt proteins in cartilage destruction. In an attempt to examine whether Wnt signaling is associated with cartilage destruction such as dedifferentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes, we first compared the β-catenin protein level between undamaged region of OA cartilage, which has a smooth surface, and the OA-affected damaged region (Fig. 1A). As expected, OA-affected cartilage showed significantly reduced staining for type II collagen and Alcian blue (Fig. 1B). Undamaged regions of the OA cartilage showed undetectable levels of the β-catenin, whereas the β-catenin level was significantly increased in the OA-affected damaged region. Positive staining of β-catenin was more evident in the deep zone than in the superficial zone of OA cartilage. Similar results were observed in other OA tissues examined (11 tissues from total 13 samples) (data not shown). We also tested expression of various Wnt molecules in pathogenic condition of primary culture chondrocytes using IL-1β, which is the primary inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction. Consistent with our previous observation (24Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), IL-1β increased β-catenin levels with a concomitant cessation of type II collagen expression (Fig. 1C). IL-1β also caused a significant increase of Wnt-5a and -7a transcript levels in primary culture chondrocytes, which is an opposite pattern of type II collagen expression (Fig. 1C). Other Wnt genes examined in this study (i.e. Wnt-1, -2, -3a, -4, -5b, and -10b) are barely detectable in cells treated with IL-1β up to 24 h, as determined by various PCR conditions (data not shown).Wnt-7a Triggers Dedifferentiation of Primary Culture Articular Chondrocyte—Because the above results suggest a possibility that Wnt-5a and -7a cause a loss of differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes via β-catenin signaling, we investigated the effects of Wnt-7a on maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of primary culture articular chondrocytes. We used conditioned medium for Wnt-7a from L929 cells that secrete Wnt-7a protein. The data presented in Fig. 2A show that Wnt-7a suppressed type II collagen expression and synthesis of sulfated proteoglycan. The number of type II collagen-expressing chondrocytes was dramatically reduced upon Wnt-7a treatment (Fig. 2B). Wnt-7a also caused the onset of type I collagen expression (Fig. 2C). Expression of type X collagen, a marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, was barely detectable in primary culture chondrocyte, and its expression pattern was not altered by Wnt-7a treatment (Fig. 2C). Therefore, suppression of type II collagen expression, induction of type I collagen expression, and no effects on type X collagen expression by Wnt-7a indicate that Wnt-7a causes dedifferentiation of primary culture articular chondrocytes. Wnt-7a also inhibited the redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. As depicted in Fig. 2D, three-dimensional culture of passage 4 cells, which do not express type II collagen, resulted in re-expression of type II collagen in alginate gel. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the addition of Wnt-7a completely abolished re-expression of type II collagen. The above results indicate that Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes and also blocks redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes.Fig. 2Wnt-7a causes dedifferentiation and inhibits redifferentiation of articular chondrocytes.A, primary culture articular chondrocytes were treated with the indicated volumes (μl) of control or Wnt-7a conditioned medium for 48 h. Type II collagen expression (left panel) and sulfated proteoglycan synthesis (right panel) were determined by Western blotting and Alcian blue staining, respectively. B, type II collagen expressing cells were identified by immunostaining from cells treated with 100 μl of control or Wnt-7a conditioned medium for 48 h. C, chondrocytes were cultured in the presence of control (100 μl) or Wnt-7a (100 or 200 μl) conditioned medium for 48 h (upper panel), and expression levels of type I collagen (Col-I), type II collagen (Col-II), type X collagen (Col-X), and GAPDH were determined by RT-PCR. As positive or negative controls for type I and X collagens, chondrocytes were cultured at passage (P) 0 and 4 (middle panel) or maintained as micromass culture for 15 days to induce hypertrophy (H, lower panel). Expression patterns of type I, type II, and type X collagen were determined by RT-PCR. D, chondrocytes were cultured as a monolayer (M) at passage 0 or 4. Passage 4 cells were three-dimensionally cultured for 4 days in alginate gel in the presence of 100 μl of control or Wnt-7a conditioned medium. Type II collagen was detected by Western blot analysis (upper panel) or immunohistochemistry from sections of alginate gel (lower panel). ERK was employed as loading controls. The data from a typical experiment are presented from at least five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Wnt-7a Inhibits Type II Collagen Expression by Stimulating Transcriptional Activity of β-Catenin—We investigated the regulatory mech"

Kinase-inactive mutant IRAK is still phosphorylated in response to IL-1 stimulation when it is transfected into IRAK-deficient cells, suggesting that there must be an IRAK kinase in the pathway. The fact that IRAK4, another IRAK family member necessary for the IL-1 pathway, is able to phosphorylate IRAK in vitro suggests that IRAK4 might be the IRAK kinase. However, we now found that the IRAK4 kinase-inactive mutant had the same ability as the wild-type IRAK4 in restoring IL-1-mediated signaling in human IRAK4-deficient cells, including NFκB-dependent reporter gene expression, the activation of NFκB and JNK, and endogenous IL-8 gene expression. These results strongly indicate that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 is not necessary for IL-1 signaling. Furthermore, we showed that the kinase activity of IRAK4 was not necessary for IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation, suggesting that IRAK phosphorylation can probably be achieved either by autophosphorylation or by trans-phosphorylation through IRAK4. In support of this, only the impairment of the kinase activity of both IRAK and IRAK4 efficiently abolished the IL-1 pathway, demonstrating that the kinase activity of IRAK and IRAK4 is redundant for IL-1-mediated signaling. Moreover, consistent with the fact that IRAK4 is a necessary component of the IL-1 pathway, we found that IRAK4 was required for the efficient recruitment of IRAK to the IL-1 receptor complex.

This superfamily can be divided into two main subgroups based on their extracellular domains, the Ig-containing receptors (1Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L.

IL-1 has been demonstrated to be one of the key orchestrators of the immune response, eliciting a wide range of biological responses, including fever, lymphocyte activation, and leukocyte infusion to the site of injury and infection (3Dinarello C.A.

The IL-1R/TLR superfamily delivers biological activities mainly by activating the transcription of various genes in different target cells. Tremendous effort has been devoted to understanding the signaling pathways mediated by this receptor superfamily. Due to the similarities in their cytoplasmic domains, these receptors employ related yet distinct signaling components and downstream pathways. Because IL-1R was the first discovered receptor in this superfamily, the IL-1-mediated signaling pathway serves as a “prototype” for other family members. Genetic and biochemical studies revealed that IL-1R mediates a very complex pathway, involving a cascade of kinases organized by multiple adapter molecules into sequential signaling complexes, leading to the activation of the transcription factors NFκB, activating transcription factor, and AP-1 (8Barnes P.J.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of the receptor complex (Complex I). During the formation of Complex I, IRAK is phosphorylated, which creates an interface for its interaction with adapter Pellino 1 (11Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar). The formation of Pellino 1-IRAK4-IRAK-TRAF6 causes conformational changes in the receptor complex (Complex I), releasing these signaling molecules from the receptor. The released components then interact with the membrane-bound preassociated TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 (12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of Complex II (IRAK-TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2). TAK1 and TAB2 are phosphorylated in the membrane-bound Complex II, triggering the dissociation and translocation of TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 (Complex III) from the membrane to the cytosol. The translocated Complex III interacts with additional factors in the cytosol, leading to TAK1 activation. The activation of TAK1 eventually leads to the activation of IκB kinase, in turn leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins and liberation of NFκB to activate transcription in the nucleus (21Mercurio F.

Activated TAK1 has also been implicated in the IL-1-induced activation of MKK6 and JNK (25Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), leading to the activation of other transcription factors, including activating transcription factor and AP1, thereby also activating gene transcription. Although the above model of the IL-1 pathway is well supported by our published studies and work from other groups, the detailed signaling mechanism for the pathway is still unclear. We recently further investigated the formation and activation of the IL-1 receptor complex (Complex I), especially regarding the mechanism of IRAK and IRAK4 in the receptor complex. IRAK is hyperphosphorylated at the receptor complex. The phosphorylation of IRAK is likely to play an important role in IL-1-mediated signaling, although the kinase activity of IRAK is dispensable for its function (19Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that kinase-inactive mutant IRAK is still phosphorylated in response to IL-1 stimulation when it is transfected into IRAK-null cells, suggesting that there must be an IRAK kinase in the pathway (19Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that another member of the IRAK family, IRAK4, is likely to function as the IRAK kinase. Severe impairment of IL-1R/TLR-mediated signaling is observed in mice lacking IRAK4 and in human patients deficient in IRAK4 (16Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zhang S. Arditi M. Gallin J.I. Vogel S.N. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRAK4 is able to phosphorylate IRAK in vitro (16Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been postulated that IRAK4 is recruited to the IL-1 receptor upon IL-1 stimulation, where it is activated, leading to the phosphorylation of IRAK. However, we now found that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 is dispensable for IL-1-mediated signaling. The presence of kinase activity from either IRAK or IRAK4 is sufficient to phosphorylate IRAK. Although IRAK4 is not necessary for IRAK phosphorylation, IRAK4 facilitates the recruitment of IRAK to the IL-1 receptor complex.

Recombinant Plasmids and Transfection—pE-selectin-luc, an NFκB-dependent E-selectin-luciferase reporter plasmid, and AP-1-dependent-luciferase reporter construct were described by Woronicz et al. (23Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type, kinase-inactive (KK213AA, two lysine residues in the ATP binding pocket were mutated to alanine, abbreviated as IRAK4KD) and truncated (1-191aa) IRAK-4 cDNA were cloned into the retrovirus vector, pBabe-puro. Transfection of the IRAK-4-deficient fibroblasts was performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Transfection solution was prepared by mixing 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent in 100 μl of serum-free medium. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the mixture was added to tissue culture wells containing 1 × 106 cells in 2 ml of complete culture medium. Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells that were not treated or treated with IL-1 (100 units/ml) were lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 μm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of antibody or preimmune serum (negative control) for 2 h followed by a 2-h incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (prewashed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a 1:1 ratio). After incubation, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and analyzed by immunoblotting. Reporter Assays—2 × 105 cells were transfected by the same procedure as described above with 1 μg of pE-selectin-luc, 1 μg of pSV2-β-galactosidase, and 100 ng of each expression construct. After 48 h, the cells were split onto two 35-mm plates and stimulated with IL-1 the next day for 4 h before harvest. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined by using the luciferase assay system and chemiluminescent reagents from Promega (Madison, WI). Gel Shift Assays and Northern blotting—An NFκB binding site (5′-GAGCAGAGGGAAATTCCGTAACTT-3′) from the IP-10 gene was used as a probe. Complementary oligonucleotides, end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and [γ-32P]ATP, were annealed by slow cooling. Approximately 20,000 cpm of probe were used per assay. Whole cell extracts were used for the assay. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 20 min in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. For Northern analysis, total RNA was isolated by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Appropriate gene-specific probes were made with a random priming kit (Amersham Biosciences). Transfers to the positively charged nylon membrane Hybond-N were performed according to the procedure provided by Amersham Biosciences.

However, it is unclear whether the kinase activity of IRAK4 is necessary for the pathway. To address this question, increasing amounts of DNA of the human wild-type (IRAK4wt) and kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4 (KK213AA, abbreviated as IRAK4KD) were co-transfected into human IRAK4-deficient cells with NFκB-dependent-E-selectin-luc and AP-1-dependent-luc reporter constructs. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type (IRAK4wt) and the kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4 (IRAK4KD) displayed similar ability in restoring the IL-1-induced NFκB- and AP-1-dependent luciferase activity, suggesting that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 is not necessary for IL-1 signaling. We then compared the ability of IRAK4KD (kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4) with IRAK4wt (wild-type IRAK4) in restoring IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK activation. Equal amounts of human IRAK4wt and IRAK4KD were stably co-transfected with pBaBePURO into human IRAK4-deficient cells. The puromycin-resistant clones were pooled and then either untreated or treated with IL-1 for the indicated times followed by NFκB gel shift assay and Western analysis with anti-phospho-JNK. As shown in Fig. 3, IRAK4wt (wild-type IRAK4) and IRAK4KD (kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4) restored similar levels of NFκB and JNK activation in human IRAK4-deficient cells in response to IL-1 stimulation, confirming that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 is dispensable for IL-1-mediated signaling. We also examined IL-1-induced gene expression in human IRAK4-deficient cells stably transfected with either IRAK4wt (human wild-type IRAK4) or IRAK4KD (human kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4). As shown in Fig. 4, the kinase inactive mutant IRAK4 (IRAK4KD) was able to restore similar levels of IL-8 gene expression in response to IL-1 stimulation as compared with wild-type IRAK4 (IRAK4wt). Taken together, the above results clearly demonstrate that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 is not necessary for IL-1-mediated signaling pathway. The Kinase Activity of Human IRAK and IRAK4 Is Redundant for IL-1-mediated Signaling—We have previously taken a genetic approach to study IL-1-dependent signaling pathways; through random mutagenesis, we generated IL-1-unresponsive cell lines lacking specific components of the pathways from human embryonic kidney 293 cells (19Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutant cell line I1A, which lacks both IRAK protein and mRNA, has been used effectively to study structure-function relationships of IRAK in IL-1-dependent signaling. Neither NFκB nor JNK is activated in IL-1-treated I1A cells, but these responses are restored in I1A-IRAK cells, indicating that IRAK is required for both. However, the kinase activity of IRAK is not required for IL-1-dependent signaling since kinase-dead IRAK mutants were still able to restore IL-1 responsiveness. The fact that the kinase-inactive mutant IRAK is still phosphorylated in response to IL-1 stimulation when it is transfected into I1A cells suggests that there must be an IRAK kinase in the pathway (19Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As IRAK4 was able to phosphorylate IRAK in vitro, it was suggested that IRAK4 might be the IRAK kinase. To examine the role of IRAK4 in IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation, we examined IL-1-induced IRAK modification in human IRAK4-deficient cells stably transfected with wild-type IRAK4 and kinase-inactive IRAK4 mutant. As shown in Fig. 5, IRAK was not phosphorylated or ubiquitinated upon IL-1 stimulation in IRAK4-deficient cells transfected with vector DNA (Vector). Transfection of wild-type IRAK4 (IRAK4wt) into the IRAK4-deficient cells restored IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation and ubiquitination in these cells. Interestingly, IL-1-induced IRAK modification was also restored in IRAK4-deficient cells transfected with the kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4 (IRAK4KD), indicating that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 is not necessary for IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation. The observed IRAK modification in IRAK4-deficeint cells stably transfected with the kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4 could very well be due to IRAK auto-phosphorylation in response to IL-1 stimulation. Taken together, the above results showed that although both human IRAK and IRAK4 are required for IL-1 signaling, their kinase activity is not necessary for the pathway, suggesting that the kinase activity of human IRAK4 and IRAK might be redundant for IL-1 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected increasing amounts of DNA of IRAK4KD (kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4) into I1A cells either with wild-type IRAK (IRAKwt) or kinase-inactive mutant IRAK (K239A, abbreviated as IRAKmt). Interestingly, although the kinase-inactive mutant IRAK4 (IRAK4KD) had minimum effect on E-selectin-promoter-driven luciferase activity when it is cotransfected with wild-type IRAK (IRAKwt) into the I1A cells, the IRAK4 mutant (IRAK4KD) efficiently inhibited the luciferase activity upon its co-transfection with the kinase-inactive mutant IRAK (IRAKmt) into the I1A cells (Fig. 6). These results showed that only the impairment of the kinase activity of both IRAK and IRAK4 efficiently abolished the IL-1 pathway, suggesting that the kinase activity of human IRAK and IRAK4 is probably indeed redundant for IL-1-mediated signaling. IRAK4 Facilitates the Recruitment of IRAK to the IL-1 Receptor Complex—Previous studies show that upon IL-1 stimulation, the adapter molecules MyD88 and Tollip are recruited to the IL-1 receptor followed by the recruitment of two serinethreonine kinases, IRAK4 and IRAK, and the adapter TRAF6, resulting in the formation of the receptor complex (Complex I) (11Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar, 12Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, IRAK4 was still efficiently recruited to the receptor in both IRAK-null I1A and MyD88-null I3A cells, indicating that the recruitment of IRAK4 does not require MyD88 or IRAK. On the other hand, IRAK was not recruited to the IL-1 receptor in MyD88-null I3A cells, confirming that MyD88 is responsible for recruiting IRAK to the receptor upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 7A). Taken together, these results indicate that the IL-1-induced recruitment of IRAK4 to the IL-1 receptor is upstream of MyD88. Although the above results clearly indicate that the recruitment of IRAK4 to the IL-1 receptor is upstream and independent of IRAK, we examined the role of IRAK4 in the recruitment of IRAK to the IL-1 receptor. As shown in Fig. 7B, whereas a small amount of IRAK was recruited to the IL-1 receptor in IRAK4-deficient cells upon IL-1 stimulation, transfection of IRAK4 facilitated the recruitment of IRAK to the receptor in these cells. In this report, we showed that IRAK4 kinase-inactive mutant had the same ability as the wild-type IRAK4 in restoring IL-1-mediated signaling in IRAK4-deficient cells, indicating that the kinase activity of IRAK4 is not necessary for the IL-1 pathway. The fact that only the impairment of the kinase activity of both IRAK and IRAK4 efficiently abolished the IL-1 pathway suggests that the kinase activity of IRAK and IRAK4 is probably redundant for IL-1-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we showed that although the kinase activity of IRAK4 was not necessary for IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation, IRAK4 facilitated the recruitment of IRAK to the IL-1 receptor complex. Based on these results, we hypothesize that upon IL-1 stimulation, through receptor adapter molecules, IRAK4 is recruited to the IL-1 receptor, which then facilitates the recruitment of IRAK to the receptor, where IRAK is hyperphosphorylated. The IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation can be achieved either by autophosphorylation or by trans-phosphorylation through IRAK4. The phospho-IRAK then interacts with receptor proximal signaling components TRAF6 and Pellino1 and is subsequently dissociated from the IL-1 receptor, leading to the activation of TAK1 and IκB kinase and the activation of NFκB. This discovery of the redundant kinase activity of IRAK and IRAK4 is not only very important for understanding the basic mechanism of the IL-1 pathway but also has a major impact on the development of anti-inflammatory drugs. Much effort has been devoted toward developing small molecule drugs that can specifically inhibit IRAK4 kinase activity. The results presented here indicate that it is necessary to search for drugs that can inhibit the kinase activity of both IRAK and IRAK4 to efficiently block IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation and subsequent signaling events. One interesting observation from this study is that IRAK4 is recruited to the IL-1 receptor in MyD88- and IRAK-deficient cells upon IL-1 stimulation, indicating that the recruitment of IRAK4 is not only IRAK-independent but also MyD88-independent. It is possible that IRAK4 is directly recruited to the IL-1 receptor without the involvement of adaptors. However, IRAK4 does not contain any sequence similarity to the Toll domain. It is likely that IRAK4 uses an adaptor molecule other than MyD88 to interact with the IL-1 receptor. One possible candidate is adaptor Tollip since it is shown to interact with the IL-1 receptor and IRAK4 upon IL-1 stimulation. Another candidate is adaptor TIRAP/Mal, which is shown to cooperate with MyD88 to mediate Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling (28Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The normal IL-1 signaling observed in TIRAP/Mal-deficient mice could be due to compensatory function between TIRAP/Mal and MyD88. Our results demonstrating the redundancy of the kinase activity of human IRAK4 and IRAK in IL-1R signaling are significantly different from those observed 2E. Lye, C. Mirtsos, N. Suzuki, and W. Yeh, personal communication. in the mouse system. By reconstituting IRAK4-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, they showed that the kinase activity of mouse IRAK4 is required for the optimal transduction of IL-1-induced signals, although they found that IRAK4 is capable of mediating some NFκB activation. The reasons for such discrepancy are unclear. One major difference in our experimental systems is mouse versus human. Another significant difference is cell type, embryonic fibroblasts versus adult fibroblasts, although consistent results are observed between human embryonic kidney 293 cells and human fibroblasts in our experiments. Therefore, it is more likely that the requirement of kinase activity of IRAK4 for the IL-1 signaling might vary from mouse to human, which will greatly affect the strategy in developing small molecule drugs for human patients.

https://openalex.org/W2171297304,"The opening of sarcolemmal and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channels in the heart is believed to mediate ischemic preconditioning, a phenomenon whereby brief periods of ischemia/reperfusion protect the heart against myocardial infarction. Here, we have applied digital epifluorescent microscopy, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, perforated patch clamp electrophysiology, and immunofluorescence/laser confocal microscopy to examine the involvement of KATP channels in cardioprotection afforded by preconditioning. We have shown that adult, stimulated-to-beat, guinea-pig cardiomyocytes survived in sustained hypoxia for approximately 17 min. An episode of 5-min-long hypoxia/5-min-long reoxygenation before sustained hypoxia dramatically increased the duration of cellular survival. Experiments with different antagonists of KATP channels, applied at different times during the experimental protocol, suggested that the opening of sarcolemmal KATP channels at the beginning of sustained hypoxia mediate preconditioning. This conclusion was supported by perforated patch clamp experiments that revealed activation of sarcolemmal KATP channels by preconditioning. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as well as immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscopy showed that the preconditioning is associated with the increase in KATP channel proteins in sarcolemma. Inhibition of trafficking of KATP channel subunits prevented preconditioning without affecting sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia in the absence of preconditioning. We conclude that the preconditioning is mediated by the activation and trafficking of sarcolemmal KATP channels."

So far, TTR has only been found in vertebrates, of which piscine TTR displays the lowest sequence identity with human TTR (47%). Human and piscine TTR bind both thyroid hormones 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) and 3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodo-l-thyronine (thyroxine, T4). Human TTR has higher affinity for T4 than T3, whereas the reverse holds for piscine TTR.

Robbins J. Clin. Lab. Med. 1993; 13: 583-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TTR also transports vitamin A by forming a complex with retinol-binding protein (for reviews, see Refs. 2Schreiber G. Richardson S.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol.

Abagyan R. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 518-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), TTR homologues have only been found in vertebrates and share high sequence identity. Of these orders, piscine TTR has the lowest sequence identity compared with human TTR. The first complete cDNA sequence of a piscine transthyretin homologue was isolated from sea bream (Sparus aurata) and has 47% sequence identity with human TTR (5Fünkenstein B. Perrot V. Brown C.L.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as do the amphibian and avian TTRs. This is in contrast to the marsupial and mammalian proteins, which have higher affinity for T4 (9Yamauchi K. Kasahara T. Hayashi H. Horiuchi R.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In birds, marsupials, and mammals, TTR is expressed both in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain, whereas in reptiles it is expressed only in the choroid plexus. In fish or amphibians the main production is in the liver (2Schreiber G. Richardson S.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol.

This suggests that the binding affinities of TTR changed during evolution. In mammalian TTR, transport of T4 is preferred across the blood-brain barrier, where T4 is converted to the biologically more active T3 hormone (12Schreiber G. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 175: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This evolution may correlate with the evolution of deiodinases, which generate T3 from T4 in a tissue-specific action (12Schreiber G. J.

Single point mutations in human transthyretin give rise to familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), a hereditary form of amyloidosis associated with fibrillar TTR deposits in the peripheral nerves, kidney, spleen, heart, and eye (22Saraiva M.J.

To elucidate the mechanism behind TTR amyloidosis, structural analyses of TTR from other organisms can provide valuable information. This study describes three crystal structures: apo sea bream TTR at 1.75 Å resolution; in complex with T3 at 1.9 Å; and in complex with T4, also at 1.9 Å. The structures are compared with the human, rat, and chicken homologues, and molecular details behind thyroid-hormone binding are discussed. Cloning of Sea Bream TTR—A construct corresponding to the mature sea bream TTR, predicted by SignalP v1.1 (29Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar), was amplified from the full-length cDNA located in a PA20H vector (7Santos C.R. Power D.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2430-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-TTT TTC ATG ACC CCC ACC CCC ACG-3′ (Interactiva Virtual Laboratory). This primer introduces the N-terminal methionine and a BspH1 cleavage site, which changes the first Ala-19 codon GCC to ACC that encodes Thr. The reverse primer 5′-TTT CGA GCT CAC TCG TGT ACG CTG GAG-3′ (Interactiva Virtual Laboratory) introduces a flanking SacI cleavage site following the C-terminal stop codon. After digestion with BspH1 and SacI (New England Biolabs/Amersham Biosciences), the fragment was introduced into a pET24d vector (kindly provided by Gunter Stier, EMBL-Heidelberg, Germany) cleaved with SacI and NcoI using the T4 DNA ligase Ready-To-Go kit (Amersham Biosciences). The ligated vector was used to transform (30Hanahan D. J. Mol.

The plasmids were digested with BamH1 (New England Biolabs), whose cleavage site is situated within the region of the pET24d cloning cassette supposedly replaced by the TTR gene, and used for a second transformation (30Hanahan D.

One colony was selected and grown in Luria Bertani with 30 μg ml-1 kanamycin at 30 °C to A600 nm = 0.9, induced with 0.2 mm isopropylthiogalactoside overnight, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at -20 °C. Frozen cells were thawed and lysed in 10 ml of water that included ∼1 mg of lysozyme and MgCl2 for 10 min. DNase I was added, followed by incubation for another 10 min and centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 10% preparative native PAGE (Model 491 Prep Cell; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.025 m Tris, pH 8.5, and 1.9 m glycine. Protein fractions were analyzed by 20% SDS-PAGE; those containing pure sea bream TTR were pooled, dialysed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, concentrated to 5 mg ml-1 (Centriprep; Amicon) and stored at -20 °C. Crystallization and Data Collection—All crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method (31McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals.

Drops with 8 μl of a 5 mg ml-1 solution of sea bream TTR in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, were mixed with 2 μl of well solution containing 40–44% polyethylene glycol 550 monomethyl ether (MME), 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 26 mm nickel sulfate or cobalt chloride and equilibrated at room temperature. Crystals 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm3 appeared in 7 days and diffracted to 1.75 Å resolution. The crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group P41 with one tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of the two TTR·hormone complexes diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution. Both complexes were crystallized in a similar fashion, i.e. the apo protein was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with a saturated solution of T3 or T4 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, prior to the crystallization trials. All data sets were collected at 100 K from single crystals mounted in nylon loops (32Sauer U.H. Ceska T.A. J. Appl.

The Structure of Piscine Transthyretin—The structure of sea bream TTR was solved using molecular replacement methods with a truncated poly(alanine) model of human TTR (PDB accession code 1F41, Ref. 16Hörnberg A. Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) as a search model. The quality of the initial electron density map was excellent and allowed most side chains of the fish TTR structure to be modeled. The four monomers (A, B, C, and D) comprising the tetramer in the asymmetric unit were refined independently of each other from the start. The final model includes residues A10-A127, B10-B125, C11-C125, D10-D123, 361 water molecules, and one sulfate ion (Fig. 1). In some cases, additional electron density was observed at the N- and C-terminal ends, but the quality did not allow additional residues to be exclusively positioned. The side chains of residues A-Gln-63, C-Glu-61, C-Gln-62, C-His-102, C-Ser-124, D-Gln-62, and D-Gly-101 displayed weak electron density. Seven residues were refined in two well defined conformations: A-Ser-84, A-Asp-96, B-Ser-84, B-Thr-119, C-Asp-96, C-Thr-119, and D-Thr-119. The 361 water molecules were positioned within proper hydrogen-bonding distances (less than 3.4 Å) from the protein with refined temperature factors less than 60 Å2. The four monomers in sea bream TTR are very similar. Root mean square deviations comparing the main chain Cα atoms of residues 12–123 among all monomers varies from 0.27 Å (comparing monomers A and B) to 0.51 Å (comparing monomers A and C). The sulfate ion bridges the main chain carbonyl oxygen of His-102 in the FG loop of monomer A and the Oγ atom of Ser-123 to the main chain nitrogen atom of Ser-124 at the C-terminal end of monomer A. This sulfate ion is also part of the crystal-packing interface forming a salt link to the side chain of Arg-103 in a symmetry-related copy of monomer B (B′). All sulfate atoms are well defined with B-factors of 34–36 Å2 and restrict the mobility at the C-terminal end of monomer A, which could be modeled to the last residue, A-Glu-127. The N terminus of piscine, avian, and reptilian TTR has three additional hydrophilic amino acids, DKH, compared with the eutherian proteins. A chimeric molecule generated from crocodile TTR, in which the N-terminal end was replaced by that from frog, was shown to differ in both the specificity and affinity of T4 and T3 binding. Therefore, it appears that the amino-terminal regions of TTR could influence its thyroid binding properties (13Prapunpoj P. Richardson S.J. Schreiber G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R885-R896Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the sea bream structure, electron density runs through the center of the hormone-binding channel visible at lower contour levels of the electron density maps (Fig. 2). We could not identify the source of this density, but water molecules seem unlikely because the density does not connect to potential hydrogen-bonding partners on the protein. Two possibilities are that the electron density corresponds to residues at the N-terminal end of the protein or to polyethylene glycol molecules present in the crystallization medium. While this work was in revision, a structure of sea bream TTR in a different crystal form was independently reported by Folli et al. (44Folli C. Pasquato N. Ramazzina I. Battistutta R. Zanotti G. Berni R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We find their structure virtually identical to ours with the exception of the positions of the FG loops. There have been controversies about the correct amino acid at position 103 (5Fünkenstein B. Perrot V. Brown C.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 157: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Santos C.R. Power D.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2430-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By sequencing the clone, we would like to correct the original data published in Ref. 7Santos C.R. Power D.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2430-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and confirm that the correct amino acid at position 103 should be an arginine. It should, however, be noted that the structure deposited by Folli et al. is reported to have a glycine at this position. Comparison of Piscine TTR with Other Species—Crystal structures of TTR are available from three other species; human (16Hörnberg A. Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), chicken (20Sunde M. Richardson S.J. Chang L. Pettersson T.M. Schreiber G. Blake C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and rat (21Wojtczak A. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1997; 44: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overall, the structure of sea bream TTR is very similar to those of rat and human with root mean square deviations of 0.62 and 0.71 Å, respectively, when superimposed on residues 12–98 and 104–123. Chicken TTR deviates significantly from fish, human, and rat in the conformation of the α-helix and succeeding EF loop (residues 75–88), and its root mean square deviation to sea bream TTR is 1.3 Å. These differences are most likely caused by a sulfate ion located in the α-helix region of the chicken structure, a different position compared with the sulfate found in sea bream TTR, that binds to the FG-loop (residues His-102 and Arg-103) and C-terminal (residues Ser-123 and Ser-124). Water molecules W1-W36 play a significant role in stabilizing the monomeric (W1-W12), dimeric (W13-W20), and tetrameric (W21-W36) forms of the human protein (16Hörnberg A. Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These water molecules are not strictly conserved in sea bream TTR, but all the corresponding molecules were numbered equivalent to human TTR (W1-W36 in monomers A and B and V1-V36 in monomers C and D) (Fig. 1). One novel water molecule is situated at the edge-strand region of each monomer, which is the only area with significant structural differences between human and piscine TTR. When comparing the two structures, the dissimilarity is already visible at the end of β-strand B, even more so in β-strand C, and most apparent in what corresponds to β-strand D in human TTR. Sea bream TTR lacks a proper β-strand D and instead forms an extended loop region stabilized by a novel water molecule W39 (W40, W139, and W140 in the B, C, and D monomers, respectively). This water molecule bridges the D loop to β-strand A, forming hydrogen bonds to the main chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms of Ile-55 and the main chain nitrogen atom of Val-14 (Fig. 3, A and B). The piscine edge-strand conformation is reminiscent of chicken TTR, which also lacks β-strand D, whereas this area in the rat homologue is more similar to the human protein. An analysis of human mutations associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy compared with a multiple sequence alignment of the TTR sequences from 20 different species shows that only six familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy mutations occur as natural amino acids in other species (4Eneqvist T. Lundberg E. Nilsson L. Abagyan R. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 518-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Leu-68 is found in eight species, Thr-45 in African clawed frog, Asp-42 and Ser-45 in bullfrog, and Leu-30 and Ser-84 in fish. The positions of both Leu-30 and Ser-84 are well defined in the electron density of sea bream TTR, but their structural significance is difficult to interpret because they are situated in regions with additional side chain substitutions compared with the human protein. Hormone Binding to Sea Bream TTR—We have previously shown that the binding properties of T3 and T4 for purified recombinant sea bream TTR are similar to those for the endogenous serum protein in sea bream (4Eneqvist T. Lundberg E. Nilsson L. Abagyan R. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 518-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of human TTR in complex with T4 provide the first detailed description of a thyroid hormone binding to TTR (17Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 45Blake C.C. Oatley S.J. Nature. 1977; 268: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These studies show that the two TTR hormone-binding sites, situated between monomers A, C and B, D, respectively, can be divided in three sections: an inner and outer cavity comprising three symmetry-related pairs of halogen-binding pockets, HBP1 (HBP1′), HBP2 (HBP2′), and HBP3 (HBP3′). The 2-fold symmetry axis of the TTR homotetramer runs in the direction of the hormone-binding channel and coincides with the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis in crystals with the P21212 space group. However, most TTR ligands lack 2-fold symmetry, and subsequently the x-ray structures of human TTR complexes in the P21212 space group have to be refined with the ligand positioned in two symmetry-related conformations with 50% occupancy. This complicates the electron density map interpretation and reduces the accuracy of the model. Recently, aligned thyroxine molecules were presented from structural studies of human and rat TTR crystals with tetramers rather than dimers in the asymmetric unit (46Wojtczak A. Neumann P. Cody V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 47Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these structures show that ligand binding imposes subtle structural differences in the AC dimer compared with the BD dimer that is selected for in the crystal packing of the TTR tetramers. A multitude of structural data about TTR·ligand complexes is available (17Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Combined, these studies show a complicated picture of TTR-ligand interactions where the same ligand can have more than one binding site in the hormone-binding channel. T4 comprises four iodines: I3 and I5 at the tyrosyl ring and I3′ and I5′ at the phenolic ring. In the human TTR·T4 complex, the I3 and I5 iodines are situated at the outer HBP1 site, whereas I3′ and I5′ are situated at the innermost HBP2 and HBP3 sites (17Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 45Blake C.C. Oatley S.J. Nature. 1977; 268: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The polar amino group interacts with the charged residues Lys-15 and Glu-54 at the entrance of the channel. In the structure of T4 in complex with rat TTR, T4 occupies two positions in the AC and BD-binding sites of the tetramer. One position is similar to T4 in the human protein where the phenolic iodines occupy the HBP2/HBP3′ pocket; in the second position the phenolic iodines occupy the HBP3/HBP3′ pocket (47Wojtczak A. Cody V. Luft J.R. Pangborn W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The structure of human TTR in complex with T3 is not known. We have made several attempts to obtain this structure but so far without success. We have collected high resolution diffraction data of both crystals soaked in T3 and of co-crystals obtained at high concentration of T3. In both cases, the determined protein structures represented the apo form of the protein. We did not detect any binding of T3 to human recombinant TTR in the dot-blot analysis, which shows strong binding of T3 to sea bream TTR (4Eneqvist T. Lundberg E. Nilsson L. Abagyan R. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 518-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that binding of T3 to human recombinant TTR is weaker than to the serum TTR protein. The sea bream TTR complexes with T3 and T4 were each studied at 1.90 Å resolution. Generally, hormone binding did not induce any major structural changes and strand D maintained its extended loop conformation. The position of the three and four iodines in T3 and T4, respectively, could be clearly identified from omit maps (Fig. 4). However, the thyronine rings and alanyl moiety are less well defined in both complex structures. As in the previously described human and rat TTR tetramers, the electron density maps display one unique binding mode of the T4 hormone, suggesting that sea bream TTR tetramers are aligned within the crystals. T4 binds similarly to sea bream TTR compared with human and rat TTR. However, the hormone molecule does not reach as deeply into the binding pocket and is situated ∼1 Å closer to the entrance (Fig. 4B). This binding positioned the I3′ and I5′ atoms symmetrically at the halogen-binding pockets HBP2 and HBP2′. Furthermore, the HBP3 and HBP3′ sites do not bind iodine in the piscine TTR·T4 complex. In the TTR·T3 complex, four strong electron density features were observed in the AC-binding site, one of which is situated at the position of the hydroxyl group, O4′,inT4. This site is now occupied to a large extent by the third iodine, I3′, in T3 (Fig. 4C). In this novel T3 conformation, the O4′ group is instead close to the main chain atoms of Leu-109 and -110 (distances are 3.0–3.2 Å). This position cannot be adopted by T4 because it leaves no room for the additional I5′ atom (Fig. 4D). The electron density also shows that a small fraction (∼20%) of T3 is positioned identically to T4. At the BD-binding site, electron density features for only three T3 iodines were found. Thus the T4-binding position is not occupied by T3 in the BD-binding site. As in the piscine TTR·T4 complex, there was no iodine in the HBP3-binding site in the TTR·T3 complex. Further structural studies are needed to elucidate whether HBP3 of piscine TTR comprises a halogen-binding site or not. Superimposing the sea bream TTR·T3 structure with all available human TTR complex structures shows that the novel binding of T3 to piscine TTR has a small resemblance to the binding of pentabromphenol and 2,4,6-tribromphenol to human TTR (53Ghosh M. Meerts I.A. Cook A. Bergman A. Brouwer A. Johnson L.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both bromphenols bind in the so-called “reversed” mode with their hydroxyl group directed toward the opening of the channel. One halogen of each ligand occupies the same position as the hydroxyl group in the human TTR·T4 complex and the phenolic iodine I3′ in the sea bream TTR·T3 complex. With the exception of the number of water molecules within the apo proteins, the hormone-binding channels of sea bream and human TTR appear very similar. The only amino acid difference within the channel is the conservative substitution of Thr-117 in sea bream to Ser in human TTR, situated 4 Å away from the hormone molecule. However, the shape of the hormone-binding channel of sea bream and human TTR is different, which explains the discrepancies in T3- and T4 binding affinities of the two species. The areas of the cavity enclosing the inner phenolic and the outer tyrosyl rings of the hormone are clearly narrower in fish TTR. This is evident upon comparing the distance between two symmetry-related residues at position 108, which is 11.2 Å in sea bream TTR and 12.0Å in human TTR, and between the Cα atoms of two symmetry-related Lys-15 residues, 12.5–12.6 Å in fish TTR compared with 13.5–13.8 Å in human TTR. In addition, the sea bream TTR hormone-binding channel is wider at its entrance, right at the binding site for the alanyl group of the hormone. At the entrance, the distance between two Cα atoms of Glu-54 is 18.9–19.0 Å in sea bream TTR compared with 17.5–17.6 Å in the human protein. These dissimilarities are due in part to a number of amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic core of fish TTR compared with the human protein, including Ile-16 for Val, Leu-30 for Val, Ile-44 for Phe, Ile-55 for Leu, Ile-59 for Thr, Phe-73 for Ile, Leu-109 for Ala. Furthermore, different side chain rotamers of Val-14 and Leu-58 affect the position of the otherwise conserved residues involved in hormone binding. The significantly wider entrance of the hormone-binding channel in combination with its narrower inner and outer cavity provides a structural explanation for the different binding affinities of T3 and T4 to avian and piscine TTR compared with human TTR. The inner phenolic ring of the T3 molecule has only one iodine and is therefore smaller than the phenolic ring of T4 and in its novel position in the outer tyrosyl ring is parallel to the Lys-15 side chains in a conformation optimal for the restricted channel of sea bream TTR. Avian TTR, which also has higher affinity for T3 than T4 (10Chang L. Munro S.L. Richardson S.J. Schreiber G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), displays a similar overall shape as sea bream TTR. We thank Anders Olofsson, Uwe H.

https://openalex.org/W2013728170,"Here we report that bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) is an efficient catalyst of RNA ligation at a 3'-OH/5'-PO(4) nick in a double-stranded RNA or an RNA.DNA hybrid. The critical role of the template strand in approximating the reactive 3'-OH and 5'-PO(4) termini is underscored by the drastic reductions in the RNA-sealing activity of Rnl2 when the duplex substrates contain gaps or flaps instead of nicks. RNA nick joining requires ATP and a divalent cation cofactor (either Mg or Mn). Neither dATP, GTP, CTP, nor UTP can substitute for ATP. We identify by alanine scanning seven functionally important amino acids (Tyr-5, Arg-33, Lys-54, Gln-106, Asp-135, Arg-155, and Ser-170) within the N-terminal nucleotidyl-transferase domain of Rnl2 and impute specific roles for these residues based on the crystal structure of the AMP-bound enzyme. Mutational analysis of 14 conserved residues in the C-terminal domain of Rnl2 identifies 3 amino acids (Arg-266, Asp-292, and Glu-296) as essential for ligase activity. Our findings consolidate the evolutionary connections between bacteriophage Rnl2 and the RNA-editing ligases of kinetoplastid protozoa."
https://openalex.org/W2095094801,"The human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (hSVCT1) mediates sodium-dependent cellular uptake of the essential micronutrient l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C). However, the molecular determinants that control the cell surface expression, subcellular distribution, and dynamics of hSVCT1 remain undefined. To identify molecular determinants involved in hSVCT1 targeting in polarized epithelia, we used live cell imaging approaches to resolve the targeting and trafficking dynamics of hSVCT1 truncation mutants in renal and intestinal cells. Confocal imaging demonstrated that hSVCT1 was expressed at the apical cell surface and video rate measurements revealed hSVCT1 also resided in a heterogeneous population of intracellular organelles with discrete dynamic properties. By progressive truncation of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of hSVCT1, we delimited an essential role for an embedded ten amino acid sequence PICPVFKGFS (amino acids 563-572) in defining the physiological targeting of hSVCT1. Intriguingly, this sequence bears significant homology to recently identified apical targeting motifs in two other sodium-dependent transporters, and we suggest this conservation is reflected topologically through the adoption of a β-turn confirmation in the cytoplasmic C-tail of each transporter. Our results provide the first direct resolution of functional hSVCT1 expression at the apical cell surface of polarized epithelia and define an apical targeting signal of relevance to transporters of diverse substrate specificity.

Confocal imaging demonstrated that hSVCT1 was expressed at the apical cell surface and video rate measurements revealed hSVCT1 also resided in a heterogeneous population of intracellular organelles with discrete dynamic properties. By progressive truncation of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of hSVCT1, we delimited an essential role for an embedded ten amino acid sequence PICPVFKGFS (amino acids 563-572) in defining the physiological targeting of hSVCT1. Intriguingly, this sequence bears significant homology to recently identified apical targeting motifs in two other sodium-dependent transporters, and we suggest this conservation is reflected topologically through the adoption of a β-turn confirmation in the cytoplasmic C-tail of each transporter. Our results provide the first direct resolution of functional hSVCT1 expression at the apical cell surface of polarized epithelia and define an apical targeting signal of relevance to transporters of diverse substrate specificity. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient required for many cellular functions relating to growth and development. Humans have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C and therefore obtain it from dietary sources via absorption through intestinal epithelia. Dietary deficiencies in vitamin C lead to a variety of clinical abnormalities such as scurvy, delayed wound healing, bone and connective tissue disorders, and vasomotor instability (1Packer L. Fuchs J. Vitamin C in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Furthermore recent studies demonstrate an increased intake of vitamin C plays a protective role against cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cataract formation (2Carr A.C. Frei B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 69: 1086-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Two sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters have been identified in humans, sodium-dependent vitamin Ctransporter-1 (hSVCT1, 1The abbreviations used are: hSVCT1, human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR.1The abbreviations used are: hSVCT1, human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR. the product of the SLC23A1 gene) and human SVCT2 (hSVCT2, the product of the SLC23A2 gene), both of which mediate sodium-dependent accumulation of l-ascorbic acid in a variety of expression systems (3Daruwala R.

These transporters display considerable structural and functional homologies: structurally, each protein has a 12 transmembrane spanning topology with cytoplasmic C- and N-terminal domains; functionally, both transporters exhibit high affinity (10-100 μm) for l-ascorbic acid. However, hSVCT1 and hSVCT2 display differential localizations; whereas hSVCT1 expression is confined to epithelia (e.g. kidney, intestine, and liver), hSVCT2 is more widely expressed (5Wang Y.

The abundance of hSVCT1 in renal and intestinal epithelia implies a physiological role in renal reabsorption as well as dietary uptake of vitamin C. To fulfill such roles, Tsukaguchi et al. (9Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) have speculated that SVCT1 is localized to the apical surface of absorptive epithelial, and recent biochemical measurements in polarized CaCo-2 cells (a human colon carcinoma cell line) support such an apical localization of hSVCT1 (7Maulen N.P. Henriquez E.A. Kempe S. Carcamo J.G. Schmid-Kotsas A. Bachem M. Grunert A. Bustamante M.E. Nualart F. Vera J.C. J. Biol.

To date, however, the cellular distribution of hSVCT1 has not been directly visualized in any epithelial cell line, and nothing is known about the mechanisms that dictate hSVCT1 targeting to the (apical) cell surface. Conventionally, molecular determinants that dictate the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and/or their localization at the cell surface comprise short motifs; for example, discrete tyrosine and di-leucine motifs have been identified within the cytoplasmic tail of many basolaterally targeted proteins (10Mellman I.

For apically targeted proteins, sorting mechanisms appear to encompass a wider variety of signals, including post-translational modifications (glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage) or specific determinants within the extracellular, transmembrane, or cytoplasmic domains (12Winckler B.

In order to define the subcellular distribution and targeting of hSVCT1 in live cells, we employed confocal imaging methods to visualize the targeting profile of hSVCT1 in polarized cell lines, derived from kidney (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, MDCK) as well as intestine (CaCo-2). In both epithelia, we show that hSVCT1 is expressed at the apical brush border, although a significant fraction of the full-length protein is retained within a heterogeneous population of intracellular organelles. Using video rate confocal microscopy, these structures were further characterized by their distinctive dynamics. Thereafter, we employed a systematic truncation approach to identify regions within the full-length protein that were crucial for this physiological targeting profile of hSVCT1. Using this method, we identified a region within the C-terminal tail of hSVCT1 that is critical for its export to the apical brush border membrane. By analogy with recent results from other sodium-dependent transporters of disparate substrate specificity (16Cheng C. Glover G. Banker G. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sun A-Q. Salkar R. Sachchidanand X. Shuhua Zeng L. Zhou M.-M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we suggest that topological variants of this motif may play a widespread role as apical determinants of protein targeting. Materials—[14C]Ascorbic acid (13mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The enhanced yellow fluorescent protein vector (EYFP-N1) and red fluorescent protein vector (DsRed2-ER) were from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). Geneticin (G418) was from Invitrogen. Tissue culture cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All other reagents were from Sigma. A fusion protein of the neurotrophin receptor to a C-terminal GFP tag (p75-GFP) was a gift from Dr. Rodriguez-Boulan (Cornell University). Generation of hSVCT1-YFP and Truncated Constructs—The cDNA of the full-length hSVCT1 (1794 bp) was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from CaCo-2 cells using gene-specific primers (Table I) and subcloned into pGEMT vector (Promega). The full-length hSVCT1-YFP fusion protein and truncated hSVCT1-YFP constructs were generated using the specific primer combinations defined in Table I under PCR conditions outlined previously (18Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PCR products and the EYFP-N1 vector were subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and SacII, the products were gel-isolated and ligated together to generate in-frame fusion proteins with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fused to the C terminus of each construct.

For radiolabel uptake and confocal imaging experiments, cells were seeded onto collagen-coated filters (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown until post-confluency. Individual filter dishes were transiently transfected ∼5 days post-confluency with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and then imaged 24-48 h later. For imaging of HuTu-80 cells, cells were grown on sterile glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek). Generation of Stable Cell Lines for Uptake Studies—hSVCT1-YFP-expressing MDCK or HuTu-80 cells were selected with G418 (0.8 mg/ml) for ∼8 weeks, after which hSVCT1 expression was quantified using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA (5 μg) was isolated from stably transfected and untransfected cells and used to generate first-stranded cDNA with hSVCT1 gene-specific primers (Table I) and a superscript First-Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). PCR reactions were loaded onto an agarose gel (0.7%), stained with ethidium bromide, and the intensity of the product band (1794 bp) was quantified by densitometry. For [14C]ascorbic acid uptake experiments, MDCK cells were seeded onto collagen-coated filters and grown to 3-5 days post-confluency. Monolayers were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of [14C]ascorbic acid (30 μm) added to either the apical of basolateral surface of the monolayer. Uptake of ascorbic acid was terminated by addition of ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer and accumulated radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were imaged using a BioRad MRC1024 confocal scanner attached to an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with a ×60 oil and a ×60 water immersion objective for imaging coverslips and filters, respectively. Fluorophores were excited with the 488-nm line of an argon ion-laser, and emitted fluorescence was monitored with a 530 ± 20 nm band-pass (YFP) or 620-nm long-pass filters (DsRed). Fluorescence distribution was quantified using the IDL analysis package (Research Systems, Boulder, CO). For real-time confocal studies, a home-brew confocal microscope (19Callamaras N. Parker I. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 272-279Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was used to record images at 30 Hz (1 frame every 33 ms) with the microscope focused about 2 μm above the coverglass. The data stream was acquired using the VideoSavant processing package (IO Industries, London, ON), and the motion of individual vesicles tracked using the point to point tracking function in Metamorph (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). In all movies, the heterogeneous size and fluorescence intensity of the hSVCT1-containing structures rendered it difficult to simultaneously image each object class without the fluorescence of some particles saturating. This drawback did not preclude particle tracking analyses, as individual data sets were analyzed separately. QuickTime videos of image sequences are appended as Supplementary Materials. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCalibur bench top cytometer (BD Biosciences). MDCK cells were grown in T25 tissue culture flasks and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 in serum-free media (Optimem). Monolayers were trypsinized 48-h post-transfection and cells pelleted, resuspended, and filtered (35-μm filter) in 2-ml aliquots of Ca2+-free media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml as described previously (20Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In all flow cytometry experiments, control samples of untransfected and YFP-transfected MDCK cells were run in parallel with hSVCT1-YFP transfected samples, in order to calibrate optical parameters for identifying the intact, transfected cell population. Cellular Distribution and Functionality of hSVCT1-YFP—Fig. 1A shows a schematic representation of the full-length hSVCT1-YFP construct to illustrate the domain organization of the protein, which comprises a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1-40), a transmembrane domain with twelve predicted membrane-spanning regions (41-510) and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (amino acid residues 511-598) to which YFP was fused. To investigate the cellular distribution and functionality of the full-length protein, a stable hSVCT1-YFP-expressing MDCK cell line was generated by antibiotic selection with G418. After ∼8 weeks of selection, RT-PCR measurements showed that hSVCT1 mRNA expression was ∼3-fold greater relative to mock-transfected MDCK cells (Fig. 1B, panel i), and a majority of cells (∼60%) scored positive for YFP fluorescence by flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). In confluent monolayers of the stable MDCK cell line grown on filters, hSVCT1-YFP targeted to the apical cell surface as well as in a variety of intracellular structures resolved distally to the cell membrane (Fig. 1B, panel ii). Similar results were obtained with filter-grown CaCo-2 cells (Fig. 1C). Finally, functional measurements of ascorbic acid uptake demonstrated that hSVCT1-YFP overexpression resulted in a ∼6.7-fold increase in [14C]ascorbic acid accumulation after addition of substrate to the apical compartment, compared with only a 1.9-fold increase when substrate was applied basolaterally (Fig. 1B, panel iii). Together, these results suggest that hSVCT1-YFP mediates vitamin C accumulation across the apical plasma membrane domain in both renal and intestinal epithelia. In axial sections (xz) of renal (MDCK) and intestinal (CaCo-2) cells grown on permeable filter supports (Fig. 1C), the proportion of hSVCT1-YFP retained intracellularly was compared with that observed with two other constructs: first, the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-GFP), which targets to the apical plasma membrane domain and is known to recycle through endocytic pathways and second, the human thiamine transporter-2 (hTHTR2-GFP) which we have shown targets efficiently to the apical brush border in both MDCK and CaCo-2 cells (21Boulware M.J. Subramanian V.S. Said H.M. Marchant J.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Said H.M. Balamurugan K. Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 286: G491-G498Google Scholar). For each construct, measurements were made of the ratio between the average fluorescence at the apical surface and the cell midpoint (R, as shown in Fig. 1C, panel i). Although all three constructs tested were expressed at the apical cell surface, the proportion of full-length hSVCT1 protein observed intracellularly was significantly more than that resolved for hTHTR2-GFP but similar to that observed with p75-GFP (e.g. fluorescence ratios surface/intracellular of 3.6 ± 0.6, 4.2 ± 0.8, and 7.9 ± 1.2 for hSVCT1-YFP, p75-GFP, and hTHTR2-GFP in MDCK cells respectively, Fig. 1C, panel ii). Similar observations were made by comparison in MDCK stable cell lines expressing hSVCT1-YFP and hTHTR2-GFP (fluorescence ratios of 3.7 ± 1.2 for hSVCT1-YFP and 9.5 ± 3.9 for hTHTR2-GFP). Lateral (xy) confocal sections, in cells cotransfected with an endoplasmic reticulum marker (DsRed2-ER, Fig. 1C, panel iii) revealed that this disparity resulted from the abundant presence of hSVCT1-YFP within a variety of intracellular structures distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum, the properties of which were subsequently investigated (see below). Molecular Determinants of hSVCT1 Plasma Membrane Targeting Reside within the Cytoplasmic Domain of the Protein—To investigate the role of specific regions of hSVCT1 structure in determining the targeting of protein to the apical surface of epithelial cells, we employed a truncation approach, in which the full-length protein was progressively shortened from the C terminus by stretches of ∼20 amino acids, and the cellular distribution of each truncation mutant was resolved by transfection into filter-grown MDCK and CaCo-2 cells. Fig. 2A shows results obtained with four truncation mutants spanning the length of the cytoplasmic C terminus of hSVCT1 (511-598 amino acids; hSVCT1[576]-YFP, hSVCT1[553]-YFP, hSVCT1[537]-YFP, and hSVCT1[510]-YFP). Loss of the 22 terminal amino acids of the full-length protein failed to impact the plasma membrane targeting of hSVCT1[576]-YFP in either MDCK or CaCo-2 cells. Quantification of the axial distribution of hSVCT1[576]-YFP revealed a similar distribution of protein localization between the apical cell surface and intracellular organelles (ratio of 3.2 ± 0.6 in MDCKs, 4.6 ± 1.2 in CaCo-2 cells) as observed with the full-length hSVCT1-YFP (3.6 ± 0.6 and 5.3 ± 0.4, Fig. 2B). In contrast, further truncation of the cytoplasmic tail after 510, 537, or 553 amino acids resulted in a loss of cell surface targeting and expression of the truncated protein within intracellular membranes (Fig. 2A, panel i). Dual emission imaging of cells co-transfected with a red fluorescent protein construct targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (DsRed2-ER) revealed considerable fluorescence overlap between the DsRed2 variant and each of these three truncated constructs (e.g.Fig. 2A, panel ii, left), indicating that these proteins were likely retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, there was little fluorescence overlap between DsRed2-ER and hSVCT1[576]-YFP (Fig. 2A, panel ii, right). Finally, we performed flow cytometry measurements from populations of MDCK cells transfected with all of these individual truncations to gauge the expression efficiency of each construct. Measurements of the mean fluorescent intensity of the transfected population revealed no difference between the expression efficiency of hSVCT1-YFP and hSVCT1[576]-YFP but a significantly lower fluorescence intensity with truncation mutations retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (hSVCT1[553]-YFP, hSVCT1[537]-YFP, and hSVCT1[510]-YFP, Fig. 2C). The Region between Amino Acids 563 and 572 Dictates the Apical Expression of hSVCT1 in Renal and Intestinal Cells—On the basis of the results described above, demonstrating that amino acids between 553 and 576 were important for cell surface targeting, we performed further truncation analyses within this region to delimit the sequence important for apical membrane expression of hSVCT1. The results of these analyses are summarized in Fig. 3. Further truncation of the cytoplasmic tail up to amino acid residue 572 (hSVCT1[572]YFP) did not impair the apical plasma membrane localization, assessed by both measurements of axial distribution (hSVCT1[572]-YFP polarity ratio of 3.5 ± 0.9 versus 3.6 ± 0.6 for wild-type protein in MDCK cells and 5.40 ± 0.74 versus 5.34 ± 0.58 in CaCo-2 cells, Fig. 3B) or efficiency of expression (hSVCT1[572]-YFP population brightness 112.1 ± 13.0% of wild type, Fig. 3C). In contrast, truncation of the preceding ten amino acids (hSVCT1[562]-YFP) dramatically altered the targeting phenotype, as the truncated protein was retained within intracellular membranes (Fig. 3, A and B) and exhibited a considerably lower expression efficiency as assessed by flow cytometry (47 ± 3% of wild type, Fig. 3C). Truncation after proline 566 (hSVCT1[566]-YFP) resulted in an intermediate phenotype, where although some MDCK and CaCo-2 cells displayed an apical targeting phenotype, the majority of cells retained hSVCT1[566]-YFP within the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3). Role of Sequence and Topology of the C-terminal VFKG Motif—In light of the above results, we focused upon amino acid residues 567-572 (VFKGFS) as a key sequence determinant of hSVCT1 export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the apical cell surface. To determine whether truncation of this region impaired apical targeting owing to a loss of specific sequence, rather than a simple shortening of the hSVCT1 polypeptide, we replaced residues within this region with randomly chosen amino acids while conserving the overall polypeptide length of 572 residues that targets just as the full-length protein (Figs. 1 and 3). Substitution of the VFKG tetrapeptide alone (e.g. hSVCT1[566-KNTEFS]-YFP) was sufficient to abrogate an apical targeting phenotype in MDCK cells (Fig. 4A, hSVCT1[566-KNTEFS]-YFP polarity ratio of 1.66 ± 0.11 versus 4.36 ± 0.36 for wild-type protein). Further the efficiency of expression of hSVCT1[566-KNTEFS]-YFP was considerably lower than hSVCT1[572]-YFP (FACS population brightness: 69.4 ± 6.5% of wild type, Fig. 4B). These data suggest that specific sequence determinants within this region dictate the apical targeting of hSVCT1. Comparison of the VFKGFS sequence with known targeting motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of other transporters, highlighted two reports that merit immediate discussion. Cheng et al. (16Cheng C. Glover G. Banker G. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently identified a novel motif within the cytoplasmic tail of the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) that directed the apical targeting of this protein in MDCK cells and defined the essential core motif as VNGGFA/S (amino acids 504-509). Alignment of this region with hSVCT1 shows conservation of four of these six residues (Fig. 4C, panel i). Second, Sun et al. (17Sun A-Q. Salkar R. Sachchidanand X. Shuhua Zeng L. Zhou M.-M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) defined a fourteen amino acid sequence required for optimal apical membrane targeting of the rat ileal bile acid transporter (Asbt), with shorter regions within this sequence sufficient to produce an apical bias of protein location. The authors analyzed the structural conformation of this region by NMR and demonstrated that the tetrapeptide sequence NKGF (amino acids 340-343) formed a β-turn motif within the targeting sequence. This elegant study provided the first evidence of a unique secondary structure determinant within an apical targeting motif. Homology alignment of this region with hSVCT1 and EAAT-3 sequence (Fig. 4C, panel i), demonstrated that three of the four amino residues within the tetrapeptide β-turn are conserved between Asbt and both the other apically targeted proteins. On the basis of these reports, we were intrigued by the idea that the VFKGFS sequence in hSVCT1 may confer a similar conformational topology, i.e. adopt a β-turn important for apical targeting. To test this idea, we initially applied two different predictive methods to identify β-turns within proteins: first, a tetrapeptide residue-coupled model developed by Chou (predictive success rate of 88.0% from both known β-turn and non-β-turn training sets, (23Chou K.C. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 120-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and second, a neural-network based method developed by Kaur and Raghava (BetaTPred2, predictive success rate of 75.5%, Ref. 24Kaur H. Raghava G.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). First, using the Chou method, successive tetrapeptide regions along the C-terminal region of hSVCT1 were analyzed for propensity to form β-turns, scored in terms of a discriminant function Δ, where values of Δ>0 indicate the tetrapeptide forms a β-turn. Fig. 4C, panel ii shows that sequential tetrapeptides within the proposed core targeting sequence (underlined) VFKGFS scored positively for the occurrence of a β-turn. Similar predictions were obtained using BetaTPred2 (www.imtech.res.in/raghava/betatpred2). As a control for the predictive capacity of this method, the Asbt sequence was analyzed (Fig. 4C, panel iii, yellow bars), and the algorithm positively scored the NKGF β-turn tetrapeptide (17Sun A-Q. Salkar R. Sachchidanand X. Shuhua Zeng L. Zhou M.-M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further, analysis of the region spanning the fourteen amino acid apical targeting sequence of EAAT-3 identified the tetrapeptide sequence VNGG as a potential β-turn at a position, which aligns exactly with the VFKG tetrapeptide scored most positively in hSVCT1 (Fig. 4C, panel iii, red arrows). We then tested whether replacement of the putative β-turn forming sequence with a known non-β-turn forming tetrapeptide would disrupt the apical targeting phenotype. From a known set of non-β-turns (23Chou K.C. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 120-144Crossref PubMed Scopus"

The presence of two disulfide bridges in the MAM molecule was evidenced and their integrity was found to be essential for MAM homophilic interaction. Our data also indicate that PTPμ ectodomain forms oligomers and mediates the cellular adhesion, even in the absence of MAM domain homophilic binding. Reciprocally, MAM is able to interact homophilically in the absence of ectodomain trans binding. The MAM domain therefore contains independent cis and trans interaction sites and we predict that its main role is to promote lateral dimerization of PTPμ at the cell surface. This finding contributes to the understanding of the signal transduction mechanism in MAM-containing PTPs. The MAM (meprin/A5-protein/PTPmu) domain is present in numerous proteins with diverse functions. PTPμ belongs to the MAM-containing subclass of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) able to promote cell-to-cell adhesion.

The phosphorylation state of numerous signaling proteins is controlled by opposing activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; RPTP, receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases; FN, fibronectin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; IAA, iodoacetic acid; IAM, iodoacetamide; Ex, extracellular region.1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; RPTP, receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases; FN, fibronectin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; IAA, iodoacetic acid; IAM, iodoacetamide; Ex, extracellular region. (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The family of PTPs consists of soluble and receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) (2Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Whereas the intracellular region of RPTPs is relatively similar in all representatives containing either a single or two PTP domains, the extracellular region has a large diversity. PTPμ belongs to subclass IIB, called “MAM-containing PTP” (2Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Besides the MAM domain (meprin/A5-protein/PTPmu domain; Ref. 3Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), their extracellular region contains a single immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain and four fibronectin (FN) III repeats (4Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I.

This structural architecture of ectodomain is similar to members of the cell-adhesion molecule superfamily.PTPμ is strongly expressed in the endothelial cell layer of the arteries and continuous capillaries as well as in cardiac muscle, bronchial and lung epithelia, retina, and several brain areas (4Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I.

At the subcellular level, it is localized at sites of cell-cell contact (7Bianchi C. Sellke F.W. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been demonstrated that PTPμ restores E-cadherin-mediated cellular adhesion, when it is expressed in LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells (8Hellberg C.B. Burden-Gulley S.M. Pietz G.E. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11165-11173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Physiologically, PTPμ has been shown to be involved in promotion and regulation of neurite outgrowth (5Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Rosdahl J.A. Mourton T.L. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 292-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Numerous experiments have clearly demonstrated that the extracellular region of PTPμ promotes cell-cell aggregation in a Ca2+-independent manner (10Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homophilic binding has been also evidenced in the ectodomains of PTPκ (12Sap J. Jiang Y.P. Friedlander D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PTPλ (13Cheng J. Wu K. Armanini M. O'Rourke N. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7264-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that these RPTPs may be involved in signal transduction through cell-to-cell contact in vivo. Evidence concerning the physiological role of PTPμ-mediated homophilic binding has been reported in a recent article (14Rosdahl J.A. Ensslen S.E. Niedenthal J.A. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showing that homophilic interactions trigger rearrangements of the axonal growth cone. However, the molecular mechanism of this interaction remains largely unknown. In this respect, it is still unclear which regions of the ectodomain are responsible for homophilic binding. Brady-Kalnay and Tonks (15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the Ig-like region is sufficient for the homophilic binding and they did not find any role for the MAM region in this interaction. In contrast, Zondag et al. (16Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that the MAM domain is necessary for the PTPμ-mediated adhesion, especially in determining its specificity.The MAM domain was also found in various, unrelated proteins like meprins, neuropilins, and zonadhesins. It was reported that the MAM domain in meprin is involved in oligomerization, as a result of covalent and non-covalent linkages (17Ishmael F.T. Norcum M.T. Benkovic S.J. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23207-23211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Also, the neuropilin MAM domain was demonstrated to be involved in lateral (cis) dimerization (18Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1093-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).To investigate the role played by the MAM region in homophilic binding interactions of PTPμ, we analyzed by different methods the oligomerization capacity of the MAM domain and the whole extracellular region of PTPμ, both expressed in insect cells as secreted proteins. Also, the wild-type and mutant forms of the MAM domain were used to assess whether they are able to bind the extracellular region of PTPμ at the surface of insect cells expressing full-length PTPμ. Similar experiments were performed to establish the role played by the MAM domain in homophilic binding of the extracellular region of PTPμ. To compare our results to those reported on the controversial subject of the role of MAM domain in PTP-mediated adhesion, we included in our experiments a similar experimental model: expression of receptor PTPμ at the surface of insect cells and then, testing their capacity to form cellular aggregates. Our results indicate that the MAM domain of PTPμ has the capacity to self-interact and has two intramolecular disulfide bridges, which are necessary to preserve the binding properties of this domain. In addition, we found that the MAM domain is not involved in the trans interaction but can instead promote the lateral (cis) dimerization of PTPμ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The cDNA of human PTPμ (pBS-hFl) was kindly provided by M. Gebbink (Netherlands Cancer Institute; Ref. 4Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. van Kessel A.G. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Using pBS-hFl as template, the cDNA fragments encoding either the complete extracellular region (Ex, bp 61–2227) or the MAM domain (bp 61–562) were amplified with oligonucleotides: 5′-GGGGATCCCGAGACGTTCTCAGGTGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTTAACTGTATGGTCTGTCTGTTTC-3′ or 5′-TTGGTACCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGAGGAGTCCTGGTACAT-3′. The last two primers encode six histidine amino acids and a stop codon. The amplified fragments were cloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene), resulting in pBS-Ex-pcr and pBS-MAM, respectively. A Bsu36I-Tth111I fragment from pBS-Ex-pcr was replaced with a similar one from pBS-hFl yielding pBS-Ex. The PCR products were amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and sequenced.The point mutation Cys36 → Ala in pBS-MAM was made using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DNA amplification was performed using Pfu polymerase, pBS-MAM as template, and a pair of complementary primers containing the mutation. The sense primer used to change the TGT codon with the GCT codon was 5′-GATGAGCCGTATAGCACAGCTGGATATAGTCAATCTGAAGGTG-3′. The presence of the mutation in plasmid pBS-MAMmutC36A was confirmed by sequencing. A Bsu36I-HindIII fragment was extracted from pBS-MAMmutC36A and inserted into pBS-Ex to produce the pBS-ExmutC36A plasmid.To obtain the pBS-Exmut5Cys plasmid, four amino acids (Cys-Gly-Pro-Ala) were inserted into the MAM region, between Pro61 and Trp62, using the DNA oligonucleotide 5′-CATGCGGGCCCG-3′. This short sequence is complementary to itself, generating a double stranded DNA fragment with two cohesive ends. Because the ends are complementary to those generated by the restriction enzyme NcoI, the pBS-MAM plasmid was digested with this enzyme and religated in the presence of the oligonucleotides. The new plasmid pBS-MAMmut5Cys was subjected to DNA sequencing. A Bsu36I-HindIII fragment was extracted from pBS-MAMmut5Cys and inserted into pBS-Ex to produce the pBS-Exmut5Cys plasmid. Similarly, the double mutant pBS-ExmutC36A/5Cys was obtained starting from the pBS-MAMmutC36A plasmid.pVL-FlagEx and pVL-MycEx were obtained as follows: pBS-Ex was digested with BamHI and KpnI enzymes and the cDNA fragment coding the extracellular region of PTPμ was inserted into transfer vectors pVL93MelFlag and pVL93MelMyc (19Lenhard T. Maul G. Haase W. Reiländer H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Bsu36I-KpnI fragment digested from pVL-MycEx was replaced with a similar restriction segment from pBS-hFl. The resulting pVL-MycPTPμ vector contains the entire human PTPμ cDNA. In a similar way, the vectors pVL-FlagExmutC36A and pVL-MycPTPμMutC36A were generated starting from pBS-ExmutC36A.To obtain the pAc-GSTMAM baculovirus transfer vector, the cDNA coding for the MAM region was inserted into BamHI and KpnI sites of a modified form of pAcSecG2T (BD Pharmingen). All recombinant constructs were expressed in insect cells under the strong polyhedrin promoter of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Genes inserted in pVL93MelFlag and pVL93MelMyc transfer vectors were preceded by an in-frame prepromelittin signal sequence to allow secretion of the corresponding proteins into the supernatant. Similarly, the pAc-GSTMAM baculovirus transfer vector contained upstream of the GST gene an in-frame gp67 signal sequence.Cell Cultures and Baculovirus Generation—The Sf9 insect cells were routinely maintained at 28 °C in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate (Sigma), 3.3 g/liter yeastolate (Sigma), 30 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma), and 10% fetal calf serum. For the suspension cultures, the medium was supplemented with 0.1% Pluronic Polyol F-68 detergent (Sigma).Recombinant baculoviruses were made by co-transfecting Sf9 cells with BaculoGold™ viral DNA (BD Pharmingen) and the appropriate transfer vectors. The viruses were purified by plaque assay.Protein Expression and Purification—For protein expression, an Sf9 suspension culture (2 × 106 cells/ml) was infected with the appropriate recombinant baculoviruses at multiplicity of infection of 10 and harvested at 48 h post-infection. The Sf9 cells were resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and lysed by sonication 3 times for 10 s.For purification of soluble, secreted GST-MAM protein, the culture medium was 10-fold concentrated on a centrifugal filter device, Centriprep YM-10 (Millipore). The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences; 20 μl of gel per 10 ml of culture) for 4 h. After extensive washing of the resin with PBS, the immobilized protein was subjected to thrombin digestion (Sigma) in PBS for 3 h at 25 °C. Each mg of fusion protein was cleaved with 20 NIH units of protease in 1 ml of buffer. The supernatant containing both the MAM domain fragment and thrombin was supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration 2 mm) and incubated for 1 h on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen; 20 μl of resin per ml of supernatant). Finally, the beads were washed with 10 mm imidazole in PBS, and the MAM fragment was eluted with PBS in the presence of 300 mm imidazole. The protein was concentrated using Centricon YM-10 (Millipore).To purify the wild-type or mutant ectodomain constructs expressed as secreted proteins, the culture medium was diluted with 2 volumes of PBS and concentrated 30-fold using Centriprep YM-30 devices. Imidazole (5 mm) and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (20 μl bed) were added to the clarified supernatant. After 4 h, the beads were washed 6 times with 10 volumes of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline A (TBSA: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 15 mm imidazole. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with TBSA supplemented with 300 mm imidazole. After addition of CaCl2 (2 mm final concentration) and centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG (M1) affinity agarose (Eastman Kodak Co.). The beads were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline B (TBSB: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) plus 2 mm CaCl2, and the bound proteins were eluted 3 times with 4 volumes of PBS plus 2 mm EDTA. The eluted proteins were concentrated on Centriprep YM-30 devices. All steps of protein purification were carried out at 4 °C if not otherwise specified.The protein concentration was measured with BCA reagent (Pierce). Using the purification procedure described above, 1.2 mg of Flag-Ex protein and 0.5 mg of MAM domain fragment were obtained per 1 liter of suspension culture. To remove N-linked glycosyl groups, the cell lysate or the purified proteins were incubated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PN-Gase F; Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were solubilized in SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and either stained by Coomassie Blue R-250 or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Immobilon-P (Millipore). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBSB buffer, the immunoblots were probed sequentially with primary and anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega). The following monoclonal antibodies were used in these studies: the BK9 antibody (kindly provided by S. Brady-Kalnay, Case Western Reserve University), directed against the MAM domain of PTPμ; the anti-myc (clone 9E10), anti-GST (clone GST-2), and antipoly-His (clone HIS-1) antibodies, purchased from Sigma, and the anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, from Eastman Kodak Co.Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—All gel chromatography experiments were performed using the Biologic System (Bio-Rad). The columns were equilibrated in buffers used for protein elution.Multimers of the purified PTPμ ectodomain were fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences; separation range 10–700 kDa) and eluted with PBS (as such or supplemented with 1 m NaCl, 2 m urea, or 25 mm DTT) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The calibration curve was established using standard globular proteins delivered by Amersham Biosciences: ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritine (440 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa).Chemical Cross-linking—The entire procedure was performed at 25 °C with the MAM domain fragment at 0.7 mg/ml concentration using a freshly prepared stock cross-linker solution: 10 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Sigma) in PBS (pH 7.4).The cross-linking reaction was carried out for various periods with a 10-fold molar excess of BS3 (0.3 mm). The reactions were quenched by addition of loading buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE.Protein Alkylation Procedure—The one- and two-step alkylation procedures and subsequent protein electrophoresis were performed as described by Takahashi and Hirose (20Takahashi N. Hirose M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein denaturation was done with 8 m urea.In the first step, 10 μg of denatured protein was alkylated with 30 mm iodoacetic acid (IAA) at 37 °C for 20 min. The protein was precipitated with cold acetone, washed, and dissolved in PBS supplemented with 8 m urea and 5 mm DTT. In the second step, the fully reduced protein was alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide (IAM) at 37 °C for 10 min. In the control experiment, the procedure was identical except IAA was omitted.In the one-step procedure, equal amounts of denatured and fully reduced protein were alkylated simultaneously with different molar ratios of IAA to IAM (30/0, 22.5/2.5, 15/5, 7.5/7.5, and 0/10 mm/mm). Alkylation reaction was allowed to proceed 20 min at 37 °C and finally all samples were mixed. The alkylated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on a discontinuous acrylamide slab gel (9% polyacrylamide) in the presence of 8 m urea and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.Cell Aggregation and Homophilic Binding Assays—A suspension culture of Sf9 insect cells was infected with the Ac-MycPTPμ, Ac-MycPTPμMutC36A, Ac-MycExTJ, Ac-MycExTJmut5Cys, or Ac-MycExTJmutC36A/5Cys recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 36 h, cellular adhesion was examined by light microscopy (Nikon E600W Microscope) with a ×10 objective. The Sf9 cells infected with non-recombinant baculovirus were used as control.The binding of different soluble constructs to the full-length PTPμ at the cell surface was assessed by a three-step method. First, a suspension culture of insect cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml was infected with recombinant baculoviruses Ac-FlagEx or Ac-GSTMAM at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At 24 h post-infection, the medium was replaced with a fresh one. At 48 h post-infection, the culture medium containing the soluble, secreted proteins was recovered and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). In the second step, the Sf9 suspension cultures (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant baculoviruses Ac-MycPTPμ, Ac-MycPTPμMutC36A, or Ac-MycPTPμMut5Cys and, as a control, with non-recombinant baculoviruses. At 30 h post-infection, the infected cells expressing the full-length PTPμ at the surface were recovered by centrifugation (800 × g, 1 min) and resuspended into the culture medium with secreted proteins obtained in the first step. After 8 h, the Sf9 cells were collected by centrifugation. In the last step, the cells were lysed by sonication in ice-cold PBS (1 ml of buffer per 20 ml of culture) and the binding of soluble proteins was tested by incubating the cell extract with anti-FLAG (M1) affinity gel or glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (15 μl gel for each ml of sonicate). After 4 h incubation at 4 °C, the resin was extensively washed, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Generation of Disulfide-linked Dimers—The Sf9 cells (2 × 106) were plated on the 25-cm2 flasks and were allowed to grow for 16 h. The cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses: Ac-MycExTJ, Ac-MycExTJmut5Cys, or Ac-MycExTJmutC36A/5Cys. At 30 h post-infection, the monolayers were washed with PBS, and the cells were incubated in TS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% SDS, pH 7.5) supplemented with benzonase (Merck, 10 units for 5 × 105 cells), for 30 min at 4 °C. After lysis, the extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. All buffers were supplemented with 20 mm iodoacetamide.RESULTSExpression and Purification of PTPμ and Its Fragments in Insect Cells—The different constructs, encompassing the full-length PTPμ, the extracellular region, and the MAM domain, respectively, were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as secreted proteins or, in the case of constructs containing the transmembrane region, on the cell surface. Constructs were either N-terminal or both N- and C-terminal labeled using different tags as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The affinity purification of the proteins produced single bands corresponding to the expected molecular weight as assessed by Western blot analysis with tag-specific antibodies. All expressed proteins were glycosylated as indicated by the fact that treatment of purified proteins with PNGase F yielded shifts to lower molecular weights in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1).Previously, it was reported that PTPμ, expressed at the surface of insect cells, promotes cell-cell aggregation by homophilic trans interactions (10Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 11Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the expression and the adhesive function of the full-length and Myc-ExTJ constructs, a similar experiment was performed under our experimental conditions. The formation of cellular clusters was evidenced, thus proving that these constructs mediate cell-cell adhesion (see below).MAM Domain Interacts Homophilically in Solution—To investigate under in vitro conditions the capacity of the soluble MAM domain fragment to self-associate, it was cross-linked using the homobifunctional reagent BS3 (a water-soluble cross-linking agent that reacts covalently with primary amino groups). The cross-linking experiments were performed under different reaction times but with a constant, 10-fold molar excess of BS3. Fig. 2 shows that under relatively mild cross-linking conditions the dimer can be detected after 1 min of reaction. Also, the MAM dimers were detected after 3 min of incubation with only 2-fold molar excess of reagent (data not shown). These results suggest that the MAM region of PTPμ has the capacity to interact with itself even in the absence of other regions of the PTPμ ectodomain.Fig. 2The MAM domain interacts homophilically in solution. The purified protein at 0.7 mg/ml was incubated with 0.3 mm BS3 at 25 °C. After different periods of reaction, 10 μg of the cross-linked protein were recovered and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. This panel is an immunoblot using anti-poly-His antibody. The arrows indicate the oligomeric and monomeric forms of the cross-linked protein. The control experiment (C) was performed under similar conditions except BS3 was not added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MAM Domain Contains Two Intramolecular Disulfide Bridges— Within the amino acid sequence of the MAM domain there are four conserved cysteine residues (3Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which can, in principle, be involved in inter- or intramolecular disulfide bridges. To determine whether one or more of the cysteine residues forms intermolecular disulfide linkages, the purified MAM domain was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of the reducing agent (DTT). In both situations the proteins run according to the molecular weight of a monomer (data not shown), suggesting that the cysteine residues of MAM are not involved in intermolecular disulfide bridges.We also examined whether the MAM domain contains intramolecular disulfide linkages using the two-step alkylation procedure (20Takahashi N. Hirose M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This procedure is based on the following principle: both IAM and IAA react only with free sulfhydryl groups but iodoacetic acid introduces into the protein molecule an additional charge, thus increasing the electrophoretic mobility of the molecule, as analyzed by urea gel electrophoresis. The IAA cannot react with the non-reduced protein as illustrated in Fig. 3A (lanes 1 and 2, step I). Consequently, there are no free cysteine residues within the MAM domain or, in other words, all four cysteine residues are involved in intramolecular linkages. The protein treated with a mixture of IAM and IAA can be separated into five electrophoretic bands, proving that the protein contains all four predicted cysteines (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Cross-linking experiments in the presence or absence of DTT, evidenced the role played by the disulfide bridges in preserving the self-binding capacity of the MAM domain: when the purified MAM domain fragment was first treated with DTT and then cross-linked with BS3, the dimer form was not still observed on SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Altogether, the above results indicate that the MAM domain has two intramolecular disulfide bridges, which are essential for MAM domain self-interaction.Fig. 3The binding capacity of the MAM domain requires the preservation of intramolecular disulfide bridges.Panel A, the samples (5 μg) treated (lane 2) or not (lane 1) with IAA have the same electrophoretic mobility. The fully reduced sample (10 μg) treated with a mixture of alkylating reagents, IAA and IAM (lane 3), migrates as five electrophoretic bands (labeled by bars) corresponding to the introduced number of IAA carboxyls (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 molecules). The proteins in lanes 1 and 2 migrate as the upper band of lane 3 confirming that there is no IAA reagent in these molecules. The bands were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The entire procedure was performed in the presence of 8 m urea.

https://openalex.org/W2016493771,"The co-transcription factor and DNA repair enzyme, Redox effector factor-1/apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (Ref-1/Ape), facilitates DNA binding and transcriptional activity of a number of transactivating factors, including those governing hypoxia-induced gene expression HIF-1. It is not known, however, whether Ref-1/Ape is a component of the hypoxic transcriptional complex. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays failed to detect direct DNA binding of Ref-1/Ape to either the HIF-1 or AP1 DNA recognition sequences present in the hypoxic response element of the VEGF gene. However, immunodepletion of Ref-1/Ape from nuclear extract prevented DNA binding of ATF/CREB and HIF-1 to the HIF-1 DNA recognition sequence. DNA affinity-precipitation analyses showed that Ref-1/Ape was part of the multiprotein transcriptional complex forming on a 64-mer sequence encompassing a minimal hypoxic response element. Immunodepletion of Ref-1/Ape prevented probe association with HIF-1, p300, ATF, and CREB. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Ref-1/Ape present in nuclear extract interacted with HIF-1 and p300 but not ATF/CREB. However, when Ref-1/Ape was immunoprecipitated from the oligonucleotide probe, both HIF-1 and p300 remained probe-associated while ATF/CREB co-immunoprecipitated. These findings suggest that Ref-1/Ape is a critical component of the hypoxia-inducible transcriptional complex forming on the VEGF gene's hypoxic response element and that the presence of Ref-1/Ape in the complex is required for the apparent high affinity association between HIF-1 and its DNA recognition sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2050917357,"Nucleotide-sugar transporters are crucial components in the synthesis of glycoconjugates. We identified a novel human nucleotide-sugar transporter gene, hfrc1, which is homologous to Drosophila melanogaster fringe connection, Caenorhabditis elegans sqv-7, and human UGTrel7. HFRC1 was localized within the Golgi apparatus following its transient expression in HCT116 cells. In human tissues, hfrc1 and UGTrel7 exhibited similar tissue distributions, although hfrc1 transcripts showed a 10 times greater abundance than those of UGTrel7. The heterologous expression of HFRC1 in the yeast revealed the multisubstrate specific transport activity of HFRC1 (for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), and GDP-mannose (GDP-Man), with apparent Km values of 8.0, 2.1, and 0.14 μm, respectively). In the mammalian cells, HFRC1 transported UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc, but not GDP-Man. Overexpression of the hfrc1 gene in HCT116 cells modulated the cell surface heparan sulfate expression status. These results suggest that HFRC1 takes part in the synthesis of heparan sulfate by regulating the level of UDP-GlcNAc, a donor substrate for the heparan sulfate synthases. Nucleotide-sugar transporters are crucial components in the synthesis of glycoconjugates.

Nucleotide sugars, high-energy donor substrates for glycosyltransferases, are synthesized in the cytosol (or in the nucleus in the case of CMP-sialic acid). On the other hand, glycosylation reactions occur in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; β4GalT1, β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1; CMP-Sia, CMP-sialic acid; HA, influenza hemagglutinin epitope; frc, fringe connection; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NST, nucleotide-sugar transporter; GDP-Fuc, GDP-fucose; GDP-Man, GDP-mannose; sqv, squashed vulva; UDP-Gal, UDP-galactose; UDP-GalNAc, UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose; UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; UDP-GlcUA, UDP-glucuronic acid; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and Golgi apparatus (1Verbert A.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Translocation of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the lumen compartment is mediated by specific nucleotide-sugar transporters (NSTs) (1Verbert A. Cacan R. Cecchelli R.

In several studies, NSTs have been mentioned as possible crucial players in the synthesis of glycoconjugates (for reviews, see Refs. 3Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Recent studies have demonstrated that some NSTs are implicated in growth factor signaling during development through the regulation of proteoglycan synthesis. In Caenorhabditis elegans, sqv-7 mutants show a defect in vulva formation, with epithelial invaginations, during ontogeny (6Herman T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 968-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SQV-7 has been identified as a transporter of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), UDP-galacose (UDP-Gal), and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) (7Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of sqv-7 mutants has demonstrated defects in both chondroitin and heparan sulfate biosynthesis in vivo (8Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Wald-rip W.R. Esko J.D.

Turco S.J. Perrimon N. Häcker U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and Goto et al. (10Goto S. Taniguchi M. Muraoka M. Toyoda H. Sado Y. Kawakita M. Hayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported that the Drosophila melanogaster gene of fringe connection (frc)is involved in embryonic Wingless/Hedgehog and fibroblast growth factor signaling (9Selva E.M.

Kawakita M. Hayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Frc encodes a multisubstrate-specific NST that transfers UDP-sugars into the Golgi apparatus (9Selva E.M. Hong K. Baeg G.H. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Perrimon N. Häcker U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Goto S. Taniguchi M. Muraoka M. Toyoda H. Sado Y. Kawakita M. Hayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcUA and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) act as substrates for the synthesis of heparan sulfate. Embryos with a mutation of frc display severe segment polarity phenotypes (9Selva E.M. Hong K. Baeg G.H. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Perrimon N. Häcker U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although sqv-7 and frc are considered to be orthologous to each other, it remains obscure which NSTs of humans have corresponding functions. In humans, the UGTrel7 protein has a similar multisubstrate specificity to those of FRC and SQV-7; namely, UDP-GlcUA/UDP-GalNAc (11Muraoka M. Kawakita M. Ishida N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, localization of UGTrel7 to the ER, not to the Golgi apparatus (11Muraoka M. Kawakita M. Ishida N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), leaves open the possibility that other transporters may be involved in proteoglycan synthesis in the Golgi apparatus. The structural conservation present among NSTs enables the identification of many putative NST sequences from data bases. By a data base search, we identified a putative NST gene that is closely related to sqv-7, frc, and UGTrel7. HFRC1 had a multisubstrate specificity for UDP-GlcNAc/UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc)/GDP-mannose (GDP-Man) in the Golgi fraction of yeast cells expressing this gene. Furthermore, alteration in the expression of hfrc1 affected the heparan sulfate on the cell surface of mammalian cells. Thus, the present study raises the possibility that HFRC1 takes part in heparan sulfate synthesis by supplying UDP-GlcNAc. Materials—GDP-[2-3H]mannose (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-[1-3H]glucose (15 Ci/mmol), UDP-N-acetyl-[6-3H]d-galactosamine (15 Ci/mmol), and UDP-[U-14C]glucuronic acid (15 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). GDP-[1-3H]fucose (6.95 Ci/mmol), UDP-[4,5-3H]galactose (48.3 Ci/mmol), CMP-[9-3H]sialic acid (33.6 Ci/mmol), and UDP-N-acetyl-[6-3H]d-glucosamine (39.7 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Zymolyase 100T, heparitinase I, chondroitinase ABC, anti-heparan sulfate/human (F58–10E4) monoclonal antibody (mAb), and anti-chondroitin 4-sulfate/rat (2H6) mAb were obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-ERp57 (MaP.ERp57) mAb and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA) mAb (HA-probe, F-7) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Isolation of a Novel Human NST cDNA and Construction of Expression Plasmids—A novel putative NST gene was cloned using the same procedures as previously described (12Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25958-25963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, a TBLASTN search was performed for the amino acid sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) of the GDP-fucose (GDP-Fuc) transporter gene (13Lubke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Korner C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We identified a cDNA sequence encoding a full-length ORF (GenBank™ accession number XM_047286). To obtain this cDNA and create recombination sites for the GATEWAY™ cloning system (Invitrogen), we used two steps of attB adaptor PCR for the preparation of attB-flanked PCR products. For the first gene-specific amplification, a forward template-specific primer with attB1 (5′-aaaaagcaggcttcccgcaggagatgacgg-3′) and a reverse template-specific primer with attB2 (5′-agaaagctgggtcgctcttcaaatccaaaca-3′) were used. PCR was performed using Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and a cDNA library derived from human colon tissue. The insertion of a complete attB adaptor and cloning into the pDONR™ 201 vector to create an entry clone for the subsequent subcloning were performed according to the instruction manual. The ORF of the UGTrel7 cDNA was obtained by the same procedures as mentioned above using the forward template-specific primer 5′-aaaaagcaggcttcgcagccatggcggaagt-3′ and the reverse template-specific primer 5′-agaaagctgggtccactgctcctttcccctt-3′. Expression vectors were inserted with three copies of the HA epitope tags (YPYDVPDYA) at the position corresponding to the C terminus of the expressing protein and converted to a Gateway destination vector with a conversion site. Each entry clone was subcloned into appropriate expression vectors using the Gateway Cloning System according to the instruction manual. Transient Transfection and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transient transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (12Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N. Chiba Y. Goto S. Toyoda H. Saigo K. Watanabe M. Narimatsu H. Jigami Y. Nishihara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25958-25963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells were subcultured onto a 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, New York) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 0.25 μg/well of pCXN2 (14Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) or pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged hfrc1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, then permeabilized in permeabilizing buffer (PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, cells were stained with anti-β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT1) mAb (15Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-ERp57 mAb for 16 h at 4 °C, washed four times with permeabilizing buffer, and incubated with rhodamine-labeled anti-IgG mAb for 90 min at room temperature. After incubation, the cells were washed, then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-HA mAb for 90 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed and mounted with PermaFluor (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Subcellular Fractionation of Yeast and Transport Assay—Yeast of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303-1a (MATa, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11,15, trp1-1, leu2-3,112, and can1-100) was transformed by the lithium acetate procedure (16Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a yeast expression vector, YEp352GAP-II (17Nakayama K. Maeda Y. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 673R-680RCrossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in synthetic defined medium in which uracil was omitted for the selection of transformants. Subcellular fractionation and nucleotide-sugar transport assays were performed as described by Roy et al. (18Roy S.K. Chiba Y. Takeuchi M. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13580-13587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, then converted into spheroplasts by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in spheroplast buffer (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg of Zymolyase 100T per g of cells). Spheroplasts were pelleted in a refrigerated centrifuge and washed twice with 1.0 m ice-cold sorbitol to remove Zymolyase. The cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells and cell-wall debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (Beckman XL-90 ultracentrifuge with 90.1 Ti rotor), which yielded a pellet of the P10 membrane fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g yielding a pellet of the P100 membrane fraction and a supernatant of the S100 fraction. Then, 200 μg of protein of each fraction were incubated in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 μm radiolabeled substrate at 30 °C for 5 min. After incubation, the radioactivity incorporated in the microsomes was trapped with a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter, and measured by liquid scintillation. The amount of incorporated substrate was calculated as the difference from the background value obtained from the time 0 assay for each sample. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the expression status of the HA-tagged protein, subcellular fractions of yeast cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Fifty micrograms of protein of each sample were added to 3× SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs Inc.), then incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were fractionated on a 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The separated proteins were electrotransferred onto polyvinyldene difluoride membrane. HA-tagged proteins were immunostained with anti-HA mouse mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb. Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected using ECL+plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Quantitative Analysis of hfrc1 and UGTrel7 Transcripts in Human Tissues by Real Time PCR—The amount of hfrc1 and UGTrel7 transcripts in human tissues was determined by real time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from human tissues by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript II first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was performed using a qPCR Mastermix QuickGoldStar (EUROGENTEC) and ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Multiplex real time PCR was used to compare the amounts of hfrc1 and UGTrel7 transcripts in normal human tissues. The sequences of the PCR primer pairs and TaqMan probes used for each gene were as follows. For the quantitation of hfrc1, the forward primer 5′-cctgacgacagcagtggtt-3′, reverse primer 5′-ctccaccgattaatatcccaat-3′, and probe 5′-agccatcaagaatgtatccgttgcct-3′ were used. The probe was labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter dye FAM, and at the 3′-end with the quencher dye TAMRA. For the detection of UGTrel7, the forward primer 5′-cattgcgtatttcacaggagatg-3′, reverse primer 5′-ctgcagaagaaagagggtgtca-3′, and probe 5′-cccagccttcaaactccacagccttt-3′ were used. The probe was labeled at the 5′-end with Yakima Yellow and at the 3′-end with Darquencher. The relative amounts of hfrc1 and UGTrel7 transcripts were normalized with respect to the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcripts in the same cDNA. Stable Transfection—HCT116 cells were subcultured onto 6-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's (1:1) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 8 μg of pCXN2 vector or pCXN2 inserted with HA-tagged hfrc1 using Lipo-fectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, transfectants were selected by the addition of 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) to the medium, and cultured for 1 month. Flow Cytometric Analysis—After 16 h of subculture, cells were harvested with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and washed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Then, 100 μl of cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells) were incubated with anti-heparan sulfate mAb or antichondroitin 4-sulfate mAb for 30 min on ice, and washed three times with 1.5 ml of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Then, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and incubated for 30 min on ice. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using EPICS ELITE flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). As the negative control, cells were treated with 10 milliunits/ml of heparitinase I or 100 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC for 90 min at 37 °C before immunoblotting. Data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.8 software (The Scripps Research Institute Cytometry software page). Cloning of Human Hfrc1 cDNA—Using the TBLASTN algorithm, we identified a cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM_047286) homologous to the GDP-Fuc transporter gene. We cloned the full-length ORF as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and named it hfrc1. The phylogenetic tree of the transporter genes in human, Drosophila, and C. elegans is shown in Fig. 1A. Hfrc1 is more closely related to UGTrel7, frc, and sqv-7 than to the GDP-Fuc transporter gene. The phylogenetic tree also demonstrates that both hfrc1 and UGTrel7 are orthologs of Drosophila frc (Fig. 1A). An alignment of the amino acid sequences of HFRC1, SQV-7, FRC, and UGTrel7 is shown in Fig. 1B. HFRC1 consists of 337 amino acids with a calculated mass of 36.7 kDa. Hydropathy analysis and predictions of the transmembrane helices of the amino acid sequence revealed that HFRC1 are Type III transmembrane proteins with seven transmembrane domains. HFRC1 showed 54.3, 46.6, and 46.6% identities to UGTrel7, FRC, and SQV-7, respectively. There is one potential N-glycosylation site in the HFRC1 sequence (double underlined). The gene structures of hfrc1 and UGTrel7 are shown in Fig. 1C. The hfrc1 gene is mapped on human chromosome 9q22.33, and the mRNA is composed of 12 exons. On the other hand, the UGTrel7 gene is mapped on human chromosome 1p32-p31, and the mRNA is composed of 12 exons. Subcellular Localization of HFRC1 in Mammalian Cells—Hfrc1 has a significant similarity to human UGTrel7 and Drosophila frc. FRC is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus (10Goto S. Taniguchi M. Muraoka M. Toyoda H. Sado Y. Kawakita M. Hayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas UGTrel7 is localized to the ER (11Muraoka M. Kawakita M. Ishida N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To investigate the subcellular localization of HFRC1, HA-tagged HFRC1 protein was transiently expressed in a mammalian cell line, and immunostained. A mammalian expression vector, pCXN2, was inserted with the ORF of hfrc1 or UGTrel7 with three copies of the HA epitope tag at the C terminus, and transfected transiently into HCT116 cells. The cells were double-immunostained with anti-HA mAb and anti-β4GalT1 mAb or anti-ERp57 mAb, and the immunofluorescence was observed microscopically. As shown in Fig. 2, HFRC1-HA was co-localized with β4GalT1, which is a typical protein of trans-Golgi localization (15Uemura M. Sakaguchi T. Uejima T. Nozawa S. Narimatsu H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6153-6157PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, UGTrel7-HA was co-localized with ERp57, which is a typical protein of the ER (Fig. 2). These results indicate that HFRC1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, unlike UGTrel7. Tissue Distribution of Hfrc1 and UGTrel7 Transcripts in Human Tissues—Although hfrc1 and UGTrel7 are closely related genes, the subcellular localization of HFRC1 is different from that of UGTrel7. To investigate whether hfrc1 and UGTrel7 have similar tissue distributions, the expression levels of hfrc1 and UGTrel7 transcripts in human tissues were analyzed using real time PCR. The gene expression profiles of these genes in various human tissues are shown in Fig. 3. All transcript levels are shown relative to that of GAPDH. Hfrc1 and UGTrel7 displayed similar tissue distributions, each showing high levels of expression in the colon, stomach, lung, and leukocyte. However, the expression level of hfrc1 transcripts was 10 times that of UGTrel7 (note the different scales in the two panels in Fig. 3). HFRC1 Is a Multisubstrate Specific Protein That Transports UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Glc, and GDP-Man—The yeast S. cerevisiae is an organism that has been widely used for the analysis of NSTs by heterologous expression. To express HFRC1 protein in S. cerevisiae, the yeast expression vector YEp352GAP-II was inserted with the ORF of hfrc1, and introduced into W303-1a yeast. The expression status of HA-tagged HFRC1 protein in the yeast was analyzed by Western blotting using antibody against the HA epitope tag. HA-tagged HFRC1 protein was successfully expressed in the Golgi-enriched P100 fraction as a 42-kDa protein (Fig. 4A). The transport activity of HFRC1 for nucleotide sugars into P100 fractions was examined using radiolabeled substrates. As shown in Fig. 4B, the incorporation into the P100 fraction prepared from yeast cells (those expressing HFRC1 over that shown for the mock) was 6.2 times for UDP-GlcNAc, 4.2 times for UDP-Glc, and 1.9 times for GDP-Man. No significant difference was observed between hfrc1 and the mock in the transport of other nucleotide sugars. The substrate concentration dependences of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Glc, and GDP-Man transport by HFRC1 are shown in Fig. 4, C–E. HFRC1 showed saturable transport activity with increases in substrate concentration, and the apparent Km values for UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Glc, and GDP-Man were estimated to be 8.0, 2.1, and 0.14 μm, respectively. Because the level of endogenous transport of GDP-Man is extremely high in S. cerevisiae, we also tested the transport activity of HFRC1 in a mammalian cell line. HCT116 cells stably expressing either HA-tagged hfrc1 or mock vector (vector alone) were analyzed for the uptake of these substrates into the P100 fraction. The hfrc transfectant showed 5.4 times the hfrc1 transcript level of the mock transfectant (6.6 versus 1.2 × 10-3/GAPDH transcript). The P100 fraction of the hfrc1 transfectant showed 1.7 times the UDP-GlcNAc transport activity and 1.8 times the UDP-Glc transport activity of the mock transfectant (380.6 versus 228.8 pmol/5 min/mg of protein, and 910.7 versus 493.2 pmol/5 min/mg of protein, respectively). However, in contrast to the yeast expression data, a difference in GDP-Man transport activity was hardly detectable between the hfrc1 transfectant and mock transfectant (168.9 versus 175.9 pmol/5 min/mg of protein). These results indicate that HFRC1 transports UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc in the mammalian cells, but transports GDP-Man alone in the yeast. Hfrc1 Has a Role in Heparan Sulfate Synthesis—Heparan sulfate molecules are found on the cell surface as glucosaminoglycan chains covalently attached to a core protein. Heparan sulfate has a repeat of GlcUA and GlcNAc, whereas chondroitin sulfate has a repeat of GlcUA and GalNAc in the glucosaminoglycan chains. Because HFRC1 can transport UDP-GlcNAc, the possibility needed to be considered that HFRC1 might contribute to the elongation of heparan sulfate by supplying the donor substrate. To investigate whether HFRC1 is involved in the synthesis of heparan sulfate, HCT116 cells stably expressing HA-tagged hfrc1 or mock vector were immunostained with an antibody against heparan sulfate, and analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5A, the cell surface expression levels of heparan sulfate on hfrc1 transfectant cells were increased compared with that on mock transfectant cells. On the other hand, the cell surface expression levels of chondroitin sulfate were not different between the hfrc1 and mock transfectants. These results suggest that hfrc1 is involved in the synthesis of heparan sulfate by supplying UDP-GlcNAc, a donor substrate for the heparan sulfate synthases. In the present study, we reported the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel human multisubstrate-specific NST, which is homologous to Drosophila frc and C. elegans sqv-7. In humans, hfrc1 also exhibited a significant similarity to another NST, UGTrel7. The phylogenetic tree indicates that both hfrc1 and UGTrel7 are orthologs of Drosophila frc (Fig. 1A). In Drosophila, frc is the only gene corresponding to these two human NSTs. We could not find any putative NST sequence homologous to hfrc1 or UGTrel7 from Drosophila data bases, except frc. This raises the possibility that UGTrel7 and hfrc1 may share a common ancestral origin. In fact, these two genes have a similar exon-intron organization, both being composed of 12 exons (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, hfrc1 and UGTrel7 displayed the same expression profiles in human tissues (Fig. 3), suggesting that these two genes are under similar regulation. Hfrc1 and UGTrel7 were mapped on different chromosomes, 9q22.33 and 1p32-p31, respectively. These locations are near the regions of 9q33–34 and 1q21–25, respectively, which are paralogous to the major histocompatibility complex. Kasahara et al. (20Kasahara M. Hayashi M. Tanaka K. Inoko H. Sugaya K. Ikemura T. Ishibashi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9096-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggested in their report that the genes in the major histocompatibility complex region of jawed vertebrates have risen as a result of ancient chromosomal duplications. These data suggest that hfrc1 and UGTrel7 have evolved from a common ancestral gene through either segmental chromosome duplication or gene duplication. As shown in Fig. 5, an alteration in the expression of hfrc1 affected heparan sulfate on the cell surface of mammalian cells. UDP-GlcNAc, a transport substrate for HFRC1, can be utilized by the enzymes that catalyze the elongation of heparan sulfate. Because the elongation of proteoglycan takes place within the Golgi apparatus (2Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 21Prydz K.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), the localization of HFRC1 to the Golgi apparatus would allow it to regulate the donor-substrate level for the enzymes. Heparan sulfate is known to be involved in a variety of biological phenomena, such as morphogenesis, development, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, cell adhesion, and lipid metabolism (23Salmivirta M.

Hfrc1 is expected to be involved in growth factor signaling through the regulation of heparan sulfate synthesis in a way similar to that observed for frc. The substrate specificity of HFRC1 also suggests the possibility that HFRC1 may be able to modulate Notch activity in humans by supplying UDP-GlcNAc. The interaction of the Notch receptor with its ligands, Serrate and Delta, is modulated by the addition of GlcNAc to an O-linked Fuc on the Notch by FRINGE enzyme (30Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 31Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D.

In Drosophila, mutation of frc leads to a defect in Notch maturation (10Goto S. Taniguchi M. Muraoka M. Toyoda H. Sado Y. Kawakita M. Hayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here, HFRC1 exhibited an apparent Km value for UDP-GlcNAc comparable with that of FRC (8 versus 7.8 μm, respectively). It would be interesting to investigate whether hfrc1 can rescue the defects in glycosylation and signaling caused by frc mutations. We also observed that HFRC1 has a UDP-Glc transport activity. HFRC1 is the first UDP-Glc transporter to be reported in a mammal, although the physiological significance of UDP-Glc transport in the Golgi apparatus is obscure. Possibly, it is involved in some glycosylation process in the Golgi apparatus, such as the addition of O-linked glucose (34Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) or the glucosyl-transferase reaction by β4GalT1 in the presence of α-lactalbumin (35Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found that HFRC1 transported GDP-Man alone in the yeast, not in the mammalian cells. This difference is perhaps because of the abundance of antiport molecules for GDP-Man within the yeast Golgi apparatus. It has been suggested that GDP-Man is transported into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus of yeast and Leishmania, but not into that of mammals (3Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Whether or not HFRC1 can act as a real GDP-Man transporter in mammalian cells needs to be evaluated in future investigations. In humans, another UDP-GlcNAc transporter exists within the Golgi apparatus (36Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We did not investigate whether HFRC1 and this UDP-GlcNAc transporter operate in a complementary fashion or in different ways within the Golgi apparatus. Identification of the glycoconjugates that are affected by these genes may hold the key to a clarification of their functions. Analysis using RNA interference of each gene may also help to elucidate the significance of these transporters in glycosylation. We thank Dr. Irimura for kindly providing the HCT116 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2162183502,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis, regulates genes crucial for cell growth and survival. In normoxia, HIF-1alpha is constantly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase binds HIF-1alpha through specific recognition of hydroxylated Pro-402 or Pro-564, both of which are modified by the oxygen-dependent HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs/HPHs). Despite the identification of a conserved Leu-X-X-Leu-Ala-Pro motif, the molecular requirement of HIF-1alpha for PHDs/HPHs binding remains elusive. Recently, we demonstrated that Leu-574 of human HIF-1alpha--10 residues downstream of Pro-564--is essential for VHL recognition. We show here that the role of Leu-574 is to recruit PHD2/HPH2 for Pro-564 hydroxylation. An antibody specific for hydroxylated Pro-564 has been used to determine the hydroxylation status; mutation or deletion of Leu-574 results in a significant decrease in the ratio of the hydroxylated HIF-1alpha to the total amount. The nine-residue spacing between Pro-564 and Leu-574 is not obligatory for prolyl hydroxylation. Furthermore, mutation of Leu-574 disrupts the binding of PHD2/HPH2, a key prolyl hydroxylase for oxygen-dependent proteolysis of HIF-1alpha. Hence, our findings indicate that Leu-574 is essential for recruiting PHD2/HPH2, thereby providing a molecular basis for modulating HIF-1alpha activity."
https://openalex.org/W2023671527,"Fgf-3 is expressed in a dynamic and complex spatiotemporal pattern during mouse development. Previous studies identified GATA-4 as a transcription factor that binds the key regulatory element PS4A of the Fgf-3 promoter and stimulates transcription. Here we show that members of the SOX family of transcription factors also bind PS4A and differentially modulate transcription. At least five SOX genes, Sox2, Sox6, Sox7, Sox13, and Sox17, were expressed in F9 cells, and of these, Sox7 and Sox17 were dramatically induced in parallel with Fgf-3 following differentiation into parietal endoderm-like cells with retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP. Complexes could be detected on PS4A with SOX2, SOX7, and SOX17 by using nuclear extracts from differentiated F9 cells. However, only Sox7 expression markedly activated the Fgf-3 promoter in these cells. By contrast, SOX2 was a poor activator of Fgf-3 transcription, and when Sox2 was coexpressed with Gata4, it negatively modulated the strong activation mediated by GATA-4. More detailed analyses showed that SOX7 competes with GATA-4 for PS4A occupancy and to activate the Fgf-3 promoter. In situ hybridization analysis showed that Sox7 is co-expressed with Fgf-3 and Gata4 in the parietal endoderm of E7.5 mouse embryos. In culture, GATA-4-deficient embryonal stem cells were shown to express Fgf-3 upon differentiation into embryoid bodies, although at lower levels than were found in wild type embryonal stem cells. This Fgf-3 expression was virtually abolished when Sox7 expression was suppressed by RNA interference. These results show that SOX7 is a potent activator of Fgf-3 transcription.

Cell. 1984; 37: 529-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) but later was found to be expressed at a variety of sites during embryogenesis, suggesting its potential involvement in a number of developmental processes (9Niswander L.

In the post-implantation conceptus, Fgf-3 is expressed in the parietal endoderm and in a number of embryonic tissues such as the primitive streak mesoderm, early hindbrain and forebrain, cerebellum, sensory cells of the inner ear, pharyngeal pouches, retina, tooth mesenchyme, and tail bud (9Niswander L.

Mice deficient for Fgf-3 show developmental abnormalities of the inner ear and partial fusion of the caudal vertebrae, indicating an essential role of Fgf-3 in the formation of these tissues (14Mansour S.L. Goddard J.M. Capecchi M.R. Development. 1993; 117: 13-28PubMed Google Scholar). To understand how the complex pattern of Fgf-3 transcription is regulated, we have been analyzing its promoter to identify the transcriptional regulators that control activity. F9 embryonal carcinoma cells can differentiate into several early cell lineages in cell culture (15Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Treatment with retinoic acid (RA) and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) preferentially induces F9 cells to differentiate in parietal endoderm-like cells, which is accompanied by the induction of Fgf-3 (16Jakobovits A.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). By using differentiated F9 cells, we previously identified positive and negative regulatory elements within the 5′-proximal region of the Fgf-3 promoter, and we concluded that an element designated PS4A was essential for promoter activity (18Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Watson R. Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar, 19Murakami A. Grinberg D. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5351-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further analyses have demonstrated that the transcription factor, GATA-4, binds PS4A and was implicated as a positive regulator of Fgf-3 expression in differentiated F9 cells (20Murakami A.

Recently we identified another transcription factor, SOX6, as a PS4A-binding protein that negatively regulates Fgf-3 transcription (26Murakami A. Ishida S. Thurlow J. Revest J.-M. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3347-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SOX6 belongs to a family of transcription factors related by homology within their DNA binding domains (HMG box) to the mammalian testis-determining factor SRY (reviewed in Ref. 27Pevny L.H.

SOX proteins are expressed in a variety of both embryonic and adult tissues and have been implicated in the determination of cell fate decisions (27Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cells frequently express more than one SOX gene, although it is not clear to what level they are functionally redundant (30Lefebvre V. Li P. Crombrugghe B.D.

An analysis of SOX protein binding to PS4A in the Fgf-3 promoter, and functional studies in F9 cells and embryonal stem (ES) cells, implicates SOX7 as an important positive regulator of Fgf-3 transcription. Most surprising, GATA-4 and SOX7 both bind PS4A but appear to act independently and exclusively to regulate positively Fgf-3 transcription. In situ hybridization analysis shows co-expression of Sox7 and Fgf-3 further supporting a role for SOX7 in the regulation of Fgf-3 during early embryogenesis. Cell Culture—Mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line F9 was cultured and induced to differentiate into parietal endoderm-like cells with RA (0.1 μm) and Bt2cAMP (1 mm) as described previously (35Strickland S.

The antiserum to SOX2 was kindly provided by Dr. Robin Lovell-Badge (National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). The antiserum to GATA-4 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antiserum to SOX7 was raised in rabbits (Asahi Technoglass, Chiba, Japan) using keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated to a peptide corresponding to a sequence in the C terminus of SOX7 (SLISVLADATATYYNSYSVS). The IgG fraction from the serum was purified by using a protein A column. In initial experiments (not shown), we used an antiserum to SOX7, kindly provided by Dr. Yoshiki Hiraoka (Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan). In vitro transcribed and translated proteins were synthesized from the constructs in which a coding region of each cDNA was inserted into pET-21b(+) vector (Novagen), using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). For competition experiments, double-stranded oligonucleotides designated HMG (5′-GGACACTGAGAACAAAGCGCTCTCACAC) and GATA (5′-GAGATGGAGATAAGGACGGG) were added as competitors at 50-fold excess compared with the probe.

Reporter Assay—The luciferase reporter plasmids, p(4A×3)tkLuc and pFgf-3/Luc, used in transfection experiments have been described previously (20Murakami A. Thurlow J. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17242-17248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The variants of pFgf-3/Luc containing a mutation in PS4A, pFgf-3/Luc4A20T, pFgf-3/Luc4AzM1, and pFgf-3/Luc4A17G were synthesized by using pFgf-3/Luc and synthetic oligonucleotides utilizing an in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system, GeneEditor (Promega). The expression plasmids for SOX proteins were constructed by inserting the coding region of each cDNA into the multiple-cloning site of pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene), which adds a FLAG tag to the N terminus of each SOX protein. These expression plasmids are designated pCMV-Tag2/Sox2, -6, -7, -13, and -17. An expression plasmid for GATA-4 tagged with histidine residues at the C terminus was constructed by inserting the Gata4 cDNA from pET/GATA-4 together with a His tag sequence (21Murakami A. Ishida S. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) into pCI-neo vector (Promega) and designated pCI-neo/Gata4-HT. The transfection of plasmid DNA into F9 cells using the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method, the isolation of stably transfected cells, the preparation of cell extracts, luciferase assays, and immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis have been described previously (19Murakami A.

In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization of mouse embryos was done according to a method described previously (40Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The BamHI-HindIII fragment (1.7 kb) in the third exon of Fgf-3 and the full-length fragments of Sparc (2.0 kb), Sox7 (1.8 kb), and Gata4 (2.2 kb) cDNAs were used as probes. Each fragment was cloned into LITMUS28 (New England Biolabs), and RNA probes were synthesized from the linearized plasmid DNAs with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) using digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Diagnostics). Hybridized probes were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Diagnostics) after treatment with anti-digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragment (Roche Diagnostics). RNA Interference—The vector, designated pKS/mH1, which directs synthesis of short interfering RNAs from the H1-RNA gene promoter by RNA polymerase III was constructed in the same way as pSUPER (41Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3967) Google Scholar) except that the promoter and transcription termination sites of human H1-RNA gene were replaced by those of the mouse gene. The synthetic oligonucleotide containing an inverted repeat of a targeting sequence against Sox7 mRNA, 5′-AAGCCGAGCTGTCGGATGG-3′ (nucleotides 59–77 of the coding sequence) separated by a spacer, 5′-TTCAAGAGA-3′ was inserted into pKS/mH1 and designated pKS/mH1-Sox7. This plasmid is expected to synthesize the short interfering RNAs forming a double-stranded stem of the targeting sequence and a loop by the spacer. Each plasmid DNA was transfected into Gata4-/- ES cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) together with pBSCX-Hyg (a gift from Dr. N. Yajima) conferring hygromycin resistance. Resulting hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated using a ring as stable expression clones for the short interfering RNAs. Detection of PS4A-binding Proteins—We identified previously GATA-4 as a PS4A-binding protein present in parietal endoderm-like cells differentiated from F9 cells but not in undifferentiated F9 cells (lanes 1 and 4 in Fig. 1) (20Murakami A. Thurlow J. Dickson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17242-17248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SOX6 was identified as another PS4A-binding protein through a yeast one-hybrid screen (26Murakami A. Ishida S. Thurlow J. Revest J.-M. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3347-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SOX proteins were not detected in the original EMSA experiments because poly(dI)·poly(dC) was used as the nonspecific DNA competitor, and this can interfere with the binding of HMG domain-containing proteins to DNA (Fig. 1) (42Dailey L. Yuan H. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7758-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, when poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) was substituted as a nonspecific competitor in the EMSA, novel complexes were formed with undifferentiated as well as differentiated F9 nuclear extracts (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 6), although part of the complex formed with differentiated cell extracts is attributable to GATA-4 binding (compare lanes 4 and 6). The complexes did not form on a probe containing two nucleotide substitutions (4AyM4) demonstrating sequence-specific binding (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). To determine which nucleotides of PS4A are required for formation of the complexes detected using poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), a series of oligonucleotide probes, each containing a single base substitution within the central region of PS4A was subjected to EMSA (Fig. 2). The point mutations in probes 4A17C, 4A18G, 4A20T, and 4A21G abolished the major complex with undifferentiated F9 nuclear extracts (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 5–8). The complex was weakly formed with probes 4A15A and 4A16G (Fig. 2B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). Hence, the recognition sequence for the protein forming the complex is (C)(T)ATTGT. Another complex (marked by an asterisk) was revealed on the base-substituted probes following loss of the major complex. However, competition with PS4A showed it did not form efficiently on the parental probe (Fig. 2C, left panel), and therefore it was not pursued further. When using differentiated F9 nuclear extracts, the analysis is complicated by the presence of GATA-4 binding (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Therefore, a competitor for GATA protein binding was added to eliminate the GATA-4 complex (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Although the amount of the major complex decreased in the presence of the competitor (Fig. 2B, bottom panel, arrow), the complexes formed with PS4A were still detected (lane 1), indicating the presence of proteins other than GATA-4. In the presence of the competitor, complex formation was significantly suppressed by point mutations in probes 4A17C, 4A18G, 4A20T, and 4A21G (Fig. 2B, bottom panel, lanes 5–8) and reduced for probes 4A15A and 4A16G (lanes 3 and 4). Hence, the deduced recognition sequence for the PS4A-binding proteins is therefore (C)(T)ATTGT, the same as that determined using undifferentiated F9 nuclear extracts. Surprisingly, this sequence overlaps in part with one of the bipartite binding sites for GATA-4 identified by using differentiated F9 nuclear extracts (boxed in Fig. 2A) (21Murakami A. Ishida S. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1056-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most interesting, a complex was formed with the 4A17C probe (Fig. 2B, lane 5, middle panel) that was not detected in the presence of the GATA competitor (lane 5, bottom panel). This complex was completely supershifted by an anti-GATA-4 serum (Fig. 2C, right panel), confirming that it contains GATA-4. At least three non-GATA-4 protein-containing complexes were distinguishable using differentiated F9 nuclear extracts, as indicated in Fig. 2B, arrow and two asterisks, lanes 1, 2, and 9. Because these complexes all failed to form on the same point-substituted probes, the same sequence seemed to be recognized by the proteins forming these complexes. The sequence (C)(T)ATTGT or ACAAT(A)(G) in the opposite orientation is similar to the consensus binding motif of SOX proteins (A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G. This is consistent with the binding of SOX6 to PS4A (26Murakami A. Ishida S. Thurlow J. Revest J.-M. Dickson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3347-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and suggests the proteins in the complexes are likely to be members of the SOX family. Identification of SOX Genes Expressed in F9 Cells—SOX family proteins contain a highly homologous DNA binding domain, the so-called HMG box (27Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 28Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). To identify the SOX proteins expressed in F9 cells, we performed low stringency PCR using a cDNA library from undifferentiated or differentiated parietal endoderm-like F9 cells with degenerate primers based on homology to the HMG box as described previously (38Roose J. Korver W. Oving E. Wilson A. Wagenaar G. Markman M. Lamers W. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Products of the predicted size were subcloned and sequenced. As seen in Table I, Sox2 and Sox7 were the most frequently isolated clones and therefore likely to be the most abundant Sox family transcripts in undifferentiated and differentiated F9 cells, respectively. In addition, clones for Sox6, Sox13, and Sox17 transcripts were also isolated. To assess the relative expression level of each SOX gene in F9 cells, the clones were used as probes in a Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 3). F9 cells can be induced with RA alone to differentiate into cells showing markers of visceral endoderm (VE-like), or RA and Bt2cAMP treatment produces cells showing markers of the parietal endoderm (PE-like). An analysis of SOX gene expression in these different cell types showed quite distinct patterns of expression. Untreated F9 cells primarily expressed Sox2 and Sox13, and after RA treatment the resulting VE-like cells continued to express these SOX genes. In addition, the expressions of Sox6, Sox7, and Sox17 were induced in the VE-like cells. In contrast, the PE-like cells expressed only Sox7 and Sox17 at a high level. Fgf-3 expression is associated with the parietal endoderm in vivo and was also induced in the PE-like cells in culture, although a small amount was seen in the cells treated with RA alone. The presence of some Sparc mRNA in the VE-like culture indicates generation of PE-like cells as a minor population even with RA treatment alone, and this could account for the low level of Fgf-3 expression in the VE-like culture.Table IDetection of Sox mRNAs in F9 cells by RT-PCRMember of SOX familyNo. of clonesaPCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO and sequenceduF9bUndifferentiated F9 cellsdF9cDifferentiated F9 cells generated by RA and Bt2cAMP treatmentSox2720Sox602Sox7366Sox1305Sox1707Total10100a PCR products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO and sequencedb Undifferentiated F9 cellsc Differentiated F9 cells generated by RA and Bt2cAMP treatment Open table in a new tab Identification of SOX Protein Complexes Formed with PS4A—EMSA was used to examine the binding of SOX proteins to the PS4A element. The ability of SOX2 to form complexes with PS4A was demonstrated using undifferentiated F9 cell nuclear extracts and supershifting part of the complex with an anti-SOX2 serum (Fig. 4A, lane 2). As an additional control, in vitro transcribed/translated SOX2 was shown to bind PS4A and yielded a complex with a mobility indistinguishable from that formed with F9 nuclear extracts (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). We suspect that the incomplete supershift of the complex is because of a low antibody titer, although we cannot exclude the presence of other SOX proteins. When using differentiated F9 nuclear extracts, a minor complex with the same mobility as that attributed to SOX2 was detected (Fig. 4A, lane 3) and partially supershifted with the anti-SOX2 serum (lanes 4 and 6). This suggests that a small amount of SOX2 complex was also formed with differentiated F9 nuclear extracts and is consistent with the reduced level of Sox2 transcripts in differentiated F9 cells (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W1964268853,"Previous studies have suggested that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) play a role in deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In the present study, we demonstrated that glypican-1 can bind fibrillar Abeta, and the binding is mainly mediated by heparan sulfate (HS) chains. Further analysis revealed that glypican-1 is the major HSPG localized in detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched (DIG) domains where all machineries for Abeta production exist and Abeta is accumulated as monomeric and oligomeric forms. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that glypican-1 is localized in primitive plaques as well as classic plaques. Moreover, overexpression of glypican-1 and amyloid precursor protein in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in reduced cell viability and made cells more susceptible to thapsigargin-induced stress and Abeta toxicity. The results raise the possibility that glypican-1 interacts with oligomerized or polymerized Abeta in such a specific compartment as DIG, resulting not only in amyloid deposition in senile plaques of AD brain, but also in accelerating neuronal cell death in response to stress and Abeta."
https://openalex.org/W2020066606,"A new recombinant, human anti-sickling β-globin polypeptide designated βAS3 (βGly16 → Asp/βGlu22 → Ala/βThr87 → Gln) was designed to increase affinity for α-globin. The amino acid substitutions at β22 and β87 are located at axial and lateral contacts of the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymers and strongly inhibit deoxy-HbS polymerization. The β16 substitution confers the recombinant β-globin subunit (βAS3) with a competitive advantage over βS for interaction with the α-globin polypeptide. Transgenic mouse lines that synthesize high levels of HbAS3 (α2βAS32) were established, and recombinant HbAS3 was purified from hemolysates and then characterized. HbAS3 binds oxygen cooperatively and has an oxygen affinity that is comparable with fetal hemoglobin. Delay time experiments demonstrate that HbAS3 is a potent inhibitor of HbS polymerization. Subunit competition studies confirm that βAS3 has a distinct advantage over βS for dimerization with α-globin.

Knock-out transgenic mice that express exclusively human HbAS3 were produced. When these mice were bred with knock-out transgenic sickle mice the βAS3 polypeptides corrected all hematological parameters and organ pathology associated with the disease. Expression of βAS3-globin should effectively lower the concentration of HbS in erythrocytes of patients with sickle cell disease, especially in the 30% percent of these individuals who coinherit α-thalassemia.

The mutation of a single DNA base leads to the substitution of a valine for a glutamic acid in the β-globin polypeptide of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The positioning of a hydrophobic residue at this position permits an interaction with a hydrophobic pocket on another hemoglobin tetramer (see Fig. 1). This interaction allows deoxy-HbS to polymerize in an entropy-driven process (3Wishner B.C. Ward K.B. Lattman E.E. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 4Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dykes G.W. Crepeau R.H. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 451-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The polymerization of deoxy-HbS leads to erythrocyte deformation from a biconcave morphology into the sickle shapes for which SCD is named. Polymerization of deoxy-HbS is effectively inhibited by fetal hemoglobin (HbF), and individuals who are homozygous for the sickle mutation but also express high levels of HbF are typically asymptomatic (6Brittenham G.

Med. 1988; 318: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The level of HbF necessary to significantly reduce the symptoms of SCD ranges from about 20 to 25%; however, data showing an enhanced red cell survival with as little as 9% HbF have been reported (9Platt O.S. Brambilla D.J. Rosse W.F. Milner P.F. Castro O. Steinberg M.H. Klug P.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1639-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). The efficacy of HbF in inhibiting HbS polymerization suggests that transduction of fetal globin genes into hematopoietic stem cells might be an effective strategy for sickle cell disease gene therapy. However, high levels of γ-globin gene expression are difficult to achieve in adult erythroid cells even in the absence of competition with the β-globin gene for locus control region (LCR) interactions (10Behringer R.R. Ryan T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Enver T. Raich N. Ebens A.J. Papayannopoulou T. Costantini F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Low level expression of the γ-globin gene apparently results from the absence of fetal-specific positive regulatory factors in adult cells. Our approach to overcome this deficiency has been to utilize the β-globin gene as a backbone and to introduce γ-globin amino acid substitutions into this construct. We demonstrated previously that a β-globin gene containing alanine at position 22 and glutamine at position 87 (βAS2) significantly inhibited HbS polymerization (12McCune S.L. Reilly M.P. Chomo M.J. Asakura T. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9852-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have now introduced an additional modification into βAS2 to form βAS3; this modification increases the affinity of β-globin subunits for α-globin polypeptides. In this paper we demonstrate that βAS3 has a competitive advantage over βS polypeptides for interaction with limiting α-globin subunits and that HbAS3 dramatically inhibits deoxy-HbS polymerization.

Polymerization was initiated using the temperature jump method in which the temperature of deoxygenated hemoglobin solutions is rapidly changed from 0 to 30 °C, and aggregation is monitored turbidimetrically at 700 nm (22Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Adachi K. Segal R. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7595-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Hemoglobin Subunit Recombination—Monomeric α- and β-globin subunits were prepared as described (24Turci S.M. McDonald M.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hemolysates were treated with carbon monoxide prior to separation to reduce formation of methemoglobin. Isolated α- and β-globin monomers were allowed to combine at 0 °C for 1 h. The amounts of HbS and HbAS3 formed were determined by HPLC using a PolyCAT A cation exchange column (PolyLC, Columbia, MD). Hemoglobins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of Buffer A (35 mm BisTris, 1.5 mm KCN, 3 mm ammonium acetate, (pH 6.47)) and Buffer B (35 mm BisTris, 1.5 mm KCN, 16.85 mm ammonium acetate, 150 mm sodium acetate, (pH 7.0)) (25Kutlar A. Kutlar F. Gu L.G. Mayson S.M. Huisman T.H. Hum. Genet. 1990; 85: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1 ml/min with detection at 415 nm. The relative amounts of each hemoglobin were calculated by integration of the area under each peak. Analysis of Heterotetramer Formation—Equimolar amounts of purified oxygenated HbS and HbAS3 or HbA were mixed and allowed to equilibrate overnight at 0 °C as described previously (17Ip C.Y. Asakura T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The mixtures were analyzed by cation exchange chromatography as described above with the addition of 3 mm sodium dithionite to the elution buffers. Sodium dithionite was added to allow separation of hemoglobins under anaerobic conditions, which was necessary for detection of heterotetramers. Production of HbAS3, Knock-out Transgenic Sickle Mice—Mice that express HbAS3 exclusively were produced by breeding the HbAS3 mice with mouse α- and β-globin gene knock-out animals (26Ciavatta D.J.

Brion C.M. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 11-39Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These animals were subsequently bred with knock-out transgenic sickle mice (28Ryan T.M. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Science. 1997; 278: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) to obtain mice that were homozygous for mouse α- and β-globin gene knock-outs and contained the human LCR α, LCR γ-βS, and LCR βAS3 transgenes. These animals expressed approximately equal amounts of HbAS3 and HbS. Hematological Indices and Histopathology—Blood was collected from anesthetized animals into Microtainer EDTA collection tubes. The red blood cell count was measured on a HemaVet 1500 hematology analyzer. Hemoglobin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically after conversion to cyanmethemoglobin with Drabkin's reagent. Before determining the hemoglobin concentration, red cell membranes were formed into pellets at 14,000 rpm for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Removal of the membranes inhibits artifactually high values caused by membrane-bound, denatured hemoglobin. Hematocrit was measured with a JorVet J503 microhematocrit centrifuge. Reticulocyte count was determined by flow cytometry after staining with thiazole orange. Urine osmolality was measured after food and water were withheld from the mice for 4 h. Tissues were fixed in 70% alcoholic formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Gomori's iron stain by standard methods. Production of Recombinant Human Hemoglobin in Transgenic Mice—Fig. 1 illustrates the major contacts present in the HbS polymer. We reported previously amino acid substitutions (βGly22 → Asp and βThr87 → Gln) that inhibit HbS polymerization (12McCune S.L. Reilly M.P. Chomo M.J. Asakura T. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9852-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To provide the modified β-globin polypeptide with a competitive advantage for interacting with α-globin chains, we made an additional amino acid substitution (βGly16 → Asp). Codon changes were introduced into the human β-globin gene by site-directed mutagenesis, and the modified sequences were inserted downstream of a 22-kb DNA fragment containing the DNase hypersensitive sites 1–5(5′-HS 1–5) of the β-globin LCR (16Ryan T.M. Townes T.M. Reilly M.P. Asakura T. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Behringer R.R. Science. 1990; 247: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These constructs were injected into fertilized mouse eggs, and transgenic lines were established. Hemolysates obtained from several animals were analyzed by HPLC to quantitate the amounts of human, mouse, and hybrid hemoglobins (17Ip C.Y. Asakura T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The purity of the human hemoglobins was assessed by denaturing reverse-phase HPLC, which separated the α- and β-globin subunits (19Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 419: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 20Schroeder W.A. Shelton J.B. Shelton J.R. Huynh V. Teplow D.B. Hemoglobin. 1985; 9: 461-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Functional Analysis of Recombinant Human Hemoglobins— The oxygen equilibrium curve for purified HbAS3 is sigmoidal (data not shown), demonstrating that oxygen binding is cooperative. The P50 value (partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is half-saturated) was determined for HbAS3 and compared with HbA and HbF (Table I). The P50 for stripped HbAS3 is 7.2 mm Hg and is increased to 10.3 mm Hg in the presence of 2 mm bisphosphoglycerate. Although stripped HbAS3 has a higher oxygen affinity than HbA or HbF, its affinity in the presence of bisphosphoglycerate is similar to that of HbF. In a physiologic environment, HbAS3 should be indistinguishable from HbF, which is a protein that is known to function in vivo to provide protection against sickling crises.Table IP50 values of recombinant and naturally occurring human hemoglobinsSampleP50 valuesWithout BPGaBPG, bisphosphoglycerateWith BPGmm HgHbA8.813.3HbF8.810.0HbAS37.210.3a BPG, bisphosphoglycerate Open table in a new tab Inhibition of HbS Polymerization by Recombinant Human Hemoglobins—The ability of HbAS3 to inhibit deoxy-HbS polymerization was analyzed by delay time measurements (22Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HbS (100%) or mixtures of HbS (75%) and HbF or HbAS3 (25%) were deoxygenated, and polymerization as a function of time was measured spectrophotometrically (22Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Adachi K. Segal R. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7595-7603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A demonstrates that HbS polymerizes rapidly but that HbF and HbAS3 markedly delay HbS polymerization. HbAS3 inhibits HbS polymerization at approximately the same level as HbF, which is known to inhibit sickling in vivo at a 3:1 ratio (6Brittenham G. Lozoff B. Harris J.W. Mayson S.M. Miller A. Huisman T.H. Am. J. Hematol. 1979; 6: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Wood W.G. Pembrey M.E. Serjeant G.R. Perrine R.P. Weatherall D.J. Br. J. Haematol. 1980; 45: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Altay C. Schroeder W.A. Huisman T.H. Am. J. Hematol. 1977; 3: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that HbAS3 would inhibit HbS polymerization in vivo if HbAS3 levels constituted 25% of total hemoglobin. The delay times determined in Fig. 2A were all measured at a concentration of 60 mg/dl. Fig. 2B illustrates the results of similar experiments performed using different concentrations of total hemoglobin. The ratio of HbS to HbF or HbAS3 in these experiments was 3:1. In this figure the log of the reciprocal of the delay time and the log of hemoglobin concentration are plotted. As reported by Hofrichter et al. (30Hofrichter J. Ross P.D. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4864-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), an empirical relationship between delay time and hemoglobin concentration is described by the equation 1/td = γSn, where S = [Hb]total/[Hb]soluble and γ is an experimental constant. The n value is related to the size of nuclei formed during polymerization. The n values of the data shown in Fig. 2B are between 2 and 3, which agree well with those shown previously in high phosphate buffer (22Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The delay time plots for mixtures of HbS with HbF and HbS with HbAS3 overlap, indicating that HbAS3 has an ability to inhibit HbS polymerization that equals that of HbF. Competition for Dimerization with the α-Globin Subunit— Previous work demonstrated that two mutations were sufficient to provide the β-globin subunit with a significant ability to inhibit the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (12McCune S.L. Reilly M.P. Chomo M.J. Asakura T. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9852-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The anti-sickling HbAS2 described in that work was the starting point for the improved anti-sickling hemoglobin, which we have termed AS3. HbAS3 combines the mutations at position 22 and 87 of AS2 with a third mutation at position 16, which is known as HbJ-Baltimore (31Baglioni C. Weatherall D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This mutation increases the ability of a β-subunit to compete for dimerization with an α-subunit (32Mrabet N.T. McDonald M.J. Turci S. Sarkar R. Szabo A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5222-5228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The parameters that determine how well a β-subunit will interact with an α-subunit have been defined using naturally occurring mutant hemoglobins (33McDonald M.J. Turci S.M. Mrabet N.T. Himelstein B.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5951-5956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimerization relationship is straightforward and is based primarily upon the charge of the α- and β-chains (34Bunn H.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiologic conditions, the α-subunit is positively charged (pI 8.4), and the β-subunit is negatively charged (pI 6.7) (35Bunn H.F. McDonald M.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutations that increase the net negative charge on the β-subunit increase its ability to dimerize with the α-subunit. Similarly, mutations that decrease the negative charge on the β-subunit decrease its ability to dimerize with the α-subunit. The βS-subunit is particularly vulnerable to competition with a more negatively charged β-subunit because the sickle mutation, glutamic acid to valine, reduces the negative charge on the βS-chain. For this reason, erythrocytes in individuals with sickle trait do not contain 50% HbS and 50% HbA but contain ∼42–45% HbS (36Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic, and Clinical Aspects. Saunders Press, Philadelphia1986Google Scholar). Competition for the α-subunit, therefore, appears to be a potential method to increase the amount of anti-sickling hemoglobin in an erythrocyte at the expense of sickle hemoglobin. The addition of the HbJ-Baltimore mutation causes the net charge on βAS3 to equal that of βA; the addition of an aspartic acid at β16 compensates for the loss of a glutamic acid at β22. Based strictly upon charge, βAS3 should have a competitive advantage over βS for dimerization with the α-subunit. When α-, βS-, and βAS3-globin subunits are combined at an α-globin: β-globin ratio of 1:1, HbAS3 comprises 59.5% of total hemoglobin. As the α-globin subunit becomes limiting, the proportion of HbAS3 increases dramatically, reaching a level of 75.1% of total hemoglobin at an α-globin:β-globin ratio of 0.5:1 and 82% of total hemoglobin at a ratio of 0.1:1. These results demonstrate that β-subunits with the HbJ-Baltimore mutation have a significant competitive advantage over βS-polypeptides for interaction with α-subunits. The βAS3-subunit interacts with the α-subunit even more efficiently than would be expected on the basis of charge alone. Apparently, the specific combination of negative residues in βAS3-subunits improves the ability of this polypeptide to interact with α-globin chains. Additionally, a recombinant therapeutic hemoglobin must be able to form heterotetramers with deoxy-HbS to achieve effective inhibition of polymerization. Earlier studies have shown that the inhibitory effect of HbF on the polymerization of deoxy-HbS is dependent on the formation of heterotetramers (α2βSγ) (37Bookchin R.M. Nagel R.L. Balazs T. Nature. 1975; 256: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was proposed to explain the polymerization inhibitory effects of the naturally occurring minor hemoglobin, HbA2 (α2δ2) (38Nagel R.L. Bookchin R.M. Johnson J. Labie D. Wajcman H. Isaac-Sodeye W.A. Honig G.R. Schiliro G. Crookston J.H. Matsutomo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unlike the α2βAβS heterotetramer, the α2βSγ and αβSδ heterotetramers are excluded from the sickle polymer, which accounts for the increased inhibitory effects of HbF and HbA2 relative to HbA. To determine whether recombinant HbAS3 could form heterotetramers (a2βSβAS3), we mixed oxygenated HbAS3 with oxygenated HbS. At equilibrium, a binomial (1:2:1) distribution of parent hemoglobins and heterotetramers is observed (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained for oxygenated mixtures of HbA and HbS. Correction of Abnormal Red Blood Cell Morphology and Hematological Parameters in Knock-out Transgenic Sickle/AS3 Mice—To determine whether HbAS3 would inhibit HbS polymerization in vivo, we bred mice that express HbAS3 with our knock-out transgenic sickle mice and obtained animals that were homozygous for mouse α- and β-globin gene knock-outs and contained the human LCR α, LCR γ-βS, and LCR βAS3 transgenes. Blood smears from sickle control and sickle/AS3 animals are illustrated in Fig. 4. Many sickled cells are observed in the sickle control; however, no sickled cells are observed in sickle/AS3 mice (two representative animals). The upper left panel is a wild-type control. The blood smears of sickle/AS3 animals also lack the anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and polychromasia that are characteristic of erythrocyte morphology observed in SCD mice and HbS patients (28Ryan T.M. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Science. 1997; 278: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 36Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic, and Clinical Aspects. Saunders Press, Philadelphia1986Google Scholar). Fig. 5 compares hematological indices of control, sickle, and sickle/AS3 mice. In sickle/AS3 animals, red blood cell counts are nearly doubled, hemoglobin levels are increased by 6 g/dl, hematocrit is normalized, and reticulocytosis is reduced to levels approaching those of wild-type mice. Sickled erythrocytes are not observed in blood smears or in tissues of sickle/AS3 mice. These data demonstrate that HbAS3 is a potent anti-sickling hemoglobin in vivo.Fig. 5Hematological parameters of sickle/AS3 corrected mice. Shown are hematological indices of control (n = 5), sickle (n = 5), and sickle/AS3 (n = 5) mice.

The spleens of sickle mice are characterized by a massive expansion of red pulp, dramatic pooling of sinusoidal erythrocytes, vaso-occlusion, and a complete loss of lymphoid follicular structure. In sickle/AS3 mice, normal splenic red and white pulp is observed, and virtually no pools of sickle erythrocytes or infarcts are evident. In addition, splenomegaly is substantially diminished in sickle/AS3 mice (Fig. 6C); sickle/AS3 spleens are ∼0.6% of total body weight compared with sickle spleens that are almost 4% of body weight. Livers of sickle animals are characterized by focal areas of necrosis and pronounced congestion of the intrahepatic vasculature with pooling of sickled red blood cells. Large aggregates of erythroid progenitors are evident in the sinusoids, and this extramedullary hematopoiesis is indicative of severe anemia. There is also abundant hemosiderin deposition subsequent to Kupffer cell erythrophagocytosis. In sickle/AS3 animals, focal areas of necrosis and aggregation of sickled erythrocytes are not observed; also, extramedullary hematopoiesis and hemosiderin deposition are absent. In the kidneys of mock transduced mice, engorgement and occlusion of blood vessels results in vascular, tubular, and glomerular changes. Sequestration and occlusion are most obvious at the corticomedullary junction where dilated capillaries are easily observed in this region of reduced oxygen tension. Reduced medullary blood flow in HbS patients causes extensive tubular damage that results in hyposthenuria, and this same loss of urine-concentrating ability is observed in the sickle mice. Kidneys of sickle animals also accumulate abundant hemosiderin in the cortical region, and these aggregates are easily visualized with Gomori's iron staining (data not shown). In contrast, kidneys of sickle/AS3 mice appear normal and free of the disruptive vascular red blood cell pooling and hemosiderin deposits observed in mock treated animals. Most importantly, urine-concentrating ability is completely restored in sickle/AS3 mice (Fig. 6B). Expression of βAS3-globin should effectively lower the concentration of HbS in erythrocytes of patients with SCD, especially in the 30% of these individuals who coinherit α-thalassemia (39Higgs D.R. Vickers M.A. Wilkie A.O. Pretorius I.M. Jarman A.P. Weatherall D.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1081-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently corrected our knock-out transgenic mouse model of SCD using lentiviral transduction of the βAS3 anti-sickling gene into purified hematopoietic stem cells (40Levasseur D.N. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Townes T.M. Blood. 2003; 102: 4312-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These results suggest that stem cell- and genetics-based therapies using recombinant βAS3-globin may be able to be translated to human sickle patients. We thank members of the Townes laboratory for helpful discussions."

(E.C. 1.15.1.1) are important antioxidant metalloenzymes protecting cells against oxidative stress arising from reactive oxygen species (1Fridovich I. J. Biol.

SODs are ubiquitous, and multiple forms often exist within a single organism or cell. Four major forms of SODs (Mn, Fe, Cu/Zn, and Ni) have been identified, distinguished by the protein fold and by the nature of the catalytic metal ion (5Keele Jr., B.B. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J.

Kim E.J. Roe J.H. Hah Y.C. Kang S.O. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Mn- and Fe-SODs share extensive homology in protein structure, whereas the Ni and Cu/Zn enzymes are structurally distinct. Despite their similar structures (9Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the Mn- and Fe-SODs exhibit a strict specificity for the catalytic metal ion (manganese or iron). Much lower selectivity is generally observed for metal binding, and the dimeric Mn-SOD from Escherichia coli is typically isolated as a mixture of Mn2-, (Mn,Fe)-, Fe2-, and half-apoforms (10Beyer Jr., W.F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Apo-Mn-SOD binds metals nonselectively in the presence of guanidinium denaturants, and this method has been used to prepare manganese-, iron-, and cobalt-reconstituted forms (13Ose D.E. Fridovich I.

Each subunit of the E. coli Mn-SOD homodimer is composed of two domains, a predominantly α-helical N-terminal domain and a mixed α/β C-terminal domain (18Edwards R.A. Baker H.M. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Jameson G.B. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 161-171Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The metal-binding site lies on the interface between these two domains buried in the interior of the protein. The mononuclear metal ion is coordinated by four amino acid side chains (Fig. 1), two arising from the N-terminal domain (His-26 and His-81) and two from the C-terminal domain (Asp-167 and His-171), resulting in a metal ion cross-link between the two domains. A buried solvent molecule serves as a fifth ligand forming a hydrogen bond in the outer sphere of the metal complex with the amido head group of Glu-146 (E. coli Mn-SOD sequence numbering). The metal ion appears to be very tightly bound, being released only under denaturing conditions and resisting extraction by metal chelators like EDTA (13Ose D.E. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Earlier work has shown that metal-free apo-SOD is produced during expression of recombinant thermophilic SODs in the mesophilic host, E. coli. The purified apoprotein has been shown to efficiently take up metal ion in vitro at elevated temperatures, and the binding is essentially irreversible under these conditions. At lower temperatures, metal uptake is not detected (19Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 402-408PubMed Google Scholar). The sigmoidal temperature profile for metalation of the recombinant thermophilic apo-SODs suggests that a two-state activated process is involved. The requirements for denaturing conditions to remove the metal and thermally triggered metal uptake imply the existence of large activation barriers for changes in the metalation state of the folded protein, preventing the use of direct titration to measure metal binding affinities for this family of proteins. In recent years an alternative approach, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), has been used to estimate very large binding constants of ultratight protein interactions that cannot be conveniently measured using conventional equilibrium techniques (21Brandts J.F.

In the present study we have used DSC methods to estimate the previously unmeasured binding constants for manganese and iron complexes of Mn-SOD, providing new insight into the metal binding processes within this family of enzymes. Mn-SOD was purified from E. coli as described previously (11Whittaker J.W. Whittaker M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Apo-Mn-SOD was prepared by literature methods and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10 mm EDTA (13Ose D.E. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem.

Protein concentration was determined by optical absorption measurements using the reported molar extinction coefficient (ϵ280 = 8.66 × 104m-1 cm-1) (14Beyer Jr., W.F. Reynolds J.A. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase activity was measured with the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c inhibition assay (5Keele Jr., B.B. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6176-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metal analyses were performed using a Varian Instruments SpectrAA atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a GTA 96 graphite furnace. The activation of apo-Mn-SOD was performed in 50 μl of 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7, containing 0.1 mm apo-Mn-SOD and 1 mm MnCl2, and the reaction mixture was heated in a thin-walled polypropylene tube in a thermal cycler (MJ Research) for 5 min, chilled on ice, and stored at -80 °C for SOD activity assay. This approach was also used to screen a range of buffer compositions for enhanced reversibility of thermal unfolding of E. coli Mn-SOD reproducing the heating/cooling rates and temperature scan ranges used in the DSC experiments. For calorimetric studies, 0.5 ml of protein (2 mg/ml) in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7, was used in each measurement. When guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) was included in the sample, 0.5 ml of 4 mg/ml protein in 40 mm MOPS, pH 7, was mixed with GdmHCl solution (twice the final concentration) immediately before the scan. Fully reduced Mn(II)2-SOD was prepared by the addition of 2 eq of H2O2 to native (as isolated) Mn-SOD, diluted to 4 mg/ml, and centrifuged for 10 min at high speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Aliquots of Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD were stored at -80 °C and thawed immediately before measurement. For DSC studies on Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD, MnCl2 was included in the sample buffer (1 mm final concentration). The calorimetric measurements were carried out using a Model 6100 NanoII differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.) using the built-in software for data acquisition and analysis. The measurements were performed by scanning from low to high temperature (upscan) at 1.5 K/min or 0.25 K/min followed by a downscan at the same scan rate. For GdmHCl concentration dependence studies only upscans were performed. A reference blank containing all reagents except the protein was measured for each sample at identical settings. E. coli apo-Mn-SOD prepared by extraction of metal ions with a chelating agent under denaturing conditions (GdmHCl, low pH) followed by renaturation of the protein contained less than 1% of manganese or iron and was devoid of superoxide dismutase activity. Apo-Mn-SOD was stable toward metal binding below ambient temperature but could be activated by incubating with MnCl2 salts at elevated temperatures. The temperature dependence of this activation process is shown in Fig. 2. The activation profile may be fit to a two-state transition model with a midpoint transition temperature Tm = 44.6 °C (318 K). A van't Hoff analysis of the metalation profile yields estimates for the thermochemical parameters for the transition (van't Hoff enthalpy, ΔHVH = 232 kJ/mol; van't Hoff entropy, ΔSVH = 728 J/mol·K). Both apo- and metalated Mn-SOD samples underwent irreversible precipitation during DSC scans in MOPS buffer (data not shown). Addition of low concentrations of GdmHCl (0.6–1.0 m) eliminated the formation of protein aggregates and resulted in quasireversible behavior of the sample (Fig. 3) as previously reported for the human fibroblast growth factor-1 protein (24Blaber S.I. Culajay J.F. Khurana A. Blaber M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 470-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For these samples, ∼20–50% of the protein contributed to a well developed unfolding endotherm on successive scans indicating that at least a fraction of the protein was able to refold reversibly under these conditions. DSC endotherms for a range of concentrations of GdmHCl (0.6–1.0 m) (Figs. 4 and 5) were analyzed, and the midpoint temperatures obtained for these sets were extrapolated to zero GdmHCl concentration for both apo-Mn-SOD and Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD (Figs. 4 and 5, insets). The DSC scan profile did not fit well to a simple two-state model and required a more extensive analysis to extract the transition enthalpy from the data. First, the combined ΔH base line was obtained by matching the linear pretransition base line to the polynomial post-transition base line. The transition enthalpy was then derived by evaluating the total Cp area under the curve minus the combination base line, and the entropy of the transition was calculated as the transition enthalpy divided by the transition temperature (Tm), evaluated at the maximum of the transition curve. The ΔCp was measured as the displacement amplitude for the ΔH base line over the transition (Table I). The partial specific volume of the protein was taken as 0.73 cm3/g in all these calculations.Fig. 4Guanidinium dependence of the unfolding transition for apo-Mn superoxide dismutase. Apo-Mn-SOD (2 mg/ml) in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, containing 0.6–1.0 M GdmHCl (GuHCl) was transferred to the DSC sample cell, and endotherms were recorded from 25–65 °C at 1.5 K/min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each endotherm was fitted to a base line (—-) and simulated to extract the integrated enthalpy for the transition and the midpoint temperature for the transition (Tm). The regression line for this set of midpoint temperatures was extrapolated to zero GdmHCl (GuHCl) concentration (inset) yielding an estimate of the unperturbed transition temperature.

Unfolding endotherms recorded for apo-Mn-SOD in 0.6–1.0 m Gdm-HCl solutions (Fig. 4) show a consistent trend of decreasing Tm with increasing GdmHCl concentration, extrapolating to Tm = 58.6 °C in the absence of GdmHCl (Fig. 4, inset; Table I). The unfolding transition is quite broad and does not fit well to a simple two-state transition model, which would require a more symmetrical endotherm, suggesting the possibility of multiple stable, partly folded intermediates in the unfolding pathway for this protein. The magnitude of the heat capacity change for unfolding apo-Mn-SOD (13 kJ/mol K) lies within the range of values for reversible unfolding enthalpies observed for other proteins (4–17 kJ/mol K). Similar analysis of the unfolding transition for reduced, fully metalated Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD in the presence of 1 mm Mn(II) ions in solution is shown in Fig. 5. The homogeneous reduced complex was selected for these experiments because the instability of the Mn(III) ion released into solution would be expected to contribute significantly to the irreversibility of the unfolding transition. The inclusion of excess Mn(II) ions actually appears to enhance the reversibility of the unfolding process and also makes it easier to evaluate the metal contributions to protein stability (see below). Extrapolation of the transition temperature to zero GdmHCl leads to the prediction of Tm = 76.2 °C in the absence of denaturant (Fig. 5, inset; Table I); the shift in transition temperature ΔTm = 17.6 °C reflects a dramatic stabilization of the protein by the bound metal. Metal Binding Affinity—The DSC protein stability data contain important information on related aspects of protein structure and interactions, and it may be used to estimate both metal binding affinities and the perturbation of the redox potential in the metalloprotein complex. We have applied Brandts' tight binding analysis (21Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.-N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6927-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23Lin L.-N. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brandts J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to the DSC data to estimate the magnitude of Mn(II) binding affinity to the protein, using an expression for the equilibrium binding affinity derived from the theory of the coupled equilibria, ÂKMn(II)(TMn)=exp[âˆ’Î”HapoR(1TMnâˆ’1Tapo)+Î”CpR(lnTMnTapo+TapoTMnâˆ’1)][Mn(II)]TMnÂ(Eq. 1) where KMn(II)(TMn) is the equilibrium binding affinity for formation of the protein-Mn(II) complex at the transition temperature for unfolding Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD, ΔHapo is the transition enthalpy for apo-Mn-SOD, Tapo is the transition temperature for unfolding of apo-Mn-SOD, TMn is the transition temperature for unfolding Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD, ΔCp is the heat capacity change for unfolding apo-Mn-SOD, and [Mn(II)]TMn is the concentration of free metal ion at TMn. Based on this expression with the observed ΔH and ΔCp values for Mn-SOD, a 10 °C shift in Tm corresponds to an ∼105-fold increase in KMn(II). The calorimetric data obtained for samples of apo-Mn-SOD and Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD yield an estimate for KMn(II) = 3.2 × 108m-1 at 76 °C. This represents the first experimental measure of metal binding affinity within this family of metalloenzymes and provides a useful estimate of the intrinsic affinity of the SOD metal-binding site for its cognate metal ion. In the absence of GdmHCl, the unfolding transition loses its reversibility, but comparison of results for apo-Mn-SOD and Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD unfolding under these conditions with the quasireversible processes measured in the presence of GdmHCl demonstrates the essential validity of the former results (Fig. 6, Table I). This suggests that irreversible processes (including aggregation) do not dramatically perturb the measured Tm values even though they will obviously contribute to the amplitude of the endotherm. The ΔTm shift between apo- and Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD unfolding in the absence of denaturant is 18.4 °C, differing from the value obtained under quasireversible conditions by less than 1 °C. This indicates that the ΔTm results measured in the absence of GdmHCl may be used to determine the effects of the identity of the metal ion and metal oxidation state on protein stability (Fig. 6) even though the Tm values are shifted, in part because of the higher scan rate used in these experiments. Comparison of the DSC endotherms observed for fully reduced Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD (Fig. 6C) and fully oxidized Mn(III)2-Mn-SOD (Fig. 6D) with native Mn-SOD (Fig. 6B) shows that the DSC analysis is sensitive to metal oxidation state with the redox heterogeneity of the native Mn-SOD sample being clearly resolved by this technique. The oxidized Mn(III) metal center is bound more tightly in the protein than the reduced Mn(II) ion, reflecting the protein tuning of the redox potential of the metal ion by selective stabilization of different oxidation states. Using the quasireversible values for unfolding enthalpy and ΔCp for apo-Mn-SOD and the observed Tm values for the unfolding Mn-SOD species in the absence of GdmHCl, the association constants for metalation may be estimated for each of the complexes. For Mn(II)2-Mn-SOD the metal binding affinity calculated using the irreversible Tm values (KMn(II) = 3 × 109m-1) is within an order of magnitude of the reversible value, demonstrating the reliability of the results and the calibration of the uncertainties. For the oxidized Mn(III)2-Mn-SOD the calculated affinity is 8 orders of magnitude higher still (KMn(III) = 5 × 1017m-1). Fe-substituted Mn-SOD is composed of a majority Fe(III) species, exhibiting a high Tm and a minor Fe(II) species that gives rise to the smaller pretransition feature in the unfolding endotherm for Fe2-Mn-SOD, near 63 °C (Fig. 6E). Metal binding affinities may be calculated from these data for both Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes (KFe(II) = 4 × 107m-1; KFe(III) = 2 × 1018m-1). Redox Potential Perturbation—The oxidation state dependence of the complex stability may be related to the stabilization of the redox potential of the metal ion by the protein relative to its solution value, ΔΔG=−RTln(Kred/Kox)=−nFΔE (Eq. 2) where F is the Faraday equivalent and ΔE is the shift in redox potential of the metal ion on binding to the protein. The magnitude of the observed ΔTm for Mn(II) and Mn(III) forms (ΔTm = 21 °C) is thus consistent with an ∼0.7-V stabilization of the redox potential in the protein complex (at 90 °C) relative to the value for the Mn(III) ion in solution (EMn(III)/(II)(aq)0=1.4 V), roughly predicting EMn(III)/(II)0=0.7 V for the Mn-SOD complex, underestimating the magnitude of the perturbation required by the value for the protein reduction potential reported from electrochemical studies on Mn-SOD (EMn(III)/(II)SOD = 0.25–0.3 V) (15Vance C.K.

However, comparison of the potentials estimated indirectly by calorimetry with those measured directly by electrochemistry is problematic. The reference redox couple in solution (assumed here to be the free Mn(III)/(II) ions) is not precisely defined in the calorimetry experiment, and the reduction potential of the reference complex would be substantially lower if stabilized by anionic ligands, e.g. protein surface carboxylates. The reduction potential of the Mn(III)-EDTA aminocarboxylate complex is E0 = 0.8 V, a value that would yield an estimate of EMn(III)/(II) = 0.1 V for the Mn ion in Mn-SOD. Further, the calculated ΔE refers to potentials at 90 °C, but the temperature coefficients are not known for either the reference or protein redox couples. For iron-substituted Mn-SOD the perturbation of the redox potential is only slightly larger (ΔE = -0.76 V at 87 °C), reflecting a similar energetic stabilization of the trivalent versus divalent metal complexes by the protein irrespective of the identity of the metal ion. However, for the iron complex, the significantly lower solution value for the Fe(III)/(II) redox potential (0.77 V) results in a relatively low potential for the protein complex (0.0 V) that must contribute to the strict metal specificity of Mn-SOD. Whereas the precise magnitudes of the redox potential shifts are clearly difficult to determine from calorimetric measurements alone, the important observation here is that the altered redox potential that has been reported for iron-substituted Mn-SOD (15Vance C.K. Miller A.-F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 461-467Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reflects a charge-dependent stabilization of the metal complexes that serves as a mechanism for tuning the redox potential of these complexes (see below). Metal binding is an essential biological function for metalloproteins and metalloenzymes that require metals for activity. Metal uptake is highly regulated in living cells, providing some control over complex formation, but ultimately the interactions of the protein-binding site with the coordinated metal ion determines the selectivity of metal binding and the functional specificity of the complex. In the Mn,Fe-superoxide dismutase family of proteins the essential antioxidant function of the enzyme depends on incorporation of the correct metal ion in the active site. However, despite the dramatic specificity that this family of enzymes exhibits for the catalytic metal ion (less than 1% of wild type activity when the wrong metal is bound), metal uptake appears to be surprisingly unselective both in vitro and in vivo. Mn2-, (Mn,Fe)-, Fe2-, and half-apo-Mn-SOD are all present when Mn-SOD is isolated from E. coli cells. This raises important questions about how the SOD protein interacts with metal ions. Does Mn-SOD have a different affinity for manganese versus iron? How tightly is the metal bound? Is metal uptake controlled by kinetic or thermodynamic factors? Conventional approaches have not been able to address these questions directly because of limitations imposed on equilibrium binding measurements by the kinetics of binding and release. Metal binding by the SOD may involve large activation barriers resulting in the thermally triggered metal uptake previously reported for thermophilic enzymes in this family (19Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 402-408PubMed Google Scholar). We have now shown (Fig. 2) that the mesophilic Mn-SOD from E. coli also exhibits this behavior, following a strong sigmoidal temperature profile for metal uptake that parallels the behavior observed for thermophilic (Thermus thermophilus Mn-SOD) (19Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and hyperthermophilic (Pyrobaculum aerophilum cambialistic SOD) (20Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 402-408PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes. This behavior may be modeled as a two-state transition between forms of the apoprotein that are distinguished by their ability to bind the metal ion. A van't Hoff analysis of these curves provides information on the thermodynamic quantities associated with the transition. Enthalpy and entropy changes are modest and very similar over the set of proteins despite structural and thermal stability differences. The transition temperature (Tm) corresponding to the point at which the enthalpy and entropy changes are equal varies systematically over these proteins and correlates with the growth temperature of the organism in which the protein is expressed, which has been interpreted as a thermophilic shift in properties for proteins adapted to function at a specific temperature range. For the mesophilic E. coli Mn-SOD the midpoint of the transition curve (Fig. 2) (Tm = 44.6 °C) is somewhat above the physiological growth temperature for E. coli, and the enthalpy change evaluated from the curve is small compared with that found for global unfolding of the protein (see below). In addition to the barriers for metal entry into the active site, reflected in the thermally triggered metal uptake behavior, significant activation barriers must also exist for the release of the metal ion that only occurs under strongly denaturing conditions. In the present study we have overcome the inherent limitations these kinetic barriers impose on the measurement of metal binding affinities by using calorimetric methods to monitor metal-protein interactions indirectly through the stability of the metalloprotein complex. This approach is based on the complementary aspects of metal binding affinity and protein stabilization, which are coupled processes in a closed cycle that are related by a thermodynamic equality (Equation 3). ΔGunfold,MnSOD−ΔGunfold,apo−SOD=−ΔGMn binding (Eq. 3) This principle has previously been applied in a calorimetric investigation of tight binding interactions in transferrin (23Lin L.-N. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Brandts J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and other proteins (21Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.-N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 22Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6927-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 29Brewer J.M. Wampler J.E. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 1: 213, 204-218, 211Google Scholar) where the theory has been extensively developed and experimentally validated. Ideally this approach requires measurement of the unfolding process under fully reversible conditions in order for the thermodynamic treatment to be valid. However, in practice it has been found that quasireversibility or partial reversibility is sufficient. We have found that at the protein concentration required for calorimetric measurements, aggregation of unfolded E. coli Mn-SOD above the transition leads to irreversibility and adds to the measured enthalpy change. However, inclusion of low concentrations of GdmHCl (0.6–1.0 m) in the sample buffer stabilizes the protein in the unfolded state, permitting a significant fraction to undergo the global unfolding in a reversible fashion (Fig. 3), preventing the formation of aggregates and yielding more reliable data from the calorimetric scans. The magnitude of the stability constant for metal binding by Mn-SOD is large but not exceptionally large. A survey of Mn(II) affinities of a series of aminocarboxylate chelates indicates that the value obtained in these experiments is typical of this type of complex. For example, a value of Ka = 1014m-1 is reported for the tetracarboxylate EDTA-Mn(II) complex (30Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1. Plenum Press, New York1974: 204-211Google Scholar), for which a stronger binding would be expected, because it has a larger number of anionic carboxylate groups. This analysis appears to contradict observations that the metal is bound essentially irreversibly to Mn-SOD and cannot be extracted by dialysis against EDTA. The apparent discrepancy is resolved by recognizing that the metal-binding site is buried in the interior of the protein and that the binding and release of the metal ion are not determined by the metal-protein interactions alone. In fact, the same activation barriers that are evident in the thermally triggered metalation process will affect the release of the metal ion as well. The stabilization of the metal complex thus includes contributions from both direct coordination (reflected in equilibrium binding affinity) and other interactions in the protein affecting the kinetics of binding and release that are largely independent of the presence or absence of the metal ion. These components are resolved in the calorimetry experiment, which allows us to separate the metal binding affinity term. The transition temperature observed in the thermally triggered metal uptake experiment (44.6 °C) (Fig. 2) is below the Tm measured for global unfolding of the apo-Mn-SOD (Tm = 52.5 °C, in the absence of GdmHCl, Table I). This suggests that metalation may occur within a partially unfolded state of the apo-Mn-SOD formed at a temperature below that required to completely unfold the protein. The relatively small values of the van't Hoff enthalpy estimated from a two-state analysis of the metal uptake profile are also consistent with a relatively low energy transition associated with Mn-SOD metalation. Details of this metal uptake mechanism will be dealt with in a separate study. The observation that Fe(III) and Mn(III) ions are bound to Mn-SOD with nearly equal affinity implies that the low metal binding selectivity that has been observed in metal binding studies is associated with inherently low discrimination of these two metal ions by the protein. Metal selectivity must be imposed on the protein by availability of metals in the cellular compartment in which the protein functions. At present there is no clear evidence for a chaperone for manganese corresponding to the copper chaperones that have been identified in the copper homeostasis system (31Luk E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) although a manganese-specific carrier protein has recently been implicated in delivery of manganese to superoxide dismutase in yeast mitochondria (32Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of the E. coli genome does not reveal any homolog for this putative yeast manganese chaperone, and in any case it is unclear whether the yeast manganese carrier directly interacts with the aposuperoxide dismutase protein. In conclusion, calorimetric studies have provided the first experimental estimates of the metal binding affinity within the Mn,Fe-Mn-SOD family of proteins. The metal binding is tight, but not ultratight, indicating that elements of protein structure that are essentially independent of the presence or absence of the metal ion contribute to the kinetic stability of the buried metal complex. The thermodynamic coupling between metal binding, metal oxidation, and protein unfolding is clearly illustrated by these experiments, contributing new insight into the interactions between the protein and its metal cofactor (Scheme 1). The metal oxidation state dependence of the stabilization of the metalloprotein complex provides an estimate of the redox potential of the complex. The lack of metal binding selectivity between manganese and iron in Mn-SOD is reflected in the similar stabilization afforded by either Mn(III) or Fe(III) complexes, demonstrating that there is very little difference in equilibrium affinities for these two metal ions. Metal binding to Mn-SOD is kinetically controlled by metal bioavailability and depends on thermal excitation of the apo-Mn-SOD protein."

The amiloride sensitivity, Na+ conductance, and critical domains for gating are characterized as a cross between proton-activated Na+ channels and α-ENaC. The hypothesis that external protons may activate human δ-ENaC was addressed by expressing δβγ-hENaC in Xenopus oocytes and evaluating proton-activated current with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Our results showed that protons transiently evoked a Na+ current with an EC50 of pH 6 overlapped on the basal current of δβγ-hENaC. Proton-activated current was not observed in uninjected oocytes. Studies on gating kinetics revealed that activation, desensitization, and recovery times of proton-activated Na+ current were 3.8 ± 0.5 s, 253 ± 9.5 s, and 10 ± 3.6 s, respectively (n = 4–12). Alkali metal cation selectivity of the proton-activated current was identical to that of the basal current of δβγ-hENaC. The metabolic acids, lactate, pyruvate, and formate, modified the proton-activated current, as did hypo-osmotic stress. EDTA, hypo-osmolarity, and lactate enhanced proton activation synergistically. Our results suggest that δ-hENaC subunit is essential for proton-activated current and γ-subunit may potentially regulate the response of δ-hENaC to protons. We have concluded that δβγ-hENaC is a proton-activated cation channel whose closing gate can be regulated by a proton-induced conformational change. Proton-sensitivity of δβγ-hENaC may be an important mechanism for integrating external ischemic signals in inflamed and hypoxic tissues. The δ-subunit of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) is predominately expressed in brain, heart, and pancreas. The amiloride sensitivity, Na+ conductance, and critical domains for gating are characterized as a cross between proton-activated Na+ channels and α-ENaC. The hypothesis that external protons may activate human δ-ENaC was addressed by expressing δβγ-hENaC in Xenopus oocytes and evaluating proton-activated current with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Our results showed that protons transiently evoked a Na+ current with an EC50 of pH 6 overlapped on the basal current of δβγ-hENaC. Proton-activated current was not observed in uninjected oocytes. Studies on gating kinetics revealed that activation, desensitization, and recovery times of proton-activated Na+ current were 3.8 ± 0.5 s, 253 ± 9.5 s, and 10 ± 3.6 s, respectively (n = 4–12). Alkali metal cation selectivity of the proton-activated current was identical to that of the basal current of δβγ-hENaC.

Proton-sensitivity of δβγ-hENaC may be an important mechanism for integrating external ischemic signals in inflamed and hypoxic tissues. Acidosis is very common under physiological and pathological conditions. Systematic acidosis, including respiratory and metabolic acid-base disorders, increases the extracellular proton concentrations throughout the body. Local hypoxia, inflammation, and ischemia generally lead to accumulation of metabolic acids, resulting in a pH decrease of the extracellular fluid. On the other hand, a pH drop is also a normal physiological occurrence. For example, external and cellular pH changes happen by the H+ ion and neurotransmitter translocation. δ-subunit of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; hENaC, human ENaC; rENaC, rat ENaC; ASIC, proton-gated sodium channel; BAPTA_AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl easter); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. belongs to the ENaC/degenerin superfamily, which was originally identified in Caenorhabditis elegans and colonic epithelia. So far, five isoforms of the ENaC branch of this superfamily have been identified. When δ-ENaC is expressed in oocytes, channels with low amiloride sensitivity, more Na+ permeability over Li+, and a unitary Na+ conductance of 12 pS resulted (1Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J.

Tissue distribution of δ-ENaC subunit mostly matches that of the proton-activated Na+ channels (ASIC), another member of the ENaC/degenerin superfamily. Location of these channels in non-epithelial tissues may reflect a function and regulation of δ-ENaC as distinct and diverse as its epithelial counterpart, namely α-ENaC subunit. There is ample evidence of regulation of native amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance in epithelial tissues and cloned ENaC by external pH. Ussing (7Ussing H.H. Acta Physiol. Scandinav. 1949; 17: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found in 1949 that the short circuit current of frog skin decreased when external pH was below 5. Comparable findings were reported by several groups (8Cuthbert A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 945-957PubMed Google Scholar, 9Funder J. Ussing H.H. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol.

Acta. 1971; 233: 591-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Chung and Johnson (12Chung R.S. Johnson G.M. Surg. Forum. 1977; 28: 435-437PubMed Google Scholar) in mammalian epithelia. In contrast, a stimulation of amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance in frog skin was observed as external pH declined (13Leaf A. Keller A. Dempsey E. Am. J. Physiol. 1964; 207: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Grinstein S. Candia O. Erlij D. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 40: 261-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Li J.H.-Y. Adv.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C477-C486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that external acidic pH (pH 6.4) did not have any effect on rat αβγ-ENaC (rENaC) expressed in oocytes when examined by the two-electrode voltage clamp and cell-free planar lipid bilayer assays. Zhang et al. (17Zhang P. Fyfe G.K. Grichtchenko I.I. Canessa C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3043-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) found with cell-attached patches that only the αβ-rENaC channel (and not αβγ-rENaC) was down-regulated by external acidic pH. Acidic pH elevated the apical Na+ conductance in A6 cells within the first hour but decreased αβγ-rENaC activity expressed in oocytes following a slight transient rise (18Awayda M.S. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1896-C1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the effects of external protons on cloned δ-hENaC (19Ji H.L. Copeland S.J. Bishop L.R. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 529aGoogle Scholar, 20Ji H.L. Copeland S.J. Waldmann R. Fuller C.M. Lazdunski M.L. Benos D.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 913aGoogle Scholar). The similarities in cation selectivity, amiloride affinity, and tissue location of δ-ENaC and ASIC channels prompted us to test the hypothesis that δ-ENaC is activated by external protons. This idea has been addressed by co-expressing δ-hENaC with human βγ-subunits in Xenopus oocytes and measuring the effects of protons on δ-hENaC channel activity. cRNA Preparation—cRNA for human δ-, β-, and γ-ENaC (hENaC) and their degenerin mutants were prepared as previously described (1Ji H.L.

Site-directed degenerin mutants of δS526F, βS520F, and γS529F hENaC were created with the Chameleon double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and sequenced. Transcription and in vitro translation were performed as described previously (23Ji H.L. Parker S. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C64-C74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocyte Expression and Whole-cell Assay—A detailed description of this technique has been previously published (24Ji H.L. Jovov B. Fu J. Bishop L.R. Mebane H.C. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8395-8405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, defolliculated oocytes were cytosolically injected with wild type and mutant hENaCs in 50 nl of RNase free water/oocyte of cRNA and incubated in half-strength L-15 medium. Whole-cell cation currents were measured by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Oocytes were impaled with two electrodes having resistances of 0.5–2 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. A TEV 200 voltage clamp amplifier was used to clamp oocytes with concomitant recording of currents. Two reference electrodes were connected to the bath. Sampling protocols were given by pCLAMP 8.0, and current at –60 mV was simultaneously monitored with a chart recorder. The control superfusate was ND96 (in mm: 96 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 KCl, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5). Superfusate with pH 6 or below was buffered with MES. pH was adjusted with NaOH and HCl. Na salt was replaced with equal molar Li+, K+, and Cs+ for ion selectivity determination. Current-voltage relationships were acquired by stepping the holding potential in 20-mV increments from –120 to +80 mV after the monitoring currents were stable, with and without application of amiloride. To test the effects of hypo-osmolarity, extracellular divalent cations, lactate, and their combinations on the proton-activated δβγ-ENaC current, 40 mm NaCl (ND-40) was included in the bath solution (80 mosm) and mannitol was used to prepare the corresponding iso-osmotic medium (200 mosm). 5 mm EDTA or EGTA and 15 mm lactate were added. Data were sampled at the rate of 1 kHz and filtered at 500 kHz. Because most proton-activated channels have fast activation and desensitization times of up to few seconds, pH switching was controlled by a SF-77B perfusion fast step system (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) to deliver solutions with neutral or acidic pH to a tiny chamber with a 0.1-ml volume. Data Analysis—Proton-activated Na+ current was computed by subtracting the basal current from the peak current in the presence of protons. The activation time constant (τa) and desensitization time constant (τd) were calculated by fitting the current trace of activation and decay with the built-in first order exponential function of CLAMP-FIT 9. The fitted curves are depicted in Fig. 5. Recovery time (τrec) was calculated by fitting the fraction of proton-activated Na+ currents as a function of time interval between proton applications. Computation of the EC50 of external pH was performed by fitting the acid-activated current with the Hill equation as shown in Equation 1: INa=ImaxpHonpHon+EC50n (Eq. 1) where INa is the proton-activated current, Imax is the maximal acid-activated current, pHo stands for the extraoocyte pH, EC50 represents the value of pHo that results in half the maximal current of the ASIC channel, and n is the Hill coefficient. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance computation combined with the Bonferroni test was used to analyze data with unequal variance between each group. A significance level of 0.05 was employed. Activation of δβγ-hENaC by Protons—To address the question of whether or not δ-hENaC is activated by external protons, human δ-ENaC was expressed in Xenopus oocytes with various compositions and acidic pH 4 was applied by a rapid perfusion system that has been successfully used to study ASIC currents (24Ji H.L. Jovov B. Fu J. Bishop L.R. Mebane H.C. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8395-8405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a current trace elicited in an oocyte expressing δ-subunit alone. Acidic external pH 4.0 activated δ-ENaC-associated Na+ current at –60 mV. The proton-activated Na+ current was not observed in uninjected oocytes; instead, protons decreased the background current of oocytes contributed by endogenous anion and cation channels (Fig. 1B). Proton-activated current levels of δβ-(–42.0 ± 12 nA, n = 8) and δγ-hENaC channels (–55 ± 11 nA, n = 8) were not markedly different from that of δ-subunit alone (–50 ± 16 nA, n = 9). In contrast, the proton-activated Na+ current of δβγ-hENaC was 44-fold greater (–1886.5 ± 269 nA, n = 35) than that of δ-ENaC itself (Fig. 1B). An EC50 of 6.0 ± 0.03 for proton activation on δ-hENaC alone was retrieved by fitting the dose-response curve (Fig. 1C, n = 11). A similar observation expressed in oocytes has just been reported (25Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the proton-activated current can be elicited in oocytes expressing δ-ENaC, it is too small for systematic study of its properties. Therefore, we amplified the δ-ENaC current magnitude by co-expressing βγ-hENaC subunits based on the fact that there is no difference between the basic features of δ- and δβγ-hENaC channels (2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, inward current of δβγ-hENaC was reversibly inhibited by amiloride. Exposure to solution with pH 4.0 resulted in an ∼50% increase in basal current. Proton-activated current returned to basal levels immediately upon restoration of the pH of the bathing solution to 7.5. Replacement of external Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine abolished Na+ conductance associated with δβγ-hENaC (Fig. 2B). If the basal current associated with δβγ-ENaC was inhibited by amiloride, external protons could not elicit an increase in inward current (Fig. 2B). To characterize the proton dependence of δβγ-hENaC, solutions of different pH were superfused over δβγ-expressing oocytes. Fig. 2C shows representative current traces elicited by external pH ranging from 8.3 to 4. Alkali pH 8.3 slightly depressed basal current, but acidic pH activated basal current in a concentration-dependent manner. An EC50 of pH 6.0 ± 0.5 (n = 8) was determined by computer fitting the proton-activated current versus pH data (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with our previous observations and identical to that of δ-ENaC alone (19Ji H.L. Copeland S.J. Bishop L.R. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 529aGoogle Scholar, 20Ji H.L. Copeland S.J. Waldmann R. Fuller C.M. Lazdunski M.L. Benos D.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 913aGoogle Scholar). The response of rat and human αβγ-ENaC expressed in oocytes to external protons was also determined with the same protocol. Superfusion of oocytes with a solution at pH 4.0 decreased human αβγ-ENaC current (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in oocytes expressing the rat αβγ-ENaC channel (not shown). Interestingly, in the absence of an external Na+ ion, an inward current was activated at pH 4.0 as observed in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC (Fig. 2A). In contrast to δβγ-hENaC, the basal current of αβγ-hENaC was significantly down-regulated by external protons (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the responses to protons between αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC are different (19Ji H.L. Copeland S.J. Bishop L.R. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 529aGoogle Scholar). Regulation of δβγ-hENaC by Intracellular pH—Intracellular acidosis down-regulated apical Na+ conductance of epithelial cells and cloned ENaC expressed in oocytes within hours (26Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Proton-activated current associated with δβγ-hENaC showed a slower activation (along the lines of several seconds) compared with those of the ASIC channels (27Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, the question arises as to whether the effect of external protons on δβγ-hENaC is mediated by cytosolic acidification. To test this hypothesis, membrane-permeable acetate was used to lower intracellular pH (16Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C477-C486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the effect of intracellular acidification on αβγ-rENaC (18Awayda M.S. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1896-C1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acetate down-regulated basal current of δβγ-hENaC progressively over 20 min (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the stimulatory effect of external protons on δβγ-hENaC, internal protons significantly decreased both basal and proton-activated currents (Fig. 4B). Gating Properties of Proton-activated Current—To characterize gating kinetics of the proton-activated current associated with δβγ-hENaC, we examined activation, desensitization, and recovery times. The activation time of δβγ-hENaC by external protons was longer (3.8 ± 0.5 s, n = 12) than that of the ASIC channel (<1 s). To estimate the desensitization time constant, oocytes were exposed to protons for a time sufficient to permit the current to return to basal levels (Fig. 5A). The average desensitization time was 253 ± 9.5s(n = 4). Recovery time was determined by application of acidic pH at various time intervals. Proton-activated currents were normalized to the proton-activated current recorded post the maximal interval (25 s). Fig. 5B shows that the recovery time for proton-activated current of δβγ-hENaC was 10.4 ± 3.6 s (n = 8). Ionic Selectivity of Proton-activated Current—To answer the question of whether the proton-activated current of δβγ-hENaC has the same selectivity as the basal current, cation selectivity for basal and proton-activated currents was determined simultaneously. Fig. 5C shows representative traces of basal and proton-activated Na+ currents at potentials stepped from –120 to +80 mV. Their current-voltage relationship revealed an identical reversal potential (+40 mV), indicating that basal and proton-activated currents are both predominately Na+-permeable (Fig. 5D). Whole-cell basal and proton-activated currents for δβγ-hENaC-expressing oocytes bathed in solutions having an alkali-metal cation different from Na+ were measured and summarized in Fig. 5E. These experiments revealed that proton-activated Li+ current is smaller than Na+ current, consistent with the findings for the basal current (1Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Estimated from the whole-cell current, the cation selectivity ratio in the order of Na+/Li+/K+/Cs+ for the basal current (1/0.7/0.04/0.07) was similar to that of the proton-activated current (1/0.5/0.04/0.1). Protons Modify the Closing Gate via Conformational Change— Two channel gates formed by separate pre-H1 and pre-H2 domains have been proposed in ENaC channels (28Grunder S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Grunder S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutating a degenerin site located in the pre-H2 domain (pore region) added a basal current to ASIC channels (31Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similar to ENaC, the basal current of degenerin-mutated ASIC channels was sensitive to amiloride and impermeable to K+. To explore the idea that protons may stimulate the basal current of δβγ-hENaC by modifying a closing gate, three degenerin mutants, δS526F, βS520F, and γS529F, were engineered and injected into oocytes with their conjugate wild type partners. Fig. 6A shows representative proton-activated Na+ current traces evoked with pH 4.0. Either δS526F or γS529F alone resulted in the loss of total proton-activated Na+ current; in some cases, the response was reversed (Fig. 6B). βS520F likewise diminished the proton-activated current to 34.6% of the wild type response (p <0.05). In the case of co-expressing three degenerin mutants together, there were no basal and proton-activated currents in oocytes 3 days postinjection of δS526F, βS520F, and γS529F (data not shown). These oocytes had resting membrane potential identical to those of uninjected oocytes (from –30 to –60 mV). To test the role of the cytoskeleton, we disrupted cytoskeletons of oocytes expressing δβγ-ENaC with cytochalasin D and/or nocodazole, 20 μg/ml (32Maroto R. Hamill O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23867-23872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both cytoskeletal disruptors affected neither the basal nor the proton-activated Na+ currents of δβγ-hENaC in voltage-clamped oocytes (data not shown). Metabolic Acids and Hypotonicity Facilitate Proton-activated Current—The postulated physiological relevance for ASIC channels includes transduction of acid-mediated pain, mechanical stretch, and temperature (27Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Even though metabolic acids generally take several minutes to produce a significant drop of external pH, it is reasonable to hypothesize ASIC as an integrator of all the aforementioned stimuli. To test the hypothesis that acidic metabolites facilitate proton-activated Na+ current associated with δβγ-hENaC, proton-activated current of δβγ-hENaC was evaluated in the presence and absence of lactate, pyruvate, and formate in an acidic superfusate. As shown in Fig. 7, 15 mm lactate nearly doubled proton-activated Na+ current. Pyruvate and formate facilitated activation of protons on δβγ-hENaC less, but their effects were statistically significant. As observed by Immke and McClesky (33Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), even 20-mm acidic metabolites still cannot reach the saturating level of stimulated current. Continuing to increase acidic metabolite concentration leads to marked changes in osmolarity and pH. This prohibited us from determining the EC50 of each acidic metabolite for the proton-activated δβγ current. Hypotonicity generally develops a few minutes following ischemia (34Hansen A.J. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 101-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 35Walz W. Klimaszewski A. Paterson I.A. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To examine the response of proton-activated δβγ-hENaC current to hypotonicity, oocytes were perfused with ND-40 solution, which has an osmolarity of 80 mosm. Hypotonic exposure of oocytes increased proton-activated current by 92% (Fig. 7E). A combination of hypotonicity and lactate stimulated proton-activated δβγ-hENaC synergistically (Fig. 7E). Several publications have reported that gating of ASIC channels by extracellular protons is regulated by intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ (33Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 36de Weille J. Bassilana F. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that extracellular divalent cations regulate the proton-activated current of δβγ-ENaC, we pretreated oocytes for 30 min with the membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA_AM (50 μm), in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The proton-activated peak current associated with δβγ-ENaC was not significantly affected either by pretreatment with BAPTA_AM (control: –2016 ± 125 nA versus BAPTA_AM: –1726.3 ± 335.4 nA, n = 8, p >0.05) or by removal of bath Ca2+ (1.8 mm: –1573.3 ± 154 nA versus 0 mm: –1696.7 ± 173 nA, n = 8, p >0.05). However, EDTA, but not EGTA, can augment the response to hypotonicity and lactate up to 2.5-fold (Fig. 7E). In the presence of both EDTA and lactate, the increased proton-activated current was stably elicited by repeated application of acidic solution, whereas the increment of proton-activated current with either hypotonicity or lactate ran down in a few minutes, These results indicate that the extracellular Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio rather than Ca2+ alone affects the proton-induced current of δβγ-hENaC. Our results indicate that δβγ-ENaC is activated by extracellular protons. Proton activation of δβγ-ENaC current is removed by degenerin mutations, leading to a conformational change as well as a decrease in closing time. Ion selectivity of the proton-activated δβγ-hENaC current was identical to that of the basal current, suggesting that an unaltered channel pore is used for both processes. Regulation of the proton-activated current of δβγ-ENaC by hypo-osmolarity and EDTA suggested that δ-ENaC may integrate ischemia-related signals. In epithelial tissue, δ-ENaC may combine with αβγ-ENaC subunits to regulate salt and water balance across the epithelium under hypoxic conditions. In non-epithelial tissues, δ-ENaC may share physiological function with proton-activated channels in the transduction of acidosis, stretch, and other ischemia-induced signals. Mechanisms for Proton-activated Conductance—Amiloride sensitivity and alkali metal salt permeabilities of proton-activated current in oocytes expressing δβγ-ENaC exclude the involvement of endogenous cation channels. MES and Hepes pH buffers are membrane-impermeable, and Na+ substitution eliminated proton-activated currents more than 80%, so it is unlikely that the acid-activated current is carried by protons. However, external proton-induced inward currents of δβγ- and αβγ-hENaC channels in the absence of bath sodium indicate that ENaC channels may be slightly permeable to H+ ion (38Palmer L.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 67: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A second line of evidence comes from examination of the effect of intracellular protons on basal and proton-activated currents (Fig. 2). Intracellular acidosis, instead of enhancing proton-activated current, abolished it gradually over minutes. A similar response to external protons was not observed in uninjected oocytes and in oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC, further confirming that activation of δβγ-ENaC by protons is specific. Fast activation kinetics suggested that protons may not activate δ-ENaC by recruiting new channel proteins from a subplasma membrane channel pool. Trafficking and internalizing measurements of ENaC in oocytes revealed that these processes generally occurred in minutes or even hours (39Rotin D. Kanelis V. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2001; 281: F391-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that unitary conductance is not altered when co-expressed with βγ-ENaC; an increased open probability, then, may mediate pH activation of δ-ENaC. As reported by Kellenberger et al. (40Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Rossier B.C. Schild L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), only ∼10% of ENaC channels located at the plasma membrane can be detected electrically at any given time. Thus, another mechanism of proton activation is that acidic pH values increase the percentage of active ENaC channels. It is not surprising to see that the pH sensitivity of δ-ENaC is identical to that of δβγ-ENaC. Several groups have found that α-like ENaC, including α-, δ-, and ϵ-ENaC, exhibits the same biophysical properties as those of channels co-expressed with βγ-subunits. Co-expression of βγ-ENaC did not influence ion selectivity, amiloride sensitivity, or conductance. However, mutagenesis revealed domains in γ-ENaC as well as in α-ENaC that affect self-inhibition and amiloride sensitivity (41Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our results confirmed that activation of protons is mainly mediated by the degenerin site of δ- and γ-subunits. Because δ-ENaC alone was activated by protons, and neither regulatory subunit β- nor γ-ENaC co-expression increased the proton-activated Na+ current (Fig. 1B), γ-ENaC may potentially regulate the response of δ-subunit to protons as revealed by degenerin site mutations (Fig. 6). Although proton activation on δβγ-ENaC requires the presence of a degenerin site, protons may not interact with this residue directly. Serine is not a proton-sensitive amino acid, and an identical site in αβγ-rENaC showed a different response to protons. On the other hand, the gating kinetics of proton-activated current associated with δβγ-ENaC is reminiscent of the acid-activated current produced by a degenerin mutant, namely, G430F-ASIC1a (24Ji H.L. Jovov B. Fu J. Bishop L.R. Mebane H.C. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8395-8405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The response of G430F-ASIC1a to protons excluded the interaction of protons with the degenerin site. Instead, the pKa of the His residue (6.0) is identical to the EC50 of protons activating δ- and δβγ-ENaC currents (Figs. 1C and 2D). Glu and Asp amino acid residues showing a pKa close to 4.0 may also contribute to the stimulatory effect of protons on δβγ-ENaC. Our results support the view that protons titrate pH-sensitive residues in the extracellular loop, leading to a conformational change of channel protein and then causing an action on the closing gate mimicking that of ASIC. Yamamura et al. (25Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) very recently reported an EC50 of 5.0 for δ-hENaC expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which differs from our observation (6.0) in oocytes. Inconsistent expression systems and time required for recovery between every proton exposure may contribute to this diversity. As we mentioned before, there are 26 His, 11 Asp, and 22 Glu amino acid residues located in the extracellular loop of δ-ENaC that are potential proton regulatory sites. Amiloride at micromolar concentration may not be able to shield all of these 59 acid-sensitive residues in total. Instead, protons may bind to these regulatory sites and lead to a conformational change of ENaC proteins and finally stimulate channel activity. Based on our observations as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, protons may not competitively bind to the out mouth of the channel with amiloride and Na+. Two amiloride binding sites in the extracellular domain of ENaC have been identified (1Ji H.L. Bishop L.R. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8428-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 44Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R.

Amiloride binding most likely prevents the conformational change resulting from acidic external pH and/or blocks Na+ entry through the channel pore. Protons may not influence the coordination and interactions of ENaC subunits. A body of evidence demonstrated that both β- and γ-ENaC subunits amplify the current amplitude of δ- and α-ENaC (2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current density of αβ and αγ channels is approximately as low as that formed by α-subunit alone (22McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of subunit composition, no studies showed that changes in subunit ratio, normally 2α:1β:1γ or 3α:3β:3γ, regulate ENaC channel activity. Proton-activated ENaC as an Integrator of Ischemia-related Signals—Predominate expression of δ-ENaC in heart and brain implies that the functions of this isoform may differ from those distributing at epithelial tissues (2Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). pH sensitivity of δ-ENaC led us to hypothesize that δ-ENaC may serve as a pH sensor by itself or as an element of a proton receptor complex in excitable cells. Lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and formatic acid are generally produced during cardiac and brain ischemia and result in acidosis within minutes (45Kraig R.P. Ferreira-Filho C.R. Nicholson C. J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 49: 831-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 46Silver I.A. Erecinska M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 47Cobbe S.M. Poole-Wilson P.A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1980; 12: 745-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Lactate, pyruvate, and formate may accumulate in cytosol via their transporters, which results in intracellular acidification and elevation of Ca2+ (48Zima A.V. Kockskamper J. Mejia-Alvarez R. Blatter L.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 765-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 49Ladilov Y. Schafer C. Held A. Schafer M. Noll T. Piper H.M. Cardiovasc.

However, intracellular acidification and BAPTA treatment do not support the idea that these metabolic acids cytosolically enhance proton activation on δ-ENaC; instead, they potentiate δ-ENaC, possibly by chelating extracellular divalent cations. A similar mechanism has been proposed to explain potentiation of proton-gated Na+ channels by lactate in ischemia-sensing neurons (33Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 43Allen N.J. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 51Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Facilitation of proton-activated current by these acidic metabolites strongly indicates that δβγ-ENaC is most likely involved in ischemic signal transduction. Not unique, this phenomenon has also been reported in ischemia-sensing neurons (33Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Membrane stretch occurs after a decrease in osmolarity of extracellular fluid during brain and heart stroke (34Hansen A.J. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 101-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 35Walz W. Klimaszewski A. Paterson I.A. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A potentiation of the proton-activated δ-ENaC current was observed following a hypotonic challenge (Fig. 7E). Generally, both hypotonic stress and removal of extracellular Ca2+ have been proved to cause an increment in cytosolic Ca2+. However, BAPTA pretreatment cannot affect the proton-induced current, indicating that cytosolic Ca2+ may not play a role in hypotonicity-facilitated current. A significant rise in the proton-induced current by hypotonic medium with 1.8 mm, but not in the absence of external Ca2+, suggests that external Ca2+ regulates δ-ENaC in a dose-dependent pattern or Ca2+ exerts two separate effects. A dual effect of external Ca2+ on ASIC channel has also been observed (36de Weille J. Bassilana F. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The diverse action of hypotonicity in the presence and absence of extraoocyte Ca2+ implies that external Mg2+ may also be involved in modification of proton activation. Additional supportive evidence comes from EDTA and EGTA application in the presence of external Ca2+ and Mg2+. EGTA is a specific chelator of Ca2+, whereas EDTA is a chelator for both Ca2+ and Mg2+. The facilitating effects of EDTA and EGTA on proton-induced current are inconsistent, indicating that not only Ca2+ itself but also the Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio regulate proton activation on δ-ENaC. Taken together, enhancement of proton-activated current by hypo-osmolarity, decreased extracellular divalent cation, or a combination of acidic metabolites further suggest that δβγ-ENaC may integrate ischemia-related signals as well as ASIC channels (43Allen N.J. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Potential Impact—In brain and heart, acidic metabolites can produce a fall of more than one pH unit in few minutes poststroke (45Kraig R.P. Ferreira-Filho C.R. Nicholson C. J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 49: 831-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 46Silver I.A. Erecinska M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). ASIC channels are thought to be activated to transduct ischemia-related signals. However, the process of pH fall generally requires minutes to develop. The millisecond activation of ASIC may be an additional limitation for them as effective pH sensors. Compared with ASIC channels, δ-ENaC is distinguished by a very slow activation and desensitization process, allowing ischemic cells to have enough time to detect changes in proton concentration and osmolarity. Another striking feature of δ-ENaC is its slow desensitization. The ASIC channel generally desensitized in less than a second (31Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas δ-ENaC took minutes. Thus, the gating properties of δ-ENaC indicated that it is an ischemic sensor different from ASIC channels.

Welsh (University of Iowa) for βγ-ENaC clones."

FA cells exhibit a characteristic hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as mitomycin C.

By using conventional chromatographic fractionation of subcellular preparations, we report: (i) the FA core complex exists in a cytoplasmic form at 500–600 kDa; (ii) a larger, 750-kDa cytoplasmic form is seen only at mitosis; (iii) a nuclear form achieves a size of 2 megaDaltons; and (iv) a distinct 1-megaDalton FA core complex exists bound to chromatin that contains phosphorylated FANCA after undergoing DNA damage. We are continuing our analysis using mass spectroscopy in an effort to characterize novel binding proteins.

Although reports describing binding partners to the FA core complex, including GRP94, cdc2, STAT1, and FAZF, have been published, little progress has been made in providing a unifying theory of FA protein function (27Pang Q.

Liu J.M. Youssoufian H. Blood. 1998; 91: 4379-4386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The core complex of FA described above fails to form in all of the complementation groups except FA-D2. The FANCD2 protein is ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and in S-phase, which is dependent upon the existence of the FA core complex. In addition, FANCD2 binds to BRCA1, and FANCD1 is BRCA2, providing links to better described pathways of DNA repair and genome surveillance, including homologous recombination (17Timmers C. Taniguchi T. Hejna J. Reifsteck C. Lucas L. Bruun D. Thayer M. Cox B. Olson S. D'Andrea A.D. Moses R. Grompe M. Mol.

Several reports have shown that FANCA phosphorylation is vital to FA pathway function and is missing in all but FA-D1 and FA-D2 cells (32Yamashita T. Kupfer G. Naf D. Suliman A. Joenje H. Asano S.

Sechi S. Wallisch M. Yang D. Young M.K. Joenje H. Hoatlin M.E. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Helicase activity was also coprecipitated. This approach yielded the latest cloned FA gene, FANCL (18Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The coprecipitation of FA proteins with another genomic instability syndrome protein, BLM, puts FA at the nexus of DNA repair syndromes.In this study, we attempt to validate a more conventional approach in concert with modern methods to purify the FA core complex. We use a series of chromatographic methods coupled with an immunoaffinity step to characterize the FA core complex with respect to size and composition. In doing so, we show a means to identify complex components that not only can shed light upon normal FA function but also has the potential to demonstrate biochemical activity. We also demonstrate that the FA core complex is not simply one complex; it is actually composed of at least four distinct complexes, depending upon its subcellular localization. Purification also allows us to isolate a phosphorylated form of FANCA, which is DNA-damage inducible.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas FA-A mutant GM6914 cells were grown in 15% fetal bovine serum. Each cell line was transduced with pMMP-FLAG-FANCA or pMMP vector alone, and the resulting cells were selected with puromycin. Cells were treated for 24 h in 0.1 μm mitomycin C (MMC), a dose producing a 90% kill in mutant cells and a 10% kill in wild-type cells.Synchronization—HeLa cells were treated overnight in the presence of 1 μm nocodazole (Sigma). Mitotic cells were collected the next morning by shaking the plate and collecting the cells in suspension. Verification of the cell-cycle state was achieved by using FACScan analysis (BD Biosciences) (1Stonesifer K. Xiang J. Wilkinson E. Benson N. Braylan R. Acta Cytol. 1987; 31: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Lysis—5–10 large plates of cells were collected by cell scraping and were washed in PBS. The resulting cell pellet was lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 or 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate).Cell Fractionation—Cells were collected similarly and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. After 20–30 strokes on ice with a Dounce homogenizer, the cytoplasmic extract was separated from the nuclei by spinning at 1500 rpm. The cytoplasmic extract was clarified by spinning at high speed. The nuclear pellet was further extracted in the lysis buffer using 500 mm NaCl as above.Chromatin Preparation—Procedures for permeabilization and sequential subnuclear extraction were adapted from the methods of Burtelow et al. (45Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Reyes et al. (46Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and are detailed in our previous work (48Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, cells pelleted (100 μl) from one large plate were resuspended and permeabilized in 5 ml of low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml digitonin) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4) for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing, the nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of permeabilization buffer containing 30 units of DNase I (RNase Free, Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at room temperature and an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Chromatin proteins were extracted by adding extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant collected at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge for 10 min was termed the chromatin fraction.SDS-Page and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE analysis was followed by gel transfer in 25 mm Tris and 200 mm glycine onto nylon-supported nitrocellulose. Filters were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and were incubated in TBS plus Tween 20 containing primary antibody for at least 1 h at room temperature. Filters were then washed in TBS plus Tween 20, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), washed again, and visualized by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (30Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Lysates from FA-A mutant either infected with vector only or with FLAG-FANCA were immunoprecipitated with FLAG-affinity gel. After extensive washing, the beads were incubated with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in Tris-buffered saline. The resulting eluates were either concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 100 mm NaHCO3 (for mass spectroscopy) or simply concentrated and kept in TBS for SDS-PAGE (using Centricon 100-kDa cutoff filters).Mass Spectroscopic Peptide Analysis—Mass spectroscopy was performed as described previously. Briefly, the eluates from the FLAG immunoprecipitations were dialyzed, reduced, and subjected to proteolysis with trypsin. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of glacial acetic acid, and the samples were stored at -35 C. Experiments utilized an HPLC (Applied Biosystems or Agilent HPLC) gradient composed of 0.1 m acetic acid and 70% acetonitrile with 0.1 m acetic acid. Tryptic peptides from solution digestion were analyzed by a method described previously, using nanoflow-HPLC/microelectrospray ionization interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer. Data-dependant analysis was performed in which one full MS scan from m/z of 300–2000 was performed, followed by five tandem MS scans of the most abundant ions present in the full mass scan. All tandem MS scans were performed with an isolation window of 3 Da (precursor m/z ± 1.5 Da) and with 35% collision energy.Protein Farm software was used as an interface between the raw mass spectrometric information and a database searching program, SEQUEST (35Garcia-Higuera I. Kuang Y. Naf D. Wasik J. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4866-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). After deletion of poor quality spectra and conversion to file format, SEQUEST was used to search against a protein data base. An eluant was only identified as containing a protein if it contained three or more peptides, with a cross correlation score above 2; each of those spectra were manually confirmed.Chromatography—Cytoplasmic extract was filtered and poured over a gravity anion-exchange resin column (Q-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences) and then eluted with 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m NaCl. 50 μl was then run on SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. The FANCA-containing fractions were then placed over a MonoQ anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a 100–500 mm salt gradient. After analysis by immunoblotting, the FANCA peak fractions were pooled and concentrated down to 600 μl, filtered, and subjected to gel filtration (Superose 6, Amersham Biosciences). Molecular mass markers (Sigma) were run as standards to determine the molecular masses of complexes within each fraction. FANCA fractions were then immunoprecipitated with FLAG-affinity resin (Sigma). 10% of the beads were probed by immunoblotting with FANCC, FANCG, FANCF (gift of M. Hoatlin, Portland, OR), and FANCE (gift of K. J. Patel, Cambridge, UK) antibodies. The remaining beads were run on gel and silver-stained (Bio-Rad).Nuclear extract was first extracted in 500 mm NaCl, filtered, and passed over a P11 cation-exchange column (Whatman). The FANCA fraction was then run directly on gel filtration. FANCA fractions were then chromatographed using a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, the FANCA fractions were immunoprecipitated by FLAG-affinity gel. The beads were analyzed as above.Chromatin extract was chromatographed as follows: (i) passage by gravity over Q-Sepharose anion-exchange resin; (ii) placement on a MonoQ anion-exchange column followed by elution with a 100–500 mm gradient; (iii) Superose 6 gel filtration; or (iv) FLAG-affinity immunoprecipitation. All fractionation and chromatographic steps were followed by immunoblotting detection of FANCA.Phosphatase Reaction—Phosphatase reactions were taken from previous protocols (45Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, the resulting washed beads were incubated with λ phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) or PP2A (gift of David Brautigan, University of Virginia) for 30 min at 30 °C in the supplied reaction buffer (λ phosphatase, in a 100-μl mix containing 100 units of enzyme in the presence or absence of the phosphatase inhibitors, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). All reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μl of 5× sample buffer (62 mm 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptomethanol).RESULTSAffinity Purification of the FA Complex—To demonstrate the validity of purification of epitope-tagged FA complex, we performed batch FLAG-affinity precipitation of FLAG-FANCA from GM6914 + FLAG-FANCA and GM6914 + vector control cells in whole-cell extract (500 mm NaCl). Immunoprecipitation was performed with covalently bound anti-FLAG-affinity resin. After extensive washing, the precipitates were eluted with FLAG peptide, and the resulting eluates were concentrated and buffer-replaced with 100 mm NH4HCO3. Thereafter, these eluates were analyzed by tandem mass time-of-flight ion-spray MS. Peptide sequence was detected by correlating to the FA proteins FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG (Fig. 1A). Additionally, cdc2 and GRP94, which are both known and previously reported binding proteins of FANCA (Fig. 1B; Refs. 40Hoshino T. Wang J. Devetten M.P. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Wise R.J. Liu J.M.

Blood. 1997; 90: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were detected.Whole-cell Extract Contains Two Different FA Complexes—We and others have demonstrated that the FA complexes exist in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, it is unclear what function the FA complexes play and what the complex composition is in each compartment. Thus, isolation and purification of the FA complexes would serve to define them to determine potential functions. To ascertain characteristics of FA protein purification, we prepared whole-cell lysate in 150 mm NaCl from GM6914 + FANCA cells and applied it to a gravity anion-exchange column. Immunoblotting for FANCA revealed that most protein was bound and eluted in the 0.3 and 0.6 m fractions (data not shown). These fractions were pooled, rediluted to 150 mm NaCl, and run over an anion-exchange (MonoQ, Amersham Biosciences) column by HPLC. Proteins were eluted from the column using a salt gradient. Subsequent immunoblotting of fractions revealed two distinct peaks containing FANCA: one eluted with low salt and the other eluted with high salt (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Whole-cell extract contains two different FA complexes.A, whole-cell extract was prepared from HeLa cells in 500 mm NaCl and successively passed over gravity anion-exchange and gradient-anion exchange columns. B, two complexes were noted; each was then subjected to gel filtration. Each step was followed by FANCA immunoblotting.

Immunoblotting for FANCA revealed that the low salt fractions corresponded to a FANCA-containing complex of 600 kDa, whereas the high salt fractions corresponded to a FANCA-containing complex of 2 MDa (Fig. 2B), as compared with a set of molecular mass standards.Stepwise Purification of FANCA-containing Complexes—Published data from this lab and others (30Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 48Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 97: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have revealed that FA proteins are contained in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Reasoning that these cellular compartments might contain differently sized and differently composed FA complexes, we performed a stepwise scheme of purification, as detailed in the scheme in Fig. 3. First, we fractionated FA-A mutant GM6914 + FLAG-FANCA or GM6914 + vector cells (negative control), either untreated or treated with 0.1 μm MMC into cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. In all subsequent figures, the vector control was conducted in parallel but is not shown except for the final affinity step. Because of the significant precipitation of proteins in nuclear extracts made with high salt and subsequently lowered to low salt (data not shown), we decided to make nuclear extracts at 500 mm NaCl while maintaining the cytoplasmic extract at 50 mm salt, as called for during the simple fractionation procedure. Second, we passed the extract (20 mg) from the cytoplasmic fraction over a gravity anion-exchange column and eluted with a step gradient of NaCl. FANCA was detected predominantly in the 0.3 and 0.6 m NaCl step elutions (Fig. 4A). These fractions were diluted back to 100 mm, passed over an anion-exchange column, and eluted using a 100–500 mm NaCl gradient. Immunoblotting showed FANCA in lower salt fractions, which is consistent with the data in Fig. 2 (data not shown). These FANCA fractions were then concentrated and loaded on a gel filtration column. Immunoblotting revealed FANCA in fractions corresponding to a predicted size of ∼600 kDa (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the finding of a complex at that size in the whole-cell extract in Fig. 2. Overall, we noted that less FANCA was present in the cytoplasmic extract of MMC-treated cells. Total protein was 200 μg, a 100-fold decrease of the starting material.Fig. 3A scheme of FA core complex purification.

We report structural and functional properties of two domains from a β-1,3-glucan recognition protein present in the hemolymph of a pyralid moth, Plodia interpunctella. A recombinant protein corresponding to the first 181 amino-terminal residues bound to β-1,3-glucan, lipopolysaccharide, and lipoteichoic acid, polysaccharides found on cell surfaces of microorganisms, and also activated the prophenoloxidase-activating system, an immune response pathway in insects. The amino-terminal domain consists primarily of an α-helical secondary structure with a minor β-structure. This domain was thermally stable and resisted proteolytic degradation. The 290 residue carboxyl-terminal domain, which is similar in sequence to glucanases, had less affinity for the polysaccharides, did not activate the prophenoloxidase cascade, had a more complicated CD spectrum, and was heat-labile and susceptible to proteinase digestion. The carboxyl-terminal domain bound to laminarin, a β-1,3-glucan with β-1,6 branches, but not to curdlan, a β-1,3-glucan that lacks branching. These results indicate that the two domains of Plodia β-1,3-glucan recognition protein, separated by a putative linker region, bind microbial polysaccharides with differing specificities and that the amino-terminal domain, which is unique to this class of pattern recognition receptors from invertebrates, is responsible for stimulating prophenoloxidase activation.

Within these protein families, PRR interactions with microbes activate both cellular and humoral aspects of innate immunity. Cellular responses include hemocyte participation in phagocytosis, nodule formation, or encapsulation (30Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Humoral immune responses may involve the activation of distinct proteinase-regulated pathways that result in the production of antimicrobial peptides, activation of the prophenoloxidase (PPO), and formation of clots via a coagulation pathway. The PPO-activating system is involved in the production of melanin that forms at the site of wounds and on the surface of pathogens and parasites (31Marmaras V.J. Charalambidis N.D. Zervas C.G. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Gillespie J.P. Kanost M.R. Trenczek T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1997; 42: 611-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). PPO is present in the hemolymph as a zymogen that is activated by a prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase. Prophenoloxidase-activating proteinases themselves appear to be activated via proteolytic cleavage (32Dohke K. Arch. Biochem.

Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Plodia interpunctella βGRP (PiβGRP) was originally identified as a soluble 53-kDa plasma protein that binds β-1,3-glucan, lipopolysaccharide, and lipoteichoic acid and subsequently activates the PPO cascade (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone encoding PiβGRP was isolated and found to belong to a family of PRRs identified from Manduca sexta (βGRPs 1 and 2), Bombyx mori (βGRP and GNBP), Drosophila melanogaster (GNBPs 1-3), Hyphantria cunea (GNBP), and Eisenia foetida (coelomic cytolytic factor). PiβGRP is expressed in fat body and is constitutively present in the hemolymph. In this study, we describe structural and functional properties of recombinant proteins corresponding to putative amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains from PiβGRP. Expression of Recombinant βGRP and Deletion Constructs—The full-length 471-residue βGRP (without secretion signal peptide) was expressed using an Invitrogen pTrcHis2-TOPO® expression vector in Escherichia coli and purified as outlined previously (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Two amino-terminal deletions mutants composed of 118 and 181 residues that corresponded to amino-terminal domains reported in B. mori and M. sexta, respectively (8Ma C. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7505-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4995-5002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), were constructed (Fig. 1A). The 118 and 181 residue recombinant proteins are referred to as 118N and 181N, respectively. A carboxyl-terminal domain (290C) consisting of 290 residues was produced similarly. All of the recombinant proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with a c-myc and a six-histidine tag at their carboxyl terminus comprising 32 additional residues. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was conducted by using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. All of the proteins were diluted to 3-4 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and scanned from 260 to 180 nm at 20-nm min-1. The mean molar residue ellipticity (θ) values were calculated by inputting the raw CD data θ into the equation (θ) = θ/(10 × l × Cr), where l is the path length in centimeters and Cr is the molar concentration of the protein multiplied by number of residues. Proteolysis and Thermal Stability of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant P. interpunctella βGRP (rβGRP), 118N, 181N, and 290C were digested with equal amounts (2 μg) of bovine trypsin or chymotrypsin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for 1 h at 25 °C. Following incubation, samples were heat-treated in SDS sample buffer to inactivate the proteinase and separated by SDS-PAGE. In a second test, the proteolysis of rβGRP through time was observed by incubating 7.2 μg of rβGRP with 2.9 μg of trypsin or chymotrypsin at 25 °Cin20mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, in a total volume of 120 μl. At appropriate time intervals (0, 0.01, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h), a 20-μl aliquot was removed, added to SDS sample buffer, and heated in a 70 °C water bath for 10 min to inactivate the proteinases. In both experiments, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes after SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis was conducted using rabbit antiserum against M. sexta βGRP2. Heat stability was determined by incubating an aliquot of each recombinant protein diluted to 0.12 mg ml-1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in a boiling water bath for 10 min. Heat-treated samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants containing heat-stable protein were collected. Precipitates were resuspended and centrifuged. After an additional wash, pellets containing heat-labile proteins were resuspended in 125 μl of the Tris buffer and analyzed as above. Curdlan binding activity of heat-treated recombinant PiβGRP and domains was determined as described below. Aggregation of Microorganisms—Recombinant proteins were tested for agglutination of fluorescein-labeled E. coli (K12 strain), Staphylococcus aureus (Wood strain without protein A), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Samples containing BSA or buffer alone were also analyzed. Multiple images obtained with a SPOT digital camera from Diagnostic Instruments (Sterling Heights, MI) were used to determine the degree of aggregation. Binding of Recombinant βGRP and Domains to Curdlan—Curdlan (an insoluble β-1,3-glucan, Sigma) was used as an affinity matrix to assess β-1,3-glucan binding of recombinant proteins. Proteins (10 μg of rβGRP, 15 μg of 118N, 12 μg of 181N, and 20 μg of 290C) were incubated with 10 mg of curdlan equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 0.5 h on ice with occasional mixing. The curdlan-protein mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed. Bound proteins were eluted from the curdlan precipitate by the addition of 50 μl of 1 × SDS-NuPAGE sample buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol followed by heating for 10 min at 95 °C. The slurry was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and equal volumes of supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue protein staining and by immunoblotting. Competition for binding curdlan by rβGRP in the presence of laminarin was tested by incubating 30 μg of recombinant protein with or without laminarin (0.5 mg) prior to the addition to curdlan (10 mg in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline). Following incubation for 30 min on ice with occasional mixing, curdlan was precipitated by centrifugation and the precipitates were washed. Protein was eluted from curdlan by heat treatment in SDS sample buffer, and equivalent amounts of supernatants were analyzed. Binding of Recombinant βGRP and Domains to Laminarin—Laminarin (a soluble β-1,3-glucan, Sigma) was biotinylated by following the protocols modified from Takaki et al. (39Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Shinohara et al. (40Shinohara Y. Sota H. Kim F. Shimizu M. Gotoh M. Tosu M. Hasegawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1076-1082PubMed Google Scholar). 10 tubes, each containing 26 nmol of laminarin and 52 nmol of biotin-biotinamidocaproyl hydrazide-hydrazide in 30% CH3CN in a total of 10 μl, were incubated at 90 °C for 2 h. Samples were pooled and incubated with 0.5 ml of UltraLink immobilized streptavidin in binding buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7) at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 1 min, washed, and then suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer. Each recombinant protein sample (40 μg) was added to the laminarin-affinity resin (50 μl) and incubated at 4 °C for 0.5 h. The resin was washed three times, resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and placed into a boiling water bath for 10 min. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue protein staining and immunoblot analysis. The specificity of the binding to laminarin (and not the affinity resin itself) was tested by preparing immobilized-streptavidin resin with biotin-biotinamidocaproyl hydrazide-hydrazide but without laminarin as the ligand and assaying as above. Affinity Constant Determination via Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—A BIAcore® 3000 SPR biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure kinetic interactions between laminarin and the recombinant proteins. Laminarin (195 nmol) was biotinylated and injected directly onto a streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA (BIAcore AB). As a control, biotin-biotinamidocaproyl hydrazide-hydrazide was similarly injected onto a different flow cell of the SA sensor chip to account for nonspecific interactions. A series of concentrations of rβGRP, 118N, 181N, and 290C ranging from 0.5 nm to 2 μm prepared in 10 mm HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% Tween 20) was injected over the surface of the sensor chip at a flow rate of 15 μl min-1. Proteins were injected at the same rate onto both the control (immobilized biotin) and test (immobilized laminarin) flow cells at 25 °C over 6 min, and the interaction was monitored as the change in SPR response. After sample injections, flow cells were washed with HBS-P buffer and dissociation of analyte (protein) from the immobilized ligand was monitored continuously over 15 min at a flow rate of 15 μl min-1. At the end of each cycle, the regeneration of the chip was accomplished with two successive 30-s washes of 50 mm H3PO4 at a flow rate of 30 μl min-1. The chip was equilibrated with HBS-P prior to the next analysis. Both association rate constants (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd) for the laminarin:protein interactions were obtained by fitting background-corrected SPR binding data to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model within the BIAevaluation software version 3.1. The association constant (KA) was subsequently determined as ka/kd. The statistical analysis of association constants for each protein was performed by using the SAS PROC ANOVA at α = 0.05 (41SAS InstituteThe SAS System for Windows. SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC1998Google Scholar). Binding of Recombinant βGRP and Domains to Lipopolysaccharide and Lipoteichoic Acid—Binding to LPS and LTA was determined by using microplate binding assays modified from Tobias et al. (42Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Yu and Kanost (22Yu X.-Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37373-37381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Yu X.-Q. Kanost M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). LPS (from E. coli 0111:B4, smooth strain LPS, Sigma) or LTA (from S. aureus) suspensions (40 μg ml-1) were used to coat wells of a microplate (Continental Lab Products, San Diego, CA). After blocking, rβBRP, 118N, 181N, and 290C at concentrations of 0, 0.024, 0.047, 0.094, 0.19, 0.28, 0.47, and 0.94 μm in TB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with 50 mm NaCl) containing 0.1 mg ml-1 BSA were added to LPS- or LTA-coated wells and incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. After washing and incubation with rabbit antiserum made against M. sexta βGRP2, wells were treated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, Bio-Rad). Alkaline phosphatase activity against p-nitrophenyl phosphate, which is proportional to LPS or LTA binding activity, was detected at 405 nm. To validate the specificity of binding to LPS or LTA, 5 μg ml-1 rβGRP or 181N was preincubated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 250, or 500 μg ml-1 free competitor (LPS or LTA). 50 μl of the solution was added to wells precoated with LPS or LTA and assayed. Activation of the PPO Pathway in the Presence of Laminarin—A method described previously by Ma and Kanost (8Ma C. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7505-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and Fabrick et al. (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was used to test ability of the recombinant proteins to activate M. sexta PPO in the presence of soluble β-1,3-glucan (laminarin). Protein samples (0.5 μm) were incubated with 150 μg of laminarin and mixed with 10 μl of M. sexta plasma. Phenoloxidase activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. Values represent the means ± S.E. of data from three sets of triplicate measurements on a single pooled plasma sample collected from five M. sexta 5th Instar (day 3) larvae. PPO activation was analyzed for significance by using the SAS PROC Student's t test at α = 0.05 (41SAS InstituteThe SAS System for Windows. SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC1998Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Full-length and Truncated βGRP—PiβGRP is 471 amino acids long with an amino-terminal region of ∼120 residues, a putative linker region, and a carboxyl-terminal region (∼220 residues) that is similar in sequence to β-1,3-glucanases (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal portion had no significant sequence similarity to any proteins other than the amino terminus of proteins that belong to the βGRP/GNBP family. The structural and functional properties of the P. interpunctella βGRP were analyzed by producing a full-length rβGRP, two amino-terminal truncation mutants (118N and 181N) that lack the glucanase-like domain, and a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant (290C) that includes only the glucanase-like domain (Fig. 1A). Purified recombinant proteins were obtained in milligram quantities from 0.5-1.0 liters of bacterial cultures. SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining indicated that each recombinant protein solution contained a single major protein band (Fig. 1B). The molecular masses of the recombinant proteins (as estimated by SDS-PAGE) were 54-, 20-, 24-, and 36-kDa for rβGRP, 118N, 181N, and 290C, respectively. Structural Properties—rβGRP and its domains appear to be folded as indicated by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2) and possess binding and biological activities. CD spectroscopy of 118N and 181N indicates that these proteins contain primarily an α-helical secondary structure with a minor β-structure. Both proteins exhibit CD spectra reminiscent of a protein containing primarily α-helix with a positive absorbance peak near 192 nm and a negative peak near 208 nm. Proteins containing only α-helix also possess a second negative absorption peak near 222 nm, which is not clearly evident in the spectra obtained from 118N and 181N, indicating that the recombinant proteins may possess other forms of secondary structure (i.e. β-sheet or turns). The CD spectra of rβGRP and 290C were complicated and could not be easily interpreted, indicating that these proteins contained a mixture of secondary structure. We believe that the proteins were folded correctly because we could detect various functional activities in both proteins. The amino-terminal domain of βGRP was resistant to both proteolysis and thermal denaturation. The treatment of rβGRP or 181N with trypsin or chymotrypsin for 1 h produced a 20-kDa protein fragment that cross-reacted with antisera made against M. sexta βGRP2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Amino acid sequencing of this fragment revealed a single polypeptide with sequence (AQQYVV) corresponding to very near the amino-terminal end (residues 4-9) of P. interpunctella βGRP (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 20-kDa fragment resisted degradation by trypsin for at least 24 h and by chymotrypsin for up to 6 h (Fig. 3, C and D). 118N did not resist degradation and was hydrolyzed to smaller peptides by both proteinases within 1 h. Both trypsin and chymotrypsin completely hydrolyzed 290C within 1 h of treatment. Heat treatment and recovery of recombinant proteins indicated that the amino-terminal domain of βGRP is highly resistant to thermal denaturation (Fig. 4, A and B). Recombinant proteins 118N and 181N both remained in solution after treatment at 100 °C for 10 min, suggesting a highly stable conformation. In addition, 118N and 181N retained their ability to bind to the β-1,3-glucan, curdlan, following heat-treatment (Fig. 4C). rβGRP and 290C were found primarily in the heat-denatured pellet, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal domain of βGRP is heat-labile. Aggregation of Microbes—Aggregation of S. cerevisiae, S. aureus, and E. coli was observed in the presence of physiological concentrations of rβGRP (Table I). Incubation with rβGRP resulted in large multicellular aggregates of each microorganism with very few individual cells visible. In contrast, only a few large aggregates of yeast or E. coli were observed in the presence of 118N and 181N. 290C did not cause significant aggregation of any of the microbes. We previously showed that the agglutination of yeast by rβGRP was concentration-dependent and reversible in the presence of soluble β-1,3-glucan (12Fabrick J.A. Baker J.E. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the full-length rβGRP is required for substantial microbial aggregation.Table IIn vitro agglutination of fluorescein-labeled microorganisms by recombinant P. interpunctella βGRP and the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domainsProteinDegree of aggregationS. cerevisiaeS. aureusE. coliBSA−−−rβGRP+++++++++118N+−+181N+−+290C−−− Open table in a new tab Binding to Microbial Polysaccharides—rβGRP, 118N, and 181N co-precipitated with curdlan (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the first ∼100 amino-terminal residues of PiβGRP comprise a β-1,3-glucan binding domain (or carbohydrate recognition domain). Neither 290C (Fig. 5A) nor BSA (data not shown) co-precipitated with the insoluble β-1,3-glucan. However, all of the recombinant 1,3-glucan recognition protein constructs (including 290C) bound to biotinylated laminarin immobilized on streptavidin-agarose (Fig. 5B). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal glucanase-like domain of PiβGRP has the capacity to bind to laminarin (a β-1,6-branched β-1,3-glucan) but not to the linear β-1,3-glucan, curdlan. Excess laminarin reduced the binding of rβGRP to curdlan, indicating that laminarin and curdlan bind to similar regions within the protein (Fig. 5C). We further characterized the binding of the 1,3-glucan recognition protein domains to laminarin by surface plasmon resonance analysis. A single flow cell on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA was coated with either biotin (control) or biotinylated-laminarin and subsequently utilized for all of the analyses. Immobilization of biotin onto the control flow cell resulted in a net change of ∼40 response units. Injection of biotinylated laminarin resulted in a net change of ∼600 response units that appeared stable, indicating the immobilization of a fixed amount of laminarin. A typical sensorgram for the injection of rβGRP over the control and bound-laminarin flow cell is shown in Fig. 5D. The binding constants of the recombinant proteins are summarized in Table II. All four recombinant proteins bound to the chip containing immobilized laminarin but did not interact with a CM5 dextran chip surface (data not shown), which consists of only the dextran linker. Corrections for non-specific binding were made by the subtraction of data obtained from the biotin-control flow cell for each protein. rβGRP had a higher affinity for laminarin (KA of 3.8 × 108 M-1) than the truncated mutants 118N, 181N, or 290C, although the differences were not statistically significant by ANOVA at α = 0.05.Table IIBIAcore surface plasmon resonance affinity determination for rβGRP and its domains to immobilized laminarinProteinkakdKAm−1 s−1s−1m−1rβGRP6.3 ± 4.0 × 1033.8 ± 3.1 × 10−53.8 ± 2.6 × 108118N2.5 ± 1.1 × 1033.1 ± 2.1 × 10−51.2 ± 0.6 × 108181N8.9 ± 8.1 × 1029.2 ± 1.0 × 10−71.1 ± 1.0 × 108290C1.1 ± 1.0 × 1032.1 ± 1.0 × 10−52.9 ± 2.2 × 107 Open table in a new tab The binding of rβGRP 2Data published in Ref. 12Fabrick J.A.

The binding of rβGRP and 181N to LPS and LTA was specific as free LPS and LTA effectively reduced the binding of the protein to the bound ligand. No significant binding was observed for 118N or 290C with LPS or LTA (data not shown). However, it is difficult to compare binding between the proteins because the antibody generated against full-length M. sexta βGRP2 does not recognize the proteins equally. Note that in Fig. 5A, unequal amounts of protein were loaded to achieve similar levels of detection on immunoblots. Activation of Prophenoloxidase—rβGRP, 118N, and 181N stimulated PPO activation when added to M. sexta plasma, but a significantly greater (∼2.5-fold) stimulation of PPO activation occurred when 1 mg ml-1 laminarin was included in the reaction mixture with these proteins (Fig. 7). 290C did not activate PPO with or without laminarin. Laminarin alone or with bovine serum albumin did not result in significant PPO activation (although a longer incubation time with laminarin alone did stimulate PPO activation). No additive or synergistic effects were observed in samples that contained both 181N and 290C. PRRs play an essential role in the activation of invertebrate innate immune pathways including those regulated by proteinase cascades such as the horseshoe crab-clotting reaction, the Toll pathway in Drosophila, the prophenoloxidase-activating system in insects and other arthropods, and the processing of a cytokine that causes the spreading of insect hemocytes (43Dimopoulos G. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 44Gorman M.J. Paskewitz S.M. Insect Biochem. Mol.

These signaling pathways are ancient in origin and conserved in many organisms. The horseshoe crab blood-clotting pathway is controlled by a proteinase cascade in which the PRRs possess both carbohydrate recognition domains, which bind to PAMPs, and proteinase domains that are activated autocatalytically (50Leonard C. Ratcliffe N.A. Rowley A.F. J. Insect Physiol. 1985; 31 (a): 789-799Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The PPO pathway involves the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase to phenoloxidase, which results in the production of melanin or other compounds that function in protective and/or signaling capacities. Various PAMPs, including β-1,3-glucan can trigger the activation of insect PPO (48Ashida M. Ishizaki Y. Iwahana H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PRRs including βGRPs, peptidoglycan recognition proteins, and C-type lectins have been shown to stimulate PPO activation (1Yu X.-Q. Zhu Y.F. Ma C. Fabrick J.A. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the antifungal peptide, drosomycin, is up-regulated by the action of the Toll pathway and requires the extracellular proteinase processing of spaetzle, a ligand for Toll. A peptidoglycan recognition proteins has been shown recently to activate this pathway in the presence of Gram-positive bacteria (but not fungi) (56Michel T. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A. Royet J. Nature. 2001; 414: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PRRs, bound to PAMPs, activate proteinases remains unknown. Ochiai and Ashida (9Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4995-5002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and Ma and Kanost (8Ma C. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7505-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) found that polypeptides corresponding to the amino-terminal domain of two lepidopteran βGRPs bound to curdlan (an insoluble β-1,3-glucan), whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain did not. Similarly, we demonstrated that a recombinant protein corresponding to the amino-terminal domain of P. interpunctella βGRP (the first 118 residues) could bind to curdlan, whereas no binding was detected with the carboxyl-terminal glucanase-like domain. However, the glucanase-like domain of P. interpunctella βGRP has an affinity to laminarin (a soluble β-1,3-glucan) as determined by affinity precipitation and SPR. Although laminarin and curdlan both contain β-(1→3)-linked D-glucopyranose backbones, the two polysaccharides differ. Laminarin contains β-(1→6) side chain branching (one branch approximately every 20 glucose units) and has an average molecular mass of 7.7×103 Da (57Young S.-H. Dong W.-J. Jacobs R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11874-11879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, curdlan is a linear polymer of β-1,3-glucan with no side chain substitutions and is generally a heterogeneous mixture of polymer sizes (average degree of polymerization of 450) (58Lee I.-Y. Biopolymers. 2002; 5: 135Google Scholar). It is likely that these structural differences allow for binding by the carboxyl-terminal domain of βGRP to laminarin but not curdlan. Laminarin and curdlan apparently compete for a common binding site or sites on rβGRP, because excess laminarin decreased the amount of protein co-precipitated with curdlan. Some insect PRRs function to opsonize microorganisms within the hemocoel, thereby activating or amplifying cellular immune responses (1Yu X.-Q. Zhu Y.F. Ma C. Fabrick J.A. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 59Rowley A.F. Ratcliffe N.A. Leonard C.M. Richards E.H. Renwrantz L. Gupta A.P. Hemocytic and Humoral Immunity in Arthropods. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 381-406Google Scholar). Aggregation of microorganisms in vivo may enhance immune signaling pathways or provide superior targets for cellular immunity. In this study, we showed that a full-length rβGRP was necessary for agglutination of microbes, whereas deletion mutants of the protein were not effective. Aggregation of cells requires that agglutinins have at least two binding sites or can form self-oligomers. Because the truncated protein domains did not agglutinate microbes, they most probably have only one binding site. Although rβGRP and/or its domains bound to surface compounds of various types of microorganisms and caused aggregation of these microbes, we could not demonstrate any direct anti-microbial activity associated with these proteins (data not shown). The amino-terminal domain for P. interpunctella βGRP has several unique physical characteristics. The first 118 residues of PiβGRP were sufficient for binding β-1,3-glucan and for the activation of PPO, whereas the glucanase-like domain has less affinity toward some PAMPs and could not activate PPO. Furthermore, the amino-terminal domain is highly resistant to degradation by proteolysis and is resistant to heat denaturation. The folded structure of this domain must be extremely stable. Although 181N does possess a pair of cysteines (Cys-143 and Cys-157) that might participate in a disulfide bond, 118N lacks cysteine residues; thus, a disulfide linkage is not responsible for the thermal stability. Whereas no tertiary structure is available for proteins similar to βGRPs, we found that the amino-terminal recombinant truncations of PiβGRP have a predominantly α-helical secondary structure. Further studies of these domains should reveal structural features required for their stability as well as what motifs are important for binding carbohydrates and mediating immunological functions.

There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in cardiovascular disease. We postulate that the development of cardiovascular disease in old age is a late consequence of evolutionary programming for a pro-inflammatory response to resist infections in early age. In 311 women, aged 85 yr old, the production of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 was determined in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood samples and studied prospectively in association with cardiovascular mortality. High TNF-alpha was a risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease (relative risk [RR] = 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-2.40), whereas high IL-10 was protective (RR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.85). A genetic variant of the IL-10 gene promoter, which is associated with lower IL-10 production, was found to predispose to a 2.8-fold higher cardiovascular mortality risk (95% CI: 1.17-6.60). Reproductive success, which was studied as a measure of evolutionary programming because it trades off with early survival by pro-inflammatory resistance genes, was negatively associated with an increasing production of TNF-alpha (RR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68-0.88), while a positive association with IL-10 was found (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05-1.41). We suggest that cardiovascular mortality is a late consequence of evolutionary programming for a pro-inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2068946493,"CtIP is a transcriptional co-regulator that binds a number of proteins involved in cell cycle control and cell development, such as CtBP (Cterminus-binding protein), BRCA1 (breast cancer-associated protein-1), and LMO4 (LIM-only protein-4). The only recognizable structural motifs within CtIP are two putative coiled-coil domains located near the N and C termini of the protein. We now show that the N-terminal coiled coil (residues 45–160), but not the C-terminal coiled coil, mediates homodimerization of CtIP in mammalian 293T cells. The N-terminal coiled coil did not facilitate binding to LMO4 and BRCA1 proteins in these cells. A protease-resistant domain (residues 27–168) that minimally encompasses the putative N-terminal coiled coil was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. This region is predicted to contain two smaller coiled-coil regions. The CtIP-(45–160) dimerization domain is helical and dimeric, indicating that the domain does form a coiled coil. The two smaller domains, CtIP-(45–92) and CtIP-(93–160), also formed dimers of lower binding affinity, but with less helical content than the longer peptide. The hydrodynamic radius of CtIP-(45–160) is the same as those of CtIP-(45–92) and CtIP-(93–160), implying that CtIP-(45–160) does not form a single long coiled coil, but a more compact structure involving homodimerization of the two smaller coiled coils, which fold back as a four-helix bundle or other compact structure. These results suggest a specific model for CtIP homodimerization via its N terminus and contribute to an improved understanding of how this protein might assemble other factors required for its role as a transcriptional corepressor.

CtIP is a 897-residue nuclear protein that is widely expressed at variable levels (3Wong A.K. Ormonde P.A. Pero R. Chen Y. Lian L. Salada G. Berry S. Lawrence Q. Dayananth P. Ha P. Tavtigian S.V.

CtIP interacts with the BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) repeats of BRCA1 and is likely to bind to the pocket domain of Rb (7Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ewen M.E. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3761-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) by interacting with Rb through an LECEE motif (4Fusco C. Reymond A. Zervos A.S. Genomics. 1998; 51: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). BRCA1 C-terminus (BRCA1) and Rb are both tumor suppressor proteins, and CtIP is thought to play important roles in regulating their tumor-suppressive functions. BRCA1 is mutated in up to 20% of familial breast cancers (8Shih H.A. Couch F.J. Nathanson K.L. Blackwood M.A. Rebbeck T.R. Armstrong K.A. Calzone K. Stopfer J. Seal S. Stratton M.R. Weber B.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas Rb is a critical regulator of the cell cycle that is disrupted in up to 50% of all cancers (9Hickman E.S. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cellular expression pattern of CtIP mirrors the cell cycle-dependent expression of BRCA1 (10Yu X. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mutations that abrogate binding of BRCA1 to CtIP have been shown to result in deregulation of the cell cycle, leading to oncogenesis (2Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 3Wong A.K. Ormonde P.A. Pero R. Chen Y. Lian L. Salada G. Berry S. Lawrence Q. Dayananth P. Ha P. Tavtigian S.V. Teng D.H. Bartel P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2279-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). CtIP can be phosphorylated by ATM kinase at residues 664 and 745 in response to ultraviolet or ionizing radiation (11Li S. Ting N.S. Zheng L. Chen P.L. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Nature. 2000; 406: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This leads to a radiation-induced cell cycle checkpoint between G2 and M phases by allowing the expression of DNA damage-response elements such as GADD45 (12Wu-Baer F. Baer R. Nature. 2001; 414: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CtIP phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM) kinase requires BRCA1 (13Foray N. Marot D. Gabriel A. Randrianarison V. Carr A.M. Perricaudet M. Ashworth A. Jeggo P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2860-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that BRCA1 acts as a scaffold that links ATM to the phosphorylation of CtIP and other non-DNA-associated downstream substrates. Ikaros family proteins bind to CtBP and repress transcription through recruitment of histone deacetylases (14Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Initially, it was thought that the transcriptional regulatory activity of CtIP might result from its interaction with CtBP, which can modify chromatin structure through intrinsic histone deacetylase activity. More recently, Koipally and Georgopoulos (6Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23143-23149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CtIP cannot bind histone deacetylases directly and is thus a deacetylase-independent repressor. Rather, CtIP can interact directly with Ikaros and with the basal transcription protein transcription factor IIB. The ability to form the latter interaction is likely to be responsible for the histone deacetylase-independent corepressor properties of CtIP. Although several protein-binding sites on CtIP have been identified, little is known about the structure of the protein. Apart from nuclear localization motifs and regions that mediate Rb and CtBP binding, the only recognizable domains are two putative coiled-coil motifs in the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein (see Fig. 1) (4Fusco C. Reymond A. Zervos A.S. Genomics. 1998; 51: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Coiled coils are the most commonly encountered oligomerization motif in proteins and comprise two to five right-handed amphipathic α-helices that coil around one another to form a left-handed supercoil (15Cohen C. Parry D.A. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). These usually stable motifs form the basis of fibrous proteins such as keratin and myosin, but are often found as dimerization domains in DNA-binding proteins. Numerous basic zipper and basic helix-loop-helix/zipper proteins such as GCN4 and c-Jun, respectively, must dimerize to bind DNA and may preferentially form homodimers or heterodimers. These putative coiled coils give CtIP the potential to homo- or heterodimerize or to form higher order oligomers. Here we report that only the N-terminal domain forms a coiled coil that mediates protein homodimerization. Protein Expression and Purification—Human CtIP constructs were subcloned into the pEF1α-puro vector carrying an N-terminal FLAG tag, pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), or a modified pIH1119 plasmid (New England Biolabs Inc.). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated.

The proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q™ HR10/10 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with a gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl over 5 column volumes. GST-CtIP proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CtIP peptides were released by treatment with thrombin at 25 °C for 15 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The eluted peptides were further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a 10–90% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradient. Immunoprecipitation Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of each expression construct using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were prepared, and proteins were immunoprecipitated and separated as described previously (5Sum E.Y. Peng B. Yu X. Chen J. Byrne J. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7849-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.), filters were blocked and incubated with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Filters were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations were estimated using theoretical extinction coefficients at 280 nm where appropriate. Concentration estimates of CtIP-(45–160), CtIP-(45–92), and CtIP-(93–160), all of which lack tyrosine and tryptophan residues, were initially estimated by gas-phase amino acid analysis (Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) and Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, New South Wales). Limited Proteolysis and Peptide Mapping—Trypsin or α-chymotrypsin protease was added to the target protein solution at a ratio of 1:500 protease:target protein. The reaction was carried out in ice for trypsin or at 37 °C for α-chymotrypsin. Samples (30 μl) were taken as indicated, quenched by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by Tris/Tricine-PAGE (16Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar). In-gel trypsin digestion and analysis was performed as described previously (17Brymora A. Valova V.A. Larsen M.R.

Far-UV CD Spectropolarimetry—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. CD data were collected at 20 °C over a wavelength range of 195–260 nm in 0.1-, 1.0-, or 10-mm path length cells with a resolution of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 1 s. Final spectra were the sum of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm/min and were base line-corrected. Spectra were smoothed using five-point fast Fourier transform filtering (Origin Version 6.0, Microcal). The buffer used in all cases was 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), except in the trifluoroethanol (TFE) experiments, for which 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) was used. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments were carried out using a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60ti rotor. Protein samples eluted from a Superose™ 12 HR10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) were diluted in gel filtration buffer to give three samples in a 12-mm path length with A230 nm = 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2, respectively, for equilibrium analysis, and one sample with A230 nm = 0.8 for velocity analysis. For equilibrium measurements, data sets were collected at 20 °C at several speeds over a range of 7500–42,000 rpm. Absorbance versus radius scans were acquired in 0.01-mm increments at 230 nm at 3-h intervals until equilibrium was reached. Data were corrected by the use of base lines acquired at 360 nm. Data analysis was carried out using NONLIN software (18Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) and Sednterp (19Hayes D.B. Laue T. Philo J. Sedimentation Interpretation Program 1.05. University of New Hampshire, 1995–2001Google Scholar). For the sedimentation velocity experiment, data were collected at 10 °C at 58,000 rpm. Absorbance versus radius scans were acquired in 0.03-mm increments at intervals of 240 s. Data analysis was carried out using Sedfit software (20Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2977) Google Scholar). Light Scattering—Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro-MS/X dynamic light scattering/molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions). Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.5) and 1 mm dithiothreitol to final concentrations of 360 μm (CtIP-(45–92)), 390 μm (CtIP-(93–160)), and 110 μm (CtIP-(45–160)). rH values were taken from an average of 15 measurements at 25 °C. Data analysis was carried out using Dynamics graphical size analysis software (Protein Solutions). A Putative N-terminal Coiled-coil Domain of CtIP Mediates Homodimerization in Vivo—The coiled-coil prediction program MULTICOIL 2Available at multicoil.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/multicoil. (21Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the coiled coil-forming potential of residues in CtIP (Fig. 1) (4Fusco C. Reymond A. Zervos A.S. Genomics. 1998; 51: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When a default window size of 28 residues was used, obvious differences between the potentials for forming coiled coils between the two predicted coiled-coil regions were observed. Although the N-terminal region contains many residues with >90% probability of forming a coiled coil, the maximum probability of forming a coiled coil in the C-terminal leucine zipper was 5.4%. Furthermore, the coiled coil-forming propensities in the putative N-terminal coiled coil showed a significant decrease near residue 92. The first half (Fig. 1, CCA, residues 45–92) had moderate potential to form coiled coils (up to 10% probability), whereas the second half (Fig. 1, CCB, residues 93–160) had high potential to form coiled coils (up to 93% probability), and the halves were separated by a few residues (positions 89–94) with <1% probability of forming a coiled coil. In addition, residues 22–44 showed a very weak probability (<0.5%) of being included in a coiled coil. To determine whether either of the putative coiled-coil domains in CtIP could dimerize in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using extracts from 293T cells transfected with constructs encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CtIP-(45–897) and a FLAG-tagged version of CtIP-(45–897), CtIP-(45–160), or CtIP-(665–800) (Fig. 2). CtIP-(45–897) is essentially full-length protein, but is expressed at much higher levels than CtIP-(1–897). CtIP-(45–160) comprises the putative N-terminal coiled-coil domain, and CtIP-(665–800) encompasses the putative C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Interactions with HA-tagged full-length CtIP protein were observed only with FLAG-tagged CtIP-(45–897) and CtIP-(45–160), but not with FLAG-tagged CtIP-(665–800). Thus, full-length CtIP can oligomerize in mammalian 293T cells, and oligomerization is mediated by the coiled-coil region in the N terminus of the protein (residues 45–160), but not by a second predicted coiled-coil domain near the C terminus (residues 665–800). The interaction domains of CtIP for BRCA1 and LMO4 (2Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from transfected 293T cells coexpressing CtIP-(45–160) with BRCA1 or LMO4 did not revealed binding (data not shown). These results indicate that CtIP-(45–160) is not sufficient for association with BRCA1 or LMO4. The N-terminal Region of CtIP Contains a Structured Region—Residues 45–369 of CtIP have previously been identified as mediating binding to LMO4 using a series of truncated CtIP mutants in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (5Sum E.Y. Peng B. Yu X. Chen J. Byrne J. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7849-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This region contains the putative N-terminal coiled-coil domain and also spans the region of CtIP implicated in binding to the BRCT domains of BRCA1 (22Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To identify a minimum structured domain within CtIP that mediates homo-oligomerization and/or interactions with other proteins, limited proteolysis of CtIP-(1–369) was performed. A recombinant fusion protein comprising MBP with CtIP-(1–369) at its C terminus was used as the substrate. MBP-CtIP-(1–369) rapidly underwent proteolysis in the presence of either trypsin or chymotrypsin to leave a stable MBP core and other moderately protease-resistant fragments corresponding to molecular masses of 18–22 kDa (Fig. 3A), suggesting that it contained significant amounts of stable structure. Similar experiments using MBP as a control showed that this protein was largely resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 3B). Three bands from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 3A) were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion (under conditions that lead to complete proteolysis) and MALDI-TOF analysis. A very similar array of peptides, corresponding to the same core region near the N terminus of CtIP (residues 27–142), was identified for all three bands (Fig. 3C). The sizes of the bands observed by SDS-PAGE, the constituent positively identified peptides, and the positioning of potential trypsin and chymotrypsin sites identified a minimum protease-resistant core region consisting of residues 24–168 (Fig. 3D). This corresponds to Band 1 (Fig. 3A), with the N terminus being surmised from a predicted chymotrypsin site near residue 27. Band 1 has a mass of ∼18 kDa upon SDS-PAGE, and residues 24–168 have a predicted mass of 17.2 kDa. The termini of the larger trypsin fragments for Bands 2 and 3 could not be unambiguously identified due to the number of potential protease sites and lack of additional identified small peptides. However, all three bands must contain at least residues 27–141. Design of CtIP Peptides for Biophysical Analysis—Based on the MULTICOIL predictions and our identification of a protease-resistant core in the N-terminal region of CtIP, we designed four CtIP peptides for biophysical characterization. CtIP-(22–160) comprises the entire predicted coiled-coil domain (including low probability residues). CtIP-(45–160) lacks the N-terminal residues with a low probability for forming coiled coils. CtIP-(45–92) comprises the first coiled-coil half of CtIP-(45–160), whereas CtIP-(93–160) contains the second half. These peptides were produced in a recombinant manner as GST fusion proteins. All of the GST fusion proteins tended to be insoluble when expressed at 37 °C but, in general, showed good solubility (∼60%) when expressed at 25 °C. An exception was GST-CtIP-(22–160), which was moderately soluble (∼30%) when expressed at 25 °C. This protein also caused problems when the peptides were cleaved from the GST fusion using thrombin. The other three proteins showed complete proteolysis (>95%), but proteolysis of GST-CtIP-(22–160) (overnight at 25 °C) reached only ∼50% completion. All CtIP peptides were further purified in milligram quantities to >95% homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. The N-terminal Domain of CtIP Forms Dimers with Coiled-coil Characteristics—To determine whether the CtIP peptides formed dimers (or higher order oligomers), they were subjected to size exclusion chromatography, followed by sedimentation equilibrium experiments. All of the peptides eluted from the size exclusion column as single peaks, except for CtIP-(45–92), which showed one major peak and one minor peak at a lower molecular mass. When compared with globular molecular mass standards, all of the proteins eluted at relatively low volumes, indicating the presence of elongated and/or oligomeric peptides. Sedimentation equilibrium data for all peptides gave a reasonable fit to a single species model with molecular masses approximately corresponding to dimers. These experimental estimates were slightly low for the two smaller peptides. CtIP-(45–92) had an apparent molecular mass of 11.3 kDa (with upper and lower limits of 12.2 and 10.5 kDa, respectively), compared with a theoretical dimer mass of 12.0 kDa. CtIP-(93–160) had an apparent molecular mass of 14.6 kDa (with upper and lower limits of 15.4 and 13.7 kDa, respectively), compared with a theoretical dimer mass of 16.7 kDa. Slightly better fits were obtained using monomer-dimer models (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that, under the conditions of the experiment, we had small but significant amounts of monomer that could interchange with dimeric species. Based on direct fits to data and estimates of percentages of monomer and dimer present, the dimerization constants of these peptides were estimated to have a lower limit of ∼106m–1. More accurate estimates of dimerization constants require higher levels of monomer in solution. Although this could be achieved by lowering protein concentrations, the low extinction coefficients of the peptides give rise to very poor signal-to-noise ratios. A model for a single species dimer produced the best fits to the data obtained for CtIP-(45–160) (indicating that no significant amounts of monomer or higher order oligomers were present), with an estimated dimer molecular mass of 30 kDa (with upper and lower limits of 33 and 28 kDa, respectively). This corresponds well with a theoretical dimer mass of 28.4 kDa. Conditions for accurate determination of a dimerization constant for CtIP-(45–160) could not be established (again because of low extinction coefficients of the peptide), but must be >107m–1 and likely to be much stronger. All models tried did not fit well to data for CtIP-(22–160). The estimated single species mass of this peptide is 40 kDa (with upper and lower limits of 42 and 37 kDa, respectively), which is larger than the theoretical dimer mass of 33.8 kDa. These data probably result from a tendency of CtIP-(22–160) to dimerize and also to aggregate in a nonspecific manner, a property that is also consistent with poor solubility upon expression and reduced efficiency of proteolysis by thrombin. This peptide was excluded from further detailed analysis. Far-UV circular dichroism spectropolarimetry was used to determine whether these peptides could form helical structure over a range of protein concentrations. All peptides showed the double minima at 208 and 222 nm typical of α-helices at all concentrations tested (0.074–300 μm) (Fig. 5, A–E). Based on the formula (23Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) MRE222 nm(max) = –40,000 × (1–(2.5/n)), where n is the number of residues in the peptide, fully helical CtIP-(45–92), CtIP-(93–160), and CtIP-(45–160) would correspond to MRE222 nm = 38,000, 38,571, and 39,154, respectively. Based on these figures, the two shorter peptides contained ∼50% helix over a concentration range of ∼2–300 μm. Only at ∼0.5 μm peptide, the lowest concentrations for which far-UV CD measurements could be made with confidence for these peptides, the helical contents dropped to slightly <50%. MRE222 nm values for CtIP-(45–160) corresponded to ∼100% helix at all peptide concentrations (0.074–74 μm). At the higher concentrations used, all three peptides had an MRE208 nm: MRE222 nm ratio that was <1, which is often cited as a marker of coiled-coil conformation. Notably, this ratio was evident at lower concentrations of CtIP-(45–160) than the two shorter peptides, indicating that the coiled-coil structure is more stable in this peptide. The presence of TFE is known to enhance helical conformation, but to disrupt coiled-coil conformation. The addition of 50% TFE to CtIP-(45–160) at moderate protein concentration (∼1 μm) had little effect on helical content, but brought the MRE208 nm:MRE222 nm ratio closer to 1 (from 0.85 in the absence of TFE to 0.96 in the presence of TFE) (Fig. 5D). The presence of 50% TFE increased the helical content of the CtIP-(45–92) and CtIP-(93–160) peptides to ∼95 and 88%, respectively (Fig. 5E). When these peptides were subjected to thermal denaturation, CtIP-(45–92) showed a progressive decrease of signal at 222 nm, with no signs of cooperative unfolding. CtIP-(93–160) and CtIP-(45–160) both showed sigmoidal unfolding curves above 28 °C, indicating cooperative unfolding (Fig. 5F). The midpoints of the major unfolding phases were 52.5 ± 0.3 °C for CtIP-(45–160) and 47.3 ± 0.1 °C for CtIP-(93–160). Both peptides may have an additional unfolding phase at lower temperatures that could not be fitted by equations for three-state unfolding. Models of the CtIP-(45–160) Structure—The sedimentation equilibrium and CD data indicate that CtIP-(45–160) forms a stable homodimeric coiled coil with a very high degree of helicity and that CtIP-(45–92) and CtIP-(93–160) form homodimers with some coiled-coiled characteristics, but of lower stability and helical content than the larger peptide. These data support three simple models for the structure of CtIP-(45–160). First, the longer peptide makes a single long stable parallel coiled coil that would measure ∼17 nm along its long axis (Model A) (Fig. 6A). Second, the two halves form two independent parallel coiled coils joined by a flexible hinge region, and stability is enhanced by the chelate effect, i.e. reduced losses of entropy upon the binding of two sites on a single molecule versus two separate molecules will increase the overall stability (Model B) (Fig. 6B). Third, the two halves fold back and interact, possibly to form a four-helix bundle comprising two coiled coils (Model C)"

In this study, we examined the relative importance of SP/NK-1Rs or NKA/NK-2Rs in a murine model for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and tested if the functional absence of NK-Rs will impair inflammatory response in vivo. Mice lacking NK-1Rs (C57BL/6J-NK-1R-/-) displayed a significantly reduced ACD inflammatory ear swelling response to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) with histological less edema and 50% fewer infiltrating leukocytes compared with the ACD response in wild-type (+/+) animals. In NK-1R+/+ mice, transient NK-1R inhibition impaired ACD sensitization. In vitro haptenized bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from NK-1R+/+ mice matured in the presence of an NK-1R antagonist displayed a reduced capability to induce T cell proliferation in vitro and ACD after adoptive transfer into naïve wild-type mice in vivo. By contrast, NK-2R inhibition significantly enhanced the ACD response in NK-1R null or in wild-type mice, whereas epicutaneous application of NK-2R agonists diminished the ACD inflammation. In conclusion, NK-1R and SP are required for antigen sensitization and a full inflammatory response to cutaneous allergens and NKA and the NK-2R mediate a contrasting anti-inflammatory role in ACD. Thus, SP, NKA, NK-1R, and NK-2R have important but differential roles in the regulation of cutaneous inflammatory responses."

Moreover, snapin is regulated by phosphorylation and enhances synaptotagmin binding to SNAREs. Furthermore, snapin and C-terminal snapin fragments have been effective in changing the release properties of neurons and chromaffin cells. Here we have reinvestigated the role of snapin using both biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. Snapin is ubiquitously expressed at low levels with no detectable enrichment in the brain or in synaptic vesicles.

Similarly, overexpression of a C-terminal snapin fragment in hippocampal neurons failed to influence any of the analyzed parameters of neurotransmitter release. Initial biochemical characterization of recombinant snapin revealed that the protein is a stable dimer with a predominantly α-helical secondary structure.

Neurons release neurotransmitters by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Exocytotic membrane fusion is mediated by SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptor; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; snapin-CT, C-terminal snapin fragment comprising residues 80–136; SFV, Semliki forest virus; EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current. proteins including the vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP) and the plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin. Assembly of SNARE complexes is currently thought to pull the vesicle and plasma membrane close together and to initiate the fusion reaction (1Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Because of the central role of SNAREs in fusion reactions, major efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins work. According to the emerging picture, SNARE proteins undergo a complex assembly-disassembly cycle during the fusion reaction that is associated with major conformational changes (2Fasshauer D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Essential for the conformational cycle are the SNARE motifs, stretches of 60–70 amino acids that are characteristic of all SNARE proteins. They are unstructured as monomers but form extended helical bundles of extraordinary stability upon oligomerization. These complexes are disassembled by the chaperone-like ATPase NSF in conjunction with cofactors (3Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). More than three dozen proteins have been identified that are supposed to regulate the activity of neuronal SNAREs by virtue of binding either to individual SNAREs or to partially or fully assembled SNARE complexes. In some cases, e.g. complexin and Munc-18, the interaction between regulatory proteins and SNAREs is structurally well defined (4Chen X. Tomchick D.R. Kovrigin E. Arac D. Machius M. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2002; 33: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), leading to the development of models explaining how and at which state these proteins regulate the SNARE assembly-disassembly cycle. For most of the other reported binding proteins, however, it remains to be established to which conformational state of the SNAREs they bind and consequently how exactly they exert their presumed control function. In many cases, the evidence for a role as SNARE regulators is limited to non-quantitative and non-equilibrium binding studies, often complemented with functional studies on intact cells in which attempts are made to perturb the presumed interaction with SNAREs. It is therefore imperative to put these interactions on solid structural ground by characterizing affinities and stoichiometries. In particular, it is important to map the binding domain and to determine its conformation in complex with its binding partner. Snapin is a 15-kDa protein that has been identified as a binding protein of SNAP-25 (5Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A stretch containing heptad repeats typical for coiled coils is located in the C-terminal half of the molecule. The N terminus contains a putative transmembrane domain. The protein has been reported to be highly enriched on purified synaptic vesicles. Snapin has attracted wide interest because it increases binding of synaptotagmin to SNAREs, which is further enhanced upon phosphorylation of snapin at Ser-50 (6Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These features raise the exciting possibility that snapin may provide a direct molecular link between the fusion apparatus and second messenger-dependent signaling cascades. Whereas snapin was originally considered to be specific for SNAP-25 (5Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it recently has been reported to bind also to SNAP-23, a ubiquitously expressed SNARE homologous to SNAP-25, suggesting that it may be a general regulator of SNAREs whose function is not confined to neuronal exocytosis (7Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Snapin has been found to bind to SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 regardless of whether these proteins are in isolation or assembled in SNARE complexes. Considering the structural difference between free and complexed SNAP-25, the latter property is particularly intriguing. We therefore set out to characterize the interaction between SNAP-25 and snapin in detail to clarify how the interaction with snapin affects the structure of SNAP-25 and furthermore to understand how snapin binds to the assembled SNARE complex. Antibodies—Two antisera that recognize rat snapin were raised in rabbits using standard procedures. For this purpose, either the recombinantly expressed full-length snapin or the synthesized peptide corresponding to residues 117–136 of rat snapin coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was used. The antibody raised against the full-length protein was used for immunoprecipitations after affinity purification on a GST-snapin column. The antibody raised against the peptide was used for Western blotting. Other antibodies were described previously: GDP dissociation inhibitor (monoclonal Cl 81.2 (8Chou J.H. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9433-9440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), synaptophysin (monoclonal Cl 7.2 (9Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Brain Res. 1985; 352: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). Most of these antibodies are available from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany), which also supplied a rabbit antiserum specific for SNAP-23. For affinity purification of snapin antibodies, 10 mg of corresponding antigen (either recombinant GST-snapin or synthesized peptide, amino acids 117–136) was bound covalently to CNBr-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with 15 ml of antisnapin rabbit serum. Bound antibodies were eluted with glycine buffer (200 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl) at pH 2.3 and neutralized immediately with Tris buffer, resulting in a pH of 7.4. Antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (40 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and stored frozen at -80 °C. Molecular Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Protein—Rat snapin expressed sequence tags were cloned via the assembly of EST189206 (amino acids 4–136) with amino acids 1–4 of the mouse snapin gi|19923056 (this amino acid sequence does not differ from a recently available full-length rat snapin clone (gi|27692724)) and cloned into pET28a or pGexKG vector. Phosphomimetic S50D mutant was produced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the primer GCG GTC AGA GAA GAC CAA GTA GAG CTC CGG and the primer CCG GAG CAC TAC TTG GTC TTC TCT GAC CGC. The pET28a vector (Novagen) was used for the following constructs: the cytosolic part of synaptobrevin 2 (residues 1–96), SNAP-25a (residues 1–206, SNAP-25a is one of the two splicing variants expressed in the brain), and the cytosolic part of syntaxin 1a (residues 1–262). If not further indicated, a SNAP-25a mutant was used, in which all cysteines were substituted with serines (14Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were expressed as either N-terminal GST or His6 fusion proteins in the BL21 DE Escherichia coli strain and purified on glutathione- or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, respectively, followed by further purification by fast protein liquid chromatography on MonoS or MonoQ columns (Amersham Biosciences). If indicated, tags were removed by thrombin cleavage. A GST-tagged ternary SNARE complex was assembled overnight at 4 °C with a GST-syntaxin to SNAP-25a ratio of 1:1 and a slight excess of synaptobrevin. Tissue Extracts and Subcellular Fractionation—Tissues were isolated from male Wistar rats and homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) either with an Ultratorax device (glandula submaxillaris and heart and skeletal muscles) or with a glass Teflon homogenizer (10 strokes at 800 rpm) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain was carried out as described previously (15Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). For Triton X-114 partitioning, total rat brain homogenate was prepared in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, complete protease inhibitor mix (Boehringer) with 1% Triton X-114 at a final protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Two hundred μl of the extract were subjected to phase separation as described by Bordier (16Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After partitioning, the aqueous phase was removed, and the detergent-enriched phase was adjusted to the same volume as the aqueous phase to allow for direct comparison. Twenty μl each of the starting material before partitioning, the aqueous phase, and the volume-adjusted detergent phase was analyzed in parallel. GST Pulldown Assays—For pulldown experiments, rat brains were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) with a glass Teflon homogenizer (9 strokes at 900 rpm) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were solubilized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g in a Beckman Ti 51.2 rotor), 15 mg of the lysate was incubated for 2 h with 200 μg of GST fusion protein. Then glutathione-Sepharose was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. After washing with the solubilization buffer, proteins bound to the beads were eluted in one-hundredth of the volume of the unbound material with SDS-sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Equal volumes of unbound material (Fig. 3, S) and eluate (B) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations—PC12 cells or total rat brain postnuclear supernatant was solubilized in 2% Triton X-100 containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and the Boehringer protease inhibitor mixture. Protein was adjusted to 2 mg/ml, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (30 min at 16,000 × g). For immunoprecipitation of snapin, 200 μg of lysate protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of affinity-purified antibody raised against full-length rat snapin. For immunoprecipitation of SNAP-25, 200 μg of lysate protein (protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) was incubated with 5 μl of SNAP-25-specific monoclonal antibody Cl 71.1 (ascites) for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibodies were prebound to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After three washing cycles with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. The unbound material was concentrated with acetone precipitation in the case of SNAP-25 immunoprecipitation to reach the protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Equal volumes of unbound and bound material corresponding to 20 μg of input material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Multiangle Laser Light Scattering—Size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a HR-10/30 Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and a protein concentration of 60 μm. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm and light scattering at 632.8 nm. Light scattering analysis was carried out using the Dawn instrument of Wyatt Technology Corp. The dn/dc value (change of solution refractive index with respect to a change in concentration of the molecules being investigated) is fairly constant for proteins and was set to 0.189 for the analysis of the light scattering data. CD Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra were obtained by averaging 15 scans using steps of 0.1 nm in the interval between 195 and 250 nm in Hellma quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 0.1 cm with a scan rate of 50 nm/min on a Jasco model J-720 upgraded to a J-715U. All CD spectra were recorded after reaching equilibrium following an overnight incubation at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Thermal melting curves were measured in 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 220 nm every 0.5 °C with a temperature increment of 60 °C/h. To evaluate changes of the CD spectrum attributable to complex formation, the spectra were compared with the theoretical sum of the individual spectra using the equation [Θ]sum = Σcini [Θ]i/Σcini, where Θ is molar residue ellipticity, ci is the respective concentrations of the proteins, and ni is the respective numbers of amino acid residues. Electrophysiology—Semliki forest virus constructs were generated by subcloning rat snapin residues 80–136 into pSFV1 vector (Invitrogen) containing a IRES-GFP cassette (19Sorensen J.B. Matti U. Wei S.H. Nehring R.B. Voets T. Ashery U. Binz T. Neher E. Rettig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Virus production and titer determination followed standard procedures (20Ashery U. Koch H. Scheuss V. Brose N. Rettig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All snapin overexpression studies were performed in parallel to control transfections and thereby to avoid culture- and age-dependent artifacts associated with synaptic properties. Snapin overexpression was compared with GFP overexpression. Data were obtained from at least three separate wild type cultures. Recording conditions (room temperature), data acquisition, and analysis were performed as described previously (21Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The holding potential was -70 mV. Cultures from hippocampal autaptic neurons from newborn mice were prepared as described previously (21Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Glutamatergic neurons were used for experiments after 10–14 days in vitro and recorded after 8–12 h following transfection. For the characterization of snapin, two rabbit sera were generated using purified recombinant rat snapin and a synthetic peptide (corresponding to residues 117–136) as antigen, respectively. Both antibodies, which specifically react with recombinant snapin, were affinity-purified using the respective antigens as immunosorbent. Furthermore, bands corresponding to recombinant snapin are recognized in homogenates of rat brain and PC12 cells (a neuroendocrine cell line) (Fig. 1) (22Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). We then performed subcellular fractionations of rat brain to confirm the association of snapin with synaptic vesicles. Surprisingly, snapin was found both in membrane-free and membrane-containing fractions, and no co-enrichment with synaptic vesicles was observed. As shown in Fig. 2A, snapin was present in cytosol obtained from whole brain (S3) as well as from synaptosomes (LS2). Both fractions are devoid of membranes as shown by the lack of the vesicle protein synaptophysin and the R1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. When crude synaptic vesicles (LP2) were prepared from synaptosomes (P2), the levels of snapin were about the same in both fractions, whereas synaptophysin, a marker for synaptic vesicles, was significantly enriched (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Tissue and subcellular distribution of snapin.A, distribution of snapin in brain subcellular fractions (10 μg/lane).

All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of snapin in membrane-free supernatants is not consistent with the view that the protein contains a transmembrane domain (5Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), but it agrees with a recent report showing that in 3T3-L1 cells snapin is partially soluble (7Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To further investigate this issue, we performed phase partitioning of rat brain homogenate in Triton X-114. This detergent undergoes phase transition above 20 °C, resulting in a micelle-enriched phase containing proteins carrying transmembrane domains and a micelle-depleted phase in which all other proteins are enriched (16Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the soluble protein GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), snapin partitioned in the micelle-depleted phase, whereas the transmembrane protein synaptophysin was enriched in the micellar phase (Fig. 2B). Identical results were obtained with homogenates of PC12 cells (not shown). We also reinvestigated the tissue distribution of snapin. Snapin was originally reported to be expressed exclusively in brain (5Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, snapin was not only detectable in nervous tissue but also in other tissues including lung, heart, testis, kidney, spleen, and exocrine glands, in agreement with a recent study reporting expression of snapin in many non-neuronal tissues (7Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Expression levels are generally low. In most tissues including brain, the signals obtained with 10 μg of homogenate were 5–10× lower than with 2 ng of purified snapin. In the next experiments, we investigated the interaction between snapin and SNAP-25 using GST pulldown assays. To obtain an accurate picture of the interaction, we concentrated the bound material 100-fold in comparison with non-bound material to detect even minor bound pools of SNAP-25. Furthermore, we used only a moderate stoichiometric excess (1.5–2-fold) of snapin over SNAP-25 to reduce nonspecific adsorption (SNAP-25 amounts to approximately 0.5–1% of brain homogenate protein (23Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. von Mollard G.F. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar)). Finally, we analyzed the bound and non-bound material in parallel to determine the binding efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3A, some SNAP-25 and syntaxin and minor amounts of SNAP-23 and synaptobrevin were detectable in the bound fraction. However, these amounts were considerably lower than those detected in the non-bound material. Considering that the bound material was concentrated 100-fold, bound SNAP-25 amounts to less than 1% of SNAP-25 in the starting material. A very similar result was observed with the phosphomimetic mutant of snapin (snapin S50D) (Fig. 3B) that has been reported previously to bind with higher affinity (6Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To exclude an inhibitory effect of the GST tag, we performed the binding experiment in reverse order using GST-SNAP-25 and brain extracts as a source for native snapin. In parallel experiments, we tested GST-synaptobrevin, GST-syntaxin 1a, and a preassembled SNARE complex containing GST-syntaxin 1a (Fig. 3C). No binding of snapin was observed under any condition. Similarly negative results were obtained with GST-SNAP-23 and GST-SNAP-29 and with the second isoform of SNAP-25 (GST-SNAP-25b) (not shown). As an independent approach for assessing an association between snapin and SNAP-25, we performed immunoprecipitations with both antisnapin and anti-SNAP-25 antibodies using detergent-solubilized homogenates of rat brain and PC12 cells as starting material. All precipitations were performed with an excess of antibody. Immunoprecipitation of snapin was almost quantitative, but no co-precipitation of SNAP-25 was detectable (Fig. 4, A and B). Conversely, no co-precipitation of snapin was detectable when SNAP-25 was precipitated. Precipitation of SNAP-25 was almost quantitative when PC12 cell extracts were used (Fig. 4C). In contrast, only partial precipitation of SNAP-25 could be achieved from brain homogenate, which may be due to epitope masking caused by binding to other proteins (Fig. 4D). Immunoprecipitation of assembled SNARE complexes using a synaptobrevin-specific antibody resulted in almost quantitative precipitation, but again no co-precipitation of snapin was found (not shown). The results described so far suggest that neither native nor recombinant snapin is capable of forming a complex with SNAP-25. However, it is conceivable that aggregation and/or partial denaturation of snapin compromises its ability to interact with SNAP-25. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that binding is of low affinity, thus escaping detection in the non-equilibrium assays described above. Therefore we purified recombinant snapin to homogeneity and performed an initial characterization of its molecular properties in order to perform equilibrium binding studies with purified SNAP-25. Recombinant snapin eluted as a single symmetrically shaped peak from a gel filtration column. Analysis by multiangle laser light scattering revealed a molecular weight of 29,100 that remained unchanged during elution (Fig. 5). Considering that the predicted molecular weight of recombinant snapin is 15,200, these data suggest that snapin is a dimer, with no evidence for aggregation to higher order oligomers. The CD spectrum of purified snapin revealed that the protein is well folded, exhibiting minima in the molar residue ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm that are characteristic for α-helices (Fig. 6A) with the helical content calculated to be 64%.Fig. 6Characterization of secondary structure by CD spectroscopy of snapin and snapin/SNAP-25 mixtures.A, CD spectra of purified snapin (black) and SNAP-25 (gray).

It is well established that SNAP-25 is largely unstructured as a monomer (see Fig. 6A) (24Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas it assumes a predominantly α-helical conformation in all protein-protein interactions that have been structurally characterized (25Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the conformational change is so large that it can be easily detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy, thus allowing monitoring of the change under equilibrium binding conditions. When snapin and SNAP-25 were combined (each at a concentration of 15 μm), the CD spectrum of the mixture was identical to the sum of the individual spectra (Fig. 6B). In contrast, combination of SNAP-25 with syntaxin resulted in a significant increase of α-helicity (Fig. 6C) in agreement with our previous observations (24Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the presence of snapin has no influence on the conformation of SNAP-25. To exclude that a"

Severing of F-actin by the homologous proteins villin and gelsolin requires unphysiologically high calcium concentrations (20–200 μm). Here we demonstrate that high calcium releases an autoinhibited conformation in villin that is maintained by two low affinity calcium binding sites (aspartic acids 467 and 715) that interact with a cluster of basic residues in the S2 domain of villin. Mutation of either of these sites as well as tyrosine phosphorylation alters the conformation of villin resulting in a protein that can sever actin in nanomolar calcium. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation rather than high calcium may be the mechanism by which villin and other related proteins sever actin in vivo.

Escherichia coli competent cells BL21 and TKX1 and QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit were from Stratagene; prokaryotic expression vector pGEX2T was from Amersham Biosciences; glutathione-Sepharose 4B Fastflow was from Amersham Biosciences; GelCode Blue was from Pierce; Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease was obtained from Sigma; monoclonal antibodies to villin, and phosphotyrosine (clone PY-20), were from Transduction Laboratories; muscle actin polymerization kit and the actin binding kit were from Cytoskeleton; all other chemicals were from Sigma or Invitrogen. Calcium Binding Site Mutants—Substitution mutants of villin were generated by designing complimentary primers to introduce a leucine for aspartic acid at Asp467 and Asp715 in full-length human villin cDNA using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer. The introduction of the desired codons was verified by sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Villin Proteins—Full-length or mutant villin cDNA (human) cloned in pGEX-2T was expressed in the E. coli BL21 cells as described earlier (1Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-tagged recombinant proteins were obtained by induction of the villin gene using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Tyrosine-phosphorylated villin protein was obtained as described before. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—CD spectra were collected from 191 to 260 nm with data collection for 5-s averaging in 1-nm increments with three repeats at 25 °C essentially as described before (2Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An AVIV model 62S spectropolarimeter equipped with electronic temperature control and a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette was used for CD studies. Mean molar ellipticity per residue was calculated by (θ)(10)/(c)(n)(l); units are degrees cm2/decimole. θ is ellipticity in millidegrees; c is concentration in moles/liters; n is number of amino acid residues per protein; and l is path length in centimeters. The K2d program was used for estimation of secondary structure from CD data. K2d provides estimated structure and the error estimate (kaleal.ugr.es/k2d.htm). Quenching of Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of wild-type, mutant, and tyrosine-phosphorylated villin proteins were recorded using a FluoroMax3 spectrofluorimeter as described before (2Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ca2+ (final concentration between 0 and 1.0 mm) was added in 0.3-μl increments, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded 5 min after each addition. The emission scan was recorded with an excitation at 290 nm. Proteolysis of VIL/WT, VILT/WT, VIL/D467L, and VIL/D715L—Villin proteins were digested for 90 min with S. aureus V8 protease (1:100, w/w) as described before (3Matsudaira P. Jakes R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1985; 315: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The proteolytic fragments were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with GelCode Blue. Measurement of Actin Depolymerization Kinetics—The ability of villin to sever actin filaments was determined by its effect on the rate and extent of decrease in fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin as described before (4Zhai L. Zhao P. Panebra A. Guerrerio A.L. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36163-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Villin, gelsolin, fragmin, and adseverin are homologous, calcium (Ca2+)-regulated, actin-severing proteins that are involved in actin remodeling and regulation of cell motility. Gene knock-out experiments have implicated the actin severing properties of villin and gelsolin in their motogenic effect (5Ferrary E. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Lapillonne A. Athman R.

However, all these proteins require very high calcium concentrations for actin severing (between 1 and 200 μm) (7Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A. J. Biol.

Activation of gelsolin by Ca2+ may be modulated by other factors as well (7Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cooper J.A. Bryan J. Schwab 3rd, B. Frieden C. Loftus D.J. Elson E. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1229-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Low pH has been reported to override the Ca2+ requirements of gelsolin (7Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the concentration of H+ (pH < 6.0) may also never be reached inside the cell. Thus understanding the regulation of actin severing by villin and its related proteins is important. Villin and gelsolin contain segments that display internal homology with each other. In villin, gelsolin and adseverin/scinderin there are six such segmental repeats (S1–S6) with S1 most closely related to S4, S2–S5, and S3–S6. The two halves of the protein, the aminoterminal (S1–S3) and carboxyl-terminal (S4–S6) are joined by a long linker region. Interaction of actin with villin is strongly Ca2+-dependent (15Janmey P.A. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16738-16743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the conformation of villin protein following its association with calcium have led to a hypothetical mechanism referred to as the “hinge mechanism” (16Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, villin bound to Ca2+ adopts a local secondary structure that allows another region of the villin protein to rotate out such that it is now exposed to the solution interface (16Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In gelsolin, the high calcium concentrations requirements have been attributed to an analogous model referred to as the “tail helix unlatching” that is required to expose the actin side binding and severing domain (S1–S2 and S4) in this protein (10Lin K.M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27746-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, no biochemical or functional studies are available identifying these latch/hinge or low affinity Ca2+ binding sites in either of these proteins. The Ca2+ concentrations required for actin severing by villin are in the micromolar range, which suggests that functional regulation of villin cannot be modulated by calcium, since intracellular Ca2+ levels may never reach 200 μm (17Villereal M.L. Palfrey H.C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1989; 9: 347-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have suggested previously that tyrosine phosphorylation of villin could modulate its ability to regulate the cortical cytoskeleton in submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (1Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve this paradox, we sought first to identify low affinity Ca2+ binding residues that could allow villin to adopt a head to tail latched/hinge mechanism and secondly to determine whether such a mechanism could be released by tyrosine phosphorylation as opposed to high Ca2+. Sequence alignment of human villin and gelsolin as well as the crystal structure of gelsolin (18Robinson R.C. Mejillano M. Le V.P. Burtnick L.D. Yin H.L. Choe S. Science. 1999; 286: 1939-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Choe H. Burtnick L.D. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. Robinson R.C. Choe S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) allowed us to identify three well conserved aspartic acid (Asp) residues (Asp86, Asp467, and Asp715) that could constitute the low affinity Ca2+ binding sites in villin and function as latch residues. Based on the crystal structure of gelsolin, these three residues could form salt bridges with arginine and lysine residues in the S1/S2 domain of villin (as predicted for gelsolin) thus forming a latch between the S1–S3 or S2–S6 or the linker region between S3–S4 and S2 domain of villin, thus inhibiting access to the actin binding sites in the villin core. Binding of Ca2+ to these low affinity binding sites could release the autoinhibited conformation thus regulating actin severing. On the basis of this, mutants of villin lacking these putative latch residues were first assessed for their ability to bind Ca2+ (17Villereal M.L. Palfrey H.C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1989; 9: 347-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, each of these aspartic acid residues was mutated to a leucine and expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (20Zhai L. Kumar N. Panebra A. Zhao P. Parrill A.L. Khurana S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11750-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding was determined by recording quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of wild-type and mutant villin proteins. Villin has an emission maximum of 337 nm, and Ca2+ induces a dose-dependent (0 to 1.0 mm) and saturable quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of villin without shifting its emission maxima (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the villin latch mutants VIL/D467L and VIL/D715L show no Ca2+-dependent quenching of tryptophan fluorescence even at the highest concentration of Ca2+ used (Fig. 1, B and C). VIL/D86L behaved like VIL/WT (supplemental Fig. S1). These data suggest that Asp467 and Asp715 are low affinity Ca2+ binding residues that could function as latch residues. To determine the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on Ca2+ sensitivity of villin, Ca2+-dependent change in tryptophan fluorescence was monitored for full-length tyrosine-phosphorylated human villin expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (VILT/WT) (1Panebra A. Ma S.X. Zhai L.W. Wang X.T. Rhee S.G. Khurana S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1046-C1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated villin does not show a Ca2+-dependent change in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1D). Thus tyrosine phosphorylation of villin may result in a change in the conformation of villin protein such that it is insensitive to Ca2+-induced changes in its structure. To determine whether the latch mutants are functional and to determine the Ca2+ requirements of these mutants as well as of tyrosine-phosphorylated villin to sever actin, we assessed their ability to sever actin in vitro by pyrene-actin depolymerization assays (4Zhai L. Zhao P. Panebra A. Guerrerio A.L. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36163-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). VIL/WT severs actin efficiently at 200 μm (Fig. 2A) consistent with previous reports (11Northrop J. Weber A. Mooseker M.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Bishop M.F. Dubyak G.R. Tucker M. Walsh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9274-9281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of villin allows it to sever actin very effectively at nanomolar Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2A). Tyrosine phosphorylation abolishes the high Ca2+ requirements for actin severing by villin and reduces the Ca2+ dependence by more than 4000-fold. In contrast, VIL/D467L and VIL/D715L mutants are constitutively active at physiological Ca2+ concentrations and can sever actin just as effectively at much lower Ca2+ concentrations of 50 nm (Fig. 2B). None of the villin proteins, wild-type or mutant, sever actin in the absence of Ca2+, consistent with previous observations that villin requires calcium for its association with actin (21Walsh T.P.

Therefore, actin severing remains a Ca2+-dependent process, suggesting the presence of additional high affinity Ca2+ binding sites in villin. The latch mutants and tyrosine phosphorylation had no effect on the actin capping activity of villin (supplemental Fig. S2). Together these data suggest that binding of Ca2+ to low affinity Ca2+ binding sites, namely Asp467 and Asp715 as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of villin regulate the Ca2+-dependent actin severing activity of villin. One possibility is that villin adopts an autoinhibited conformation that both high calcium or tyrosine phosphorylation could release allowing villin to sever at physiological Ca2+ levels. The very high Ca2+ levels required to sever actin may in fact function to maintain the villin protein in an autoinhibited conformation, and tyrosine phosphorylation may be the physiologically relevant agonist for the activation of the severing activity of villin. To determine whether high Ca2+ or tyrosine phosphorylation could change the conformation of the villin protein, we measured changes in the secondary structure of the villin protein using circular dichroism spectroscopy in the farultraviolet region (2Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CD measurements were made with samples containing VIL/WT, VILT/WT, as well as the latch mutants in the absence or presence of different concentrations of calcium (0–1.0 mm). The CD spectra were fitted to the K2d program to quantify the structural changes in the villin protein as described before (2Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism spectrum of human villin shows significant dose-dependent changes in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). Binding with Ca2+ results in a significant increase in the α-helical and a decrease in the β-sheet content of the protein (supplemental Table S1). These data agree with a previous observation made by Hesterberg and Weber (16Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the α-helical content of villin protein was increased at 50 μm Ca2+. A comparison of VIL/WT structure with the structure of the latch mutants VIL/D467L and VIL/D715L shows an increase in the α-helical and decrease in the β-sheet content of the villin protein, consistent with a change in the secondary structure of the protein (Fig. 3, B and C). Mutation of the latch residues also makes these proteins insensitive to Ca2+-induced structural changes (insets in Fig. 3, B and C). Tyrosine-phosphorylated villin likewise shows an increase in the α-helical content and a decrease in the β-sheet structure (Fig. 3D and supplemental Table S1). Unlike VIL/WT, tyrosine-phosphorylated villin shows no Ca2+-dependent change in the secondary structure (Fig. 3D and supplemental Table S1). Thus tyrosine phosphorylation also makes villin insensitive to Ca2+-induced structural changes. These data show that both high Ca2+ as well as tyrosine phosphorylation induce global changes in the secondary structure of villin, which regulate the ligand binding properties of villin (Ca2+) as well as the actin-modifying functions of villin (actin severing). Limited proteolysis was also used to compare the conformational changes induced by Ca2+ during unlatching of the hinge mechanism. S. aureus V8 cleaves villin to generate large amino-terminal fragments, the villin core (87 kDa) and the villin headpiece of 8.5 kDa. Further proteolysis produces fragments of 51, 44, and 30 kDa (supplemental Fig. S4). V8 maximally cleaves VIL/WT in the presence of calcium but not in the presence of EGTA. In contrast, VILT/WT, VIL/D467L, and VIL/D715L are cleaved at these sites even in the presence of EGTA. These data then support the idea that V8 digests villin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and tyrosine phosphorylation or latch site mutations in villin generate conformational changes that are comparable with those generated by Ca2+ in full-length villin. Villin contains a cluster of arginine and lysine residues in S2 that have been identified as the F-actin side binding and actin severing domain in villin (22). Since we speculate that if Asp467 and Asp715 could form a latch with this domain in villin, then mutation in the S2 domain should similarly release the inhibitory effect of the latch. As shown in supplemental Table S1 deletion of all the positive residues in this domain (amino acids 138–146) results in a villin mutant protein (ΔPB2) that adopts a different conformation compared with VIL/WT. ΔPB2 has a higher α-helical content, lower β-sheet structure, and an increase in the random coil content of the protein, consistent with significant secondary structural changes in the villin mutant protein (supplemental Table S1). These data are in agreement with the idea that Asp467 and Asp715 form a latch with the cluster of basic residues in S2 domain of human villin. We have demonstrated previously that mutation of R138A, R145A, and R146A in villin does not alter the conformation of the protein (2Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that perhaps no single residue in this domain but rather the cluster of positive charge in PB2 contributes to the formation of the latch. These data show that both tyrosine phosphorylation as well as mutation of latch residues result in a rearrangement of the villin conformation that no longer requires high Ca2+ levels for its activity. We speculate that this new conformation of villin is a more open structure where the villin F-actin side binding site is exposed allowing the villin protein to bind and sever F-actin in physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3 E). Such a model would agree with the reported Ca2+ induced increase in the Stoke volume of the villin protein (16Hesterberg L.K. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 359-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of actin severing by tyrosine phosphorylation is likely to extend to other proteins of the villin family including gelsolin (Fig. 3F), which have been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in vitro (23Wang Q. Xie Y. Du Q.S. Wu X.J. Feng X. Mei L. McDonald J.M. Xiong W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24De Corte V. Demol H. Goethals M. Van Damme J. Gettemans J. Vandekerckhove J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and in vivo (23Wang Q. Xie Y. Du Q.S. Wu X.J. Feng X. Mei L. McDonald J.M. Xiong W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Yuan X. Desiderio D.M. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since both villin and gelsolin are tyrosine-phosphorylated we hypothesize that tyrosine phosphorylation of this family of proteins may abrogate the high Ca2+ requirements for actin severing and may in fact be a molecular mechanism shared by this family of proteins. The reduced calcium affinity of villin may possibly be physiologically relevant, since the intestine is the primary site of calcium absorption, allowing villin to maintain actin bundles not only under physiological calcium concentrations but also at elevated calcium concentrations (less than 100 μm).

Enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 in K562 cells and human cord blood progenitors increases fetal globin gene expression, and in progenitors, reduces β-globin expression. To examine the role of NF-E4 in an in vivo model of hemoglobin switching, we enforced the expression of p22 NF-E4 in transgenic mice carrying the human β-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome. Although murine erythropoiesis and globin gene expression is unaffected in these mice, the expression profile of the human globin genes is altered. All three transgenic lines displayed an increased γ:β-globin ratio in E12.5–14.5 fetal liver, resulting in a delay in the fetal/adult switch. At E12.5, this is primarily due to a reduction of β-gene expression, whereas at E14.5, the increased γ:β ratio is due to enhanced γ-gene expression. Despite this, the switch in globin subtype is fully completed in the adult bone marrow. These findings indicate that p22 NF-E4 is capable of influencing human globin gene expression in vivo but is incapable of overriding the intrinsic mechanisms governing γ-gene silencing in this context.

Expression of the human β-like globin genes (ϵ, Gγ, Aγ, δ, β) is co-ordinately regulated throughout human development under the influence of both local and distal transcriptional control elements. The high level of gene activation observed at each developmental stage is dependent on the presence of key regulatory sequences 6–20 kb upstream of the ϵ-gene (1Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C.

These sequences, characterized by the presence of five DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (5′-HS1–5), are known as the locus control region (LCR) 1The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; SSP, stage selector protein; SSE, stage selector element; EKLF, erythroid Kruppel-like factor; HA, hemagglutinin; CFC, colony-forming cells; E, embryonic day.

A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity sites act cooperatively as a holocomplex that focuses the LCR to a single globin gene at any given time point during ontogeny (8Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the primary role of the LCR is to enhance the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (9Sawado T. Halow J. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the LCR does not provide the temporal specificity of globin gene expression as transgenic mice lacking this region still exhibit appropriate developmental switching (10Starck J. Sarkar R. Romana M. Bhargava A. Scarpa A.L. Tanaka M. Chamberlain J.W. Weissman S.M. Forget B. Blood. 2000; 84: 1656-1665Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly, mice lacking the endogenous LCR retain the normal developmental profile of globin gene expression, albeit at markedly reduced levels (11Bender M.A. Bulger M. Close J. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). From these studies, it is evident that the sequences conferring stage-specific expression reside in the regions immediately flanking the globin genes. Several diverse regulatory mechanisms govern the highly restricted pattern of globin gene expression. These include: the gene order within the locus (12Dillon N. Trimborn T. Strouboulis J. Fraser P.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic mice have emphasized the importance of gene order and promoter competition. Transgenic lines carrying a β-gene in a more proximal position or lines in which an isolated β-gene is linked to the LCR show promiscuous adult globin expression in yolk sac and fetal liver (12Dillon N. Trimborn T. Strouboulis J. Fraser P. Grosveld F. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Behringer R.R. Ryan T.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L.

Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Correct temporal regulation of β-gene expression is restored in lines in which the ϵ- and/or γ-genes are linked more proximally in cis. In contrast, the ϵ- and γ-globin genes are silenced autonomously in transgenic mice, requiring no linked globin gene for correct stage-specific expression (23Dillon N. Grosveld F. Nature. 1991; 350: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Raich N. Enver T. Nakamoto B. Josephson B. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Science. 1990; 250: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The concept of promoter competition for single enhancer elements was first proposed in the chicken globin system (15Choi O.R.B. Engel J.D. Cell. 1988; 55: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The preferential expression of the β-globin gene in this system was mediated by a stage selector element (SSE) in the proximal β-promoter. We defined analogous elements in the human γ-globin promoters that provide these promoters with a competitive advantage over the β-promoter in fetal erythroid cells (25Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The human SSE lies immediately adjacent to the γ-TATA box and binds a fetal/erythroid transcription factor complex known as the stage selector protein (SSP) (17Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 4: 97-105Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The SSP consists of a complex between the ubiquitous transcription factor CP2, and an erythroid-specific partner, p22 NF-E4 (17Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 4: 97-105Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The in vivo role of developmental transcription factors in human globin gene competition is best characterized in studies of EKLF-/- mice transgenic for the human β-globin locus (18Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M.L. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12267-12271Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit a significant increase in the number of transcriptionally active γ-genes in the fetal liver in parallel to the dramatic reduction in β-globin expression. Despite this, the majority of the cells transcribing the γ-genes have only one active locus, suggesting that silencing of the other locus had occurred independently of promoter competition (19Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The SSP is a candidate factor for mediating the preferential expression of the γ-genes in the fetal liver. Deletion of the SSE in mice transgenic for the human β-globin locus results in an increase in the β/γ+β ratio in E12–16 fetal liver. This effect is lost when these lines are crossed with EKLF+/- mice, indicating that a balance of fetal and adult stage-specific factors governs competition between the promoters for the LCR (27Ristaldi M.S. Drabek D. Gribnau J.J. Poddie D. Yannoutsous N. Cao A. Grosveld F. Imam A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further examine the importance of this balance, we have now generated transgenic mice in which the expression of NF-E4 has been enforced in the context of the βYAC. These animals display an increase in the γ/β ratio in E12.5–14.5 fetal liver but still complete the γ/β switch in adult bone marrow. Production and Screening of Transgenic Mice—The NF-E4 transgenic construct was generated with a 600-bp EcoRI fragment containing the coding region of the p22NF-E4 cDNA, 3′ end tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence. The internal ATG codon at position 101 was mutated using PCR, and the final cDNA was sequenced and cloned into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS. The transgenic insert was prepared by cutting the plasmid with HindIII/PvuI and purified from the gel for microinjection. 75 μl of the plasmid at 2 μg/ml was injected into a fertilized egg of C57BL/6 mice and implanted into C57BL/6 recipient mice as described (28Gordon J.W. Ruddle F.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 411-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Tails were clipped at weaning, and genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping. Animals were screened by Southern blotting of PstI-digested DNA using the 0.3-kb PstI/EcoRI p22 NF-E4 fragment as a probe. Founder animals were crossed to C57BL/6 mice to establish transgenic lines. Pups or embryos were tested for the presence of the transgene by Southern blot analysis or PCR analysis of tail or embryo genomic DNA. PCR was performed with NF-E4 sense primer 5′-ACC CGG GAG GGG CTC CGG TCT T-3′ and NF-E4 antisense primer 5′-CCC TTG GCT CAG ATG AAG CGA TGG TAG T-3′. Total cellular RNA was extracted from mouse tissues, including bone marrow, spleen, heart, and kidney, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The expression of NF-E4 was analyzed using Northern blotting, primer extension, and RNase protection analysis. To detect the expression of transgene at protein level, spleen cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA monoclonal antibody and blotted with antisera against NF-E4. Detection of the immunoprecipitated proteins was achieved using the ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Globin Production in Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice carrying a βYAC have been described previously (29Gaensler K.M.L. Kitamura M. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11381-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Genotyping of βYAC transgenic mice was carried out by PCR performed with γ-globin sense primer 5′-AAG CTC CTA GTC CAG ACG CCA-3′ and γ-globin antisense primer 5′-GGC CAC TCC AGT CAC CAT CTT-3′. To study the effects of NF-E4 on globin gene expression, staged pregnancies were interrupted at days 10.5, 12.5, 14.5, and 16.5 of development. Samples from blood and yolk sac from embryos at day 10.5 and liver from fetuses at days 12.5, 14.5, and 16.5 were collected. Total cellular RNA was extracted from 10.5-day embryo yolk sac, 12.5-, 14.5-, and 16.5-day fetal livers, adult bone marrow, and spleen using TRIZOL reagent. Primer extensions and RPA were performed as described (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.84Google Scholar). Primers used were human γ, 5′-CCAGCATCTTCCACATTCACC-3′; human β, 5′-AGACGGCAATGACGGGACACC-3′; mouse α, 5′-CAGGCAGCCTTGATGTTGCTT-3′; mouse βmaj, 5′-TGATGTCTGTTTCTGGGGTTGTG-3′; mouse βh1, 5′-ATAGCTGCCTTCTTCCTCAGCT-3′. Probes used were as described previously (31Morley B.J. Abbott C.A. Wood W.G. Blood. 1991; 78: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extract Preparation and Western Analysis—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam as described previously (32Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 182: 194-203Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, nuclear extract or fetal liver whole cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 12% gel. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, the samples were immunoblotted with specific antiserum and developed with ECL. Semisolid Culture of Fetal Liver CFCs—Cultures were performed as described by Metcalf (33Metcalf D. Heamtopoietic Colony-Stimulating Factors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984Google Scholar) and enumerated in situ using a dissection microscope after staining for hemoglobinized erythroid colonies with 2,7-diaminofluorene. Generation of Transgenic Lines Expressing Human NF-E4—To examine the role of NF-E4 in hemoglobin switching in an in vivo model, we initially generated transgenic mouse lines in which the expression of NF-E4 was driven off the β-spectrin promoter to confine expression to the erythroid compartment at all developmental stages (34Gallagher P.G. Sabatino D.E. Romana M. Cline A.P. Garrett L.J. Bodine D.M. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6062-6073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, despite deriving numerous transgenic lines, we were unable to identify a single line in which a significant increase in NF-E4 expression was observed (data not shown). We therefore turned to the pCAGGS system (containing the chicken β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer, β-actin intron, and rabbit globin polyadenylation signal) that has been widely used in the generation of transgenic lines. These regulatory elements drive high level expression of linked genes in virtually all tissues throughout development (35Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). The NF-E4 cDNA initiates at a non-AUG codon and contains a single methionine at codon 101 that is the predicted initiation codon for a shorter 14-kDa isoform, observed in K562 cells, fetal liver, and bone marrow (26Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We inserted the NF-E4 cDNA tagged at the 3′ end with the HA epitope and containing a mutation of methionine at codon 101 into our vector construct (Fig. 1A). Five independent lines were generated using this construct, and NF-E4 RNA expression was observed in a variety of organs in four of these lines (4Vanin E.F. Henthorn P.S. Kioussis D. Grosveld F. Smithies O. Cell. 1983; 35: 701-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6062-6073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Expression of NF-E4 was noted to be low in the bone marrow and spleen of line 26. To confirm expression of the transgene at protein level, whole cell lysates from splenocytes were obtained from all lines and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antisera and blotted with anti-NF-E4 antisera (Fig. 1C). In accordance with our RNA data, p22 NF-E4-HA protein expression was readily detected in lines 4, 33, and 34. No expression was detected in line 5, and low levels were detected in line 26, so these lines were not studied further. To examine the expression of the transgene during erythroid development, we obtained RNA from yolk sac (E10.5), fetal liver (E12.5–16.5), and adult bone marrow from line 33 and control wild-type littermates and performed RNase protection using an NF-E4 probe (Fig. 1D). Abundant message was present at all stages of erythroid development in the transgenic mice. As expected, no signal was detected in the wild-type control mice as no murine homologue of NF-E4 has been identified. Enforced Expression of p22 NF-E4 Does Not Affect Murine Erythropoiesis or Globin Gene Expression—All NF-E4 transgenic mice appeared healthy and were fertile, indicating that enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 outside its normal tissue range had no apparent adverse effects. To ensure that expression of the transgene did perturb erythropoiesis, we initially examined the full blood counts of NF-E4 transgenics and their littermate controls. The hematocrit and reticulocyte counts were identical in the two groups (Fig. 2A), and all other parameters, including the red cell indices, were also identical (data not shown). To extend these studies, we examined the immunophenotypes of erythroid cells from E13.5 fetal livers from NF-E4 transgenics and littermate controls, co-staining for Ter119 and CD71 (Fig. 2B). This combination of cell surface markers can be used to discriminate several stages of erythroid maturation (36Socolovsky M. Nam H. Fleming M.D. Haase V.H. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3261-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The relative and absolute numbers of each erythroid phenotype were indistinguishable between the two groups. To further examine erythropoietic activity in these animals, we performed colony-forming assays on fetal liver cells from NF-E4 transgenic and control E13.5 embryos (Fig. 2C). The frequency and behavior of burst-forming uniterythroid colonies was identical in the two groups, as were myeloid CFCs (granulocyte-CFC, granulocyte-macrophage-CFC, and macrophage-CFC). These results indicate that hematopoiesis was unaffected by the presence of the NF-E4 transgene, and in particular, the mice exhibited no evidence of a stress erythropoiesis response. We next examined the profiles of murine globin gene expression in the transgenic mice and wild-type control littermates (Fig. 2D). We observed a small increase in βh1 expression in E12.5 fetal liver in line 33, but no other change in the level or timing of globin gene expression was observed in the transgenic lines as compared with controls. This finding indicated that enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 did not significantly influence murine erythroid maturation or development. Enforced Expression of p22 NF-E4 Delays the Human γ/β Switch in Transgenic Mice—To determine the effects of enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 on human globin gene expression, we crossed our transgenic lines (lines 4, 33, and 34) with mice homozygous for the β-globin locus on a yeast artificial chromosome (βYAC) (29Gaensler K.M.L. Kitamura M. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11381-11385Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (a kind gift of Dr K. Gaensler). Yolk sac (E10.5), fetal liver (E12.5-E16.5), and adult bone marrow RNA were obtained and analyzed by RNase protection using probes specific for the human γ- and β-globin genes. A murine α-globin probe served as the loading control (Fig. 3, A–C). In the E10.5 yolk sac, in which the γ-genes are highly expressed and the β-gene is silent, increased levels of p22 NF-E4 had no additional effect on γ-gene expression. Although there was some minor variability between the lines, at E12.5–14.5, when the γ- and β-genes are actively competing for the LCR, increased levels of NF-E4 resulted in an increase in the γ/β ratio in all three NF-E4+/βYAC+ transgenic lines (line 33, Fig. 3A; line 4, Fig. 3B; and line 34, Fig. 3C, and summarized in Fig. 4A) as compared with the NF-E4-/βYAC+ littermate controls. The increased γ/β ratio was due to different mechanisms at the respective time points (Fig. 4, B and C). At d12.5, the altered ratio was predominantly due to a decrease in the level of β-gene expression as evidenced by the decrease β/α ratio in fetal liver (Fig. 4C, panel 1). This was most marked in lines 4 and 33, where expression of the β-gene at E12.5 was almost completely absent. Line 34 also displayed a reduction in β-gene expression at this time point, although this line also demonstrated increased γ-gene expression at E12.5. In the E14.5 fetal liver, the increased γ/β ratio was predominantly due to a significant increase in γ-gene expression, as evidenced by the increased γ/α ratio at this time point (Fig. 4B, panel 2). Again, this was most marked in lines 4 and 33 but also present in line 34. Overall, we observed an approximate 6-fold increase in the γ/β ratio at E12.5 and a 4-fold increase at E14.5 (Fig. 4A). These reciprocal changes suggest an NF-E4-induced shift in the competitive balance between the fetal and adult globin genes to favor the fetal genes. Despite this, the γ/β-switch was completed in the adult bone marrow of all NF-E4+/βYAC+ mice.Fig. 4Effect of the NF-E4 transgene on human γ- and β-globin synthesis. Bar diagrams of results from the three transgenic lines studied are shown.

To determine the effect of EKLF dosage on human globin gene expression in the context of enforced expression of NF-E4, we crossed the NF-E4 transgenic mice with EKLF+/- mice (a kind gift of Dr S. Orkin) to obtain EKLF+/-/NF-E4+ mice. These were subsequently crossed with the homozygous βYAC mice and human globin gene expression examined in the d12.5 and d16.5 fetal liver (Fig. 5). Both the presence of the NF-E4 transgene and a dose reduction of EKLF increased the level of fetal globin expression at d12.5 in isolation. The combination of the two resulted a small additional increase in γ-gene expression at this time point. In contrast, loss of one EKLF allele at d16.5 had a more marked effect on γ-gene expression than the NF-E4 transgene, and no additive effect was observed in the context of altered expression of both transcription factors. The SSE has been shown in human cell lines and in transgenic mice to contribute to the preferential expression of the γ-genes when in competition with the β-genes for the enhancer sequences of the LCR (25Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Ristaldi M.S. Drabek D. Gribnau J.J. Poddie D. Yannoutsous N. Cao A. Grosveld F. Imam A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of p22 NF-E4, the erythroid-specific component of the SSP, augments fetal globin expression in the γ-globin producing cell line, K562 (26Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In human cord blood progenitors, in which both γ- and β-genes are expressed, enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 has modest effects on γ-gene output but significantly reduces β-gene expression (26Zhou W.-L. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 in mice transgenic for the human β-globin locus has similar effects to those observed in cord blood, shifting the balance between the γ- and β-globin genes to favor the fetal gene. In the E10.5 yolk sac, in which the γ-genes are highly expressed and the β-gene is silent, p22 NF-E4 appears to have no effect on γ-gene expression. Similarly, at E12.5, when γ-gene expression still predominates, the change in the γ/β ratio was primarily due to a reduction in β-gene expression. In contrast, at E14.5, when γ-gene silencing has commenced, the increased γ/β ratio is predominantly due to elevated levels of γ-gene expression. This suggests that when the two genes are actively competing for the LCR, increased levels of NF-E4 swing the balance further in favor of the fetal genes by maintaining repression of the β-gene. Once the intrinsic processes to silence γ-gene and activate β-gene expression commence, the elevated levels of p22 NF-E4 serve to maintain the active state of the fetal gene rather than repress the adult globin gene. These effects are observed in the absence of any alteration in murine erythropoiesis or globin gene expression, highlighting the specificity of NF-E4 in human fetal globin regulation. Our findings suggest that the predominant role of p22 NF-E4 is to direct the LCR to the γ-promoter in the setting of globin gene competition and to maintain γ-gene expression in the setting of intrinsic silencing. The data obtained from mice carrying a human β-globin mini-locus with a deletion of the SSE support our conclusions (27Ristaldi M.S. Drabek D. Gribnau J.J. Poddie D. Yannoutsous N. Cao A. Grosveld F. Imam A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These animals display no reduction in γ-gene expression prior to the onset of gene competition but then display a significant increase in the β/γ+β ratio in the fetal liver from E12 to E16. These findings also indicate that this region is not a typical promoter element but functions to provide an advantage for the γ-promoter in the setting of gene competition. This is reflected by the reduced number of transcriptional events detected by the primary transcript fluorescence in situ hybridization occurring at the γ-gene versus the β-gene in mice carrying the SSE deletion (27Ristaldi M.S. Drabek D. Gribnau J.J. Poddie D. Yannoutsous N. Cao A. Grosveld F. Imam A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We are currently examining whether enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 also increases the number of active loci using this technique. Our studies provide further insight into the balance that exists between p22 NF-E4 and EKLF in the control of globin gene switching. A reduction in EKLF levels in the context of normal gene competition results in a shift in the balance toward the γ-promoter with prolonged and increased levels of γ-gene expression (18Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M.L. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12267-12271Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Similarly, loss of the SSE shifts the balance away from the γ-promoter toward the adult β-gene (27Ristaldi M.S. Drabek D. Gribnau J.J. Poddie D. Yannoutsous N. Cao A. Grosveld F. Imam A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When EKLF is reduced in this context, the competition again becomes even, and the timing of switching is restored to normal (27Ristaldi M.S. Drabek D. Gribnau J.J. Poddie D. Yannoutsous N. Cao A. Grosveld F. Imam A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5242-5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The increase in the γ/β ratio observed in our transgenic lines implicates p22 NF-E4 in human hemoglobin switching. The change in this ratio is due to both a reduction in β-gene expression and increased levels of γ-gene expression. Our observation that enforced expression of p22 NF-E4 in the setting of reduced levels of EKLF confers no significant additional advantage on the γ-promoter suggests that the two developmental factors, NF-E4 and EKLF, play equally important roles in determining the balance between the γ- and β-globin genes at the time of switching. The concept of a dynamic balance of transcription factors regulating developmental expression of the globin genes is not novel. Studies of the γ-to β-globin switch in the fetal livers of mice transgenic for the β-globin locus YAC by primary transcript in situ hybridization reveal that the LCR flip-flops back and forth between the two genes as the transcription factor milieu changes to favor the adult gene (8Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). More recent data indicate that this occurs through a physical approximation between the LCR and the individual promoters (39Carter D. Chakalova L. Osborne C.S. Dai Y.F. Fraser P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 40Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1453-1465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Presumably, both EKLF and NF-E4 play essential roles in this direct interaction. The mechanism by which this is achieved will provide a cornerstone in our understanding of switching. Finally, the completion of the γ/β switch in the adult bone marrow of the NF-E4+/EKLF+/- mice indicates that p22 NF-E4 and EKLF, although able to influence gene competition, are incapable of completely overriding the globin developmental program. Despite persistently high levels of NF-E4 expression in d16.5 fetal liver in the setting of reduced EKLF dosage, γ-gene expression is virtually silenced at this time point. These findings support the models of competitive silencing of the β-globin gene and autonomous regulation of the γ-genes and indicate that altered levels p22 NF-E4 expression are not responsible for fetal globin gene silencing.

https://openalex.org/W2039451511,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are monogenic disorders of metabolism caused by deficiency of hydrolytic enzymes. In several LSDs, cells of the reticuloendothelial (RE) system are the primary targets of the disease. Exogenous administration of recombinant enzymes overproduced in mammalian cells has proved effective for treating the systemic phenotype in nonneuropathic patients with LSDs. However, for the treatment of diseases with primary involvement of the RE system, the production of the therapeutic enzyme in insect cells could be an alternative and advantageous method because glycoproteins expressed in insect cells carry carbohydrates of the pauci-mannose or core-type. These recombinant enzymes are in principle already poised to be internalized by cells that express mannose receptors, including macrophages. Here, we demonstrate that three baculovirus-expressed enzymes, protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), neuraminidase (Neu1), and beta-glucosidase, were readily taken up and restored lysosomal function in enzyme-deficient mouse macrophages. The capacity of recombinant PPCA and Neu1 to clear the lysosomal storage in target cells was assessed in PPCA-/- mice, a model of galactosialidosis. Intravenously injected PPCA-/- mice efficiently internalized the corrective enzymes in resident macrophages of many organs. In addition, treated mice showed overall clearance of lysosomal storage in the most affected systemic organs, kidney, liver, and spleen. Our results suggest that ERT with baculovirus-expressed enzymes might be an effective treatment for nonneuropathic patients with galactosialidosis and possibly for others with LSDs that primarily involve the RE system."

Mouse CD4+25+ regulatory T cells now are shown to express the same pattern of S1P1 > S1P4 >>other S1P Rs as other CD4 T cells. CD4+25+ T cell suppression of 3H-thymidine uptake and IL-2 generation by CD4+25- T cells stimulated with anti-T cell receptor antibodies without S1P was enhanced significantly by S1P at normal blood and lymph concentrations. These levels of S1P also enhanced IL-10 generation by CD4+25+ T cells by up to threefold compared with that without S1P but decreased IL-10 from CD4+25- T cells. That IL-10 from CD4+25+ T cells incubated with S1P mediates suppressive activity was demonstrated by prevention with neutralizing anti-IL-10 or anti-IL-10 receptor antibodies. Extracellular fluid S1P thus is required for optimal activity of CD4+25+ T cells.

TSEs include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in humans and scrapie in sheep. Diagnosis of TSEs can be accomplished by a variety of tests using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, which identify PrPSc. Several recent studies report additional techniques for the detection of PrPSc involving repeated sonication of PrPC in the presence of PrPSc seed, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (1Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), and the identification of uPrPSc in the urine of TSE-positive animals and humans (2Shaked G.M. Shaked Y.

Early diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of the TSEs are considered to be very important problems that confront the medical community. Solutions to these problems will be advanced by understanding the details of the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and the mechanisms involved in PrPSc accumulation. However, the post-translational modifications involved in the conversion of the host-coded glycoprotein into its pathogenic isoform are poorly understood. Nonenzymatic glycation between reducing sugars and amino groups of proteins, termed the Maillard reaction, produces reversible Schiff bases and Amadori products. These early glycated products undergo further complex and advanced glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation), which elicits irreversible modification, to form heteromorphic and fluorescent derivatives termed AGEs (3Brownlee M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 4Ulrich P. Cerami A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). AGEs can be synthesized in vitro by glycoxidation between reducing sugars, such as glucose (although compounds including glycolaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal are more reactive than glucose in vitro), and proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), RNase, and collagen (5Fu M.X.

Amino groups that are located in the side chains of amino acids, such as lysine and arginine, are primary targets for nonenzymatic glycoxidation with carbohydrates. AGEs have been reported to be associated with pathogenesis in vascular disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, renal failure, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that AGEs may contribute to the progressive deterioration associated with these chronic diseases.

These reports suggested an examination of the possibility that post-translational AGE-mediated modification of protease-resistant pathogenic PrPSc might play a role in protein stabilization and thereby be responsible, in part, for the accumulation of the aberrant protein in the brain. Here we report that in samples taken just prior to the terminal stage of disease one or more lysine residues at position 23, 24, and 27 of PrPSc are covalently modified with AGEs, which may be carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), one of the structural varieties of AGEs. The arginine at position 37 may also be modified with AGE, but not the arginine residue at position 25. These results indicate that nonenzymatic glycation plays a role in the post-translational processing of PrPSc. Animals and Scrapie Strains—Inbred mice (C57BL/6J, MB) and golden Syrian hamsters (SHa), 6 weeks of age, were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Hallym University, and divided into age-matched controls and groups destined to be infected with specific scrapie strains. Dr. Alan Dickinson of the Neuropathogenesis Unit (Edinburgh, Scotland) kindly provided the following scrapie strains: ME7 and 22L, which were passaged in C57BL mice, and 87V, which was passaged in MB mice. The 139A strain obtained from Dr. Richard H. Kimberlin of the Neuropathogenesis Unit (Edinburgh, Scotland) was passaged in C57 BL mice, and the 263K and 139H scrapie strains were passaged in hamsters. All passages were performed by intracerebral inoculation with 30 μl per mouse and 50 μl per hamster of a 1% (w/v) brain homogenate (prepared in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) from either normal brain or from scrapie-infected brain at the terminal stages of the disease). With the exception of the time course study (Fig. 3), 263K scrapie-infected hamsters were harvested at 70 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.), 22L scrapie-infected mice at 152 d.p.i., ME7, 139A, and 139H scrapie-infected animals at 158 d.p.i., and 87V scrapie-infected mice at 287 d.p.i. Animals were sacrificed when clinical signs of the disease were manifested. Animals were anesthetized with 16.5% urethane and then transcardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for brain sections, whereas for the isolation of PrPSc-enriched insoluble fraction, each scrapie brain and age-matched control were frozen without perfusion and stored in –70 °C prior to use. Also, frozen portions of the temporal cortex of normal human and CJD brains and the frontal cortex of vCJD brain were used for isolation of PrPSc-enriched fractions. Preparation of in Vitro AGE Products and Production of Anti-AGE Antibody—AGE-modified BSA (AGE-BSA), lysine-derived AGE (AGE-Lys), arginine-derived AGE (AGE-Arg), and the AGE-modification of PrP peptides (Table I) were prepared as previously described (20Horiuchi S. Araki N. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7329-7332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, BSA, lysine, arginine (Sigma), and PrP peptides were dissolved with d-glucose (Sigma) in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The solution was deoxygenated with nitrogen gas, and sterilized by ultrafiltration (0.45-micron filter, Nalgene), and then incubated at 37 °C for 7, 50, or 90 days, as noted in results. After incubation, the samples except for lysine- and arginine-derived AGE were dialyzed using three changes of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl. The dialyzed samples and the d-glucose-treated lysine and arginine samples were then lyophilized. Rabbits were immunized with AGE-BSA as reported, and R3 anti-AGE antiserum was subsequently collected and purified with affi-gel protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad). Affinity-purified IgG was passed over a column of activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with BSA two times. The non-adsorbed fractions were combined and then passed over a column of AGE-BSA-coupled Sepharose 4B using a modification of a previous report (20Horiuchi S. Araki N. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7329-7332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-AGE IgG bound to AGE-BSA, which comes from what did not bind to BSA, was eluted with 0.1 m citric acid (pH 3.0) and then neutralized with 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). R3 anti-AGE antiserum and anti-AGE IgG purified from antiserum were used in the current study.Table ISequences of synthesized prion peptidesSeq. no.aNumber of peptides.232530354045501KKRPKPGGWNTGGS2KRPKPGGWNTGGSR3RPKPGGWNTGGSRY4PKPGGWNTGGSRYP5KPGGWNTGGSRYPG6PGGWNTGGSRYPGQ7GGWNTGGSRYPGQG8GWNTGGSRYPGQGS9WNTGGSRYPGQGSP10NTGGSRYPGQGSPG11TGGSRYPGQGSPGG12GGSRYPGQGSPGGN13GSRYPGQGSPGGNR14SRYPGQGSPGGNRY15RYPGQGSPGGNRYPa Number of peptides. Open table in a new tab Isolation of PrPSc-enriched Insoluble Fraction—PrPSc-enriched insoluble fraction was isolated as previously described (21Bossers A. Belt P.B.G.M. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. De Vries R. Smits M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4931-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, each normal and TSE brain was homogenized in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4), and then rehomogenized in TBS (pH 7.4) containing 20% N-lauroyl sarcosine (Sigma) and then centrifuged. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged and the resulting pellet resuspended in TBS (pH 7.4) containing 10% NaCl and 0.1% myristyl sulfobetaine (SB3-14) prior to treatment with or without proteinase K (PK) (Sigma). After the sample was ultracentrifuged again, it was resuspended with TBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% SB3-14. The supernatant of normal brain preparation after ultracentrifugation was used as the PrPC-containing fraction. Total proteins were quantified by the modified Lowry method (22Lowry O.H. Roseborough N.J. Farr L.A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot, Peptide N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) Treatment, and Competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—For Western blot, samples of equal protein concentration of PrPC-containing fraction, PrPSc-enriched insoluble fraction, PK (25 μg/insoluble fraction extracted from 1-g tissues, 2 h at 37 °C)-treated fraction, and PNGase F-treated fraction were separated with 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with either R3 anti-AGE antiserum (1:4,000) preincubated with BSA or AGE-BSA, 6D12 anti-AGE IgG (0.2 μg), and anti-PrP antibodies (3F4; 1:20,000 or 78295; 1:5,000) in blocking solution (blocked with TBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween-20). Each membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase. After blotting shown in Fig. 1, A, C, and E, each membrane was stripped with buffer (2 ml of 10% SDS, 420 μlof1.5 m Tris (pH 6.7), 70 μl of mercaptoethanol, 7.5 ml of triple-distilled H2O). Next, membranes were blocked with blocking solution and incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase and developed with SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce). These processes demonstrate both complete stripping and exclusion of endogenous peroxidase activity. Thereafter, membranes were reprobed with monoclonal 3F4 anti-PrP antibody (Fig. 1B) or polyclonal 78295 anti-PrP antibody (Fig. 1, D and F). For PNGase F analysis, 100 μg of total protein of the insoluble fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer. After heating for 10 min at 94 °C, it was supplemented with 5 units of PNGase F (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 36 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. For competitive ELISA, each well was coated with total proteins (30 μg) of denatured PrPSc-enriched insoluble fraction of 263K scrapie-infected brain and blocked with 1% BSA in TBS. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20, AGE competitors including AGE-modified amino acids or AGE-modified PrP peptides were added to each well followed by R3 anti-AGE antiserum. Immunoprecipitation—For the immunoprecipitation assay, PrPC-containing fractions, and PrPSc-enriched insoluble fractions of 263K or 139H scrapie-infected and PNGase F-treated 263K-infected brains were boiled to unblock epitopes and were then immunoprecipitated with either R3 anti-AGE antibody, 6D12 anti-AGE antibody, or 3F4 anti-PrP antibody (each antibody was first coated to the surface of tosyl-activated magnetic Dynabeads M-280 (Dynal Biotech) according to a procedure described by the manufacturer). The complexes were washed several times with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) using a magnet (Dynal MPC, Dynal Biotech). Complexes were subsequently eluted by boiling in the presence of sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation studies, supernatants (30 μg of protein) containing PrPC prepared from normal hamster brain and insoluble fraction (2 μg of protein) enriched with PrPSc from 263K or 139H scrapie-infected brains were used as the positive controls. Ascorbate Autoxidation—Metals present in the buffers used in this study have the potential to induce peroxidase activity in PrPSc and thereby yield false positives on Western blots. Ascorbate oxidation experiments were performed to assess the level of contaminating metals in the buffers used in these experiments. For this test, 0.1 m ascorbate stock solution was prepared using reagent grade ascorbic acid (Sigma) and deionized high purity water (Bio-Rad). 3.75 μl of 0.1 m ascorbate stock solution was added to a total volume of 3.0 ml of each solution to be tested (23Buettner G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The levels of ascorbate autoxidation are shown by the percentage loss of absorbance at 15 min compared with the determination of initial absorbance at 265 nm. Immunohistochemistry—Following perfusion, brains were immediately removed, cut into blocks, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS, dehydrated with ethanol, and then embedded in paraffin (Oxford). Coronal sections of the brains (6-μm thick) were cut with a microtome. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using the ABC kit (Vector) by a modification of the avidin biotin-peroxidase method. Briefly, sections of the brains were deparaffinized with xylene, hydrated with graded ethanol, and then treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methyl alcohol to block endogenous peroxidase. The sections were treated with PK (10 μg/ml, 10 min) to remove PrPC, exposed to 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h, and then incubated with one of the following: R3 anti-AGE antiserum (1:500), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:800, Jackson Laboratories), anti-PrP antibody (3F4 or 78295); and incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C. The sections were sequentially treated with biotinylated anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse) immunoglobulin followed by addition of the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex, developed with diaminobenzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution (0.003% 3,3-diaminobenzidine and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 m Tris buffer), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Antibodies—Two different anti-AGE antibodies were used in this study: 1) rabbit polyclonal anti-AGE antibody against AGE-BSA, which was produced in this study (R3); and 2) mouse monoclonal anti-AGE antibody raised against AGE-BSA (6D12, TransGenic Inc.), which has been selected as AGE-HSA-positive and BSA-negative and is termed CML-positive (20Horiuchi S. Araki N. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7329-7332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shibayama R. Araki N. Nagai R. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Two different anti-PrP antibodies were used; mouse monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (3F4) (25Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal anti-PrP antibody (78295) (26Kascsak R.J. Fersko R. Pulgiano D. Rubenstein R. Carp R.I. Immunol. Investig. 1997; 26: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-GFAP antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was used for GFAP in immunohistochemistry. AGE-modified Proteins Accumulate in TSE Brains—We hypothesized that the long lasting PrPSc molecules would be the most likely material to assay for nonenzymatic glycation in the brains of TSE-infected animals. The anti-AGE-BSA antiserum was pre-adsorbed with BSA to ensure specific staining of AGE-modified protein. R3 anti-AGE antiserum raised against many different types of AGE epitopes reveals that AGE-modified proteins are at a high concentration in 263K and 139H scrapie-infected brains but not in controls (Fig. 1A). After stripping the membrane of R3 anti-AGE antibodies, PrPSc was detected with PrPSc-specific antibody, and these bands were identical to those seen with the AGE-antibody immunostaining (Fig. 1B). Following PK digestion, which removes ∼90 amino acids from the N terminus of PrPSc, there was no detectable R3 anti-AGE antibody immunostaining (Fig. 1, A and B). AGE-modified proteins were also detected in mouse brains infected with the 139A, ME7, 22L, and 87V scrapie strains, and in the brains of CJD and vCJD patients; but in each case reactivity disappeared after PK digestion (Figs. 1, C and E, and 2A). However, PK-resistant prion isoforms were detected after PK digestion (Fig. 1, D and F). As indicated from the results with normal brain material, the presence of soluble PrPC does not contribute to the results obtained for the insoluble fraction found in TSE brains (Figs. 1 and 2A). In the vCJD preparation, the lightly stained band with the lowest molecular mass (Fig 2A, lane 5) probably represents a small fragment of one of the PrPSc isoforms that has been modified with AGE. Preimmune serum did not detect AGE-modified proteins in PrPSc-enriched fractions nor did anti-AGE antiserum that had been preabsorbed with AGE-modified BSA. In contrast, preincubation of anti-AGE antiserum with BSA that had not been AGE-modified did not reduce AGE immunostaining to yield the same as Fig. 1, A, C, and E (data not shown). In addition, AGE-modified proteins were detected with 6D12 anti-AGE antibody in 263K-infected brain; there was minimal staining of an unknown protein with molecular mass of ∼32 kDa in the brains of normal hamsters (Fig. 2B, lane 1). There were no immunoprecipitates obtained from control brain preparation supernatants containing soluble PrPC (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that AGE-modified proteins accumulated only in TSE brains and are composed of protease-resistant PrPSc. PrPSc, but Not PrPC, Is Modified with AGE—Immunoprecipitation assays support the finding that PrPSc is nonenzymatically glycated in brain, but PrPC is not glycated (Fig. 2, C–F). AGE-modified proteins were immunoprecipitated from 263K and 139H scrapie-infected brains, and then detected with 3F4 anti-PrP antibody (Fig. 2C). Conversely, prion isoforms were immunoprecipitated with 3F4 antibody and then detected with R3 anti-AGE antibody (Fig. 2D). Soluble PrPC in the supernatant, however, was not immunoprecipitated, indicating that PrPC is not modified with AGE (Fig. 2E). PNGase F was used to treat the insoluble fraction to remove one or both N-glycans of prion isoforms and then immunoprecipitated with 6D12 anti-AGE IgG. Deglycosylated isoform of AGE-modified prion proteins was detected with R3 anti-AGE antibody (Fig. 2F, lane 1 and 2). Moreover, three AGE-modified prion isoforms were found in PNGase F-untreated insoluble fractions after immunoprecipitation with 6D12 anti-AGE IgG (Fig. 2F, lane 3), although 6D12 does not immunoreact with the nonglycosylated isoform in Western blot (Fig. 2B, lane 2). This indicates greater sensitivity of immunoprecipitation compared with Western analysis. Disease-associated Prion Is Modified with AGE at the Late Stage of Disease—PrPSc was detected at an early stage of disease in 263K-infected hamsters, even at 10 d.p.i., and then its accumulation increased throughout the clinical course of the disease. AGE modification of PrPSc was not detected until ∼50 d.p.i. (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that AGE modification occurs postconversion of PrP into the PrPSc conformation; however, it should be kept in mind that this result could be a function of the relative sensitivities of the antibodies, rather than a reflection of the timing of events. The issue of possible nonspecific endogenous peroxidase activity yielding false positive staining was of some concern. In fact, using the ascorbate test for catalytic metals (Buettner, Ref. 23Buettner G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that could bind to PrPSc and thereby produce endogenous peroxidase activity, we found that several buffers (0.1 m and 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, TBS, TBS containing 20% N-lauroyl sarcosine, TBS containing 10% NaCl and 0.1% SB3-14, and TBS containing 0.1% SB3-14) contained catalytic metals. Those buffers that included SB3-14 were free of metals (Table II). To rule out the potential that AGE-modified PrPSc possesses endogenous peroxidase activity, a membrane was developed with SuperSignal West Pico including peroxide and enhancer solution without incubation with antibody. This blot showed that AGE-modified PrPSc did not possess endogenous peroxidase activity (Fig. 2B, 4 lanes on right portion of blot). Furthermore, in Fig. 3B, PrPSc is present at 40 d.p.i., but this sample does not reveal positive staining in the anti-AGE blot (Fig. 3A), indicating that PrPSc does not have endogenous peroxidase activity. Thus, despite the presence of contaminating metals in some of the buffers used in these studies (Table II), there was no evidence that the PrPSc assayed by Western blots contained endogenous peroxidase activity.Table IIAscorbate autoxidation testSolutionsDeionized pure waterAaSolution A: 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer.BbSolution B: 500 mm sodium phosphate buffer.CcSolution C: TBS, pH 7.4.DdSolution D: TBS, pH 7.4 containing 20% N-lauroyl sarcosine.EeSolution E: TBS, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% SB3-14.FfSolution F: TBS, pH 7.4 containing 10% NaCl and 0.1% SB3-14.% Loss of A72.6 ± 2.451.9 ± 3.249.2 ± 2.937.1 ± 3.624.3 ± 3.895.6 ± 2.297.7 ± 1.4a Solution A: 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer.b Solution B: 500 mm sodium phosphate buffer.c Solution C: TBS, pH 7.4.d Solution D: TBS, pH 7.4 containing 20% N-lauroyl sarcosine.e Solution E: TBS, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% SB3-14.f Solution F: TBS, pH 7.4 containing 10% NaCl and 0.1% SB3-14. Open table in a new tab Characteristics of AGE Modification of PrPSc—There are several key points with regard to the appearance patterns of AGE-modified PrPSc. First, in 263K- and 139H-infected hamsters, AGE-mediated modification occurs most often in diglycosylated PrPSc and least often in nonglycosylated PrPSc. In contrast, AGE modification is distributed differently in most scrapie strain-mouse strain combinations (Fig. 1, A and C and 22L in E, G, and H). In the 87V-infected brain, for example, only diglycosylated PrPSc appears to be modified with AGEs (Fig. 1, E and H). It is possible that the differences in AGE modifications of PrPSc are a function of the TSE strain host combination (27Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 28Pan T. Colucci M. Wong B.S. Li R. Liu T. Petersen R.B. Chen S. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37284-37288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Second, identification of AGE modification of nonglycosylated PrPSc indicates that the epitopes are not N-glycans but AGE products of nonenzymatic glycation of the protein component of PrPSc (Fig. 1, A and C and 22L in E). This result is supported by PNGase F analysis (Fig. 2F, lanes 1 and 2). Nonenzymatic AGE Modification of PrPSc Occurs at the N-terminal Lys Residue and May Be at Arg37—We speculated that the AGE epitope(s) is within the residues 23–89 of prion protein, because it was not detected in PK-digested fractions (Fig. 1). In order to map the epitope(s) involved in AGE-modified PrPSc, we nonenzymatically glycated PrP peptides occurring at the N terminus, specifically PrP peptide 23–36 and PrP peptide 37–50, incubated for 50 days. As shown in Fig. 4A, in vitro glycoxidation produces R3-positive AGE-mediated modification of BSA molecules (Fig. 4A, lane 1) and PrP peptide 23–36 molecules (Fig. 4A, lane 3) following AGE modification, but does not yield R3-positive AGE-PrP peptide 37–50 after incubation for 50 days. Both AGE-PrP peptide 23–36 and AGE-BSA are capable of competing with AGE-modified PrPSc as shown by competitive ELISA (Fig. 4B), whereas AGE-PrP peptide 37–50 incubated for 50 days is not. These results indicate that the extreme N terminus of PrPSc can be post-translationally modified through AGE-mediated modification and suggest that AGEs formed from PrP peptide 23–36 are the nonenzymatically glycated component in PrPSc found in"
https://openalex.org/W2028948231,"The geminin protein is a critical regulator of DNA replication. It functions to control replication fidelity by blocking the assembly of prereplication complexes in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Geminin protein levels, which are low in G0/G1 and increase at the G1/S transition, are controlled through coordinate transcriptional and proteolytic regulation. Here we show that geminin is regulated transcriptionally by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB)/E2F pathway. Initially, we observed that the activation of RB led to the repression of geminin transcription. Conversely, Rb-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts have enhanced the expression of geminin relative to wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Similarly, an acute loss of Rb in mouse adult fibroblasts deregulated geminin RNA and protein levels. To delineate the responsible regulatory motifs, luciferase reporter constructs containing fragments of the geminin promoter were generated. An analysis of the critical regulatory cis-acting elements in the geminin promoter indicated that intragenic E2F sites down-stream of the first exon were responsible for RB-mediated repression of geminin. The direct analysis of the endogenous geminin promoter revealed that these intragenic E2F sites are occupied by E2F proteins, and the mutation of these sites eliminates responsiveness to RB. Together, these data link the expression of geminin to the RB/E2F pathway and represent the first promoter analysis of this important regulator of DNA replication.

Together, these data link the expression of geminin to the RB/E2F pathway and represent the first promoter analysis of this important regulator of DNA replication. Geminin was identified originally as a protein that is degraded by mitotic Xenopus egg extracts, but not by interphase extracts (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), and concurrently during a screen to identify proteins that affect Xenopus development (2Kroll K.L. Salic A.N. Evans L.M. Kirschner M.W. Development. 1998; 125: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Geminin is a small (25 kDa) protein expressed during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle but degraded in M phase at the metaphase/anaphase transition via the anaphase-promoting complex-mediated ubiquitination (3McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Bastians H. Topper L.M. Gorbsky G.L. Ruderman J.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3927-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Functional analyses demonstrated that geminin acts to prevent the relicensing of replication origins after they have fired once. This is accomplished by binding to CDT1 (5Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), a requisite factor for loading MCMs 1The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; RB, the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PSM, phosphorylation-site mutant; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; CDK4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4; Gmnn, geminin; dox, doxycycline; TraFac, transcription factor binding site comparison.1The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; RB, the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PSM, phosphorylation-site mutant; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; CDK4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4; Gmnn, geminin; dox, doxycycline; TraFac, transcription factor binding site comparison. into the prereplication complex. Beginning at the G1/S transition, geminin protein levels accumulate and become sufficient to inhibit CDT1 activity. As soon as the origins of replication have fired once in the S phase, this inhibition of CDT1 prevents the reloading of MCMs onto chromatin until the completion of mitosis when geminin is degraded. Although the levels of geminin mRNA have been shown to increase 2–3-fold at the G1/S transition (6Kulartz M. Kreitz S. Hiller E. Damoc E.C. Przybylski M. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mechanism of this transcriptional regulation remains to be elucidated. RB has several emerging roles in the control of diverse processes outside of the G1/S transition. These include DNA repair, cell death, and DNA replication (7Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 8Zheng L. Lee W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Lipinski M.M. Jacks T.

In the case of DNA replication, the activation of the RB pathway results in the repression of numerous target genes. Classically, this repression is achieved through assembling repressor complexes at the E2F family of transcription factor binding sites (11Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). For example, the known targets of RB-mediated repression include several genes that encode components of the MCM complex, which are required for the initiation of DNA synthesis (14Ishida S. Huang E.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6587-6597PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase α and PCNA, both required for DNA replication to proceed, also are repressed via the activation of RB (14Ishida S. Huang E.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6587-6597PubMed Google Scholar). As the noted replication factors all stimulate DNA replication, their negative regulation is consistent with the action of RB in the inhibition of the S phase. However, in a recent microarray screen, we identified geminin as a putative target for RB-mediated repression. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the classical cell cycle inhibitory role of RB. If geminin in fact is repressed via RB, this would represent a novel function because it would indicate that RB plays an important role not only in inhibiting replication but also in enabling replication to commence. In this study, we observed the repression of endogenous geminin by active RB as well as deregulation of geminin expression with a loss of RB signaling. A comparison of the geminin genes in mouse and rat revealed conserved E2F sites. We cloned the geminin promoter and identified critical regulatory elements. An analysis of the cis-acting elements by reporter assays showed that the geminin promoter is repressed via active RB functioning through intragenic E2F sites. Cell Lines and Culture—The Rat-16, A2-4, and A5-1 cell lines were derived and cultured as described previously (17Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A2-4 and A5-1 express a phosphorylation site mutant (PSM) of the RB large pocket domain, PSM-RB, in a tetracycline-off-inducible manner. PSM-RB is unable to be phosphorylated by CDK/cyclin activity and is active constitutively. Twenty-four hours prior to harvest, these cultures were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline to remove doxycycline (dox) from the medium. The S phase synchronization was performed by culture in aphidicolin as described previously (17Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Rb exon 3loxP/loxP mice were obtained from Dr. Tyler Jacks and have been described previously (18Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Mouse adult fibroblasts isolated were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine (200 μg/ml), penicillin, and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Rb+/+ and Rb–/– mice were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, glutamine (200 μg/ml), penicillin, and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Adenoviral Infections—Cells were infected with p16INK4A- or GFP-encoding adenovirus as described previously (16Markey M.P. Angus S.P. Strobeck M.W. Williams S.L. Gunawardena R.W. Aronow B.J. Knudsen E.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6587-6597PubMed Google Scholar). Adenovirus encoding cre-recombinase was obtained from the University of Iowa Vector Core. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA harvested from cell cultures was utilized for microarray studies as described previously using Affymetrix Genechips U34A, B, and C (rat cell lines) or U74Av2 (mouse primary cells). RNA was harvested from Rb exon 3loxP/loxP mouse adult fibroblasts using TRIzol (Invitrogen) at 72 and 144 h post-infection with an adenovirus-encoding cre-recombinase. RNA was harvested from passage 3 MEFs using TRIzol and following the manufacturer's suggested protocols. RNA was isolated from Rb+/+ and Rb–/– MEFs after 24 h in the presence or absence of dox using TRIzol. Hybridizations were carried out up to three times for each condition and each cell line. The results from each chip were analyzed using Microarray Suite (Affymetrix) and GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics). Prior to the analysis, samples were verified for the induction of active RB (in the rat cell lines) or knock-out of Rb (in the Rb exon 3loxP/loxP mouse fibroblasts) and RNA quality was evaluated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was carried out using standard biochemical techniques. Equal total protein from cell lysates was loaded in each lane. Loading was verified by comparing to napthal black staining and CDK4 protein levels. Antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology against geminin (FL-209) and CDK4 (H-22). The RB antibody was a gift from Dr. Jean Wang. RT-PCR—RNA was harvested from A5-1 cell cultures using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's suggested protocols. Superscript RT (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of total RNA were used to generate cDNAs using random hexamer primers. PCR was carried out using the following primers: 5′-CCA TCG GAA GAG GAA GAC AC-3′ and 5′-GAA GTG GCT GAG CAC GTA CA-3′ (for rat Gmnn) and 5′-GGT CAT CAA TGG GAA ACC CAT CAC-3′ and 5′-AGT ACT GGT GTC AGG TAC GGT AGT-3′ (for glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Analysis of Promoter Regions and Identification of E2F Sites—The genomic sequences for geminin were obtained from the NCBI data base. The sequences flanking NM_020567 in mouse, XM_214477 in rat, and NM_015895 in human were used for these studies. TraFaC (transcription factor binding site comparison) (19Jegga A.G. Sherwood S.P. Carman J.W. Pinski A.T. Phillips J.L. Pestian J.P. Aronow B.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1408-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used to identify the transcriptional start sites, intron/exon boundaries, and E2F binding sites. Binding sites were determined based on the TRANSFAC (20Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar) data base, version 6.0. Position weight matrices M00050 and M00024 were used, but only M00050 sites were found to be conserved in the regions we examined. 91 transcription factor binding sites were found to be conserved in parallel between mouse and rat within this region; however, the non-E2F binding sequences are not shown here for clarity. TraFaC also was used to compare and align the E2F promoter sequences into the image shown in Fig. 4D. Cloning of the Geminin Promoter and Construction of Luciferase Reporter Constructs—Mouse genomic DNA was isolated from adult fibroblasts by phenol-chloroform extraction. The following primers were used to generate constructs containing pieces of the geminin promoter region: mGmnn (–520 to 44), 5′-AAA ATT CCT CAG CTT CAA CTT TTT-3′ and 5′-AGA CAG CAA TGC TCA GTT CC-3′; mGmnn (1160 to 1696, 5′-ATT CTG GTT CTC TGC CCA GC-3′ and 5′-TTC ACA TTC TCT TGG GCT CC-3′; mGmnn (871 to 1696), 5′-TAG GAT TAA AGG CGT GTG CC-3′ and 5′-TTC ACA TTC TCT TGG GCT CC-3′; mGmnn (181 to 1696), 5′-AGT CTG GGG ACT TGA AAG GG-3′ and 5′-TTC ACA TTC TCT TGG GCT CC-3′; mGmnn (–521 to 1696), 5′-TGC TTC CTT TAG TGT GTG CG-3′ and 5′-TTC ACA TTC TCT TGG GCT CC-3′; and rat Gmnn (–159 to 1328), 5′-CAA GAG GAG CCC TAG TGA CC-3′ and 5′-TAC TTT TTG GTA GAA CCA CTA TCT GTT-3′. TA cloning for each fragment was carried out using the Invitrogen TA cloning kit and the manufacturer's suggested protocols. Promoter fragments then were subcloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pGL2-Basic (Promega), such that the cloned promoter fragment drives the expression of the firefly luciferase gene. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Mutagenesis of E2F sites was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The primers employed were as follows: 5′-GGT GAG GTC GGT TTT GGa tCG CTC TGG TGT TCG C-3′ and 5′-GCG AAC ACC AGA GCG atC CAA AAC CGA CCT CAC C-3′; 5′-GTT TTG TTT TGT TTT TGG atA TCG GGT TTT ATT AAC TTG-3′ and 5′-CAA GTT AAT AAA ACC CGA Tat CCA AAA ACA AAA CAA AAC-3′; and 5′-CGA CAT CTT GGT TGG Aat CAA AAG ATC TTG GGT TTT G-3′ and 5′-CAA AAC CCA AGA TCT TTT Gat TCC AAC CAA GAT GTC G-3′. All of the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Transfections were carried out using calcium phosphate. Doxycycline and calcium phosphate were washed from the medium 16 h after transfection, and the cells then were allowed to grow in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 24 h before harvesting. Reporter vectors and cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase were cotransfected into A5-1 cells and then grown in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 24 h. To look at the activation of the reporter constructs during cell cycle progression (Fig. 5E), transfections were carried out in Rat1 cells. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured for each sample, and luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase levels to control for transfection efficiency. Normalized activity for each reporter was set to 1 for the +doxycycline condition, and the –doxycycline condition is relative to this condition. Error bars represent the mean ± S.E. between the samples. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) was carried out as described previously (21Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (22Siddiqui H. Solomon D.A. Gunawardena R.W. Wang Y. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7719-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A5-1 cells were cultured in 15-cm cultures plates in the presence of dox. Chromatin isolated from ∼107 cells was incubated with 1 μg of E2F4 (sc-1082X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Dbf-4 (sc-11354, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Promoter regions of geminin then were amplified using the following primer pairs: rat Gmnn (+1218), 5′-CTT GGT TGG AGC CAA AAG AT-3′ and 5′-TAC AAT GGC ATG GTG TCC TG-3′; rat Gmnn (+1057), 5′-TTT CTT CTG CTT CCC TGC TG-3′ and 5′-ATG CTA CAT GGC CAA GAT CC-3′; rat Gmnn (+708), 5′-CAA GTC TTG GGT CTG GTG GT-3′ and 5′-CCC AGG CAG TGT GGT TTC TA-3′; rat Gmnn (+324), 5′-GTG GAG GCG AGG ATA TGA AG-3′ and 5′-AAT TCA ATC CCA GCC AAG C-3′; rat Gmnn (+12), 5′-CAA GAG GAG CCC TAG TGA CC-3′ and 5′-CTC GGA CTC ACA GAC AGC AG-3′; and rat Gmnn (–272), 5′-AAT GCG TGT GAA CCT GTA CG-3′ and 5′-CGG TGC GTG TAT CTG AAA GA-3′. PCR was performed with 30 cycles in a 50-μl volume containing 3 μl of purified DNA, 50 ng of each primer set, 0.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), and 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. PCR parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 45 s; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s; 49.5 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 20 s; and a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Geminin Is Repressed Transcriptionally by RB Activation—We have developed cells lines that inducibly express specific Rb alleles under the regulation of tetracycline (17Sever-Chroneos Z. Angus S.P. Fribourg A.F. Wan H. Todorov I. Knudsen K.E. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4032-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the A5-1 and A2-4 cell lines express PSM-RB when the tetracycline analog dox is removed from the medium. This allele is constitutively active and is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and transcriptional repression. Microarray analyses showed that geminin was a target of RB-mediated RNA attenuation (Fig. 1B). Similar repression was observed when the RB pathway was activated through the expression of p16INK4A, which leads to the dephosphorylation/activation of the endogenous RB (data not shown). To verify the results of the microarray, we used the RT-PCR analysis. Specifically, A5-1 cells were grown in the presence or absence of dox for up to 24 h. Recovered RNAs were reverse-transcribed and amplified for geminin or glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control. Under these conditions, the induction of PSM-RB lead to the attenuation of geminin RNA levels with rapid kinetics (Fig. 1C). If the effect of RB on geminin is of functional significance, the protein levels also should be attenuated. By immunoblot analysis, no change in the geminin expression was observed in the parental Rat-16 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2) but geminin protein levels were attenuated in the presence of PSM-RB in A5-1 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, the ectopic expression of p16INK4A resulted in significant attenuation of geminin protein levels (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the activation of the RB pathway either through constitutively active alleles of RB or the action of p16INK4A resulted in the attenuation of geminin RNA and protein levels. In principal, the attenuation of geminin could be attributed to indirect effects of RB on cell cycle position. To eliminate changes in cell cycle position, A5-1 cells were synchronized and held in the S phase with the DNA-polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. Microarray analysis and immunoblotting then were repeated. Under these conditions, we observed the attenuation of geminin RNA (Fig. 2A). Additionally, geminin protein levels also were attenuated (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the influence of RB upon geminin is not through indirect changes in cell cycle distribution. Geminin Is Deregulated upon Loss of RB—Because we observed that geminin is repressed by RB, it would be expected that the loss of RB would lead to the deregulation of geminin expression. To carry out this analysis, we initially utilized MEFs harboring wild type or homozygously inactivated Rb.By microarray analyses, we observed a rather modest increase in geminin RNA levels in those cells deficient in RB (Fig. 3A, 1.6-fold change; p = 0.01). However, protein levels were significantly higher in the Rb–/– MEFs relative to their wild type counterparts (Fig. 3C). Recently, it has become clear that compensation can develop in cells lacking RB (18Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar); therefore, we exploited a model to acutely knock out Rb. Murine adult fibroblasts were isolated from mice with Rb exon 3 flanked by loxP sites. In culture, Rb can be ablated efficiently from these cells through the use of cre-recombinase delivered by recombinant adenoviruses. When compared with cells infected with GFP-encoding adenovirus as a control, we observed that geminin RNA levels were induced in concert with the knock-out of Rb (Fig. 3B). Immunoblotting in this system also revealed elevated geminin protein levels following cre-infection (Fig. 3D). Thus, RB is required to maintain appropriate levels of geminin. The Geminin Promoter Contains Several Conserved E2F Sites—As RB is known to function as a transcriptional repressor, we sought to determine how geminin RNA levels are modulated by RB. RB is known to exert transcriptional repression via E2F DNA binding elements. Initially, we focused on the canonical promoter region upstream of the transcriptional start site (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Kroll K.L. Salic A.N. Evans L.M. Kirschner M.W. Development. 1998; 125: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, we cloned 520 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site to 44 base pairs downstream to generate a luciferase reporter construct. This fragment contained a putative E2F site at –306 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4A). The reporter was transfected into A5-1 cells that were then grown in the presence or absence of dox for 24 h. Repression by active RB was measured as the change in relative luciferase activity in the absence of doxycycline. Surprisingly, although this construct harbored significant luciferase activity, it was not repressed by active RB (Fig. 4B). To extend our analysis for E2F-regulatory elements, we used the TraFaC program (trafac.chmcc.org) (19Jegga A.G. Sherwood S.P. Carman J.W. Pinski A.T. Phillips J.L. Pestian J.P. Aronow B.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1408-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to search for additional E2F motifs within the murine geminin genomic sequence. This analysis identified four E2F sites that were clustered around the first exon (Fig. 4, C and D). Many other putative binding sites for other transcription factors also were identified (data not shown), because the control of any given promoter is ultimately very complex. Because of our observations that RB is affecting geminin expression and because of the canonical role of E2F in RB-mediated repression, we have focused this analysis on E2F binding sites. TraFaC alignment of the genomic regions ∼1 kb upstream and downstream of the first exon in mouse, rat, and human showed that the E2F sites identified in mouse corresponded to similar sites in rat (Fig. 4C) and in human (data not shown). A compositional similarity between species for the presence of E2F sites further supports an important role for the RB/E2F pathway in the control of geminin expression. Additionally, this analysis suggested that the intragenic E2F sites downstream of the transcriptional start site may play a significant role in geminin control. Active RB Represses Geminin through Intragenic E2F Sites—To address the role of all of the identified E2F sites, we cloned a larger region of geminin sequence and generated a reporter construct containing all four of the clustered E2F sites in mouse (Fig. 5A). In the reporter assays, the activity of this reporter was repressed strongly by active RB (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that the intragenic E2F sites are responsible for the observed repression. We then proceeded to generate deletions of this reporter to identify critical E2F sites. Initially, we focused on a specific intragenic E2F site just upstream of the coding region (exon 2) and found that in isolation it exhibited a relatively weak repression (Fig. 5, C and D). Similarly, the two downstream E2F sites in combination were only weakly repressed by PSM-RB. In contrast, the combination of all three E2F sites found in intron 1 resulted in strong repression equivalent to the repression observed with the larger geminin fragment. This reporter was activated strongly by the ectopic expression of E2F2, emphasizing the importance of the intragenic E2F sites in the control of geminin expression (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that the E2F sites downstream of the transcriptional start site are the predominant targets for RB-mediated repression. To verify that our geminin reporter with intact E2F sites is regulated by endogenous RB during the course of the cell cycle, transfections were carried out in Rat1 fibroblasts. These cells were held for 96 h in serum-deficient (0.01%) medium to synchronize the majority of cells in G1. Cells were stimulated with 10% serum for 0–18 h and harvested for flow cytometry and reporter assays. The strongest activation of the reporter occurred at 12 h after release from G1, just preceding the entry of most cells into S phase (Fig. 5F). The Response of the Geminin Promoter to RB Is Dependent upon E2F—To investigate whether the response of the geminin promoter to RB is dependent on the E2F sites, we use site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt the three sites as shown in Fig. 6, A and B. Rat1 cells then were transfected with either pGL2-mGmnn (+181 to 1696), pGL2-mGmnn ΔE2F, PSM-RB, or PSM-RB and E2F2 expression plasmids (Fig. 6C). The wild type reporter was active and repressed by PSM-RB. This repression was alleviated mostly by cotransfection with E2F2, indicating that the observed repression occurs via E2F. The ΔE2F reporter was not significantly influenced by PSM-RB. These results demonstrate that the repression of the geminin promoter by active RB is mediated through these E2F sites. The Geminin Promoter Is Occupied by E2F—To determine the ability of E2F proteins to occupy the geminin promoter, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assay at the E2F sites in the rat promoter (Fig. 7A). The intragenic region of this promoter was repressed by RB in the A5-1 cell line similarly to the mouse promoter (Fig. 7B). The primers were designed to amplify pieces of the promoter containing the different E2F sites or to amplify a region ∼9 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, which we determined by sequence comparison to be nonconserved and devoid of transcription factor binding sites (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 7C, E2F4 occupied predominantly E2F sites at +12, +324, and +708 of the rat geminin sequence. These results are consistent with the findings in mouse reporter assays confirming that the intragenic E2F sites are responsible for modulating transcription. Here we show that geminin is regulated transcriptionally by the RB/E2F pathway. In the presence of a constitutively active RB allele, geminin RNA levels are repressed strongly regardless of cell cycle position. Similar repression is observed when endogenous RB is activated by p16INK4A overexpression. Conversely, in Rb-deficient cells, geminin expression is deregulated. Therefore, geminin RNA and protein levels are regulated via RB. To delineate the mechanisms of regulation, we investigated E2F sites in the geminin promoter region. Typically, RB exerts its influence on gene expression through E2F sites relatively close to the transcriptional start site. Surprisingly, we failed to observe any repression with reporter constructs surrounding this conventional region of regulation. Cross-species analyses identified highly conserved E2F sites in proximity of the first exon of geminin, and reporter analyses confirmed that this region facilitated RB-mediated repression. Inactivation of endogenous RB at the G1/S transition resulted in the activation of a reporter construct, and the mutation of the E2F sites in the first intron prevented the repression of the reporter by PSM-RB. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation confirms that E2F proteins are bound to these intragenic regions. These findings demonstrate that intragenic sequences play an important role in the regulation of geminin transcription. The expression of geminin is controlled by the intricate interplay of transcriptional and proteolytic regulatory mechanisms. Degradation of geminin at the metaphase to anaphase transition has been shown to rely on the anaphase-promoting complex (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 4Bastians H. Topper L.M. Gorbsky G.L. Ruderman J.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3927-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of geminin at the transcriptional level by RB represents an additional control mechanism. RB is dephosphorylated and activated at the M/G1 transition when geminin levels decrease, and likewise, RB is phosphorylated and inactivated at the G1/S transition when the levels of geminin transcript increase and the protein begins to accumulate. We propose that RB functions in concert with the anaphase-promoting complex to maintain low levels of geminin throughout G1. The biological importance of low geminin levels through G1 has been indicated by several studies. McGarry and Kirschner (1McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W.

Although cell division continued, the resulting daughter cells were anucleate. Quinn et al. (23Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study (30Hodgson B. Li A. Tada S. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) shows that during the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle, 30–60% of endogenous geminin protein was not degraded at anaphase. The remaining geminin was altered in some way to prevent its activity through G1. Transcriptional control by RB could limit de novo synthesis of geminin in G1, conceivably preventing the need to alter additional geminin after the transition into G1. RB classically functions as an inhibitor of DNA replication. Consistent with this concept, RB mediates the repression of several ORC and MCM genes that are requisite components of the preRC that initiates DNA replication at origins (14Ishida S. Huang E.

Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Broceno C. Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was in a way paradoxical that geminin, an inhibitor of preRC assembly and DNA replication, was also under RB control. One reason for RB-mediated regulation of geminin during cell division processes would be to allow reentry into the cell cycle. It has been demonstrated previously (18Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) that cells rapidly reenter the cell cycle after RB-mediated repression of target genes is relieved. In order for a cell to quickly take advantage of growth-permissive conditions, it is critical that inhibitors of DNA replication not be present. Such a model would argue that there must be kinetic distinctions between the rate of preRC assembly and the accumulation of geminin during progression through G1. Geminin levels presumably are checked by the activity of the anaphase-promoting complex, and this may be sufficient to allow preRC assembly as cells transit through G1. The increased levels of geminin observed in Rb-deficient cells could be hypothesized to tightly regulate DNA replication. However, Rb-deficient cells clearly exhibit defects in S phase control. For example, the loss of RB compromises S phase checkpoints, allowing for DNA replication in the presence of damage. Additionally, rather than being resistant to rereplication, Rb-null MEFs and Rb-deficient tumor cell lines readily undergo aberrant rounds of DNA replication resulting in aneuploidy (31Broceno C. Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Khan S.H. Wahl G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, deregulation of geminin expression by loss of RB is insufficient to prevent either normal or aberrant replication. Two possible explanations exist for this observation. First, that geminin, while being expressed copiously, is not active in Rb-deficient cells. This model is supported by the finding that inactive species of geminin, which fail to bind CDT1 or inhibit DNA replication, can be detected (29Shreeram S. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Blow J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, the enhanced geminin levels present in Rb-deficient cells are met by correspondingly higher levels of positive regulators of the preRC (i.e. CDT1, cdc6, and MCMs). Under these conditions, geminin could be rendered inert because of an excess of targets. As such, Rb-deficient cells would be prone to rereplication in a manner analogous to geminin-deficient cells. In summary, we find that RB is a potent regulator of the critical licensing factor geminin. These analyses underscore the complexity of RB signaling both in mechanism of repression (through intragenic E2F sites) and diverse target spectrum (through the regulation of an inhibitor of DNA replication).

https://openalex.org/W2069549484,"Bacteriophage T4 gene 59 protein greatly stimulates the loading of the T4 gene 41 helicase in vitro and is required for recombination and recombination-dependent DNA replication in vivo. 59 protein binds preferentially to forked DNA and interacts directly with the T4 41 helicase and gene 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein. The helicase loader is an almost completely alpha-helical, two-domain protein, whose N-terminal domain has strong structural similarity to the DNA-binding domains of high mobility group proteins. We have previously speculated that this high mobility group-like region may bind the duplex ahead of the fork, with the C-terminal domain providing separate binding sites for the fork arms and at least part of the docking area for the helicase and 32 protein. Here, we characterize several mutants of 59 protein in an initial effort to test this model. We find that the I87A mutation, at the position where the fork arms would separate in the model, is defective in binding fork DNA. As a consequence, it is defective in stimulating both unwinding by the helicase and replication by the T4 system. 59 protein with a deletion of the two C-terminal residues, Lys(216) and Tyr(217), binds fork DNA normally. In contrast to the wild type, the deletion protein fails to promote binding of 32 protein on short fork DNA. However, it binds 32 protein in the absence of DNA. The deletion is also somewhat defective in stimulating unwinding of fork DNA by the helicase and replication by the T4 system. We suggest that the absence of the two terminal residues may alter the configuration of the lagging strand fork arm on the surface of the C-terminal domain, so that it is a poorer docking site for the helicase and 32 protein."

We have recently shown that calcium-activated TGase 3, like TGase 2, can bind, hydrolyze, and is inhibited by GTP despite lacking structural homology with other GTP-binding proteins. Here we report the crystal structure determined at 2.0 Å resolution of TGase 3 in complex with GMP to elucidate the structural features required for nucleotide recognition. Binding affinities for various nucleotides were found by fluorescence displacement to be as follows: guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) (0.4 μm), GTP (0.6 μm), GDP (1.0 μm), GMP (0.4 μm), and ATP (28.0 μm). Furthermore, we found that GMP binds as a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of TGase 3 transamidation activity, similar to GTPγS and GDP. A genetic algorithm similarity program (GASP) approach (virtual ligand screening) identified three compounds from the Lead Quest™ data base (Tripos Inc.) based on superimposition of GTPγS, GDP, and GMP guanine nucleotides from our crystal structures to generate the minimum align flexible fragment. These three were nucleotide analogs without a phosphate group containing the minimal binding motif for TGase 3 that includes a nucleoside recognition groove. Binding affinities were measured as follows: TP349915 (Kd = 4.1 μm), TP395289 (Kd = 38.5 μm), TP394305 (Kd = 1.0 mm). Remarkably, these compounds do not inhibit but instead activate TGase 3 transamidation by about 10-fold.

Six of the nine known human TGase enzymes are expressed in terminally differentiating epithelia such as the epidermis and involved in the assembly of the cell envelope.

GTP binding inhibits TGase transamidation activity, whereas calcium binding inhibits GTP binding and activates the enzyme (23Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. Rastinejad F. J.

To gain more insight into the structural basis for nucleotide binding and specificity, we determined the crystal structure of the active TGase 3 enzyme in complex with GMP at 2.0-Å resolution and measured the binding affinity for different guanine nucleotides by fluorescence titration. Three nucleotide analogs were identified from a virtual ligand screening experiment using the GMP crystal structure. In contrast to guanine nucleotide inhibitors, these compounds are shown to activate TGase 3 transamidation. These results reveal that the nucleotide binding pocket in TGase 3 may be exploited to either enhance or inhibit the enzymatic activity as required for different therapeutic approaches. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant human TGase 3 as a zymogen was expressed in the baculovirus system and purified as described (26Kim H.C. Nemes Z. Idler W.W. Hyde C.C. Steinert P.M. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The zymogen (in a 10-ml solution at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 125 mm NaCl) was proteolyzed with 3 mg of dispase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min. The protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q™ column eluting in a 500 mm NaCl gradient at 150 mm NaCl. The protein was extensively dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 125 mm NaCl. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trials of TGase 3·GMP complex were performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Stock solutions of active enzyme (10 mg/ml, previously dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 125 mm NaCl) were supplemented with 0.1 mm β-octyl glucoside, 0.575 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm GMP. Equal volumes (2 μl each) of protein and reservoir/precipitant solution were mixed and equilibrated at 21 °C over well solutions containing 100 mm sodium-Hepes (pH 7.0) and a concentration gradient of 4-10% (w/v) in polyethylene glycol 6000. Thin, plate-like crystals appeared after 2 days and were harvested into reservoir solution containing 20% 2-methyl-2, 4-pentanediol cryoprotectant and flash-frozen into liquid nitrogen with a rayon mounting loop (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK) before data collection. All data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories using beamline X9B with an ADSC Quantum 4 detector with a wavelength of 0.92 Å, crystal distance-to-detector of 180 mm, and oscillation range of 1.0° and exposure for 30 s.

Microcalorimetric Titration Studies of Nucleotide Binding of TGase 3—The thermodynamic properties of nucleotide binding to the activated TGase 3 were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry using a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter at 30 °C. Before measurements, the activated TGase 3 (6.8 μm), dialyzed three times against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm standard CaCl2 solution (Fisher), was placed in a 1.38-ml sample cell. The activated TGase 3 was titrated with GMP nucleotide (0.19 mm) in a series of automatic injections starting with 5 μl each into the protein solution and following with 10- and 20-μl aliquots using a 250-μl syringe. After each injection, a 5-min pause was allowed to achieve a stable base line. Heat produced due to dilution was measured by injecting the nucleotide solution into sample cells from which TGase 3 protein was omitted. For each titration step, the heat of dilution was subtracted. Data were fitted to appropriate binding models, and thermodynamic parameters were determined from nonlinear least-squares fits using ORIGIN™ software. TGase 3 Activity Assay—TGase activity was measured by incorporation of [14C]putrescine into casein (38Folk J.E. Cole P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 122: 244-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Assays were done at 37 °C in 0.5-ml portions of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% N,N-dimethylated casein (Sigma), 0.5 μCi of putrescine (118 mCi/mmol), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. Reaction blanks contained no added calcium. Reactions were stopped with the addition of ice-cold 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and incorporated radioactivity was collected by filtration through GF/A glass fiber filters (Whatman) wet with ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and successively washed 3 times with 5 ml of ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Filters were dried and solubilized in 5 ml of CytoScint (ICN). Inhibition assays contained 0-500 μm GMP at 3 different CaCl2 concentrations. TGase 3 Quantitative Metal Analyses—All plastic and glassware were incubated in 5 n HCl for period of 36 h and rinsed with double-distilled water that had been passed over a Chelex 100 column. For buffer and transition metal solutions, Chelex 100-treated water was used throughout. Before adjustment of the pH, Chelex 100 resin was added (0.5 g/100 ml), and the solution was stirred for 45 min; after adjustment of the pH, the solution was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and stored in metal-free plastic vials at -20 °C. Before measurements, TGase 3 zymogen (10 mg/ml) was treated with dispase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min and dialyzed 5 times against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm EGTA. The EGTA solution was removed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Bound metal ions were detected using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ELAN 6100 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry dynamic reaction cell apparatus. TGase 3 Fluorescence Titration and Displacement—Titration experiments were performed at 25 °C using a PerkinElmer LS50 fluorescence spectrometer. The fluorescence of GTPγS trisodium salt BODIPY FL thioester (BODIPY FL GTPγS, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and TNP-GTP were measured at an excitation wavelength of 475 nm (spectral bandpass, 2.5 nm) and emission wavelength of 513 nm (bandpass 2.5 nm), corresponding to the maximum in the fluorescence difference spectrum between free and TGase 3-bound BODIPY FL GTPγS. Either BODIPY FL GTPγS was added in small aliquots (2-10 μl) to a given solution of TGase 3 (40-200 nm) or TGase 3 from a concentrated stock solution was added in aliquots to a given concentration of BODIPY FL GTPγS (32 nm). The total change of the sample volume was less than 10% in every case. The buffer used for experiments with activated TGase was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2 and for the inactivated form was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2. The following equation was used for non-linear least-square fitting of the data: F = F0 + ΔF ((nE + L + KD - ((nE + L + KD)2-4LE)1/2)/2nE), where F is the measured signal, F0 is the signal without binding, ΔF is the maximal change of the signal at saturation, E and L are the total concentrations of titrated substance and ligand, respectively, and n and KD are the number of binding sites and the dissociation constant. For the fluorescence displacement experiments different nucleotides from stock solutions were added in small aliquots to a mixture of BODIPY FL GTPγS and TGase 3 (0.48 and 0.43 μm, respectively). The data fitting for non-linear least square was obtained from a previously derived formula (39Wang Z. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Virtual Ligand Screening and Modeling of the Nucleotide Binding Pocket of TGase3—The GASP program was used to superimpose GTPγS, GDP, and GMP guanine nucleotides from our crystal structures to generate the “minimum align flexible fragment.” This fragment signature query was used to scan a Tripos fragment data base (Lead Quest™, 84,509 molecules as of 10 Dec, 2003). The SYBYL UNITY tools were used as a source of fragment molecules for the creation of a signature data base with two-dimensional fragment similarity. The starting data base was screened for all compounds with molecular mass less than 600 Da, yielding 117 molecules. The two-dimensional output molecules were used to generate three-dimensional coordinate molecules from the CONCORD module tool in SYBYL program. The FlexS module implemented in SYBYL was then used to predict conformations and orientations of the nucleotide analogs relative to the pharmacophore pattern template (map of properties common to all active conformations of a set of ligands). The best 10 compound scores from FlexS, which are heavily based on shared volume and influenced by similar groups in space, were subsequently used for flexible docking method in FlexX. The orientations of three compounds with the best conformational scores (TP349915, TP395289, TP394305) were visually inspected. Overall Architecture of TGase 3·GMP Complex—The crystal structure of TGase 3·GMP complex at 2.0 Å of resolution was solved. Except for the substitution of GMP nucleotide, the crystallization conditions used here were identical to those previously used to crystallize this enzyme in the presence of GTPγS including 0.575 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (23Ahvazi B.

The final 2 Fo - Fc exp(iac) electron density map in the region of the catalytic triad is shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B shows the overall architecture and binding site for GMP. The TGase 3·GMP complex crystal contains two independent protomers (692 residues each, subunit A and B) within the asymmetric unit. The overall conformation of the two subunits are essentially identical, similar to that reported earlier for the activated TGase 3 either in the absence or the presence of guanine nucleotide (23Ahvazi B.

The root mean square deviation between the 673 Cα carbon atoms of the A and B subunits is 0.43 Å in the complex, indicating that overall conformations are similar. The two subunits in each of the structures lack electron density for a flexible loop between residues 462-478 in subunit A and 460-472 in subunit B. This flexible hinge region harbors Ser469-Ser470, the cleavage site used for proteolytic activation of the TGase 3 zymogen. Because the protein is known to be a monomer in solution (15Kim H.C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of a dimer as the crystallographic asymmetric unit is likely of no functional relevance. The TGase 3 architecture consists of four domains (β-sandwich domain, catalytic core domain, β-barrel 1, and β-barrel 2 domains), which we described previously (23Ahvazi B. Boeshans K.M. Idler W. Baxa U. Steinert P.M. Rastinejad F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7180-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Ahvazi B. Kim H.C. Kee S.H. Nemes Z. Steinert P.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23834-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The core domain harbors the active site residues Cys272, His330, and Asp353. This catalytic triad is shielded from contact with the solvent because it is buried within a narrow cleft with walls formed by two β-sheet strands of the catalytic core domain and the carboxyl terminus of β-barrel 1 domain. In addition, the core domain possesses two functional Ca2+ and one Mg2+ metal-binding site indicated in Fig. 1B. The TGase 3·GMP structure has two non-proline cis peptide bonds (Arg268-Tyr269 in the β strand before the loop of the α-helix containing the active site Cys272 residue and Asn382-Phe383 in a loop adjoining two α-helices of the core domain) and cis-peptide bond at Gly367-Pro368. The GMP Nucleotide Binding Pocket—The electron density unequivocally indicates the presence of a bound GMP molecule in the crystal structure (Fig. 2A, left panel). The GMP nucleotide binds to the same site as GTPγS and GDP, a deep cleft located between the core domain and the β-barrel 1 domain (Fig. 2A, right panel). This cleft consists of residues Asn168 and Arg169 from the core domain and Lys485, Lys487, Val488, Met491, Leu492 (first β-strand), Arg587, Asp588, Ile590, Leu591, and Asp592 (last β-strand) from β-barrel 1. Fig. 2B shows how the guanine ring is recognized in the structure. The specificity for binding by guanine nucleotides versus adenine nucleotides is conferred by the pattern of hydrogen bond donors and acceptor interactions with the major-groove face of the guanine moiety. Ile590 uses its backbone nitrogen and oxygen to form direct hydrogen bonds with the O-6, N-1, and N-2 atoms of the guanine base. The side chain of Arg587 forms a hydrogen bond with the N-7 group of the guanine ring and α-phosphate oxygen of GMP nucleotide and stabilizes a water-mediated interaction with O-6 through Nϵ of Arg587. An additional hydrogen bond to the phosphate oxygen atom is made with the backbone nitrogen of Val488. The GMP nucleotide binding cleft is defined on one side by the Arg169 side chain stacking with the guanine ring and the side chains from Val488, Leu492, and Ile589 sandwiching from the other side. This binding cleft shows no similarity to those of traditional large and small G proteins, which rely on a (N/T)KXD consensus motif for hydrogen-bonding interactions with the guanine ring (42Pai E.F.

The Effect of GMP Nucleotide on Metal Ion Binding—We have shown previously that active TGase 3 can bind three Ca2+ ions. That in site 1 is constitutively bound, whereas those in sites 2 and 3 are acquired during activation and are required for activity. In particular, bind"

In this study, we observed and quantitated the presence of a tRNA-bound, ribosome-associated polypeptide subpopulation present in vitro. This subpopulation was accessible to signal peptidase on ribosome-associated polypeptides longer than 114 amino acids. This demonstrates that it is possible for a peptidyl-tRNA species, in the midst of translation, to be processed by the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase implying that the peptidase is closely associated with the mammalian translocon.

This sequence is a substrate for a family of conserved proteases called type I signal peptidases (SPase I) 1The abbreviations used are: SPase I, type I signal peptidase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RM, rough microsomes; Puro, puromycin.

Nascent proteins can be modified within the ER by removal of the signal sequence, addition of N-linked sugars (21Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, the temporal order of these events relative to each other and relative to translocation through the channel has not been resolved. In this paper, we observe that polypeptide intermediates still attached to their biosynthetic ribosomes can be cleaved by the ER signal peptidase. We conclude that the peptidase can access a nascent chain that has not completed translocation or translation. Materials—Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. PerkinElmer Life Sciences supplied [35S]methionine. Except when indicated, all other chemicals were supplied by either Fisher or Sigma. Plasmids—pGEM-BP1, containing both the Staphylococcus aureus β-lactamase gene and Bos taurus preprolactin cDNA, was provided by Dr. C. Nicchitta (23Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The secretory protein Rattus norvegicus immunoglobulin κ light chain VJC cDNA was provided by Dr. M. Nussenzweig and subcloned into a pGEM-3Z plasmid (Promega) using EcoRI and AccI to create plasmid pGEM-κLC.

Transcription was carried out using instructions and reagents provided in the Megascript T7 kit from Ambion. In vitro [35S]methionine translations were performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) treated with 2 mm puromycin, purified, separated with Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE, and visualized using STORM autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences) in a manner comparable with the manufacturer's instructions and previous descriptions (24Borel A.C.

Protein Quantification—Using ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences), we drew rectangles around the four potential bands in each lane of an SDS gel. Background subtraction and normalization were done as described previously (26Daniels R. Kurowski B. Johnson A.E. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Percent tRNA-bound polypeptide = the intensity of the top two bands of any given lane divided by the total intensity of all four rectangles in that same lane; percent total tRNA-bound polypeptide without signal sequence = the intensity of the lower of the top two rectangles divided by the total intensity of all four rectangles in a lane; percent tRNA-bound polypeptide without (or with) signal sequence released by puromycin addition = the percent total tRNA-bound polypeptide with or without signal sequence was determined with (A) and without (B) puromycin. The ratio (E) of the percentage released by puromycin to the percentage present in the absence of puromycin was calculated: (B – A)/B = E. Examples of Construct Nomenclature—βlac FL-1 Trp = β-lactamase full-length minus stop codon(s), tryptophan as final amino acid; pPl 0.75 Pro = preprolactin, 75% of full-length, proline as final amino acid; κLC FL = κ light chain full-length with stop codon(s). Background and Characterization of the Experimental System—During translation of mRNA truncated without stop codon(s), the ribosome stalls at the terminal codon and the cognate tRNA molecule remains bound to the polypeptide chain and to the ribosome (23Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Perara E. Rothman R.E. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1986; 232: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This resulting peptidyl-tRNA migrates more slowly on SDS-PAGE and can be quantified when labeled with [35S]methionine. Concomitantly, the peptidyltransferase of the ribosome may add puromycin to the carboxyl end of the stalled chain thereby releasing the tRNA (28Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29Redman C.M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Puromycin increases the electrophoretic mobility of ribosome-bound, nascent peptidyl-tRNA but has no effect on peptidyl-tRNA that have dissociated from their ribosomes (24Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several Higher Molecular Mass Bands Are Present in βlac FL-1 Trp Translation Product—The transcription/translation product for β-lactamase without stop codons, βlac FL-1 Trp, was predicted to encode a 31.6-kDa preprotein of 286 amino acids and a 28.9-kDa mature form of 263 amino acids. For both βlac FL-1 Trp and βlac FL, translation products at 31 kDa (major) and 25 kDa (minor) were observed in the absence of RM (RM –) (Fig 1A). In the presence of RM (RM +), an additional, major band at 28 kDa was visible (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4). The 31-kDa and the 28-kDa bands have been characterized as the full-length polypeptide with and without signal sequence, respectively. The 25-kDa product has not been characterized but appears elsewhere (30Promega Corp.Canine Pancreatic Microsomal Membranes: Technical Manual. Madison, WI, 2000Google Scholar). The intensity of the 28-kDa band as a percentage of total (28 kDa + 31 kDa) band intensity was 76 ± 24% (n = 13) for βlac FL and 72 ± 14% (n = 4) for βlac FL-1 Trp. Higher Molecular Mass βlac FL-1 Trp Bands Are Released by Puromycin—Translation products of βlac FL-1 Trp showed several additional major translation products of higher molecular mass (Fig. 1A). In the absence of RM, the 44-kDa band was more intense than the 40-kDa band (paired, two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.01). An additional band of 42 kDa was seen in the presence of RM (Fig. 1A, lane 4). To test whether these higher molecular mass bands were nascent polypeptide chains with carboxyl-terminal amino acids still attached to their cognate tRNA, we added puromycin to translation mixtures (Puro +) (24Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When a RM – translation mix encoding βlac FL-1 Trp was treated with 2 mm puromycin, both the 44- and 40-kDa bands decreased in intensity, while the 31- and 25-kDa bands gained intensity (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). In RM +/Puro + mixtures, the major band of 42 kDa lost intensity, while the 28-kDa band gained intensity (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). These data suggest that higher molecular mass bands represent tRNA-bound forms of nascent polypeptide with (44 kDa) and without (42 kDa) a signal sequence. For all experiments with βlac FL-1 (n = 4), the percentage of total tRNA-bound protein without a signal sequence (the 42-kDa band) was ∼0 ± 0% in samples untreated with RM as opposed to 75 ± 6% in samples treated with RM (paired, two tailed Student's t test, p < 0.01) (Table I). The percentage intensity of tRNA-bound, processed polypeptide of total tRNA intensity was decreased an average of 91 ± 3% by addition of puromycin (Table I).Table IQuantitative data from in vitro translations of various mRNA constructsnConstructLength (amino acid)% total polypeptide as tRNA bound form (±S.D.)% total tRNA-bound polypeptide without signal sequence (±S.D.)% tRNA bound polypeptide (±S.D.)RM -RM +RM -RM +p4βlac FL-1 Trp28627 ± 358 ± 60 ± 075 ± 6<0.0191 ± 3aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.5βlac 0.87 Pro24960 ± 862 ± 103 ± 234 ± 6<0.0193 ± 9aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4βlac 0.75 Pro21744 ± 423 ± 23 ± 482 ± 4<0.0195 ± 2aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4βlac 0.63 Asp17746 ± 420 ± 22 ± 370 ± 1<0.0193 ± 1aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4βlac 0.50 Pro14347 ± 943 ± 222 ± 257 ± 9<0.0195 ± 4aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4βlac 0.46 Ala13225 ± 318 ± 72 ± 358 ± 12<0.0182 ± 5aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.3βlac 0.39 Gly11419 ± 1012 ± 73 ± 50 ± 10.484 ± 15bWith signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.3βlac 0.38 Glu10837 ± 1521 ± 122 ± 34 ± 40.788 ± 18bWith signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4βlac 0.37 Pro10526 ± 1517 ± 113 ± 60.1 ± 0.20.462 ± 27bWith signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.3βlac 0.27 Asp8323 ± 649 ± 62 ± 21 ± 10.528 ± 16bWith signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4κLC 0.89 Ser20636 ± 560 ± 53 ± 461 ± 9<0.0177 ± 2aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.3κLC 0.75 Val18184 ± 279 ± 61 ± 260 ± 2<0.0128 ± 6aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.4pPl 0.75 Pro18471 ± 1876 ± 112 ± 225 ± 4<0.0195 ± 5aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.3pPl 0.57 Pro13954 ± 1164 ± 31 ± 122 ± 3<0.0173 ± 8aWithout signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.a Without signal sequence, released by puromycin addition.b With signal sequence, released by puromycin addition. Open table in a new tab Truncated Eukaryotic Constructs Show Results Similar to β-Lactamase—To observe whether the signal sequence can be cleaved from polypeptide intermediates of eukaryotic origin, we synthesized several bovine preprolactin and rat κ light chain constructs. Construct pPl 0.75 Pro was predicted to encode a 19.1-kDa preprotein of 172 amino acids and a 15.9-kDa mature protein of 142 amino acids. When pPl 0.75 Pro was translated in the absence of RM, two major bands of ∼35 and 20 kDa were observed (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). In the presence of RM, two additional bands appeared at 32 and 16 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). In the presence of RM, 27 ± 6% of the pPl 0.75 Pro (n = 4) tRNA-bound polypeptide species were without a signal sequence, while in the absence of RM 2 ± 3% of the peptidyl-tRNA lacked a signal sequence (paired, two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.01) (Table I). Puromycin released an average of 95 ± 5% of tRNA-bound, processed polypeptide chains. We observed lower but similarly patterned results for construct pPl 0.57 Pro (Table I). The longer IgG κ light chain construct, κLC 0.89 Ser, coded for a 22.5-kDa preprotein of 206 amino acids and a 19.4-kDa mature protein of 177 amino acids. For translation products of both κLC constructs, the results were similar to β-lactamase and preprolactin truncated constructs (Fig. 2B and Table I). Signal Sequence Cleavage of β-Lactamase tRNA-bound Constructs Is Length-dependent—To test whether length of the polypeptide intermediate affected processing of the signal sequence, we created truncated mRNA constructs encoding various lengths of β-lactamase. When primed with mRNA coding for a polypeptide greater than 114 amino acids, translations in the presence of RM contained a significantly greater amount of processed peptidyl-tRNA than translations in the absence of RM. Translation mixtures primed with truncated β-lactamase constructs coding for less than 132 amino acids did not show a similar, significant difference (Fig. 3 and Table I, paired, two-tailed Student's t test). When mRNA constructs encoding more than 114 amino acids of β-lactamase were translated in the presence of RM, the tRNA-bound translation products were without a signal sequence. These translation products, upon puromycin addition, were reduced in excess of 80–90% of their original intensity. Similarly, all constructs (except βlac 0.27) coding for less than 132 amino acids showed release of tRNA-bound, signal sequence present species in excess of 60% upon puromycin addition (Table I). Can ER signal peptidase cleave the signal sequence from polypeptide chains still associated with functional ribosomes? To address this question we built on previous experimental paradigms (24Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Daniels R. Kurowski B.

In this study, typically 25% or greater of the polypeptide was tRNA-bound, and of that generally more than 60% was associated with functional ribosomes (Table I). Our results show that the percentage of tRNA-bound, ribosome-associated polypeptide is a variable quantity, specific to, but not uniformly predicted by, the identity of the parental mRNA. The results indicate that in many in vitro translations, and potentially in many in vivo reactions, as much as 85% of the nascent polypeptide is either not tRNA-bound or ribosome-associated. This tRNA-bound, ribosome-associated subpopulation is the only biologically relevant intermediary in protein translation, a factor that must be taken into consideration in all studies. To assess the activity of ER signal peptidase, we used this system to observe the differences between polypeptide species in translation mixtures containing or lacking RM. Without RM in the translation mixture, the tRNA-bound population was generally homogenous (e.g. Fig. 1B, lane 5). When the same translation was done in the presence of RM, the tRNA-bound population became heterogeneous, with one band similar to the RM – lane representing unprocessed, tRNA-bound polypeptide and one band of generally 1–3 kDa lower apparent molecular mass representing the tRNA-bound polypeptide without its signal sequence (e.g. Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7). Therefore, in the RM + translation mixtures, some tRNA-bound polypeptides were processed and some were unprocessed, and a reproducible percentage of these processed constructs were susceptible to puromycin release (Table I). These results demonstrate that tRNA-bound, ribosome-associated polypeptides can be accessed by ER signal peptidase in vitro. Once it was established that polypeptides still attached to the ribosome could be processed by the ER signal peptidase, we examined how early during the biosynthesis of a polypeptide a signal sequence could be cleaved. We synthesized increasingly shorter β-lactamase mRNA constructs and translated them. Ribosome-associated polypeptides 114 amino acids and shorter could no longer be resolved from their signal sequence cleaved form (Fig. 3, Table I). However, by our puromycin release assay, tRNA-bound polypeptide chains from these shorter constructs were still attached to functional ribosomes (Table I). Of the 114 amino acids in the longest unprocessed β-lactamase construct, 70 are buried in the translation and translocation “machinery” of the cell (24Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 45: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Connolly T.

We hypothesize that, in this study, these 20–50 amino acids span the distance from the active site of the signal peptidase to the point where the translocon protects the nascent chain from protease. This would necessitate the subcellular location of the ER signal peptidase to be in close proximity to the mammalian translocon. Based on these ideas, we propose that signal sequence cleavage is an event tightly coupled, both temporally and spatially, to the movement of the polypeptide through the translocon. β-Lactamase is a single protein, and this study examines three canonical polypeptides from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes within a mammalian translation/translocation model. Obvious extensions include using alternative models for ER translocation such as permeabilized cell extracts (36Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or prepared bacterial membranes (37Müller M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) along with a wider range of constructs, including viral and yeast, to explore these results further. We have previously demonstrated that nascent polypeptides, still attached to their biosynthetic ribosomes in the cytosol, can be modified by the oligosaccharyltransferase in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (24Borel A.C. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10587-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The analysis of a nascent polypeptide containing both a cleaved signal sequence and glycosylation site would allow us to assay the relative timing of these events and further our in vitro biochemical understanding of the functional organization of the translocon complex.
