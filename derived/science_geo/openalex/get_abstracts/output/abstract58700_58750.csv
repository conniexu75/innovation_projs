https://openalex.org/W2075703668,"Polystyrene spherules averaging 0.5 millimeter in diameter (range 0.1 to 2 millimeters) are abundant in the coastal waters of southern New England. Two types are present, a crystalline (clear) form and a white, opaque form with pigmentation resulting from a diene rubber. The spherules have bacteria on their surfaces and contain polychlorinated biphenyls, apparently absorbed from ambient seawater, in a concentration of 5 parts per million. White, opaque spherules are selectively consumed by 8 species of fish out of 14 species examined, and a chaetognath. Ingestion of the plastic may lead to intestinal blockage in smaller fish."
https://openalex.org/W2060174057,"There are many possible spatial patterns of selection and gene flow that can produce a given cline structure; the actual geography of natural selection and gene flow must be worked out before an attempt is made to explain a given natural cline in terms of a model. The results of experimental and theoretical models show that it is possible for local differentiation to evolve parapatrically in spite of considerable gene flow if the selection gradients are relatively uniform. Irregularities in environmental gradients increase the sensitivity of clines to the effects of gene flow in proportion to the increase in the differences in gene frequencies between the emigrants and the demes receiving the immigrants. It is not necessary for a sharp spatial environmental change to be present for distinct differentiation to occur. In some cases even a gentle environmental gradient can give rise to marked spatial differentiation along a genetically continuous series of demes; such environmental differences may be below the practical limits of resolution in field studies. Any asymmetry in gene flow does not lead to dedifferentiation if the environmental gradient is smooth; it merely shifts the position of the transition zone between the differentiated areas from that which would be expected if there were no asymmetry. Abrupt geographic differences in gene, genotype, or morph frequencies should not, therefore, be interpreted as evidence for environmental changes in the immediate vicinity of the steepest part of the cline; neither should they be interpreted as evidence for geographic barriers, sharp environmental differences, or sexual isolation among the differentiated groups of populations when there are no other sources of evidence for these phenomena. Gene flow may be unimportant in the differentiation of populations along environmental gradients."

https://openalex.org/W2050731825,"Four adult male rhesus monkeys were provided access individually to a group of receptive females. Each male assumed dominance and engaged in frequent copulations. Plasma testosterone levels increased two- to threefold during this period. Next, each male was subjected to sudden and decisive defeat by a large all-male group, and plasma testosterone fell following this experience. Two males were later reintroduced to the females, and plasma testosterone rose rapidly to the previous elevated levels."
https://openalex.org/W1640796678,"The chromophore content of blue-green algal phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, derived from a unicellular blue-green alga of Synechococcus sp., has been determined by quantitative spectrophotometry. Phycocyanin carries three covalently bound phycocyanobilin chromophores per monomer (molecular weight 36,700). Two of these chromophores are attached to the β subunit and one to the α subunit. Allophycocyanin has a single chromophore per polypeptide chain (molecular weight 16,500). Experiments with blue-green algae belonging to other taxonomic groups (Aphanocapsa sp. and Anabaena sp.) indicate that this chromophore distribution holds generally among cyanophytan phycobiliproteins. Bennett and Bogorad ((1971) Biochemistry 10, 3625) have reported earlier that 3 molecules of phycoerythrobilin are bound per monomer of cyanophytan phycoerythrin, two on the β subunit and one on the α subunit. The present work completes the assignment of the distribution of the chromophores among the blue-green algal phycobiliproteins and their subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1999648932,"Disagreement exists over whether man's bipedal form of locomotion evolved as an economical means for covering long distances. There is also some disagreement about the energetic price man had to pay to free his hands. In an investigation of the relative energetic cost of bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion in primates, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) were trained to run on a treadmill either on two or on four legs while their oxygen consumption was being measured. Both primates expend the same amount of energy whether running on two or on four legs. The relative energy cost of bipedal versus quadrupedal running should not be used in arguments about the evolution of bipedal locomotion in man."
https://openalex.org/W2052232439,"The activity of putamen neurons was studied in a monkey during the performance of both slow and rapid arm movements. More than half of all movement-related units discharged preferentially in relation to slow movements and less than 10 percent in relation to rapid movements. These findings indicate that at least a portion of the basal ganglia (the putamen) is primarily involved in the control of slow movements and are consistent with the hypothesis of Kornhuber that the primary motor function of the basal ganglia is to generate slow (""ramp"") rather than rapid (""ballistic"") movements."

https://openalex.org/W1481707322,"Abstract A class of 80 S ribosomes has been isolated from purified yeast mitochondria. These ribosomes are distinguished from cytoplasmic ribosomes of the postmitochondrial supernatant fraction by having a greater stability against the dissociating effect of 0.4 m KCl. These results confirm observations of Schmitt ((1969) Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. Lett. 4, 234–238). Ribosome dissociability has been examined as a function of the stage of cell growth. Free and membranebound cytoplasmic ribosomes of the postmitochondrial supernatant fraction and the 80 S ribosomes associated with mitochondria are all more resistant to the dissociating effect of 0.4 m KCl when isolated from log phase as compared with stationary phase cells. In all cases, however, 80 S ribosomes associated with mitochondria show resistance to KCl dissociation to a significantly larger degree than do the other classes of ribosomes. Three lines of evidence support the conclusion that the 80 S ribosomes (bound 80 S) we isolate from purified mitochondria are cytoplasmic-type ribosomes: (a) incorporation of 32Pi into rRNA of these 80 S ribosomes is insensitive to 15 µg per ml of ethidium bromide, (b) this class of 80 S ribosomes is found in the mitochondrial fraction from a cytoplasmic petite which lacks mtDNA, and, (c) poly(U)-directed phenylalanine incorporation catalyzed by purified preparations of 80 S ribosomes associated with mitochondria is sensitive to inhibition by cycloheximide but not by chloramphenicol. Evidence is presented that purified mitochondria have binding sites for the bound 80 S ribosomes; additional binding sites can be exposed by washing mitochondria with 2 mm EDTA. We observe at least two classes of binding sites with EDTA-washed mitochondria. Low affinity sites bind 260 µg of ribosomes per mg of mitochondrial protein and high affinity sites bind 116 µg of ribosomes per mg of mitochondrial protein. Ribosome binding sites on EDTA-washed mitochondria are labile; storage of mitochondria at 0° reduces their ability to bind exogenously added bound 80 S ribosomes in an apparent first order process with a half-life of 33 hours."
https://openalex.org/W1521060160,"The occurrence of N-nonsubstituted glucosamine residues in Bacillus cereus cell wall peptidoglycan is demonstrated and accounts for resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. Lysozyme-resistant cell walls isolated from three strains of B.cereus indicate unusually small free muramic acid contents as analyzed in an autoanalyzer after acid hydrolysis. Over 80% of the total muramic acid was recovered from the acid hydrolysates of the peptidoglycan as disaccharides, which were identified as glucosaminyl-β(1→4)-muramic acid and glucosaminyl-β(1→4)-muramic acid 6-phosphate. Analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed that, in the peptidoglycan, over 70% of glucosamine residues have free amino groups. These cell walls, which remain resistant to lysozyme after removal of O-acetyl groups, polysaccharide components, and peptide components, are converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of N-acetylation with acetic anhydride."
https://openalex.org/W1483635415,"Abstract A glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) from ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) and UDP-glucose was isolated from 13- to 14-day-old embryonic chicken brain. The reaction is the following: Ceramide + UDP-glucose → glucosylceramide (+ UDP) Ceramide was the most effective lipid acceptor, and a variety of potential donors could not replace UDP-glucose. The Km values for ceramide and UDP-[14C]glucose were 0.08 mm and 0.12 mm, respectively. Metal ions did not stimulate the reaction, and it was not inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The particulate preparation of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase showed an absolute requirement for detergent, and optimal activity was obtained with a mixture of Cutscum and Triton X-100. The glucosyltransferase was detectable in brains from chick embryos as early as 7 days old; maximal activity was detected between 13 and 17 days of embryonic development. The enzyme catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of gangliosides."

These results indicate that tremor and involuntary movements are associated with a common mechanism and that the activity of the dopamine receptors is involved in the regulation of these dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2416740612,"The thermolabile α-galactosidase (α-galactosidase A) and thermostable α-galactosidase (α-galactosidase B) were separated and purified from human placenta. A homogeneous α-galactosidase B preparation was obtained, but the α-galactosidase A preparation contained small amounts of contaminating protein and various other acid hydrolase activities. Each preparation had a molecular weight of approximately 150,000, as estimated by Sephadex filtration. α-Galactosidase A had a Km of 3.4 mm for the artificial substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-galactopyranoside, and of 40.6 mm for melibiose. α-Galactosidase B hydrolyzed 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-galactopyranoside with first order kinetics and appeared to have no activity with melibiose. Both enzymes had maximal enzyme activity at pH 4.5, but α-galactosidase A had a broad pH-activity curve, while that of the B enzyme was sharply peaked. α-Galactosidase A was inhibited by myoinositol; α-galactosidase B was not. The isoelectric point of α-galactosidase A was 4.70 ± 0.07; the isoelectric point of α-galactosidase B was 4.42 ± 0.04. Antibodies were produced against both the α-galactosidase A and α-galactosidase B preparations. No cross reactivity between the two enzyme preparations was found on double immunodiffusion. Neither antiserum neutralized enzyme activity, but the anti-α-galactosidase A serum precipitated α-galactosidase A activity from solution and the anti-α-galactosidase B serum precipitated α-galactosidase B activity from solution. Treatment of α-galactosidase A with neuraminidase does not change its immune reactivity or kinetic properties. These studies lend no support to the concept that α-galactosidase A is the neuraminyl derivative of galactosidase B or that the two enzymes are closely structurally related."
https://openalex.org/W1500214914,"Abstract The unique lubricating quality of synovial fluid between apposed articular cartilages suggests that this fluid contains a moiety which is able to interact in a specific manner with the cartilaginous surfaces. Fractionation of whole synovial fluid using ultrafiltration on Millipore filters, density gradient centrifugation, and column chromatography resulted in the preparation of a fraction (approximately 0.05% of the original protein) which was able to lubricate articular cartilage in a test system in a similar manner to whole synovial fluid. This fraction was eluted in the void volume of a Bio-Gel A-5m column, gave a single precipitin line both with antisera to synovial fluid and serum and a single sedimenting boundary (s20, w = 4.6) in the analytical centrifuge. Threonine, glutamic acid, and proline were the major amino acids present and galactose, galactosamine, and sialic acid were the major carbohydrate constituents determined by gas liquid chromatography after methanolysis. After denaturation and reduction of the lubricating fraction two glycopeptides and one peptide were found to be the major constituents using sodium dodecyl sulfate disc electrophoresis. The data suggest that the lubricating moiety is a complex macromolecule composed of these three constituents. The tendency of the purified fraction to form insoluble precipitates, however, made it impossible to determine whether these constituents were components of 1 or more than 1 macromolecule."

This enzyme has more than 10 times the specific activity of the protein kinases in other subcellular fractions. When native αs1-casein is used as the substrate, the rate of phosphorus incorporation decreases by 77%. This suggests that phosphorylation of casein may occur in the Golgi apparatus following biosynthesis of the polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1525036342,"Phycocyanins of two unicellular (Synechococcus sp., and Aphanocapsa sp.), and one filamentous (Anabaena sp.) blue-green alga, have been purified and characterized with respect to behavior on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of denaturing agents, isoelectric point, absorption spectra in the visible region, subunit molecular weights, and amino acid composition. The α and β subunits of each of the phycocyanins were separated by chromatography in urea solutions, and characterized in a similar manner. Each phycocyanin was reconstituted from its separated subunits. Hybrid phycocyanins were formed from the α subunits of Synechococcus sp. phycocyanin and the β subunits of Aphanocapsa sp. and Anabaena sp. phycocyanins, and from the β subunit of Synechococcus sp. phycocyanin and the α subunits derived from the phycocyanins of the other two blue-green algae. The reconstituted and hybrid phycocyanins were purified by ion exchange chromatography, and recovered in an over-all yield of 40 to 60% based on the starting weight of subunit protein. The reconstituted and hybrid phycocyanins were characterized in the same manner as the native proteins. The native, reconstituted, and hybrid phycocyanins, all consisted of α and β subunits in a ratio of 1:1, as established by quantitative amino acid analyses and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The chromatographic properties, absorption spectra, and behavior on isoelectric focusing, of both the reconstituted and hybrid phycocyanins, were consistent with the possession by these macromolecules of a three-dimensional structure very similar to that of the native proteins. The divergence of unicellular and filamentous blue-green algae occurred over 2.5 billion years ago. The successful hybridization of subunits of phycocyanins from these two types of organisms indicates a conservation of structural features over a span of time considerably greater than had been involved in previous comparative studies of protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1554175843,"The reaction of tetranitromethane with the tyrosine residues of the pituitary glycoprotein hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has been compared. The total reaction products were inactive if sufficient reagent was used. Although polymer formation is a major reaction, nitrated LH monomer was obtained which was then separated into its α and β subunits and a fraction containing cross-linked monomer. The α subunit was fully nitrated at position 21; the two tyrosines at positions 92 and 93 were each partially nitrated while tyrosines 30 and 41 had not reacted. Nitrated LH-α recombined with either LH-β or TSH-β as judged by gel electrophoresis, but only 10 to 25% of the hormonal activity expected after recombination of native subunits was restored. The immunological response of the nitrated products against antisera to the native hormone or to the subunits was unimpaired. The results show that nitration of tyrosine residues 21 and 92–93 of the α subunit does not interfere with its association to either LH-β or TSH-β, but it is probable that these residues are involved in the interaction of the two hormones with receptor structures at their respective target organs. The alternatives of dissociation in vivo or of increased destruction in plasma as causes of loss of activity, however, are not excluded. The two tyrosines of LH-β isolated from the monomer were not nitrated although in much of the nitrated LH these residues participated in the formation of interchain or intramolecular cross-links. When isolated subunits are allowed to react with tetra-nitromethane under similar conditions, an additional tyrosine, residue 41, of the α chain is fully nitrated. The additional nitration of the α chain partially or completely inhibits recombination with native LH-β, nitrated LH-β, and native TSH-β, thus indicating the participation of tyrosine 41 in the interaction between α and β subunits. In LH-β nitration of tyrosine 59 and partial nitration of tyrosine 37 occurred, but the effects of nitration on the isolated β chain were less clear; some recombination and restoration of hormonal activity were found. Nitration of intact TSH, even in the presence of a limited amount of reagent, yielded largely polymeric material with a molecular weight range of 150,000 to 220,000, thus showing that some of the 16 tyrosines of its subunits are particularly well located for the formation of cross-links. The immunological response was not affected."
https://openalex.org/W1599084797,"Sperm acrosomes contain hyaluronidase, the amount varying, respectively, from ram, rabbit, bull, human, boar, rat, and stallion sperm to rooster sperm that do not possess this enzyme. Hyaluronidase was partially purified from bull sperm acrosomal extracts by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Bull sperm acrosomal hyaluronidase has an optimum pH of 3.75 and is not effected by freezing and thawing or refrigeration, but it is unstable at a pH below 3.0 or temperatures above 50°. The enzyme requires salt for stability and activity and is inhibited by Fe++ and Fe+++ ions or heparin but not by Mn++, Mg++, and Ca++ ions or EDTA. Partially purified acrosomal hyaluronidase from rabbit spermatozoa possesses the same properties. The molecular weight of the hyaluronidase of bull sperm acrosomal extracts was estimated to be 110,000 by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-100 column. The acrosomal proteinase-proteinase inhibitor complex appeared as a separate fraction with a molecular weight of 68,000. The activity of bull testicular hyaluronidase as well as bull sperm acrosomal hyaluronidase is inhibited by rabbit immunoantisera prepared against bull testicular hyaluronidase preparations or bull sperm acrosomal extracts. Immunodiffusion experiments showed that bull testicular hyaluronidase and bull sperm acrosomal hyaluronidase preparations have only one component in common. This component was demonstrated to be the hyaluronidase. The results suggest that sperm acrosomal hyaluronidase is identical with testicular hyaluronidase but is apparently different from lysosomal hyaluronidase, present in organs other than the testis."
https://openalex.org/W2101797966,"Abstract The separation of folate compounds has been achieved by gel chromatography and the effect of buffer concentration on the elution pattern of folate derivatives was investigated by Sephadex G-15 and G-25 column chromatography. Highly conjugated polyglutamates appear in the effluent considerably sooner when eluted with water than would be expected from their molecular weights. Monoglutamates, except 10-formyltetrahydropteroylglutamic acid, are retarded on G-15 and G-25 in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) solvent system; the situation becomes more apparent as the buffer concentration is increased. Chromatography on Sephadex G-25 with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol gives a satisfactory separation of pteroylpolyglutamates containing 2 to 7 glutamic acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1488241419,"Abstract Citrate transport in Bacillus subtilis is dependent on the presence of Mg2+. Other divalent cations like Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ can replace magnesium ions. 28Mg2+ or 54Mn2+ are taken up by the cells simultaneously with the uptake of citrate. Cells which are not induced for citrate transport do not show the citrate-dependent uptake of either 54Mn2+ or 28Mg2+. Citrate transport and the citrate-dependent transport of a divalent cation are inhibited by the uncoupling agent m-chlorophenyl carbonylcyanidehydrazone. Therefore, using this uncoupler, it is possible to distinguish between the citrate-independent binding of divalent cations to the cell surface and the citrate-dependent transport of these ions across the cytoplasmic membrane. The kinetic constants of citrate uptake and of citrate-dependent Mg2+ transport are very similar. Citrate transport may be stoichiometrically reduced by limiting the concentrations of Mg2+. Our results suggest that a complex of citrate and Mg2+ is the transported substrate. The coupled transport of citrate and Mg2+ does function normally in a Co2+-resistant mutant of B. subtilis which is defective in another transport system of high affinity for Mg2+. The efflux of phosphate from B. subtilis cells during uptake of citrate is too slow to account for electroneutrality of the system. No cotransport of K+ and citrate can be demonstrated. Valinomycin inhibits the citrate-Mg2+ transport activity, which can be restored by the addition of external K+. In a potassium-retention mutant of B. subtilis, citrate transport activity decreases in parallel with the loss of K+ from these cells. Thus a high concentration of K+ inside the cells is necessary for the proper function of the citrate-Mg2+ transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1529198736,"Abstract Epithelial cells from freshly isolated mammary glands of mature virgin mice make minute amounts of casein and exhibit low levels of lactose synthetase A-protein (a UDP-galactosyltransferase) activity. They have barely detectable lactose synthetase B-protein (α-lactalbumin) activity. When cultured in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin, mammary explants from mature virgin mice develop the capacity to synthesize these milk proteins asynchronously. Casein synthesis and A-protein activity reach their maxima after 72 hours of exposure to the hormones and 24 hours before the emergence of B-protein activity. Estradiol-17β, or prolactin, priming of mature virgin mice reduces the time required for the development of B-protein activity in the mammary explants, while the time course of casein synthesis and appearance of A-protein activity is not appreciably affected. As a result, the secretory proteins, casein and α-lactalbumin, develop synchronously. This represents a heretofore undiscovered manifestation of the influence of prolactin in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1592483023,"Abstract The gene encoding threonine synthetase has been located by genetic transformation in Bacillus subtilis. Its position is adjacent and central to the genes encoding homoserine dehydrogenase and homoserine kinase. Its mutational sites are closely linked to, and interspersed among, several mutational sites affecting a minor but phenotypically significant threonine dehydratase (distinct from the major, biosynthetic threonine dehydratase of B. subtilis). This minor dehydratase activity differs from the biosynthetic threonine dehydratase in several important respects. (a) It accounts, when derepressed, for only 4% of the total threonine dehydratase activity of normal cells. (b) The genes encoding the two enzymes are separated by more than half of the chromosome. (c) It has a Michaelis constant for l-threonine nearly 10 times as large as that of the biosynthetic enzyme. (d) It is only mildly inhibited by l-isoleucine. (e) It requires phosphate ions for activity. Enzymatic studies with mutant strains show that both threonine synthetase and the minor dehydratase are concomitantly altered by single mutational events, while strains missing both activities regain both by reverse mutation at single gene frequency (10-8). Furthermore, transformation studies utilizing sheared DNA at low concentrations show that single, indivisible mutational sites affect both activities. Finally, both enzyme activities, partially purified from a strain derepressed for the enzymes of threonine production, co-fractionate to over 200-fold purification through standard protein purification procedures. These findings, together with the mutant studies, are an indication that the minor threonine dehydratase of B. subtilis is a secondary activity of threonine synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1986360635,"Some neurons in the visual cortex of awake monkeys visually tracking a moving target showed receptive fields that were excited only by stimulus motion relative to a background, while other neurons responded to any kind of stimulus motion. This result was found with two methods, one in which tracking eye movements were identical in both relative-motion and absolute-motion conditions, and another in which stimulus motions on the retina were identical in both conditions. This response pattern can differentiate translation of the retinal image during eye movement from motion of objects in the world."
https://openalex.org/W2243998910,"Abstract EDTA, added either alone or with equimolar concentrations of CaCl2 or MgCl2, was without effect on the increase in fat cell glucose oxidation due to insulin, vitamin K5, menadione, or sucrose hyperosmolarity. In contrast, EDTA markedly inhibited the action of cysteine, glutathione, and an insulin-like factor from serum on fat cell glucose metabolism. The inhibition by EDTA was greater on high concentrations of cysteine (1.5 or 2 mm) than lower concentrations (0.5 or 1 mm). In fat cells incubated in a 3% albumin medium which had been incubated for 30 min with 2 mm cysteine prior to addition of EDTA and cells, EDTA was ineffective in blocking the action of cysteine. The stimulation by cysteine, glutathione, and vitamin K5 of white fat cell glucose oxidation was inhibited in the absence of albumin while the response to insulin or sucrose hyperosmolarity was unaffected. The effect of albumin on the action of cysteine was biphasic. The stimulatory effect of 0.05 or 0.5 mm cysteine was about 3-fold greater than 1.5 mm cysteine in the presence of 0.75% albumin while with 3% albumin present the response of cells to 1.5 and 0.5 mm cysteine was maximal and that to 0.05 mm cysteine was nearly abolished. Dialysis of albumin reduced its ability to support the effect of cysteine as did passage over Sephadex G-50. The stimulation by cysteine and glutathione of glucose metabolism was inhibited by almost 90% if fat cells were incubated in albumin which had been exposed to 3.3 mm phenanthroline and then chromatographed on Sephadex G-50 while the increase due to insulin was diminished by only 25%. Cu++ at 3 x 10-6 and 10-5 m, but not 10-4 m, restored the stimulatory effect of cysteine on fat cell glucose metabolism in the presence of the phenanthroline, Sephadex-treated albumin. These results indicate that the stimulatory effects of cysteine on white fat cell glucose utilization involve a mechanism dependent on the presence of divalent copper."

https://openalex.org/W1526955738,"Abstract Glycogen synthetase was extensively purified from swine kidney by a procedure involving adsorption to calcium phosphate gel, ammonium sulfate fractionation, precipitation with ethanol, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The enzyme was purified more than 10,000-fold to a final specific activity of 9.1 µmoles of glucose transferred from UDP-d-glucose to glycogen per min per mg of protein at 37°. Yields of 15 to 30% of the activity present in the crude extracts were consistently obtained by this isolation procedure. The purified enzyme was converted to an inactive form by washed kidney particulate preparations. When a step involving incubation in the presence of these particulate fractions, ATP, and magnesium ion was included in the purification procedure, only the form of glycogen synthetase dependent on the presence of glucose 6-phosphate for activity was isolated. The stability of the enzyme at all stages of purification was greatly increased in the presence of 0.3 m sucrose and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The final preparation was essentially homogeneous as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, elution profiles from DEAE-cellulose, Bio-Gel A1.5 and Sepharose 6B columns, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The purified preparation was free of protein kinases which convert glycogen synthetase to an inactive form. The enzyme was also completely free of phosphofructokinase, phosphorylase kinase, phosphorylase, and protein phosphatases when measured with phosphorylase a, phosphoglucomutase, casein, phosvitin, and glycogen synthetase labeled with 32P as substrates. The molecular weight of kidney glycogen synthetase calculated from data obtained by sucrose density centrifugation and chromatography on Sepharose 6B was 370,000. Analysis of the amino acid composition indicated a high ratio of acidic to basic residues, which may account in part for the tight binding of the enzyme to DEAE-cellulose columns. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the denatured enzyme in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride indicated that four polypeptide chains were present in the native enzyme. These results were confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate which showed that the enzyme contained 4 subunits with molecular weights of 92,000 ± 3,000. Some of the kinetic properties of the active and inactive forms of kidney glucogen synthetase were examined. Glucose-6-P stimulated the activity of the inactive form of the enzyme. There was no activity in the absence of glucose-6-P and the Km for UDP-glucose was 1.1 x 10-4 m at 1 mm glucose-6-P and 6.7 x 10-5 m at 11 mm glucose-6-P. The Km of the active form of the enzyme for UDP-glucose was 8.7 x 10-4 m, and the activity was increased only slightly in the presence of glucose-6-P. The Km of the active form of the enzyme for UDP-glucose was about 15 times greater than that of the inactive form. The purified enzyme preparation was completely free of glycogen, and no activity was observed in the absence of this primer. Increasing concentrations of glycogen affected the activity of both forms of the enzyme in a similar manner."
https://openalex.org/W130857140,"Abstract We describe a purification scheme for human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase. Following two ammonium sulfate fractionations, batchwise absorption on CM-cellulose, chromatography on CM-cellulose with fructose 1,6-diphosphate elution, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, a 30,000-fold purification was achieved with a yield of 8% from the original hemolysate. Antiserum against partially purified pyruvate kinase was prepared in rabbits and used to follow the subsequent purification of the enzyme. Catalase and immunoglobulin G were identified by immunodiffusion as components of the impure preparation. Isoelectric focusing of partially purified pyruvate kinase gave a single activity peak with an isoelectric point of 7.1 at 4°. The final product was homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. No free NH2-terminal amino acids could be detected. Sedimentation velocity analysis gave a major peak and a faster migrating, minor peak corresponding to 5% of the total. We suggest that the minor peak is due to aggregation of the major component. From sedimentation equilibrium analysis a molecular weight of 225,400 was obtained for the purified pyruvate kinase. The amino acid composition is presented."

Dissociation of the immunoadsorbent-virus complex with 0.75 molar sodium chloride and then with a glycine-hydrochloride gradient released infective particles resembling picornaviruses. The elution profile suggests that two different types of virus-antibody complexes are formed, one dissociated by sodium chloride and another that requires glycine-hydrochloride in addition to sodium chloride for release of virus."

The homogeneity in length of poly(4) regions is observed in 70S RNA from visna virus and all RNA tumor viruses tested, and not with other types of RNA. By this criterion visna virus resembles RNA tumor viruses."
https://openalex.org/W66437937,"Abstract Fractions enriched in neuronal and glial cells from rat brain were assayed for their ability to incorporate 14C-labeled serine, ethanolamine, and choline into lipids in vitro. It was found that these precursors were incorporated into their respective phospholipids by mainly a simple non-energy-dependent, Ca+2-requiring reaction rather than by de novo synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497955157,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of an unusual adult hemoglobin chain, termed 3α, is delineated for 107 of 141 residues from gorilla. The sequence of the remainder of positions from gorilla as well as those in a similar 3α chain from chimpanzee are inferred from peptide composition and homology with the sequence of the major α chains. The eight to nine amino acid differences between 3α and the major α chains are scattered throughout the chain and similar for both gorilla and chimpanzee proteins. The extent of the differences suggests that the genesis of the 3α gene much antedated speciation among the great apes and that man, in whom 3α chains have not yet been detected, may also possess the 3α locus. Trace hemoglobins containing 3α chains were found, among 14 gorillas in only a father and son; a comparable hemoglobin was found only once among 37 chimpanzees. Electrophoretic and immunological features suggest that 3α gene products are indeed absent in most animals and not merely rendered undetectable by the mass of hemoglobin A. A clue to the inactivity of the 3α gene in most animals and its appearance in a few is the occurrence of serine/asparagine or aspartic acid heterogeneity at position 131, 133, or 138 of the 3α chain from one gorilla. Such heterogeneity suggests that two allele products are produced. Genetic and other features make it unlikely that this biallelic expression is the result of a reversion mutation in each of two 3α alleles and support the notion that 3α products are normally absent because of a nearly ubiquitous nonsense mutation which has been suppressed in a few animals by mutation at some non-hemoglobin locus."

https://openalex.org/W1514331378,"Abstract The deoxythymidylate phosphohydrolase (dTMPase) induced by Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage PBS2 (whose DNA contains uracil instead of thymine) has been partially purified and shown to possess deoxyuridylate phosphohydrolase (dUMPase) activity. The similarities of induction period, pH dependence, heat and trypsin inactivation, sulfhydryl reagent and fluoride inhibition, metal ion effects, kinetic constants for substrates and products, and apparent molecular weight suggest that a single enzyme catalyzes both dTMPase and dUMPase reactions. Although the PBS2 phosphohydrolase is active on many different deoxyribonucleotide derivatives of 4-hydroxypyrimidine and 6-hydroxypurine, it displays a strong preference for dTMP (apparent Km of 10-5 m versus 10-3 m for dUMP). This phage-induced phosphohydrolase may be responsible for the exclusion of thymine from PBS2 DNA during PBS2 phage infection, by eliminating the substrate (dUMP) and the product (dTMP) of the B. subtilis thymidylate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1509779197,"Erythroid ferritin was isolated from tadpole red blood cells, an unusually abundant source, with an iron content of 12%. The apoprotein was characterized by sedimentation equilibrium studies, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, and by determination of amino acid composition. Tadpole red cell apoferritin has a molecular weight of 478,000, a subunit size of 19,600, and an amino acid composition similar to that of horse spleen apoferritin, particularly in its proline content. However, there is little or no cysteine in the tadpole protein in contrast to that from horse spleen; two other tadpole red cell proteins also have little or no cysteine. The amount of ferritin in amphibian red blood cells decreased from 0.9% of the soluble protein in the tadpole to 0.08% in the frog as measured immunologically; ferritin could not be detected in lysates of frog cells using gel electrophoresis. A large non-hemoglobin iron pool in the tadpole red cell was indicated not only by the amount of ferritin but also by the observation that cell suspensions could incorporate 14C-amino acids into hemoglobin without incorporating 59Fe into hemoglobin. Red cell suspensions from adult frogs incorporated 14C-amino acids and 59Fe into hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1561994208,"Abstract Transcarboxylase labeled with 60Co or 65Zn was isolated and purified to near homogeneity from Propionibacterium shermanii. The enzyme which is a metallo-biotin enzyme, was found to contain 7 to 8 g atoms of zinc plus cobalt per mole of transcarboxylase (molecular weight ∼790,000). The 60Co- or 65Zn-labeled enzymes were dissociated under controlled conditions to yield subunits with s20,w ≃ 12 and 6 S, which were separated by density gradient centrifugation. The 6 S subunit contains the metals and the 12 S subunit little or none. The 6 S subunit dissociates further to a subunit containing the metals and to the biotin containing carboxyl carrier protein. The metals in transcarboxylase as well as in the subunits are tightly bound. Only small amounts of the bound cobalt or zinc are removed when transcarboxylase labeled with these metals is passed over Sephadex equilibrated with 10 mm o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline 5-sulfonate, or EDTA. Dialysis at alkaline or neutral pH does not remove the metals but some is removed when the enzyme is dialyzed at acidic pH values (pH 5, 4.5, or 4). Dialysis against 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or 4 to 6 m urea causes release of the metals but these conditions cause irreversible dissociation of the enzyme to its constituent peptides."

https://openalex.org/W1593295818,"Abstract The catalysis of the energy-linked transhydrogenation reaction of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores is dependent upon a soluble protein, the transhydrogenase factor. This factor can be detached from the chromatophore membrane by the relatively mild procedures of extensive washing, passage of chromatophores through Sephadex G-200, or sedimentation of chromatophores through a dense sucrose solution. Fractionation of the crude factor preparation on DEAE-Sephadex yields a highly purified protein which is resolved on polyacrylamide gels into two bands of apparent equal concentration. The transhydrogenase factor has no noticeable flavin absorption, is heat-inactivated, trypsin-sensitive, and has a molecular weight of about 70,000. It contains sulfhydryl groups which are essential for its activity. A soluble, oligomycin-insensitive Mg++ - dependent ATPase protein isolated from R. rubrum chromatophores has been successfully used together with the transhydrogenase factor in reconstitution experiments with chromatophore particles resolved with respect to these two factors."

These regions were distributed throughout the whole molecule of DNA. The susceptible regions were richer in A and T than the over-all composition of the parent DNA, regardless of whether the parent was A + T-rich or C + G-rich DNA. In the digested material C = G, A = T, therefore both strands were attacked simultaneously."

https://openalex.org/W1517427560,"Abstract Analyses of the carbohydrate chains of prothrombin indicated that each chain contained sialic acid, galactose, mannose, and glucosamine in the ratio of 2 to 3:2:3:4 to 6, respectively. Based on the galactose content of whole prothrombin there are four carbohydrate chains per enzyme molecule. Enzymatic degradation of the external carbohydrate indicated that the sequence was [see PDF for equation] The inner carbohydrate was resistant to enzymatic attack and consisted of about one-third of the total mannose and one-half of the total N-acetylglucosamine residues. It was shown that the carbohydrate chain was not attached to serine or threonine and that it is probably linked to asparagine. The α and β anomeric forms of galactose were present in about a 1:1 ratio. Glycopeptides containing α- and β-galactosidic bonds could be partially separated, indicating that the two anomers are incorporated into specific carbohydrate chains and are not randomly dispersed. The carbohydrate content and enzymatic degradation revealed few differences between the remainder of the carbohydrate in the α- and β-galactose-containing glycopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1598602866,"Abstract Two distinct deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activities have been purified from extracts of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Fraction I may be prepared from log phase and stationary phase cells. Fraction II appears initially in late log phase and increases to a maximum of 45% of the total DNA polymerase activity found in extracts of stationary phase cells. Fraction I and Fraction II have been purified approximately 1000-fold and 350-fold, respectively. Sedimentation coefficients of the two enzymes were 5.2 ± 0.1 S (78,000 molecular weight) for Fraction I and 5.8 ± 0.1 S (92,000 molecular weight) for Fraction II. Although the pH optima and magnesium titration curves for the two fractions were similar, several significant differences in their catalytic behavior were observed. Fraction I used either native or denatured primer-template DNA from L. acidophilus with equal efficiency. The addition of spermidine caused a 4-fold stimulation in activity of Fraction I assayed on denatured DNA. Fraction II showed a preference for native DNA in the absence of spermidine and used native or denatured DNA equally well with spermidine present. Fraction I was much less sensitive to inactivation by parahydroxymercuribenzoate than Fraction II, and the two fractions had dissimilar manganese titration curves. Thermal inactivation curves at 45° provided further evidence that the two fractions were different, and similar studies with mixed extracts suggested that the two polymerases may interact with each other."
https://openalex.org/W1610788898,"Abstract We measured the kinetics of absorbance changes at 296 nm occurring on addition to or removal of magnesium from brewers' and bakers' yeast enolase A, B, or a mixture of these. The stopped flow apparatus was equipped with a highly stabilized Xenon arc light source and an on-line computer was used to record and process all data. When excess magnesium is added to partially dissociated enolase, we obtain a rapid absorbance change within the dead time of the instrument, a protein concentration-dependent change, and finally a first order change. The initial absorbance change is probably the result of magnesium binding to both monomeric and dimeric enzyme. The protein concentration-dependent change is from subunit association. The final change parallels recovery of enzymatic activity. The rates of these reactions are slower in 1 m potassium chloride, which evidently reduces the rate of subunit association. The source of the enolase, the isozymic form of the enzyme, and the age and storage conditions determine how readily the enzyme dissociates in the absence of metal. The initial activity of enzyme is inversely proportional to the absorbance changes observed in the stopped flow, that is, to the extent of dissociation. Associated enzyme is fully active within 4 ms of binding magnesium, suggesting that magnesium binding to yeast enolase monomers is not requisite for subunit association. On addition of EDTA to enzyme containing endogenous magnesium, two successive first order reactions occur, following an absorbance change within the dead time of the instrument. This occurs whether the enzyme dissociates under these conditions or not, showing that these transitions do not correspond to those seen on addition of magnesium. Consequently, at least four transitions occur in the enzyme on removal of magnesium. We conclude that magnesium can affect the subunit association equilibrium simply by binding preferentially to the dimeric form of enolase."
https://openalex.org/W1507874308,Abstract Human carbonic anhydrase B was converted into large peptides for use in sequence analysis by cleaving the molecule with cyanogen bromide at the methionine residues and by tryptic digestion. A relatively large amount of insoluble tryptic digestion products was obtained which consisted of partially hydrolyzed peptides. Some were soluble in guanidine HCl and could be fractionated by gel filtration to give a series of large overlapping peptides useful in sequence analyses. A linear model of the enzyme has been constructed which shows the positions of residues cleaved to provide these peptides.
