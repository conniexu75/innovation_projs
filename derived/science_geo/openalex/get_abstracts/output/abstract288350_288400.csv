https://openalex.org/W1969020799,"The luciferase gene from the firefly, Photinus pyralis, was used as a reporter of gene expression by light production in transfected plant cells and transgenic plants. A complementary DNA clone of the firefly luciferase gene under the control of a plant virus promoter (cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter) was introduced into plant protoplast cells (Daucus carota) by electroporation and into plants (Nicotiana tabacum) by use of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens tumor-inducing plasmid. Extracts from electroporated cells (24 hours after the introduction of DNA) and from transgenic plants produce light when mixed with the substrates luciferin and adenosine triphosphate. Light produced by the action of luciferase was also detected in undisrupted leaves or cells in culture from transgenic plants incubated in luciferin and in whole transgenic plants ""watered"" with luciferin. Although light was detected in most organs in intact, transgenic plants (leaves, stems, and roots), the pattern of luminescence appeared to reflect both the organ-specific distribution of luciferase and the pathway for uptake of luciferin through the vasculature of the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2035492077,"Sediments of the early Mesozoic Newark Supergroup of eastern North America consist largely of sedimentary cycles produced by the rise and fall of very large lakes that responded to periodic climate changes controlled by variations in the earth's orbit. Fourier analysis of long sections of the Late Triassic Lockatong and Passaic formations of the Newark Basin show periods in thickness of 5.9, 10.5, 25.2, 32.0, and 96.0 meters corresponding to periodicities in time of roughly 25,000, 44,000, 100,0003,, 13000 and 400,000 years, as judged by radiometric time scales and varve-calibrated sedimentation rates. The ratios of the shortest cycle with longer cycles correspond closely to the ratios of the present periods of the main orbital terms that appear to influence climate. Similar long sequences of sedimentary cycles occur through most of the rest of the Newark Supergroup spanning a period of more than 40 million years. This is strong evidence of orbital forcing of climate in the ice-free early Mesozoic and indicates that the main periods of the orbital cycles were not very different 200 million years ago from those today."
https://openalex.org/W1996596446,"The vertical flux of nitrate across the thermocline in the upper ocean imposes a rigorous constraint on the rate of export of organic carbon from the surface layer of the sea. This export is the primary means by which the oceans can serve as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. For the oligotrophic open ocean regions, which make up more than 75% of the world's ocean, the rate of export is currently uncertain by an order of magnitude. For most of the year, the vertical flux of nitrate is that due to vertical turbulent transport of deep water rich in nitrate into the relatively impoverished surface layer. Direct measurements of rates of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation, coupled with highly resolved vertical profiles of nitrate and density in the oligotrophic eastern Atlantic showed that the rate of transport, averaged over 2 weeks, was 0.14 (0.002 to 0.89, 95% confidence interval) millimole of nitrate per square meter per day and was statistically no different from the integrated rate of nitrate uptake as measured by incorporation of (15)N-labeled nitrate. The stoichiometrically equivalent loss of carbon from the upper ocean, which is the relevant quantity for the carbon dioxide and climate question, is then fixed at 0.90 (0.01 to 5.70) millimole of carbon per square meter per day. These rates are much lower than recent estimates based on in situ changes in oxygen over annual scales; they are consistent with a biologically unproductive oligotrophic ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1980861940,"Extensive deposits of kaolinite in Florida are formed by transformation of montmorillonite during low-temperature supergene weathering. The transformation occurs by intracrystalline leaching of interlayer cations and tetrahedral silica layers. Interposition of stripped layers within montmorillonite creates a regular 1:1 mixedlayered montmorillonite-kaolinite, a new clay structure. Kaolin-like layers are nourished by lateral epitaxy, as the iron-rich montmorillonite decomposes. Hexagonal outgrowths of new kaolinite develop at the edges of montmorillonite flakes and nucleate new vertical growth. Kaolinitic sands impregnated with goethite are ultimately formed, and the released silica enriches groundwater and forms secondary chert."
https://openalex.org/W1967412223,A review of the known crystal structures containing the uranyl ion shows that plane-pentagon coordination is equally as prevalent as planesquare or plane-hexagon. It is suggested that puckered-hexagon configurations of OH(-) or H(2)O about the uranyl group will tend to revert to plane-pentagon coordination. The concept oft of pentagonal coordination is invoked for possible explanations of the complex crystallography of the natural tiranyl hydroxides and the unusual behavior of polynuclear ions in hydrolyzed uranyl solutions.
https://openalex.org/W2085574160,"Organic single crystals provide an ideal model for studying the factors that influence chemical processes in structured media. Reaction trajectories are well defined and reveal the influence of spontaneous mechanical stresses equivalent to tens of thousands of atmospheres. Analysis of molecular and crystal structures helps to explain both local mechanical properties, which influence reactions, and bulk properties such as melting point, compressibility, and surface energy."
https://openalex.org/W2082789776,"An inverse relationship between a volume estimated to be associated with interphase chromosomes and acute lethal exposure to x-or gamma radiation has been found in 16 plant species. The apparent differences in radiosensitivities found would seem spurious, since the estimated average energy absorbed in the nucleus per chromosome (3.6 x 10(6) ev) approaches a constant (variation less than fourfold) in spite of wide ranges of lethal exposures (0.6 to 75 kr), of nuclear volumes (43 to 1758 micro(3)), and of somatic chromosome numbers (6 to 136). The regression line obtained can be used to predict the radiosensitivities of other plant species if their nuclear volumes and chromosome numbers are known."
https://openalex.org/W1979409280,"In an established colony a subordinate monkey repeatedly pr essed a lever which stimulated the caudate nucleus of the boss monkey by radio and inhibited his aggressive behavior. In other experiments, timed stimulations of the posteroventral nucleus of the thalamus of the boss monkey, paired with a tone, increased his aggressiveness and established conditioned escape responses of the whole group. Both types of experiments may be useful in neurophysiological and pharmacological investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2039705870,"Optical fiber is rapidly becoming the transmission medium of choice for new telecommunication systems. For a true lightwave network to evolve, however, optical control devices such as optical switches and multiplexer-demultiplexers will be essential. Optical guided-wave devices built with photolithographic fabrication techniques and electro-optic substrates are compact, low drive power devices that provide these functions. Research is particularly advanced on integrated-optic devices based on waveguides formed by titanium diffused into lithium niobate. Switch arrays, tunable filters, and high-speed modulators have been demonstrated and used in research systems experiments."

Some recordings of electrical activity in pupae of the cecropia silkworm (in which the brain is considered to be electrically ""silent"" during diapause) suggest that at least some activity is maintained, but possibly it is restricted to certain regions of the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2043629336,"Corn seeds of a special genetic stock were recovered from two satellite flights and the plants grown from them were examined for abnor malities. Some evidence for a slight increase in chromosomal deletions was observed, which was predicted from the flux of heavy cosmic ray primary particles. Nothing unexpected was observed."

https://openalex.org/W2000802974,"Determination of the amino acid composition of coelomic hemerythrin from Golfingia gouldii shows 3 arginine residues and 10 to 11 lysine residues per protein subunit of 13,500 molecular weight. On this basis, the 28 to 30 major peptide spots revealed by electrophoresis and chromatography of tryptic hydrolysates would indicate two kinds of subunit. However, similar evidence from chymotryptic hydrolyses is not unequivocal, since the number of peptide spots is also compatible with an assumption of only one kind of chain. In addition to indicating the possible existence of two types of subunit, the peptide maps of enzymic digests of hemerythrin from individual animals shows at least one and perhaps more differences in peptide composition."
https://openalex.org/W2091938192,"The international debt crisis arose from imprudent borrowing, imprudent lending, and major shocks to the world economy from 1980 to 1982. The initial impulse in 1982 was to treat the debt problem as one of illiquidity and thus provide further lending while the debtor countries tried to adjust to the shock. This strategy produced massive recessions in the major debtors (mostly in Latin America) and led in 1985 to the Baker plan, the aim of which is to find ways to permit the debtor countries to resume growth while not defaulting on the debt. The Mexican case is highlighted."

https://openalex.org/W1994126007,"The protons in crystal structures can be related to the oxygen lattice through several spatial arrangements. In orthosilicates (for example, hydrogarnets), so-called tetrahedral hydroxyls have been demonstrated by indirect methods. Similar methods, when applied to kehoeite and viséite, lead to the conclusion that (H(3)O(2))(-) units can occur in the framework of analcime, a structure in which all apexes of oxygen tetrahedra are shared."
