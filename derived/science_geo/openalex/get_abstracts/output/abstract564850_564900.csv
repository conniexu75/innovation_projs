https://openalex.org/W2500474003,"Given the important role of the brain in regulating endurance performance, this comparative study sought to determine whether professional road cyclists have superior inhibitory control and resistance to mental fatigue compared to recreational road cyclists.After preliminary testing and familiarization, eleven professional and nine recreational road cyclists visited the lab on two occasions to complete a modified incongruent colour-word Stroop task (a cognitive task requiring inhibitory control) for 30 min (mental exertion condition), or an easy cognitive task for 10 min (control condition) in a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over order. After each cognitive task, participants completed a 20-min time trial on a cycle ergometer. During the time trial, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded.The professional cyclists completed more correct responses during the Stroop task than the recreational cyclists (705±68 vs 576±74, p = 0.001). During the time trial, the recreational cyclists produced a lower mean power output in the mental exertion condition compared to the control condition (216±33 vs 226±25 W, p = 0.014). There was no difference between conditions for the professional cyclists (323±42 vs 326±35 W, p = 0.502). Heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and RPE were not significantly different between the mental exertion and control conditions in both groups.The professional cyclists exhibited superior performance during the Stroop task which is indicative of stronger inhibitory control than the recreational cyclists. The professional cyclists also displayed a greater resistance to the negative effects of mental fatigue as demonstrated by no significant differences in perception of effort and time trial performance between the mental exertion and control conditions. These findings suggest that inhibitory control and resistance to mental fatigue may contribute to successful road cycling performance. These psychobiological characteristics may be either genetic and/or developed through the training and lifestyle of professional road cyclists."
https://openalex.org/W2488170494,"Phoenix dactylifera L (Date palm) is a native plant of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and other Middle Eastern countries. Ajwa date has been described in the traditional and alternative medicine to provide several health benefits including anticholesteremic, antioxidant, hepatoprotective and anticancer effects, but most remains to be scientifically validated. Herein, we evaluated the anticancer effects of the Methanolic Extract of Ajwa Date (MEAD) on human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7) cells in vitro.MCF7 cells were treated with various concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/ml) of MEAD for 24, 48 and 72 h and changes in cell morphology, cell cycle, apoptosis related protein and gene expression were studied.Phase contrast microscopy showed various morphological changes such as cell shrinkage, vacuolation, blebbing and fragmentation. MTT (2-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay demonstrated statistically significant dose-dependent inhibitions of MCF7 cell proliferation from 35% to 95%. Annexin V-FITC and TUNEL assays showed positive staining for apoptosis of MCF7 cells treated with MEAD (15 mg and 25 mg for 48 h). Flow cytometric analyses of MCF7 cells with MEAD (15 mg/ml and 20 mg/ml) for 24 h demonstrated cell cycle arrest at 'S' phase; increased p53, Bax protein expression; caspase 3activation and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed up-regulation of p53, Bax, Fas, and FasL and down-regulation of Bcl-2.MEAD inhibited MCF7 cells in vitro by the inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our results indicate the anticancer effects of Ajwa dates, which therefore may be used as an adjunct therapy with conventional chemotherapeutics to achieve a synergistic effect against breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2489898299,"A skeleton discovered in the Upper Cretaceous Sierra Barrosa Formation (Turonian-Coniacian) of Neuquén Province, Argentina represents a new species of theropod dinosaur related to the long snouted, highly pneumatized Megaraptoridae. The holotype specimen of Murusraptor barrosaensis n.gen et n.sp. (MCF-PVPH-411) includes much of the skull, axial skeleton, pelvis and tibia. Murusraptor is unique in having several diagnostic features that include anterodorsal process of lacrimal longer than height of preorbital process, and a thick, shelf-like thickening on the lateral surface of surangular ventral to the groove between the anterior surangular foramen and the insert for the uppermost intramandibular process of the dentary. Other characteristic features of Murusraptor barrosaensis n.gen. et n. sp.include a large mandibular fenestra, distal ends of caudal neural spines laterally thickened into lateral knob-like processes, short ischia distally flattened and slightly expanded dorsoventrally. Murusraptor belongs to a Patagonian radiation of megaraptorids together with Aerosteon, Megaraptor and Orkoraptor. In spite being immature, it is a larger but more gracile animal than existing specimens of Megaraptor, and is comparable in size with Aerosteon and Orkoraptor. The controversial phylogeny of the Megaraptoridae as members of the Allosauroidea or a clade of Coelurosauria is considered analyzing two alternative data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2506227063,"Cardiac fibrosis attributed to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins is a major cause of heart failure and death. Cardiac fibrosis is extremely difficult and challenging to treat in a clinical setting due to lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to cardiac fibrosis and effective anti-fibrotic therapies. The objective in this study was to examine whether unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway mediates cardiac fibrosis and whether a pharmacological intervention to modulate UPR can prevent cardiac fibrosis and preserve heart function.We demonstrate here that the mechanism leading to development of fibrosis in a mouse with increased expression of calreticulin, a model of heart failure, stems from impairment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, transient activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and stimulation of the TGFβ1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Remarkably, sustained pharmacologic inhibition of the UPR pathway by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is sufficient to prevent cardiac fibrosis, and improved exercise tolerance.We show that the mechanism leading to development of fibrosis in a mouse model of heart failure stems from transient activation of UPR pathway leading to persistent remodelling of cardiac tissue. Blocking the activation of the transiently activated UPR pathway by TUDCA prevented cardiac fibrosis, and improved prognosis. These findings offer a window for additional interventions that can preserve heart function."
https://openalex.org/W2481255288,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles (MVs), have emerged as a major form of intercellular communication, playing important roles in several physiological processes and diseases, including cancer. EVs generated by cancer cells contain a variety of proteins and RNA species that can be transferred between cancer cells as well as between cancer and non-transformed (normal) cells, thereby impacting a number of aspects of cancer progression. Here we show how oncogenic transformation influences the biogenesis and function of EVs using a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that can be induced to express an oncogenic form of diffuse B cell lymphoma (Dbl). Although MEFs induced to express onco-Dbl generated a similar amount of MVs as uninduced control cells, we found that MVs isolated from onco-Dbl-transformed cells contain a unique signaling protein, the ubiquitously expressed non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase. The addition of MVs isolated from MEFs expressing onco-Dbl to cultures of fibroblasts strongly promoted their survival and induced their ability to grow under anchorage-independent conditions, outcomes that could be reversed by knocking down focal adhesion kinase and depleting it from the MVs or by inhibiting its kinase activity using a specific inhibitor. We then showed the same to be true for MVs isolated from aggressive MDAMB231 breast cancer cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that the induction of oncogenic transformation gives rise to MVs, which uniquely contain a signaling protein kinase that helps propagate the transformed phenotype and thus may offer a specific diagnostic marker of malignant disease.

Classical intercellular signaling involves the secretion of growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins by a cell into its local environment (1Taylor D.D.

Extracellular vesicles: vehicles that spread cancer genes.BioEssays. 2012; 34: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells generate two distinct types of EVs: MVs and exosomes. MVs typically range in size from 0.2–2.0 μm in diameter and are formed via the budding and release (shedding) of membrane-enclosed packages from plasma membranes. Exosomes represent the second major class of EVs. They are significantly smaller than MVs, averaging only 0.03–0.1 μm in size, and are formed through a distinct mechanism. Specifically, exosomes are generated as a result of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport- and Rab-dependent rerouting of multivesicular bodies containing endosomes from the lysosome, where they would be degraded, to the cell surface. The multivesicular bodies then fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents (i.e. endosomes) into the extracellular environment, at which point they are referred to as exosomes. One of the main reasons why MVs and exosomes have been attracting a good deal of attention has to do with the cargo they contain, which includes cell surface receptors, cytosolic signaling proteins, metabolic enzymes, and even nuclear proteins, as well as RNA transcripts and microRNAs (1Taylor D.D.

This cargo is then used by the cell to elicit specific cellular processes or outcomes. Although it is beginning to be appreciated that both normal cell types and cancer cells generate MVs and exosomes, EVs have been most often studied in the context of cancer, where they have been shown to play important roles in the progression of the disease (4Antonyak M.A. Cerione R.A.

For example, MVs generated by highly aggressive human cancer cells are capable of stimulating tumor angiogenesis, reorganizing the stroma to establish the tumor microenvironment, as well as promote tumor growth and chemoresistance (10Liu Y.

Survivin is released from cancer cells via exosomes.Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The role of MVs in cancer progression was exemplified in a study showing that a highly oncogenic form of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), known as EGFR variant type III (EGFRvIII), is present in MVs generated by glioma cells engineered to express this truncated EGFR. When MVs from these glioma cells were isolated and then added to EGFRvIII-negative glioma cells, EGFRvIII was transferred from the MVs to the cells, where it triggered oncogenic signaling events that promoted cell growth and survival (8Al-Nedawi K. Meehan B. Micallef J. Lhotak V. May L. Guha A. Rak J. Intercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that cancer cell-derived MVs also impact the behavior of normal cell types that can be found bordering a tumor (13Heneberg P.

For example, our laboratory has shown that MVs generated by the highly aggressive MDAMB231 breast cancer cell line are capable of conferring a transformed-like phenotype onto normal mammary epithelial cells and fibroblasts, including the ability to grow under serum-limiting or anchorage-independent conditions. We further showed that an important aspect of the mechanism underlying the ability of MVs to mediate such phenotypic changes involved the cross-linking of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, which is associated with MVs, through the acyl transferase activity of another MV-associated protein, tissue transglutaminase. This enabled the MVs to dock onto normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts through the binding of the MV-associated cross-linked fibronectin to integrins on the surfaces of these cells (6Antonyak M.A. Li B. Boroughs L.K. Johnson J.L. Druso J.E. Bryant K.L. Holowka D.A. Cerione R.A.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4852-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In addition to EVs acting locally to promote tumor growth, they can also impact cells at distant sites through their ability to enter the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body. Thus, the isolation of EVs from blood samples is being actively pursued as a potential source of diagnostic information (15Skog J. Würdinger T. van Rijn S. Meijer D.H. Gainche L. Sena-Esteves M. Curry Jr., W.T. Carter B.S. Krichevsky A.M. Breakefield X.O. Glioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkers.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence have shown that high-grade/highly aggressive cancer cells shed considerably more EVs than lower-grade cancer cells and normal cells (16Di Vizio D. Morello M. Dudley A.C. Schow P.W. Adam R.M. Morley S. Mulholland D. Rotinen M. Hager M.H. Insabato L. Moses M.A. Demichelis F. Lisanti M.P. Wu H.

Pathol. 2012; 181: 1573-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In one such study, patients with malignant melanoma were found to have nearly twice the amount of EVs in their blood serum compared with normal patients (17Logozzi M. De Milito A. Lugini L. Borghi M. Calabro L. Spada M. Perdicchio M. Marino M.L. Federici C. Iessi E. Brambilla D. Venturi G. Lozupone F. Santinami M. Huber V. Maio M. Rivoltini L. Fais S. High levels of exosomes expressing CD63 and caveolin-1 in plasma of melanoma patients.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Moreover, a study conducted on glioblastoma patients found that the amount of EVs in the circulation increased proportionally to tumor volume (18Shao H. Chung J. Balaj L. Charest A. Bigner D.D. Carter B.S. Hochberg F.H. Breakefield X.O. Weissleder R. Lee H. Protein typing of circulating microvesicles allows real-time monitoring of glioblastoma therapy.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 1835-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggest that the levels of circulating EVs, and/or the cancer-specific cargo contained within these vesicles, could be used as potential diagnostic indicators. Given the importance of EVs in cancer progression, we set out to better understand the key differences between MVs generated by normal and transformed cells, as this information would shed additional light on how cancer cell-derived MVs impact recipient cells, as well as further examine their potential as diagnostic markers. Here, using an inducible model of cellular transformation, we show that the amount of MVs shed by non-transformed MEFs is comparable with that generated by MEFs transformed by inducing the expression of onco-Dbl (19Stalnecker C.A. Ulrich S.M. Li Y. Ramachandran S. McBrayer M.K. DeBerardinis R.J. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Mechanism by which a recently discovered allosteric inhibitor blocks glutamine metabolism in transformed cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a truncated guanine nucleotide exchange factor that constitutively activates members of the Rho family of small GTPases. However, we found that MVs from transformed MEFs were specifically enriched in the non-receptor tyrosine kinase FAK, despite this kinase being expressed at similar levels in both the non-transformed and transformed MEFs. We went on to determine that FAK is also preferentially expressed in MVs derived from several highly aggressive breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, we found that the presence of FAK in MVs from transformed MEFs as well as highly aggressive MDAMB231 breast cancer cells has important functional consequences: it enables MVs to promote cell survival and anchorage-independent growth. Overall, the findings reported here highlight that specific cargo is recruited to MVs upon oncogenic transformation, thus conferring these vesicles with unique functional capabilities. The formation and shedding of MVs by cells is now appreciated as a form of intercellular communication with important roles in human cancer progression. These vesicles are also being aggressively pursued as a novel source of diagnostic information. However, there still remains a gap in our understanding of how cancer cell-derived MVs mediate their effects and how we might best utilize their unique properties for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, we took advantage of a well defined, inducible system of oncogenic transformation to compare the cargo and functional properties of MVs isolated from transformed cells and their non-transformed counterparts. Specifically, this system involves MEFs that stably express a doxycycline-regulated form of onco-Dbl, a truncated guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the small GTPases Rho and Cdc42 (20Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. Signaling to the Rho GTPases: networking with the DH domain.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Olivo C. Vanni C. Mancini P. Silengo L. Torrisi M.R.

Cerione R.A. Manor D. Specific contributions of the small GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 to Dbl transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). When cultured in the presence of doxycycline, the expression of HA-tagged onco-Dbl in MEFs is inhibited (Fig. 1A, top panel, first lane). However, 24 h after placing the MEFs in medium lacking doxycycline, HA-tagged onco-Dbl is readily detected in lysates derived from these cells (Fig. 1A, compare the first and third lanes), with maximal expression occurring within 48 h (Fig. 1A, compare the third, fourth, and fifth lanes). Thus, for all the experiments where MEFs expressing onco-Dbl are used, we first induced its expression for 48 h prior to beginning the assays. As reported previously (19Stalnecker C.A. Ulrich S.M. Li Y. Ramachandran S. McBrayer M.K. DeBerardinis R.J. Cerione R.A. Erickson J.W. Mechanism by which a recently discovered allosteric inhibitor blocks glutamine metabolism in transformed cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), marked actin cytoskeletal rearrangements accompanied the expression of onco-Dbl and its activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho. Fig. 1B shows an example of an uninduced control MEF stained with an HA antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to label F-actin. The uninduced control MEFs, which lacked onco-Dbl expression (Fig. 1B, top left panel), showed a typical fibroblast-like morphology (Fig. 1B, top right panel). However, upon induction of HA-tagged onco-Dbl expression (Fig. 1B, bottom left panel), there was a significant increase in the number and size of F-actin stress fibers (Fig. 1B, bottom right panel). We then subjected the uninduced control and onco-Dbl-expressing MEFs to soft agar and cell death assays. Soft agar assays determine the ability of cells to grow and form colonies under anchorage-independent conditions, an in vitro measure of tumorigenicity. Fig. 1C, top panel, shows that, after 14 days in culture, the control MEFs remained as single cells. In contrast, the induction of HA-tagged onco-Dbl expression resulted in the formation of large colonies of cells (Fig. 1, C, bottom panel, and D). To examine how onco-Dbl expression influenced MEF viability, we then cultured uninduced control MEFs as well as MEFs induced to express HA-tagged onco-Dbl in medium lacking or containing serum for 48 h. The cells were then collected, stained with DAPI to label their nuclei, and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy for the appearance of condensed or blebbed nuclei, a hallmark of apoptosis. There was a nearly 18-fold increase in the number of control MEFs that died when cultured in serum-free medium compared with MEFs cultured in 2% serum (Fig. 1E, compare the first and second columns). However, onco-Dbl expression reduced the amount of cell death caused by serum starvation to a similar extent as culturing the control MEFs in 2% serum (Fig. 1E, compare the first and fourth columns). We next used the inducible model of cellular transformation to determine how MVs generated by normal (non-transformed) cells differ from those generated by transformed cells. Given that various studies have suggested that high-grade and highly aggressive cancer cells generate more EVs compared with either lower-grade cancer cells or their normal cellular counterparts (16Di Vizio D.

Med. 2012; 18: 1835-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), we asked whether uninduced control MEFs generated less MVs than MEFs expressing onco-Dbl. Control MEFs and MEFs expressing HA-tagged onco-Dbl were treated with the fluorescent membrane dye FM1–43FX and visualized using fluorescent microscopy. Fig. 2A shows that MVs could be detected along the surfaces of cells from both of these cultures. The MVs were then isolated from the conditioned media collected from an equivalent number of serum-starved control MEFs or MEFs expressing onco-Dbl using a method that involved a series of centrifugations to remove cells and cell debris, followed by a filtration step using a 0.22-μm filter (Fig. 2B). This approach allows for the separation of MVs from the population of smaller-sized EVs known as exosomes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) performed on the MV preparations revealed that EVs averaging ∼300–400 nm in diameter could indeed be routinely isolated from each of these cell cultures (Fig. 2C). A portion of these MV preparations were also lysed and analyzed by Western blotting to detect the MV marker protein flotillin. Fig. 2D, top panel, MVs, shows that flotillin is readily detectable in MVs isolated from both control MEFs and from cells expressing onco-Dbl. Importantly, the cytosolic signaling protein IκBα was only detected in the whole cell lysates (Fig. 2D, second panel, WCL), indicating that the MV preparations were devoid of cytosolic contaminants. These same MV preparations were also subjected to nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to determine the size and amount of MVs in each sample. Consistent with our TEM results, NTA showed that the MVs generated by these cells range in size from ∼200–700 nm, with most of them averaging ∼300–400 nm (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, this analysis also showed that the uninduced control MEFs actually shed slightly more MVs into their culturing medium than the MEFs expressing onco-Dbl (Fig. 2E), indicating that non-transferred cells are capable of generating equivalent, if not slightly greater, amounts of MVs than their transformed counterparts. We then set out to determine whether MVs generated by non-transformed MEFs, versus MVs from MEFs transformed by onco-Dbl, exhibit distinct functional capabilities. Thus, MVs generated by each of these cell types were isolated, quantified using NTA, and normalized based on MV number. The MVs were then added to cultures of serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells for 48 h (Fig. 3A), at which point the amount of cell death for each condition was determined by staining the cells with DAPI to identify condensed or blebbed (apoptotic) nuclei. Approximately 60–70% of the NIH-3T3 cells cultured in serum-free medium underwent cell death (Fig. 3B, first column). When NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with MVs derived from uninduced control MEFs, a modest reduction (∼30%) in cell death was observed (Fig. 3B, compare the first and third columns). Doubling the amount of these MVs did not reduce the extent of cell death further (Fig. 3B, compare the third and fourth columns), suggesting that a maximal MV dose for conferring a survival advantage had been achieved in these experiments. However, when NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with MVs from MEFs expressing onco-Dbl, the apoptotic rate was dramatically reduced and approached the extent of protection from cell death that was provided when culturing cells in 2% serum (Fig. 3B, compare the second and fifth columns). The ability of MVs derived from MEFs expressing onco-Dbl to induce the anchorage-independent growth (i.e. colony formation in soft agar) of the non-transformed NIH-3T3 cell line was also determined (Fig. 3A). As expected, NIH-3T3 cells either left untreated (no MVs) or treated with MVs from the uninduced control MEFs for 14 days remained primarily as single cells (Fig. 3C, left and center panels). However, when the same cells were treated with MVs derived from the transformed MEFs they began to form colonies (Fig. 3, C, right panel, and D, compare the first and second columns with the third column), similar to what was observed with MVs isolated from highly aggressive brain and breast cancer cells (6Antonyak M.A. Li B. Boroughs L.K. Johnson J.L. Druso J.E. Bryant K.L. Holowka D.A. Cerione R.A.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 4852-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MVs generated by transformed cells may contain distinct cargo that enables them to promote the anchorage-independent growth and survival of cells to a much greater degree compared with MVs isolated from non-transformed MEFs. To identify such cargo, lysates prepared from control and transformed cells, as well as the lysates of the MVs shed by these cells, were subjected to Western blotting analysis to detect proteins linked to cell survival. We examined MV lysates for the presence of a number of signaling proteins linked to cell survival. One that stood out was FAK, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed and/or hyperactive in many different cancer cell types, where it has been shown to participate in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype, including the evasion of apoptosis and promotion of anchorage-independent growth (23Shibue T.

https://openalex.org/W2491877212,"A screening instrument's ability to provide clinicians with consistent and reproducible information is crucial to intervention. Despite widespread acceptance and clinical use of the Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) in orthopedics and sports medicine, few studies have reported on its reliability and no such studies have concentrated on child or adolescent samples exclusively, segments of the population for which this instrument is often used. The purpose of the current study was to describe and report on the reliability and validity of the AKPS for use with high school female athletes participating in interscholastic athletics. The study was a secondary analysis of prospective epidemiologic data using established scale validation methods. The records of 414 female athletes 11.0 to 18.1 years of age (Mean 13.9 yrs, SD = 1.7 yrs) were used for analysis. Four different approaches to scoring and scale reduction of the AKPS were evaluated, including the original, ordinal 13-item form, a modified, ordinal 6-item form, a modified, dichotomous 13-item form, and a modified, dichotomous 6-item form. Three different types of reliability (internal consistency, equivalence across forms, standard error of measurement) and one type of validity (criterion-related) were estimated for the AKPS in the current sample. The four scoring formats of the AKPS scale were found to have high internal consistency (αcoef = 0.83 to 0.91), equivalence across the short and long forms (r = 0.98), acceptable standard errors of measurement (0.82 to 3.00), and moderate to high criterion related validity-as determined by physican's diagnosis: 0.92 (13-item form), 0.90 (6-item form). The Kujala AKPS is a valid and reliable measure of anterior knee pain and appropriate for use as an epidemiologic screening tool with adolescent female athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2503706510,"Although reinforcement learning (RL) is suitable for highly uncertain systems, the applicability of this class of algorithms to medical treatment may be limited by the patient variability which dictates individualised tuning for their usually multiple algorithmic parameters. This study explores the feasibility of RL in the framework of artificial pancreas development for type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this approach, an Actor-Critic (AC) learning algorithm is designed and developed for the optimisation of insulin infusion for personalised glucose regulation. AC optimises the daily basal insulin rate and insulin:carbohydrate ratio for each patient, on the basis of his/her measured glucose profile. Automatic, personalised tuning of AC is based on the estimation of information transfer (IT) from insulin to glucose signals. Insulin-to-glucose IT is linked to patient-specific characteristics related to total daily insulin needs and insulin sensitivity (SI). The AC algorithm is evaluated using an FDA-accepted T1D simulator on a large patient database under a complex meal protocol, meal uncertainty and diurnal SI variation. The results showed that 95.66% of time was spent in normoglycaemia in the presence of meal uncertainty and 93.02% when meal uncertainty and SI variation were simultaneously considered. The time spent in hypoglycaemia was 0.27% in both cases. The novel tuning method reduced the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, especially in patients with low SI."
https://openalex.org/W2480416543,"The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is the principal vector of the highly destructive citrus disease called Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening, which is a major threat to citrus cultivation worldwide. More effective pest control strategies against this pest entail the identification of potential chemosensory proteins that could be used in the development of attractants or repellents. However, the molecular basis of olfaction in the Asian citrus psyllid is not completely understood. Therefore, we performed this study to analyze the antennal and abdominal transcriptome of the Asian citrus psyllid. We identified a large number of transcripts belonging to nine chemoreception-related gene families and compared their expression in male and female adult antennae and terminal abdomen. In total, 9 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 12 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 46 odorant receptors (ORs), 20 gustatory receptors (GRs), 35 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 4 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and 4 different gene families encoding odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs): 80 cytochrome P450s (CYPs), 12 esterase (ESTs), and 5 aldehyde dehydrogenases (ADE) were annotated in the D. citri antennal and abdominal transcriptomes. Our results revealed that a large proportion of chemosensory genes exhibited no distinct differences in their expression patterns in the antennae and terminal abdominal tissues. Notably, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and quantitative real time-PCR (qPCR) analyses showed that 4 DictOBPs, 4 DictCSPs, 4 DictIRs, 1 DictSNMP, and 2 DictCYPs were upregulated in the antennae relative to that in terminal abdominal tissues. Furthermore, 2 DictOBPs (DictOBP8 and DictOBP9), 2 DictCSPs (DictOBP8 and DictOBP12), 4 DictIRs (DictIR3, DictIR6, DictIR10, and DictIR35), and 1 DictCYP (DictCYP57) were expressed at higher levels in the male antennae than in the female antennae. Our study provides the first insights into the molecular basis of chemoreception in this insect pest. Further studies on the identified differentially expressed genes would facilitate the understanding of insect olfaction and their role in the interactions between olfactory system and biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2493679865,"Hemodialysis using hollow-fiber membranes provides life-sustaining treatment for nearly 2 million patients worldwide with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, patients on hemodialysis have worse long-term outcomes compared to kidney transplant or other chronic illnesses. Additionally, the underlying membrane technology of polymer hollow-fiber membranes has not fundamentally changed in over four decades. Therefore, we have proposed a fundamentally different approach using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques to create thin-flat sheets of silicon-based membranes for implantable or portable hemodialysis applications. The silicon nanopore membranes (SNM) have biomimetic slit-pore geometry and uniform pores size distribution that allow for exceptional permeability and selectivity. A quantitative diffusion model identified structural limits to diffusive solute transport and motivated a new microfabrication technique to create SNM with enhanced diffusive transport. We performed in vitro testing and extracorporeal testing in pigs on prototype membranes with an effective surface area of 2.52 cm2 and 2.02 cm2, respectively. The diffusive clearance was a two-fold improvement in with the new microfabrication technique and was consistent with our mathematical model. These results establish the feasibility of using SNM for hemodialysis applications with additional scale-up."

Here, a novel multi-tiered systems biology approach was used to predict metabolites and signaling molecules potentially affected by the in vivo deletion of organic anion transporter 1 (Oat1, Slc22a6, originally NKT), a major kidney-expressed drug transporter. Validation of some predictions in wet-lab assays, together with re-evaluation of existing transport and knock-out metabolomics data, generated an experimentally validated, confidence ranked set of OAT1-interacting endogenous compounds enabling construction of an “OAT1-centered metabolic interaction network.” Pathway and enrichment analysis indicated an important role for OAT1 in metabolism involving: the TCA cycle, tryptophan and other amino acids, fatty acids, prostaglandins, cyclic nucleotides, odorants, polyamines, and vitamins. The partly validated reconstructed network is also consistent with a major role for OAT1 in modulating metabolic and signaling pathways involving uric acid, gut microbiome products, and so-called uremic toxins accumulating in chronic kidney disease. Together, the findings are compatible with the hypothesized role of drug transporters in remote inter-organ and inter-organismal communication: The Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis (Nigam, S. K. (2015) Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 14, 29). The fact that OAT1 can affect many systemic biological pathways suggests that drug-metabolite interactions need to be considered beyond simple competition for the drug transporter itself and may explain aspects of drug-induced metabolic syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2513706709,"During development, the Hippo signaling pathway regulates key physiological processes, such as control of organ size, regeneration, and stem cell biology. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a major transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway. The scaffold protein IQGAP1 interacts with more than 100 binding partners to integrate diverse signaling pathways. In this study, we report that IQGAP1 binds to YAP and modulates its activity. IQGAP1 and YAP co-immunoprecipitated from cells. In vitro analysis with pure proteins demonstrated a direct interaction between IQGAP1 and YAP. Analysis with multiple fragments of each protein showed that the interaction occurs via the IQ domain of IQGAP1 and the TEAD-binding domain of YAP. The interaction between IQGAP1 and YAP has functional effects. Knock-out of endogenous IQGAP1 significantly increased the formation of nuclear YAP-TEAD complexes. Transcription assays were performed with IQGAP1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HEK293 cells with IQGAP1 knockdown by CRISPR/Cas9. Quantification demonstrated that YAP-TEAD-mediated transcription in cells lacking IQGAP1 was significantly greater than in control cells. These data reveal that IQGAP1 binds to YAP and modulates its co-transcriptional function, suggesting that IQGAP1 participates in Hippo signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2485901231,"The earth is warming at an alarming rate, especially in the Arctic, where a marked decline in sea ice cover may have far-ranging consequences for endemic species. Little auks, endemic Arctic seabirds, are key bioindicators as they forage in the marginal ice zone and feed preferentially on lipid-rich Arctic copepods and ice-associated amphipods sensitive to the consequences of global warming. We tested how little auks cope with an ice-free foraging environment during the breeding season. To this end, we took advantage of natural variation in sea ice concentration along the east coast of Greenland. We compared foraging and diving behaviour, chick diet and growth and adult body condition between two years, in the presence versus nearby absence of sea ice in the vicinity of their breeding site. Moreover, we sampled zooplankton at sea when sea ice was absent to evaluate prey location and little auk dietary preferences. Little auks foraged in the same areas both years, irrespective of sea ice presence/concentration, and targeted the shelf break and the continental shelf. We confirmed that breeding little auks showed a clear preference for larger copepod species to feed their chick, but caught smaller copepods and nearly no ice-associated amphipod when sea ice was absent. Nevertheless, these dietary changes had no impact on chick growth and adult body condition. Our findings demonstrate the importance of bathymetry for profitable little auk foraging, whatever the sea-ice conditions. Our investigations, along with recent studies, also confirm more flexibility than previously predicted for this key species in a warming Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W2491263595,"The replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in DNA metabolism. RPA is able to unfold G-quadruplex (G4) structures formed by telomeric DNA sequences, a function important for telomere maintenance. To elucidate the mechanism through which RPA unfolds telomeric G4s, we studied its interaction with oligonucleotides that adopt a G4 structure extended with a single-stranded tail on either side of the G4. Binding and unfolding was characterized using several biochemical and biophysical approaches and in the presence of specific G4 ligands, such as telomestatin and 360A. Our data show that RPA can bind on each side of the G4 but it unwinds the G4 only from 5′ toward 3′. We explain the 5′ to 3′ unfolding directionality in terms of the 5′ to 3′ oriented laying out of hRPA subunits along single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate by kinetics experiments that RPA proceeds with the same directionality for duplex unfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2481704676,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is a lethal variant of prostate cancer that is associated with castrate-resistant growth, metastasis, and mortality. The tumor environment of neuroendocrine prostate cancer is heterogeneous and characterized by hypoxia, necrosis, and numerous mitoses. Although acidic extracellular pH has been implicated in aggressive cancer features including metastasis and therapeutic resistance, its role in neuroendocrine prostate cancer physiology and metabolism has not yet been explored. We used the well-characterized PNEC cell line as a model to establish the effects of extracellular pH (pH 6.5, 7.4, and 8.5) on neuroendocrine prostate cancer cell metabolism. We discovered that alkalinization of extracellular pH converted cellular metabolism to a nutrient consumption-dependent state that was susceptible to glucose deprivation, glutamine deprivation, and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) mediated inhibition of glycolysis. Conversely, acidic pH shifted cellular metabolism toward an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent state that was susceptible to OXPHOS inhibition. Based upon this mechanistic knowledge of pH-dependent metabolism, we identified that the FDA-approved anti-helminthic niclosamide depolarized mitochondrial potential and depleted ATP levels in PNEC cells whose effects were enhanced in acidic pH. To further establish relevance of these findings, we tested the effects of extracellular pH on susceptibility to nutrient deprivation and OXPHOS inhibition in a cohort of castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B, PC-3, and PC-3M. We discovered similar pH-dependent toxicity profiles among all cell lines with these treatments. These findings underscore a potential importance to acidic extracellular pH in the modulation of cell metabolism in tumors and development of an emerging paradigm that exploits the synergy of environment and therapeutic efficacy in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2477632050,"Background Health worker density per 1000 population in Ghana is one of the lowest in the world estimated to be 2.3, below the global average of 9.3. Low health worker motivation induced by poor working conditions partly explain this challenge. Albeit the wage bill for public sector health workers is about 90% of domestic government expenditure on health in countries such as Ghana, staff motivation and performance output remain a challenge, suggesting the need to complement financial incentives with non-financial incentives through a community-based approach. In this study, a systematic community engagement (SCE) intervention was implemented to engage community groups in healthcare quality assessment to promote mutual collaboration between clients and healthcare providers, and enhance health worker motivation levels. SCE involves structured use of existing community groups and associations to assess healthcare quality in health facilities. Identified quality gaps are discussed with healthcare providers, improvements made and rewards given to best performing facilities for closing quality care gaps. Purpose To evaluate the effect of SCE interventions on health worker motivation and experiences with clients. Methods The study is a cluster randomized trial involving health workers in private (n = 38) and public (n = 26) primary healthcare facilities in two administrative regions in Ghana. Out of 324 clinical and non-clinical staff randomly interviewed at baseline, 234 (72%) were successfully followed at end-line and interviewed on workplace motivation factors and personal experiences with clients. Propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimations were used to estimate treatment effect of the interventions on staff motivation. Results Intrinsic (non-financial) work incentives including cordiality with clients and perceived career prospects appeared to be prime sources of motivation for health staff interviewed in intervention health facilities while financial incentives were ranked lowest. Intervention health facilities that were assessed by female community groups (Coef. = 0.2720, p = 0.0118) and informal groups with organized leadership structures like Artisans (Coef. = 0.2268, p = 0.0368) associated positively with higher intrinsic motivation levels of staff. Conclusion Community-based approach to health worker motivation is a potential complementary strategy that needs policy deliberation to explore its prospects. Albeit financial incentives remain critical sources of staff motivation, innovative non-financial approaches like SCE should complement the latter."

Birthweights of 357 infants born in Leyte, The Philippines were obtained within 48 hours of delivery and infants were evaluated at one, six and 12 months. Newborns were classified as LBW, SGA, or both. We derived length-for-age, weight-for-length and weight-for-age Z-scores using WHOAnthro. Generalized estimating equations models were used to compare the differences in prevalence and mean Z-scores for these growth and nutritional outcomes, with separate models made with LBW and SGA as distinct primary predictors. We compared the longitudinal risk of stunting, wasting and underweight during infancy among LBW versus non-LBW and SGA versus non-SGA infants, while also evaluating key potential confounding, explanatory and modifying covariates. Overall, 9.0% of infants were born prematurely, 14.0% of infants were LBW and 22.9% were SGA. LBW infants had significantly increased odds of stunting, wasting and underweight persisting to 12 months of age, and SGA infants had significantly increased odds of stunting and underweight. LBW and SGA infants had higher rates of weight-for-length gain in the first month of life. Maternal educational attainment and exclusive breastfeeding decreased the risk of stunting and undernutrition. In this setting, LBW and SGA infants have higher rates of growth stunting and undernutrition during the first year of life and do not exhibit catch-up growth by 12 months of age.

These ant-plant interactions have rarely been studied at community level. Here, we tested whether: 1) EFN-bearing plants are more visited by ants than EFN-lacking plants; 2) ant visitation is higher in the rainy season than in dry season; 3) plants producing young leaves are more visited than those lacking young leaves in the rainy season; 4) during the dry season, plants with old leaves and flowers are more visited than plants with young leaves and bare of leaves or flowers; 5) the composition of visiting ant fauna differs between plants with and without EFNs. Field work was done in a cerrado reserve near Uberlândia, MG State, Brazil, along ten transects (total area 3,000 m2), in the rainy (October-January) and dry seasons (April-July) of 2010–2011. Plants (72 species; 762 individuals) were checked three times per season for ant presence. Results showed that 21 species (29%) and 266 individuals (35%) possessed EFNs. These plants attracted 38 ant species (36 in rainy, 26 in dry season). In the rainy season, plants with EFNs had higher ant abundance/richness than plants without EFNs, but in the dry season, EFN presence did not influence ant visitation. Plant phenology affected ant richness and abundance in different ways: plants with young leaves possessed higher ant richness in the rainy season, but in the dry season ant abundance was higher on plants possessing old leaves or flowers. The species composition of plant-associated ant communities, however, did not differ between plants with and without EFNs in either season. These findings suggest that the effect of EFN presence on a community of plant-visiting ants is context dependent, being conditioned to seasonal variation."

We inserted His residues into position 12 or 14 of GWALP23 (replacing either Leu12 or Leu14) and incorporated specific [2H]Ala labels within the helical core sequence. Solid-state 2H NMR spectra report the folding and orientation of the core sequence, revealing marked differences in the histidine-containing transmembrane helix behavior between acidic and neutral pH conditions. At neutral pH, the GWALP23-H12 and GWALP23-H14 helices exhibit well defined tilted transmembrane orientations in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) bilayer membranes. Under acidic conditions, when His12 is protonated and charged, the GWALP23-H12 helix exhibits a major population that moves to the DOPC bilayer surface and a minor population that occupies multiple transmembrane states. The response to protonation of His14 is an increase in helix tilt, but GWALP23-H14 remains in a transmembrane orientation. The results suggest pKa values of less than 3 for His12 and about 3–5 for His14 in DOPC membranes. In the thinner DLPC bilayers, with increased water access, the helices are less responsive to changes in pH.

In light-evoked behavioral tests, compared with wild-type littermates, Rev-Erbα-/- mice showed enhanced negative masking at low light levels (0.1 lx). Rev-Erbα-/- mouse retinas displayed significantly higher numbers of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs; 62% more compared with wild-type) and more intense melanopsin immunostaining of individual ipRGCs. In agreement with a pivotal role for melanopsin, negative masking at low light intensities was abolished in Rev-Erbα-/- Opn4-/- (melanopsin gene) double-null mice. Rev-Erbα-/- mice showed shortened latencies of both a and b electroretinogram waves, modified scotopic and photopic b-wave and scotopic threshold responses, and increased pupillary constriction, all of which suggested increased light sensitivity. However, wild-type and Rev-Erbα-/- mice displayed no detectable differences by in vivo fundus imaging, retinal histology, or expression of cell type-specific markers for major retinal cell populations.

https://openalex.org/W2484722360,"Pigeons have shown suboptimal gambling-like behavior when preferring a stimulus that infrequently signals reliable reinforcement over alternatives that provide greater reinforcement overall. As a mechanism for this behavior, recent research proposed that the stimulus value of alternatives with more reliable signals for reinforcement will be preferred relatively independently of their frequencies. The present study tested this hypothesis using a simplified design of a Discriminative alternative that, 50% of the time, led to either a signal for 100% reinforcement or a blackout period indicative of 0% reinforcement against a Nondiscriminative alternative that always led to a signal that predicted 50% reinforcement. Pigeons showed a strong preference for the Discriminative alternative that remained despite reducing the frequency of the signal for reinforcement in subsequent phases to 25% and then 12.5%. In Experiment 2, using the original design of Experiment 1, the stimulus following choice of the Nondiscriminative alternative was increased to 75% and then to 100%. Results showed that preference for the Discriminative alternative decreased only when the signals for reinforcement for the two alternatives predicted the same probability of reinforcement. The ability of several models to predict this behavior are discussed, but the terminal link stimulus value offers the most parsimonious account of this suboptimal behavior."

Here, we first examined the variations in genomic DNA methylation during chicken embryogenesis through high-performance liquid chromatography using broilers as the model organism. We then identified the degree of DNA methylation of the promoters and gene bodies involved in two specific genes (IGF2 and TNF-α) using the bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction method. In addition, we measured the expression levels of IGF2, TNF-α and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1, 3a and 3b. Our results showed that the genomic DNA methylation levels in the liver, heart and muscle increased during embryonic development and that the methylation level of the liver was significantly higher in mid-anaphase. In both the muscle and liver, the promoter methylation levels of TNF-α first increased and then decreased, whereas the gene body methylation levels remained lower at embryonic ages E8, 11 and 14 before increasing notably at E17. The promoter methylation level of IGF2 decreased persistently, whereas the methylation levels in the gene body showed a continuous increase. No differences in the expression of TNF-α were found among E8, 11 and 14, whereas a significant increase was observed at E17. IGF2 showed increasing expression level during the examined embryonic stages. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of DNMTs increased with increasing embryonic ages. These results suggest that chicken shows increasing genomic DNA methylation patterns during the embryonic period. Furthermore, the genomic DNA methylation levels in tissues are closely related to the genes expression levels, and gene expression may be simultaneously regulated by promoter hypomethylation and gene body hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2491418406,"Crop yield reduction due to salinity is a growing agronomical concern in many regions. Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells accompanies many abiotic stresses including salinity, acting as toxic and signaling molecules during plant stress responses. While ROS are generated in various cellular compartments, chloroplasts represent a main source in the light, and plastid ROS synthesis and/or elimination have been manipulated to improve stress tolerance. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing a plastid-targeted cyanobacterial flavodoxin, a flavoprotein that prevents ROS accumulation specifically in chloroplasts, displayed increased tolerance to many environmental stresses, including drought, excess irradiation, extreme temperatures and iron starvation. Surprisingly, flavodoxin expression failed to protect transgenic plants against NaCl toxicity. However, when high salt was directly applied to leaf discs, flavodoxin did increase tolerance, as reflected by preservation of chlorophylls, carotenoids and photosynthetic activities. Flavodoxin decreased salt-dependent ROS accumulation in leaf tissue from discs and whole plants, but this decline did not improve tolerance at the whole plant level. NaCl accumulation in roots, as well as increased osmotic pressure and salt-induced root damage, were not prevented by flavodoxin expression. The results indicate that ROS formed in chloroplasts have a marginal effect on plant responses during salt stress, and that sensitive targets are present in roots which are not protected by flavodoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2505639909,"The multi-functional molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein performs diverse essential roles during mitosis. The mechanistic importance of the dynein Light Intermediate Chain homologs, LIC1 and LIC2 is unappreciated, especially in the context of mitosis. LIC1 and LIC2 are believed to exist in distinct cytoplasmic dynein complexes as obligate subunits. LIC1 had earlier been reported to be required for metaphase to anaphase progression by inactivating the kinetochore-microtubule attachment-sensing arm of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). However, the functional importance of LIC2 during mitosis remains elusive. Here we report prominent novel roles for the LIC2 subunit of cytoplasmic dynein in regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint. LIC2 depletion in mammalian cells led to prolonged metaphase arrest in the presence of an active SAC and also to stretched kinetochores, thus implicating it in SAC inactivation. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy of SAC components revealed accumulation of both attachment- and tension-sensing checkpoint proteins at metaphase kinetochores upon LIC2 depletion. These observations support a stronger and more diverse role in checkpoint inactivation for LIC2 in comparison to its close homolog LIC1. Our study uncovers a novel functional hierarchy during mitotic checkpoint inactivation between the closely related but homologous LIC subunits of cytoplasmic dynein. These subtle functional distinctions between dynein subpopulations could be exploited to study specific aspects of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is a key mediator of fidelity in eukaryotic cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2477438706,"Early postnatal anesthesia causes long-lasting learning and memory impairment in rodents, however, evidence for a specific neurotoxic effect on early synaptogenesis has not been demonstrated. Drebrin A is an actin binding protein whose localization in dendritic protrusions serves an important role in dendritic spine morphogenesis, and is a marker for early synaptogenesis. We therefore set out to investigate whether clinically-relevant concentrations of anesthetic sevoflurane, widely- used in infants and children, alters dendritic morphology in cultured fetal day 16 mouse hippocampal neurons. After 7 days in vitro, mouse hippocampal neurons were exposed to four hours of 3% sevoflurane in 95% air/5% CO2 or control condition (95% air/5% CO2). Neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Alexa Fluor555-Phalloidin, and/or rabbit anti-mouse drebrin A/E antibodies which permitted subcellular localization of filamentous (F)-actin and/or drebrin immunoreactivity, respectively. Sevoflurane caused acute significant length-shortening in filopodia and thin dendritic spines in days-in-vitro 7 neurons, an effect which was completely rescued by co-incubating neurons with ten micromolar concentrations of the selective Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632. Filopodia and thin spine recovered in length two days after sevoflurane exposure. Yet cluster-type filopodia (a precursor to synaptic filopodia) were persistently significantly decreased in number on day-in-vitro 9, in part owing to preferential localization of drebrin immunoreactivity to dendritic shafts versus filopodial stalks. These data suggest that sevoflurane induces F-actin depolymerization leading to acute, reversible length-shortening in dendritic protrusions through a mechanism involving (in part) activation of RhoA/Rho kinase signaling and impairs localization of drebrin A to filopodia required for early excitatory synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2499065503,"The Iberian Peninsula has been the focus of attention of numerous studies dealing with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation, most of them targeting the control region segment. In the present study we sequenced the control region of 3,024 Spanish individuals from areas where available data were still limited. We also compiled mtDNA haplotypes from the literature involving 4,588 sequences and 28 population groups or small regions. We meta-analyzed all these data in order to shed further light on patterns of geographic variation, taking advantage of the large sample size and geographic coverage, in contrast with the atomized sampling strategy of previous work. The results indicate that the main mtDNA haplogroups show primarily clinal geographic patterns across the Iberian geography, roughly along a North-South axis. Haplogroup HV0 (where haplogroup U is nested) is more prevalent in the Franco Cantabrian region, in good agreement with previous findings that identified this area as a climate refuge during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), prior to a subsequent demographic re-expansion towards Central Europe and the Mediterranean. Typical sub-Saharan and North African lineages are slightly more prevalent in South Iberia, although at low frequencies; this pattern has been shaped mainly by the transatlantic slave trade and the Arab invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. The results also indicate that summary statistics that aim to measure molecular variation, or AMOVA, have limited sensitivity to detect population substructure, in contrast to patterns revealed by phylogeographic analysis. Overall, the results suggest that mtDNA variation in Iberia is substantially stratified. These patterns might be relevant in biomedical studies given that stratification is a common cause of false positives in case-control mtDNA association studies, and should be also considered when weighting the DNA evidence in forensic casework, which is strongly dependent on haplotype frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2479912542,"Background The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) in preclinical development exhibits improved safety and antiviral activity profiles with minimal drug resistance compared to approved NRTIs. However, the systemic antiviral efficacy of EFdA has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we utilized bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice to investigate the systemic effect of EFdA treatment on HIV replication and CD4+ T cell depletion in the peripheral blood (PB) and tissues. In particular, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the female reproductive tract (FRT) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, major sites of transmission, viral replication, and CD4+ T cell depletion and where some current antiretroviral drugs have a sub-optimal effect. Results EFdA treatment resulted in reduction of HIV-RNA in PB to undetectable levels in the majority of treated mice by 3 weeks post-treatment. HIV-RNA levels in cervicovaginal lavage of EFdA-treated BLT mice also declined to undetectable levels demonstrating strong penetration of EFdA into the FRT. Our results also demonstrate a strong systemic suppression of HIV replication in all tissues analyzed. In particular, we observed more than a 2-log difference in HIV-RNA levels in the GI tract and FRT of EFdA-treated BLT mice compared to untreated HIV-infected control mice. In addition, HIV-RNA was also significantly lower in the lymph nodes, liver, lung, spleen of EFdA-treated BLT mice compared to untreated HIV-infected control mice. Furthermore, EFdA treatment prevented the depletion of CD4+ T cells in the PB, mucosal tissues and lymphoid tissues. Conclusion Our findings indicate that EFdA is highly effective in controlling viral replication and preserving CD4+ T cells in particular with high efficiency in the GI and FRT tract. Thus, EFdA represents a strong potential candidate for further development as a part of antiretroviral therapy regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2486482393,"We have recently reported that Compound 49b, a novel β-adrenergic receptor agonist, can significantly reduce VEGF levels in retinal endothelial cells (REC) grown in diabetic-like conditions. In this study, we investigated whether Compound 49b could protect the retina under hypoxic conditions using the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced model in rats, as well REC cultured in hypoxic conditions. Some rats received 1mM topical Compound 49b for the 2 (5 rats each group) or 10 (4 rats in each group) days post-I/R. Analyses for retinal thickness and cell loss in the ganglion cell layer was done at 2 days post-I/R, while numbers of degenerate capillaries and pericyte ghosts were measured at 10 days post-I/R. Additionally, REC were cultured in normal oxygen or hypoxia (5% O2) only or treated with 50 nM Compound 49b for 12 hours. Twelve hours after Compound 49b exposure, cells were collected and analyzed for protein levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (KDR), angiopoietin 1 and its receptor Tie2 for Western blotting. Data indicate that exposure to I/R significantly decreased retinal thickness, with increasing numbers of degenerate capillaries and pericyte ghosts. Compound 49b treatment inhibited these retinal changes. In REC cultured in hypoxia, levels of IGFBP-3 were reduced, which were significantly increased by Compound 49b. Hypoxia significantly increased protein levels of VEGF, KDR, Angiopoiein 1, and Tie2, which were reduced following Compound 49b treatment. These data strongly suggested that Compound 49b protected the retina against I/R-induced injury. This provides additional support for a role of β-adrenergic receptor actions in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2477626593,"Several commercially and ecologically important species in the southern Benguela have undergone southward and eastward shifts in their distributions over previous decades, most notably the small pelagic fish sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus. Understanding these changes and their implications is essential in implementing an ecosystem approach to fisheries in the southern Benguela and attempting to appreciate the potential impacts of future environmental change. To investigate possible impacts of these shifts at an ecosystem level, distribution maps for before (1985-1991), during (1997-2000) and after (2003-2008) the shift in small pelagic fish were constructed for 14 key species from catch and survey data, and used to calculate spatial indicators including proportion east and west of Cape Agulhas, relative overlap in biomass and area, index of diversity, connectivity. Potential interactions on the south and west coasts were also compared. For several species (redeye; chub mackerel; kingklip; chokka squid; yellowtail), previously unidentified increases in the proportion of biomass east of Cape Agulhas were shown to have occurred over the same period as that of small pelagic fish, although none to the same degree. On average, overlap with small pelagic fish increased over time and overall system connectivity was lowest in the intermediate period, possibly indicating a system under transition. Connectivity declined over time on the west coast while increasing on the east coast. Distributions of other species have changed over time, with the region east of Cape Agulhas becoming increasingly important in terms of potential trophic interaction. Variations in distribution of biomass and structural complexity affect the trophic structure and hence functioning of the system, and implications should be considered when attempting to identify the possible ecosystem impacts of current and future system-level change."
https://openalex.org/W2493167734,"Bone healing involves a variety of different cell types and biological processes. Although certain key molecules have been identified, the molecular interactions of the healing progress are not completely understood. Moreover, a clinical routine for predicting the quality of bone healing after a fracture in an early phase is missing. This is mainly due to a lack of techniques to comprehensively screen for cytokines, growth factors and metabolites at their local site of action. Since all soluble molecules of interest are present in the fracture hematoma, its in-depth assessment could reveal potential markers for the monitoring of bone healing. Here, we describe an approach for sampling and quantification of cytokines and metabolites by using microdialysis, combined with solid phase extractions of proteins from wound fluids. By using a control group with an isolated soft tissue wound, we could reveal several bone defect-specific molecular features. In bone defect dialysates the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL3 were quantified with either a higher or earlier response compared to dialysate from soft tissue wound. Moreover, by analyzing downstream adaptions of the cells on protein level and focusing on early immune response, several proteins involved in the immune cell migration and activity could be identified to be specific for the bone defect group, e.g. immune modulators, proteases and their corresponding inhibitors. Additionally, the metabolite screening revealed different profiles between the bone defect group and the control group. In summary, we identified potential biomarkers to indicate imbalanced healing progress on all levels of analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2476161405,"Little is known about the immunoediting process in precancerous lesions. We explored this aspect of benign colorectal adenomas with a descriptive analysis of the immune pathways and immune cells whose regulation is linked to the morphology and size of these lesions. Two series of polypoid and nonpolypoid colorectal adenomas were used in this study: 1) 84 samples (42 lesions, each with matched samples of normal mucosa) whose gene expression data were used to quantify the tumor morphology- and size-related dysregulation of immune pathways collected in the Molecular Signature Database, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; 2) 40 other lesions examined with immunohistochemistry to quantify the presence of immune cells in the stromal compartment. In the analysis of transcriptomic data, 429 immune pathways displayed significant differential regulation in neoplasms of different morphology and size. Most pathways were significantly upregulated or downregulated in polypoid lesions versus nonpolypoid lesions (regardless of size). Differential pathway regulation associated with lesion size was observed only in polypoid neoplasms. These findings were mirrored by tissue immunostaining with CD4, CD8, FOXP3, MHC-I, CD68, and CD163 antibodies: stromal immune cell counts (mainly T lymphocytes and macrophages) were significantly higher in polypoid lesions. Certain markers displayed significant size-related differences regardless of lesion morphology. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that the marker panel clearly discriminated between precancerous lesions of different morphologies and sizes. Statistical analysis of immunostained cell counts fully support the results of the transcriptomic data analysis: the density of infiltration of most immune cells in the stroma of polypoid precancerous lesions was significantly higher than that observed in nonpolypoid lesions. Large neoplasms also have more immune cells in their stroma than small lesions. Immunoediting in precancerous colorectal tumors may vary with lesion morphology and stage of development, and this variability could influence a given lesion’s trajectory to cancer."

However, whether increased cardiac events in those with upper normal FBG is secondary to the shift of their cardiac sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance is unknown.To assess the association between FBG levels and cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM) in euglycaemic healthy subjects based on heart rate variability (HRV) derived indices.The study enrolled 42 healthy young adults. Following sociodemographic and clinical assessment, blood samples were collected to measure FBG levels. Five minutes ECG recordings were performed to all participants to obtain frequency domain HRV measurements, namely the natural logarithm (Ln) of total power (LnTP), very low frequency (LnVLF), low frequency (LnLF) and high frequency (LnHF), low frequency/ high frequency ratio (LnLF/HF), normalized low frequency (LF Norm) and high frequency (HF Norm).FBG levels correlated positively with LnHF (r = 0.33, P = 0.031) and HF Norm (r = 0.35, P = 0.025) and negatively with LF Norm (r = -0.35, P = 0.025) and LnLF/HF (r = -0.33, P = 0.035). LnHF and HF Norm were significantly decreased in subjects with the lower (4.00 (1.34) ms2/Hz and 33.12 (11.94) n.u) compared to those with the upper FBG quartile (5.64 (1.63) ms2/Hz and 49.43 (17.73) n.u, P = 0.013 and 0.032 respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2479303027,"The rolled leaf trait, long considered to be a key component of plant architecture, represents an important target trait for improving plant architecture at the population level. We therefore performed linkage mapping using a set of 262 highly variable RILs from two rice cultivars (Minghui 63 and 02428) with minor differences in leaf rolling index (LRI) in conjunction with GWAS mapping of a random subset of the 1127 germplasms from the 3K Rice Genomes Project (3K Rice). A total of seven main-effect loci were found to underlie the transgressive segregation of progenies from parents with minor differences in LRI. Five of these loci were previously identified and two (qRl7b and qRl9b) are newly reported with additional evidence from GWAS mapping for qRl7b. A total of 18 QTLs were identified by GWAS, including four newly identified QTLs. Six QTLs were confirmed by linkage mapping with the above RIL population, and 83.3% were found to be consistent with previously reported loci based on comparative mapping. We also performed allele mining with representative SNPs and identified the elite germplasms for the improvement of rolled leaf trait. Most favorable alleles at the detected loci were contributed by various 3K Rice germplasms. By a re-scanning of the candidate region with more saturated SNP markers, we dissected the region harboring gRl4-2 into three subregions, in which the average effect on LRI was 3.5% with a range from 2.4 to 4.1% in the third subregion, suggesting the presence of a new locus or loci within this region. The representative SNPs for favorable alleles in the reliable QTLs which were consistently identified in both bi-parental mapping and GWAS, such as qRl4, qRl5, qRl6, qRl7a, and qRl7b will be useful for future molecular breeding programs for ideal plant type in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2492654629,"Introduction Combination therapy is increasingly utilized against extensively-drug resistant (XDR) Gram negative bacteria (GNB). However, choosing a combination can be problematic as effective combinations are often strain-specific. An in vitro antibiotic combination testing (iACT) service, aimed to guide the selection of individualized and rationally optimized combination regimens within 48 hours, was developed. We described the role and feasibility of the iACT service in guiding individualized antibiotic combination selection in patients with XDR-GNB infections. Methods A retrospective case review was performed in two Singapore hospitals from April 2009–June 2014. All patients with XDR-GNB and antibiotic regimen guided by iACT for clinical management were included. The feasibility and role of the prospective iACT service was evaluated. The following patient outcomes were described: (i) 30-day in-hospital all-cause and infection-related mortality, (ii) clinical response, and (iii) microbiological eradication in patients with bloodstream infections. Results From 2009–2014, the iACT service was requested by Infectious Disease physicians for 39 cases (20 P. aeruginosa, 13 A. baumannii and 6 K. pneumoniae). Bloodstream infection was the predominant infection (36%), followed by pneumonia (31%). All iACT recommendations were provided within 48h from request for the service. Prior to iACT-guided therapy, most cases were prescribed combination antibiotics empirically (90%). Changes in the empiric antibiotic regimens were recommended in 21 (54%) cases; in 14 (36%) cases, changes were recommended as the empiric regimens were found to be non-bactericidal in vitro. In 7 (18%) cases, the number of antibiotics used in combination empirically was reduced by the iACT service. Overall, low 30-day infection-related mortality (15%) and high clinical response (82%) were observed. Microbiological eradication was observed in 79% of all bloodstream infections. Conclusions The iACT service can be feasibly employed to guide the timely selection of rationally optimized combination regimens, and played a role in reducing indiscreet antibiotic use."

Here we present the first exploratory biomarker study conducted on a cohort of 187 patients with breast cancer to evaluate the prognostic role of total GIV (tGIV) and tyrosine phosphorylated GIV (pYGIV) across the various molecular subtypes. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of recurrence-free survival showed that the presence of tGIV, either cytoplasmic or nuclear, carried poor prognosis, but that nuclear tGIV had a greater prognostic impact (P = 0.007 in early and P = 0.0048 in late clinical stages). Activated pYGIV in the cytoplasm hadthe greatest prognosticimpact inlate clinical stages (P = 0.006). Furthermore, wefound that theprognostic impacts of cytoplasmic pYGIV and nuclear tGIV were additive (hazard ratio 19.0548; P = 0.0002). Surprisingly, this additive effect of nuclear tGIV/cytoplasmic pYGIV was observed in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive tumors (hazard ratio 16.918; P = 0.0005)butnot in triple-negative breast cancers. Intriple-negative breast cancers, tGIV and cytoplasmic pYGIV had no prognostic impact; however, membrane-association of pYGIV carried a poor prognosis (P = 0.026). Both tGIV and pYGIV showed no correlationwith clinical stage, tumor size, pathologic type, lymph node involvement, and BRCA1/2 status. We conclude that immunocytochemical detection of pYGIV and tGIV can serve as an effective prognosticator. On the basis of the differential prognostic impact of tGIV/pYGIV within each molecular subtype, we propose a diagnostic algorithm. Further studies on larger cohorts are essential to rigorously assess the effectiveness and robustness of this algorithm in prognosticating outcome among patients with breast cancer.—Dunkel, Y., Diao, K., Aznar, N., Swanson, L., Liu, L., Zhu, W., Mi, X.-Y., Ghosh, P.

https://openalex.org/W2494792982,"Objectives Road traffic crashes that involve very high numbers of fatalities and injuries arouse public concern wherever they occur. In China, there are two categories of such crashes: a crash that results in 10–30 fatalities, 50–100 serious injuries or a total cost of 50–100 million RMB ($US8-16m) is a “serious road traffic crash” (SRTC), while a crash that is even more severe or costly is a “particularly serious road traffic crash” (PSRTC). The aim of this study is to identify the main factors affecting different types of these crashes (single-vehicle, head-on, rear-end and side impact) with the ultimate goal of informing prevention activities and policies. Methods Detailed descriptions of the SRTCs and PSRTCs that occurred from 2007 to 2014 were collected from the database “In-depth Investigation and Analysis System for Major Road Traffic Crashes” (IIASMRTC), which is maintained by the Traffic Management Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security of China (TMRI). 18 main risk factors, which were categorized into four areas (participant, vehicle, road and environment-related) were chosen as potential independent variables for the multinomial logistic regression analysis. Comparisons were made among the single-vehicle, head-on, rear-end and side impact crashes in terms of factors affecting crash occurrence. Findings Five risk factors were significant for the six multinomial logistic regression models, which were location, vertical alignment, roadside safety rating, driver distraction and overloading of cargo. It was indicated that intersections were more likely to have side impact SRTCs and PSRTCs, especially with poor visibility at night. Overloaded freight vehicles were more likely to be involved in a rear-end crash than other freight vehicles. Driver distraction is an important risk factor for head-on crashes, while vertical alignment and roadside safety rating are positively associated with single-vehicle crashes. Conclusion Based on the findings, promising measures were proposed to prevent each type of SRTC and PSRTC, which governmental or regulatory agencies could employ to plan strategies to reduce SRTCs and PSRTCs and support lifesaving policies."
https://openalex.org/W2506939671,"Objective Previous studies have confirmed Slug as a key player in regulating phenotypic changes in several cell models, however, its role in smooth muscle cells (SMC) has never been assessed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of Slug during the phenotypic switch of SMC in vitro and throughout the development of vascular remodeling. Methods and Results Slug expression was decreased during both cell-to-cell contact and TGFβ1 induced SMC differentiation. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), a known inductor of a proliferative/dedifferentiated SMC phenotype, induces the expression of Slug in SMC. Slug knockdown blocked TNFα-induced SMC phenotypic change and significantly reduced both SMC proliferation and migration, while its overexpression blocked the TGFβ1-induced SMC differentiation and induced proliferation and migration. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis showed that in SMC, Slug knockdown induced changes mainly in genes related to proliferation and migration, indicating that Slug controls these processes in SMC. Notably, Slug expression was significantly up-regulated in lungs of mice using a model of pulmonary hypertension-related vascular remodeling. Highly remodeled human pulmonary arteries also showed an increase of Slug expression compared to less remodeled arteries. Conclusions Slug emerges as a key transcription factor driving SMC towards a proliferative phenotype. The increased Slug expression observed in vivo in highly remodeled arteries of mice and human suggests a role of Slug in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular diseases."

In the present study, archive samples of canine SCC from different anatomical locations were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of PV DNA and by p16 immunohistochemistry. The aims were to investigate the relationship between p16 expression and presence of PV DNA, in order to assess the utility of p16 overexpression as a biomarker of PV infection in canine SCC. A total of 52 SCCs were included. Nine cases (17.3%) showed moderate p16 immunoreactivity, with no association with tumor degree of differentiation, histotype or mitotic activity. The canPVf/FAP64 primers amplified Canis familiaris PV-1 DNA from 3 out of 52 tumors (5.8%), one cutaneous, one oral and one tonsillar SCC. There was no association between PV presence and p16 immunostaining. These results do not support a significant role of PVs in the development of canine SCCs. Additionally, PV infection was apparently not the cause of the p16 immunostaining observed in a subset of canine SCCs. A better awareness of p16 level of expression and cellular function in canine cancer may help to define its diagnostic and prognostic role."
https://openalex.org/W2486917223,"Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Genome wide association studies have identified over 100 common variants associated with multiple sclerosis, the majority of which implicate immunologically relevant genes, particularly those involved in T-cell development. SNP rs13204742 at the THEMIS/PTPRK locus is one such variant. Here, we have demonstrated mutually exclusive use of exon 1 and 2 amongst 16 novel THEMIS isoforms. We also show inverse correlation between THEMIS expression in human CD4+ T-cells and dosage of the multiple sclerosis risk allele at rs13204742, driven by reduced expression of exon 1- containing isoforms. In silico analysis suggests that this may be due to cell-specific, allele-dependent binding of the transcription factors FoxP3 and/or E47. Research exploring the functional implications of GWAS variants is important for gaining an understanding of disease pathogenesis, with the ultimate aim of identifying new therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2486588715,"The epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is related to human poverty with marked differences between developing and developed countries. Socioeconomic factors and living standards are the main determinants of the age-dependent acquisition rate of H. pylori, and consequently its prevalence. The aim of this study was to assess the risk and sero-prevalence of H. pylori colonization among Orang Asli in Peninsula Malaysia. This cross-sectional study was conducted on Orang Asli subjects in seven isolated settlements spanning across all three major tribes (Negrito, Proto Malay and Senoi) in Malaysia. Socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects were obtained through interview. Subjects were tested for H. pylori colonization based on CagA and whole cell (WC) antigen serological assays. A total of 275 subjects participated in this study. Among these subjects, 115 (44.7%) were H. pylori sero-positive with highest sero-prevalence among Negrito (65.7%). Among subjects who were H. pylori sero-positive, CagA sero positivity was also significantly higher among Negrito. The highest proportion of respondents reported to be H. pylori sero-positive was from age group 30 years old and below (57.9%), males (56.2%), Negrito (48.6%) and live in bamboo house (92.3%). The highest proportion of respondents reported to be CagA sero-positive was from age group 30 years old and below (41.4%), males (35.6%) and Negrito (48.6%). The results of this study demonstrate that H. pylori colonization can be related to age, gender, tribes and house materials and CagA sero-positive stain closely associated with age, gender and tribes."
https://openalex.org/W2487456834,"To investigate the role of homocysteine in neuronal injury in HIV infection.Using a cross-sectional design and archived samples, we compared concentrations of plasma homocysteine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light protein (NFL), a sensitive marker of neuronal injury, in 83 HIV-1-infected subjects without antiretroviral treatment. We also analyzed plasma vitamin B12, serum folate, CSF, and plasma HIV RNA, the immune activation marker neopterin in CSF and serum, and albumin ratio as a marker of blood-brain barrier integrity. Twenty-two subjects provided a second sample median of 12.5 months after antiretroviral treatment initiation.A significant correlation was found between plasma homocysteine and CSF NFL concentrations in untreated individuals (r = 0.52, p < 0.0001). As expected, there was a significant inverse correlation between homocysteine and B12 (r = -0.41, p < 0.001) and folate (r = -0.40, p = < 0.001) levels. In a multiple linear regression analysis homocysteine stood out as an independent predictor of CSF NFL in HIV-1-infected individuals. The correlation of plasma homocysteine and CSF NFL was also present in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy (r = 0.51, p = 0.016).A correlation between plasma homocysteine and axonal injury, as measured by CSF NFL, was found in both untreated and treated HIV. While this study is not able to prove a causal link, homocysteine and functional B12/folate deficiency appear to play a role in neural injury in HIV-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2503370879,"Introduction In the general ageing population, 40% of deaths occur following a prolonged trajectory of “progressive dwindling,” characterised by chronic accumulation of disability and frailty, and associated with increased dependency and reduced reserves. Those who progressively dwindle are poorly catered for by current healthcare systems and would benefit from a coordinated approach to their medical and social care, known as formative care. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) may be more likely to progressively dwindle, and may be appropriate targets for formative care pathways. Objectives To determine the proportion of pwMS who follow a progressive dwindling trajectory prior to death. To relate trajectory to place of death, and examine what factors predict the progressively dwindling trajectory. Methods A retrospective observational study of 582 deceased pwMS enrolled in the UK MS Tissue Bank, including death certificates and extensive clinical summaries. Results 73.7% of pwMS had a “progressively dwindling” trajectory of dying. This was predicted by those who reach MS disease milestones earlier. 72.5% of pwMS died an MS-related death, which was predicted by an aggressive disease course from onset. Those who progressively dwindled were equally likely to die in hospital as those with other trajectories to death. Conclusions The progressively dwindling trajectory of dying is very common in pwMS, and can be predicted by earlier disease milestones. Pathways could target pwMS in these years prior to death, to improve care."
https://openalex.org/W2479534231,"An individual's reputation and group membership can produce automatic judgments and behaviors toward that individual. Whether an individual's social reputation impacts interactions with affiliates has yet to be demonstrated. We tested the hypothesis that during initial encounters with others, existing knowledge of their social network guides behavior toward them. Participants learned reputations (cooperate, defect, or equal mix) for virtual players through an iterated economic game (EG). Then, participants learned one novel friend for each player. The critical question was how participants treated the friends in a single-shot EG after the friend-learning phase. Participants tended to cooperate with friends of cooperators and defect on friends of defectors, indicative of a decision making bias based on memory for social affiliations. Interestingly, participants' explicit predictions of the friends' future behavior showed no such bias. Moreover, the bias to defect on friends of defectors was enhanced when affiliations were learned in a social context; participants who learned to associate novel faces with player faces during reinforcement learning did not show reputation-based bias for associates of defectors during single-shot EG. These data indicate that when faced with risky social decisions, memories of social connections influence behavior implicitly."
https://openalex.org/W2503371459,"If the market has an invisible hand, does knowledge creation and representation have an ""invisible brain""? While knowledge is viewed as a product of neuron activity in the brain, can we identify knowledge that is outside the brain but reflects the activity of neurons in the brain? This work suggests that the patterns of neuron activity in the brain can be seen in the representation of knowledge-related activity. Here we show that the neuron activity mechanism seems to represent much of the knowledge learned in the past decades based on published articles, in what can be viewed as an ""invisible brain"" or collective hidden neural networks. Similar results appear when analyzing knowledge activity in patents. Our work also tries to characterize knowledge increase as neuron network activity growth. The results propose that knowledge-related activity can be seen outside of the neuron activity mechanism. Consequently, knowledge might exist as an independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2491479866,"Sampling the biodiversity is an essential step for conservation, and understanding the efficiency of sampling methods allows us to estimate the quality of our biodiversity data. Sex ratio is an important population characteristic, but until now, no study has evaluated how efficient are the sampling methods commonly used in biodiversity surveys in estimating the sex ratio of populations. We used a virtual ecologist approach to investigate whether active and passive capture methods are able to accurately sample a population's sex ratio and whether differences in movement pattern and detectability between males and females produce biased estimates of sex-ratios when using these methods. Our simulation allowed the recognition of individuals, similar to mark-recapture studies. We found that differences in both movement patterns and detectability between males and females produce biased estimates of sex ratios. However, increasing the sampling effort or the number of sampling days improves the ability of passive or active capture methods to properly sample sex ratio. Thus, prior knowledge regarding movement patterns and detectability for species is important information to guide field studies aiming to understand sex ratio related patterns."

Presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).To compare the distribution of APOE genotype in iNPH patients with an age-matched population-based control group and with Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.APOE genotype frequencies were determined in 77 iNPH patients (50 men and 27 women, mean age 71.7 years) diagnosed with iNPH, a sample of 691 AD patients and 638 age-matched population controls (299 men and 339 women) from the INTERGENE cohort.The APOE distribution did not differ significantly between the iNPH patients and the control population. The per e4-allele odds-ratio (OR) of iNPH was given by OR = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.50, 1.60) that was considerably smaller than the per-allele OR of AD, OR = 5.34 (4.10, 7.00).The results suggest that the APOE-related risk of AD in patients with iNPH is not higher than in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2481802828,"The significance of coal in the world economy remains unquestionable for decades. It is also expected to be the dominant fossil fuel in the foreseeable future. The increased awareness of sustainable development reflected in the relevant regulations implies, however, the need for the development and implementation of clean coal technologies on the one hand, and adequate analytical tools on the other. The paper presents the application of the quantitative Partial Least Squares method in modeling the concentrations of trace elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, V and Zn) in hard coal based on the physical and chemical parameters of coal, and coal ash components. The study was focused on trace elements potentially hazardous to the environment when emitted from coal processing systems. The studied data included 24 parameters determined for 132 coal samples provided by 17 coal mines of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. Since the data set contained outliers, the construction of robust Partial Least Squares models for contaminated data set and the correct identification of outlying objects based on the robust scales were required. These enabled the development of the correct Partial Least Squares models, characterized by good fit and prediction abilities. The root mean square error was below 10% for all except for one the final Partial Least Squares models constructed, and the prediction error (root mean square error of cross–validation) exceeded 10% only for three models constructed. The study is of both cognitive and applicative importance. It presents the unique application of the chemometric methods of data exploration in modeling the content of trace elements in coal. In this way it contributes to the development of useful tools of coal quality assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2495845285,"Despite recent advances in molecular profiling of colorectal cancer (CRC), as of yet this has not translated into an unbiased molecular liquid biopsy profile which can accurately screen for early CRC. In this study we depict the profile of early stage CRC as well as for advanced adenomas (AA) by combination of current molecular knowledge with microarray technology, using efficient circulating free plasma RNA purification from blood and RNA amplification technologies. We joined literature search with Affymetrix gene chip experimental procedure to draw the circulating free plasma RNA profile of colorectal cancer disease reflected in blood. The RNA panel was tested by two datasets comparing patients with CRC with healthy subjects and patients with AA to healthy subjects. For the CRC patient cohort (28 CRC cases vs. 41 healthy controls), the ROC analysis of the selected biomarker panel generated a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 93% for the detection of CRC using 8-gene classification model. For the AA patient cohort (28 subjects vs. 46 healthy controls), a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 87% were calculated using a 2-gene classification model. We have identified a panel of 8 plasma RNA markers as a preliminary panel for CRC detection and subset markers suitable for AA detection. Subjected to extensive clinical validation we suggest that this panel represents a feasible approach and a potential strategy for noninvasive early diagnosis, as a first-line screening test for asymptomatic, average-risk population before colonoscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2496230778,"This paper proposes a novel approach for the implementation of simulation scenarios, providing a client entity for cloud computing systems. The client entity allows the creation of scenarios in which the client behavior has an influence on the simulation, making the results more realistic. The proposed client entity is based on several characteristics that affect the performance of a cloud computing system, including different modes of submission and their behavior when the waiting time between requests (think time) is considered. The proposed characterization of the client enables the sending of either individual requests or group of Web services to scenarios where the workload takes the form of bursts. The client entity is included in the CloudSim, a framework for modelling and simulation of cloud computing. Experimental results show the influence of the client behavior on the performance of the services executed in a cloud computing system."
