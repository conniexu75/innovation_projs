https://openalex.org/W3133782701,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants may jeopardize newly introduced antibody and vaccine countermeasures. Here, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), animal immune sera, human convalescent sera and human sera from recipients of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, we report the impact on antibody neutralization of a panel of authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants including a B.1.1.7 isolate, chimeric strains with South African or Brazilian spike genes and isogenic recombinant viral variants. Many highly neutralizing mAbs engaging the receptor-binding domain or N-terminal domain and most convalescent sera and mRNA vaccine-induced immune sera showed reduced inhibitory activity against viruses containing an E484K spike mutation. As antibodies binding to spike receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain demonstrate diminished neutralization potency in vitro against some emerging variants, updated mAb cocktails targeting highly conserved regions, enhancement of mAb potency or adjustments to the spike sequences of vaccines may be needed to prevent loss of protection in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3102509658,"Purpose The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented stress to students and educational institutions across the world. We aimed to estimate the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of college students. Methods We used data on 419 first-year students (ages 18–20) at a large public university in North Carolina both before (October 2019-February 2020) and after (June/July 2020) the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. After evaluating descriptive data on mental health and stressors by students’ demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between Covid-19 stressors (including work reductions, health, distanced learning difficulties and social isolation) and mental health symptoms and severity controlling for students’ pre-pandemic mental health, psychosocial resources, and demographic characteristics. Results We found that the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety increased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% within four months after the pandemic began; and the prevalence of moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5% to 31.7%. White, female and sexual/gender minority (SGM) students were at highest risk of increases in anxiety symptoms. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, female, and SGM students were at highest risk of increases in depression symptoms. General difficulties associated with distanced learning and social isolation contributed to the increases in both depression and anxiety symptoms. However, work reductions as well as Covid-19 diagnosis and hospitalization of oneself, family members or friends were not associated with increases in depression or anxiety symptoms. Conclusion Colleges may be able to reduce the mental health consequences of Covid-19 by investing in resources to reduce difficulties with distance learning and reduce social isolation during the pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W3134873297,"Studying the function of common genetic variants in primary human tissues and during development is challenging. To address this, we use an efficient multiplexing strategy to differentiate 215 human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines toward a midbrain neural fate, including dopaminergic neurons, and use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile over 1 million cells across three differentiation time points. The proportion of neurons produced by each cell line is highly reproducible and is predictable by robust molecular markers expressed in pluripotent cells. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were characterized at different stages of neuronal development and in response to rotenone-induced oxidative stress. Of these, 1,284 eQTL colocalize with known neurological trait risk loci, and 46% are not found in the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalog. Our study illustrates how coupling scRNA-seq with long-term iPSC differentiation enables mechanistic studies of human trait-associated genetic variants in otherwise inaccessible cell states. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of iPSC neural differentiation identifies markers that predict line-to-line differences in cell fate potential and eQTLs that are specific to different stages of differentiation and that overlap with GWAS risk variants for neurological traits."
https://openalex.org/W3135324733,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is typically lethal, exhibiting intrinsic or acquired resistance to second-generation androgen-targeting therapies and minimal response to immune checkpoint inhibitors1. Cellular programs driving resistance in both cancer and immune cells remain poorly understood. We present single-cell transcriptomes from 14 patients with advanced prostate cancer, spanning all common metastatic sites. Irrespective of treatment exposure, adenocarcinoma cells pervasively coexpressed multiple androgen receptor isoforms, including truncated isoforms hypothesized to mediate resistance to androgen-targeting therapies2,3. Resistance to enzalutamide was associated with cancer cell-intrinsic epithelial-mesenchymal transition and transforming growth factor-β signaling. Small cell carcinoma cells exhibited divergent expression programs driven by transcriptional regulators promoting lineage plasticity and HOXB5, HOXB6 and NR1D2 (refs. 4-6). Additionally, a subset of patients had high expression of dysfunction markers on cytotoxic CD8+ T cells undergoing clonal expansion following enzalutamide treatment. Collectively, the transcriptional characterization of cancer and immune cells from human metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer provides a basis for the development of therapeutic approaches complementing androgen signaling inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W3134225151,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an established cellular system to study the impact of genetic variants in derived cell types and developmental contexts. However, in their pluripotent state, the disease impact of genetic variants is less well known. Here, we integrate data from 1,367 human iPSC lines to comprehensively map common and rare regulatory variants in human pluripotent cells. Using this population-scale resource, we report hundreds of new colocalization events for human traits specific to iPSCs, and find increased power to identify rare regulatory variants compared with somatic tissues. Finally, we demonstrate how iPSCs enable the identification of causal genes for rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3134243331,"In Bangladesh, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have substantial effects on the livelihood of people, but smallholder vegetables growers will be even more affected because of the perishability nature of the product. The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Bangladesh on 8th March, 2020 and consequently the country went into lockdown on 26 March, 2020. This study has made a survey of vegetables farmers through a mobile phone to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vegetables supply chain, gross margin and the future production plan of the growers. In Bangladesh, the lockdown has disrupted the food supply chain and increases the likelihood of food insecurity. Lockdown has impeded vegetable farmers’ access to markets, thus limiting their productive and sales capacities. The price of yield has dropped by more than half resulting in huge loss for vegetable growers. The loss incurred by the farmers for producing Brinjal, Cucumber, Pointed gourd, Yardlong beans and Bottle gourd are BDT 4900, BDT 10900, BDT 57400, BDT 52500 and BDT 18500 per acre respectively as a result of COVID-19. The decreased income increases farmers’ likelihood of vulnerability and food insecurity and poses a challenge to continued produce. ‘Cash support’ is more important than ‘food support’ in order to keep vegetable farmers in farming, to ensure a ready supply of necessary low-cost resources, and to help fight against the upcoming food shortage."
https://openalex.org/W3134978222,"Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health control strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as “ the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months ” or “ the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days ”. We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications. For example, based on the model in Lombardy, Italy, achieving less than 100 deaths per day and 10000 total deaths within 100 days requires 441.7% more vaccination control effort than achieving less than 1000 deaths per day and 50000 total deaths within 100 days."
https://openalex.org/W3133768868,"Cariogenic Streptococcus mutans is known as a predominant etiological agent of dental caries due to its exceptional capacity to form biofilms. From strains of S. mutans isolated from dental plaque, we discovered, in the present study, a polyketide/nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster, muf, which directly correlates with a strong biofilm-forming capability. We then identified the muf-associated bioactive product, mutanofactin-697, which contains a new molecular scaffold, along with its biosynthetic logic. Further mode-of-action studies revealed that mutanofactin-697 binds to S. mutans cells and also extracellular DNA, increases bacterial hydrophobicity, and promotes bacterial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation. Our findings provided an example of a microbial secondary metabolite promoting biofilm formation via a physicochemical approach, highlighting the importance of secondary metabolism in mediating critical processes related to the development of dental caries. The mutanofactin family of lipopeptide natural products, produced by strains of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans, promotes biofilm formation via increased cell-surface hydrophobicity and binding to extracellular DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3134590928,"There is limited understanding of how social dynamics impact pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in generalized HIV-epidemic settings. We examined experiences of oral PrEP use disclosure to various social groups with the goal of identifying supportive relationships that can be leveraged to promote adherence.We used qualitative methods to explore experiences disclosing PrEP use and the perceived impact of disclosure on adherence among 22 South African AGYW (16-25 years) taking daily oral PrEP. Serial in-depth-interviews (IDIs) were conducted 1-, 3-, and 12-months post-PrEP initiation. Respondents also self-reported their disclosures separately for various social groups and adherence was assessed using intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate levels.Qualitative respondents had a median age of 20.5 years and reported disclosing their PrEP use to friends (n = 36 total disclosures), partners, siblings, other family members (n = 24 disclosures each), and parents (n = 19 disclosures). IDI data revealed that parents and partners provided the most support to respondents and a lack of support from these groups was most often perceived as negatively affecting PrEP use. AGYW described difficulties explaining PrEP to their mothers, who believed PrEP was HIV treatment or would lead to HIV infection. Disclosure to household members was notably meaningful for AGYW (both positively and negatively). Respondents reported leveraging supportive relationships for pill reminders. For respondents who perceived a household member would be unsupportive, however, non-disclosure was less feasible and PrEP use was often stigmatized. To avoid stigma, several respondents hid or discontinued PrEP.While supportive relationships may facilitate PrEP use, disclosure can also lead to stigma. Counselors should support AGYW in disclosing to key people in their social networks and provide AGYW with materials that lend credibility to explanations of PrEP. Community education is necessary to alleviate PrEP-related stigma and facilitate disclosure."
https://openalex.org/W3133535787,"In vivo and carcass measurements were evaluated to predict carcass physical and chemical composition and to list the measurements that best fit the prediction of the composition of growing Santa Inês sheep carcasses. Thirty-three animals were used to measure the loin eye area by ultrasound in vivo (LEAu) and in the carcass. We used 39 animals for biometric measurement in vivo and 42 sheep for morphometric measurement in the carcass. For the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses, dissection of the half left carcass was carried out in 42 animals. The data were submitted to Pearson’s correlation analysis and t test. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed using a stepwise procedure. All correlations between in vivo measurements and the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses (in kg) were significant, except for LEAu. Biometric measurements and hot (HCW) and cold (CCW) carcass weights were considered as predictors of the carcasses’ physical and chemical compositions. Slaughter body weight (SBW) was the variable that most influenced the equations in the assessment of in vivo measurements and HCW and CCW most influenced the equations for measurements on carcasses. Biometric measurements of Santa Inês sheep can be used together with the SBW to estimate the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses, with emphasis on body compactness index, breast width, wither height, and croup height. The morphometric measurements can be used together with carcass weight to estimate the physical and chemical compositions of carcasses, with emphasis on croup width, carcass compactness index, croup perimeter, external and internal carcass lengths, chest width, and leg length and perimeter. The HCW can be used to predict the physical and chemical composition of carcasses without affecting the accuracy of the prediction model."
https://openalex.org/W3135101281,"The sympathetic nervous system-catecholamine-uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) axis plays an essential role in non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis. However, whether there exists a direct effector that physically connects catecholamine signalling to UCP1 in response to acute cold is unknown. Here we report that outer mitochondrial membrane-located AIDA is phosphorylated at S161 by the catecholamine-activated protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylated AIDA translocates to the intermembrane space, where it binds to and activates the uncoupling activity of UCP1 by promoting cysteine oxidation of UCP1. Adipocyte-specific depletion of AIDA abrogates UCP1-dependent thermogenesis, resulting in hypothermia during acute cold exposure. Re-expression of S161A-AIDA, unlike wild-type AIDA, fails to restore the acute cold response in Aida-knockout mice. The PKA-AIDA-UCP1 axis is highly conserved in mammals, including hibernators. Denervation of the sympathetic postganglionic fibres abolishes cold-induced AIDA-dependent thermogenesis. These findings uncover a direct mechanistic link between sympathetic input and UCP1-mediated adaptive thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3135506483,"The CRISPR/Cas9 bacterial system has proven to be an powerful tool for genetic manipulation in several organisms, but the efficiency of sequence replacement by homologous direct repair (HDR) is substantially lower than random indel creation. Many studies focused on improving HDR efficiency using double sgRNA, cell synchronization cycle, and the delivery of single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotides (ssODN) with a rational design. In this study, we evaluate these three methods’ synergistic effects to improve HDR efficiency. For our tests, we have chosen the TNFα gene (NM_000594) for its crucial role in various biological processes and diseases. For the first time, our results showed how the use of two sgRNA with asymmetric donor design and triple transfection events dramatically increase the HDR efficiency from an undetectable HDR event to 39% of HDR efficiency and provide a new strategy to facilitate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated human genome editing. Besides, we demonstrated that the TNFα locus could be edited with CRISPR/Cas9 methodology, an opportunity to safely correct, in the future, the specific mutations of each patient."
https://openalex.org/W3134221690,"Given the negative environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, there is an urgent need to reduce the impact of food production on biodiversity. Ecological restoration of farmland could potentially contribute to this goal. While the positive impacts of ecological restoration on biodiversity are well established, less evidence is available regarding impacts on economic development and employment. Potentially, prospects for economic development could be enhanced by ecological restoration though increased provision of ecosystem services, on which some economic activity depends. Here we examined this issue through the development of contrasting land use scenarios for the county of Dorset, southern England. Two scenarios of future agricultural expansion were compared with two scenarios of landscape-scale ecological restoration and the current situation. Impacts on provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) were explored using InVEST models and proxy values for different land cover types. Impacts on economic employment were examined using an economic input-output model, which was adjusted for variation in ES flows using empirically determined ES dependency values for different economic sectors. Using the unadjusted input-output model, the scenarios had only a slight economic impact (≤ 0.3% Gross Value Added, GVA). Conversely, when the input-output model was adjusted to take account of ES flows, GVA increased by up to 5.4% in the restoration scenarios, whereas under the scenario with greatest agricultural expansion, GVA was reduced by -4.5%. Similarly, employment increased by up to 6.7% following restoration, compared to declines of up to -5.6% following maximum agricultural expansion. These results show that the economic contribution of rural land is far greater than that attributable to agricultural production alone. Landscape-scale restoration of agricultural land can potentially increase the contribution of farmland to economic development and employment, by increasing flows of multiple ES to the many economic sectors that depend on them."
https://openalex.org/W3133579939,"Metal artifacts are considered a major challenge in computed tomography (CT) as these adversely affect the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Several approaches have been developed to address this problem. The present study explored the clinical potential of a novel photon-counting detector (PCD) CT system in reducing metal artifacts in head CT scans. In particular, we studied the recovery of an oral tumor region located under metal artifacts after correction. Three energy thresholds were used to group data into three bins (bin 1: low-energy, bin 2: middle-energy, and bin 3: high-energy) in the prototype PCD CT system. Three types of physical phantoms were scanned on the prototype PCD CT system. First, we assessed the accuracy of iodine quantification using iodine phantoms at varying concentrations. Second, we evaluated the performance of material decomposition (MD) and virtual monochromatic images (VMIs) using a multi-energy CT phantom. Third, we designed an ATOM phantom with metal insertions to verify the effect of the proposed metal artifact reduction. In particular, we placed an insertion-mimicking an iodine-enhanced oral tumor in the beam path of metallic objects. Normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR) was performed for each energy bin image, followed by an image-based MD and VMI reconstruction. Image quality was analyzed quantitatively by contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurements. The results of iodine quantification showed a good match between the true and measured iodine concentrations. Furthermore, as expected, the contrast between iodine and the surrounding material was higher in bin 1 image than in bin 3 image. On the other hand, the bin 3 image of the ATOM phantom showed fewer metal artifacts than the bin 1 image because of the higher photon energy. The result of quantitative assessment demonstrated that the 40-keV VMI (CNR: 20.6 ± 1.2) with NMAR and MD remarkably increased the contrast of the iodine-enhanced region compared with that of the conventional images (CNR: 10.4 ± 0.5) having 30 to 140 keV energy levels. The PCD-based multi-energy CT imaging has immense potential to maximize the contrast of the target tissue and reduce metal artifacts simultaneously. We believe that it would open the door to novel applications for the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3134137489,"To study the dysregulated host immune response to infection in sepsis, gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE54514, GSE57065, GSE64456, GSE95233, GSE66099 and GSE72829 were selected. From the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) immune system pathways, 998 unique genes were selected, and genes were classified as follows based on gene annotation from KEGG, Gene Ontology, and Reactome: adaptive immunity, antigen presentation, cytokines and chemokines, complement, hematopoiesis, innate immunity, leukocyte migration, NK cell activity, platelet activity, and signaling. After correlation matrix formation, correlation coefficient of 0.8 was selected for network generation and network analysis. Total transcriptome was analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEG), followed by gene set enrichment analysis. The network topological structure revealed that adaptive immunity tended to form a prominent and isolated cluster in sepsis. Common genes within the cluster from the 6 datasets included CD247 , CD8A , ITK , LAT , and LCK . The clustering coefficient and modularity parameters were increased in 5/6 and 4/6 datasets in the sepsis group that seemed to be associated with functional aspect of the network. GSE95233 revealed that the nonsurvivor group showed a prominent and isolated adaptive immunity cluster, whereas the survivor group had isolated complement-coagulation and platelet-related clusters. T cell receptor signaling (TCR) pathway and antigen processing and presentation pathway were down-regulated in 5/6 and 4/6 datasets, respectively. Complement and coagulation, Fc gamma, epsilon related signaling pathways were up-regulated in 5/6 datasets. Altogether, network and gene set enrichment analysis showed that adaptive-immunity-related genes along with TCR pathway were down-regulated and isolated from immune the network that seemed to be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Prominence of platelet and complement-coagulation-related genes in the immune network was associated with survival in sepsis. Complement-coagulation pathway was up-regulated in the sepsis group that was associated with favorable prognosis. Network and gene set enrichment analysis supported elucidation of sepsis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3133645656,"Type II diabetes (T2D) and specific cancers share many risk factors, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these connections are often not well-understood. BCDIN3D is an RNA modifying enzyme that methylates specific precursor microRNAs and tRNAHis. In addition to breast cancer, BCDIN3D may also be linked to metabolism, as its gene locus is associated with obesity and T2D. In order to uncover metabolic pathways regulated by BCDIN3D in cancer, we performed an unbiased analysis of the metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome of breast cancer cells depleted for BCDIN3D. Intersection of these analyses showed that BCDIN3D-depleted cells have increased levels of Fructose 1,6 Bisphosphate (F1,6-BP), the last six-carbon glycolytic intermediate accompanied by reduced glycolytic capacity. We further show that elevated F1,6-BP is due to downregulation of Aldolase C (ALDOC), an enzyme that cleaves F1,6-BP mainly in the brain, but whose high expression/amplification is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. BCDIN3D regulates ALDOC through a non-canonical mechanism involving the crucial let-7 microRNA family and its target site on the 3′UTR of ALDOC. Overall, our results reveal an important connection between BCDIN3D, let-7 and glycolysis that may be relevant to breast cancer, obesity, and T2D."
https://openalex.org/W3133688949,"Tight junctions (TJs) play a dominant role in gut barrier formation, therefore, resolving the structures of TJs in any animal species is crucial but of major importance in fast growing broilers. They are regulated in molecular composition, ultrastructure and function by intracellular proteins and the cytoskeleton. TJ proteins are classified according to their function into barrier-forming, scaffolding and pore-forming types with deductible consequences for permeability. In spite of their importance for gut health and its integrity limited studies have investigated the TJs in chickens, including the comprehensive evaluation of TJs molecular composition and function in the chicken gut. In the actual study sequence-specific probes to target different TJ genes (claudin 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 19, zonula occludens 1 (ZO1), occludin (OCLN) and tricellulin (MD2)) were designed and probe-based RT-qPCRs were newly developed. Claudin (CLDN) 1, 5, ZO1 and CLDN 3, 7, MD2 were engulfed in multiplex RT-qPCRs, minimizing the number of separate reactions and enabling robust testing of many samples. All RT-qPCRs were standardized for chicken jejunum and caecum samples, which enabled specific detection and quantification of the gene expression. Furthermore, the newly established protocols were used to investigate the age developmental changes in the TJs of broiler chickens from 1–35 days of age in the same organ samples. Results revealed a significant increase in mRNA expression between 14 and 21days of age of all tested TJs in jejunum. However, in caecum, mRNA expression of some TJs decreased after 1 day of age whereas some TJs mRNA remained constant till 35 days of age. Taken together, determining the segment-specific changes in the expression of TJ- proteins by RT-qPCR provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathophysiological changes in the gut of broiler chickens with various etiologies."
https://openalex.org/W3135406186,"Background General practitioners (GPs) play a significant role in depression care. Recognition of depression is crucial for adequate treatment but is impeded by a high portion of depressed patients only reporting physical symptoms to their GP. Among the many reasons for this phenomenon is mental health stigma. We investigated how patients with depression differed from patients without depression regarding the types and number of complaints presented to their GP, as well as their depression stigma. For the subgroup of patients with depression, potential associations between perceived depression stigma and number and types of presented complaints were investigated to see if these might reflect the patient’s intention to conceal mental health symptoms due to fear of being stigmatized by others. Further, we investigated if perceived depression stigma is related to depression treatment. Methods Data on depressive symptoms (assessed by the Depression Screening Questionnaire; DSQ), depression stigma (assessed by the Depressions Stigma Scale; DSS), type of complaints reported to the GP and treatment-related factors were collected from 3,563 unselected primary care patients of 253 GPs in a cross-sectional epidemiological study (“VERA study”) in six different German regions. Data of a total of 3,069 patients was used for analysis on complaints reported to the GP (subsample of the VERA study), and for 2,682 out of 3,069 patients data on a stigma questionnaire was available. Results Nearly half of the primary care patients with depression (42.2%) reported only physical complaints to their GP. Compared to patients without a depression diagnosis, patients with depression reported twice as many complaints to their GP with a mean of 2.02 (1.33) vs. 1.2 (0.69), including a more frequent combination of physical and mental symptoms (28.8% vs. 3.5%). Patients with depression showed higher total stigma compared to patients without depression, Mdn = 48 ( IQR 40–54) vs. Mdn = 46.3 ( IQR 29–53), due to higher perceived stigma, Mdn = 27 ( IQR 21–32) vs. Mdn = 25.9 ( IQR 20–29). Perceived stigma was associated with male gender (beta -.14, p = .005) and a lack of pharmacological treatment (beta -.14, p = .021) in patients with a depression diagnosis. Conclusion The number of complaints presented to the GP might function as a marker to actively explore depression in primary care patients, in particular when both physical and mental symptoms are reported. Perceived depression stigma should also be addressed especially in male patients. Further research should clarify the role of perceived stigma as a potential inhibitor of pharmacological treatment of depression in primary care."
https://openalex.org/W3135601240,"Background Google Classroom (GC) is a free web-based instructional platform rarely used for nursing student education. The acceptance, intention to use, and learning outcomes of GC remain unclear in Taiwan. We sought to identify the technology acceptance level and factors affection the intention to use GC. We also explored how integrating GC into traditional teaching affects learning satisfaction and academic achievement among nursing students in Taiwan. Methods In this randomized controlled study, based on a technology acceptance framework, 74 nursing students were randomly assigned in clusters to experimental (n = 39) and control (n = 35) groups during the spring semester of 2018. In Weeks 3–18, each member of the experimental group received one hour of traditional and GC teaching per week. The control group received two hours of traditional teaching per week. Both groups were asked to complete questionnaires to evaluate learning satisfaction and academic achievement during weeks 10 (mid-semester) and 18 (end-of-semester). The experimental group additionally completed technology acceptance questionnaire s in both situations. Findings In the experimental group, the overall end - of-semester technology acceptance score was high (141.8 out of 155); their perceived ease of use, intention to use, and technology acceptance scores increased significantly compared to mid-semester ( p &lt;0.05). At the end-of-semester, perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness explained 63.5% of the variance in intention to use. Regardless of whether the assessment was administered mid-semester or at the end-of-semester, the experimental group had higher learning satisfaction and academic achievement scores than the control group. However, the degree of progress on learning satisfaction and academic achievement demonstrated no significant between-group differences. Conclusions The experimental group demonstrated high acceptance of GC. Playfulness and usefulness positively influenced nursing students’ intention to use GC. Blended learning—in combination with GC and traditional methods—resulted in similar learning satisfaction and academic achievement when compared to traditional learning. More research is needed to explore the effectiveness of blended learning through the GC platform with different courses and ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W3135858942,"Chemical transfection is broadly used to transiently transfect mammalian cells, although often associated with cellular stress and membrane instability, which imposes challenges for most cellular assays, including high-throughput (HT) assays. In the current study, we compared the effectiveness of calcium phosphate, FuGENE and Lipofectamine 3000 to transiently express two key voltage-gated ion channels critical in pain pathways, Ca V 2.2 and Na V 1.7. The expression and function of these channels were validated using two HT platforms, the Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader FLIPR Tetra and the automated patch clamp QPatch 16X. We found that all transfection methods tested demonstrated similar effectiveness when applied to FLIPR Tetra assays. Lipofectamine 3000-mediated transfection produced the largest peak currents for automated patch clamp QPatch assays. However, the FuGENE-mediated transfection was the most effective for QPatch assays as indicated by the superior number of cells displaying GΩ seal formation in whole-cell patch clamp configuration, medium to large peak currents, and higher rates of accomplished assays for both Ca V 2.2 and Na V 1.7 channels. Our findings can facilitate the development of HT automated patch clamp assays for the discovery and characterization of novel analgesics and modulators of pain pathways, as well as assisting studies examining the pharmacology of mutated channels."
https://openalex.org/W3134808719,"Monitoring pesticide resistance is essential for effective and sustainable agricultural practices. Bioassays are the basis for pesticide-resistance testing, but devising a reliable and reproducible method can be challenging because these tests are carried out on living organisms. Here, we investigated five critical parameters and how they affected the evaluation of resistance to the organophosphate phosmet or the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin using a tarsal-contact protocol on Drosophila suzukii , a worldwide invasive pest. Three of the parameters were related to insect biology: (i) sex, (ii) age of the imago (adult stage) and (iii) genetic diversity of the tested population. The two remaining parameters were linked to the experimental setup: (iv) the number of individuals tested per dose and (v) the duration of exposure to the active ingredient. Results showed that response to insecticide differed depending on sex, males being twice as susceptible to phosmet as females. Age principally affected young females’ susceptibility to phosmet, because 0–24 hour-old flies were twice as susceptible as 24–48 hour-old and 72–96 hour-old females. Genetic diversity had no observable effect on resistance levels. The precision and accuracy of the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) were greatly affected by the number of individuals tested per dose with a threshold effect. Finally, optimal duration of exposure to the active ingredient was 24 h, as we found an underestimation of mortality when assessed between 1 and 5 h after exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin. None of the main known point mutations on the para sodium channel gene associated with a knockdown effect were observed. Our study demonstrates the importance of calibrating the various parameters of a bioassay to develop a reliable method. It also provides a valuable and transferable protocol for monitoring D . suzukii resistance worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3135210503,"Introduction Regulating excessive activation of fibroblasts may be a promising target to optimize extracellular matrix deposition and myocardial stiffness. Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) is upregulated in activated fibroblasts after myocardial infarction (MI), and alters fibroblast migration in vitro . We hypothesized that FAP depletion may have a protective effect on left ventricular (LV) remodeling after MI. Materials and methods We used the model of chronic MI in homozygous FAP deficient mice (FAP-KO, n = 51) and wild type mice (WT, n = 55) to analyze wound healing by monocyte and myofibroblast infiltration. Heart function and remodeling was studied by echocardiography, morphometric analyses including capillary density and myocyte size, collagen content and in vivo cell-proliferation. In non-operated healthy mice up to 6 months of age, morphometric analyses and collagen content was assessed (WT n = 10, FAP-KO n = 19). Results Healthy FAP-deficient mice did not show changes in LV structure or differences in collagen content or cardiac morphology. Infarct size, survival and cardiac function were not different between FAP-KO and wildtype mice. FAP-KO animals showed less LV-dilation and a thicker scar, accompanied by a trend towards lower collagen content. Wound healing, assessed by infiltration with inflammatory cells and myofibroblasts were not different between groups. Conclusion We show that genetic ablation of FAP does not impair cardiac wound healing, and attenuates LV dilation after MI in mice. FAP seems dispensable for normal cardiac function and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3135846059,"HOTAIR is a well-known long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in various cellular signaling, whereas its functional impacts on endometriosis development are still largely unknown. To this end, six potential functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HOTAIR , with minor allele frequencies more than 10% in Han population and altered net energy of RNA structures larger than 0.5 kcal/mol, were selected for genotyping study. The study included 207 endometriosis patients and 200 healthy women. Genetic substitutions at rs1838169 and rs17720428 were frequently found in endometriosis patients, and rs1838169 showed statistical significance ( p = 0.0174). The G-G (rs1838169-rs17720428) haplotype showed the most significant association with endometriosis ( p &lt; 0.0001) with enhanced HOTAIR stability, and patients who harbor such haplotype tended to show higher CA125. Data mining further revealed higher mRNA HOTAIR levels in the endometria of patients with severe endometriosis which consistently showed reduced HOXD10 and HOXA5 levels. HOTAIR knockdown with specific shRNAs down-regulated cell proliferation and migration with the induction of HOXD10 and HOXA5 expression in human ovarian clear cancer cells. Our study therefore provided evidence to indicate a prominent role of HOTAIR in promoting endometriosis, which could be used as a potential target for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3133612307,"Background The aim of this study is to compare the three previously applied, conventional porcine corneal decellularization methods and to demonstrate the importance of preserving the corneal limbus through decellularization. Methods Fresh, wild-type (with or without) limbus porcine corneas were decellularized using three different methods, including (i) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), (ii) hypertonic saline (HS), and (iii) N 2 gas (NG). Post-treatment evaluation was carried out using histological, residual nuclear material, and ultrastructural analyses. Glycerol was used to help reduce the adverse effects of decellularization. The corneas were preserved for two weeks in cornea storage medium. Results All three decellularization methods reduced the number of keratocytes at different rates in the stromal tissue. However, all methods, except SDS, resulted in the retention of large numbers of cells and cell fragments. The SDS method (0.1% SDS, 48h) resulted in almost 100% decellularization in corneas without limbus. Low decellularization capacity of the NG method (&lt;50%) could make it unfavorable. Although HS method had a more balanced damage-decellularization ratio, its decellularization capacity was lower than SDS method. Preservation of the corneoscleral limbus could partially prevent structural damage and edema, but it would reduce the decellularization capacity. Conclusion Our results suggest that SDS is a very powerful decellularization method, but it damages the cornea irreversibly. Preserving the corneoscleral limbus reduces the efficiency of decellularization, but also reduces the damage."
https://openalex.org/W3134329935,"Microsporidia are recognized as opportunistic pathogens in individuals with immunodeficiencies, especially related to T cells. Although the activity of CD8 + T lymphocytes is essential to eliminate these pathogens, earlier studies have shown significant participation of macrophages at the beginning of the infection. Macrophages and other innate immunity cells play a critical role in activating the acquired immunity. After programmed cell death, the cell fragments or apoptotic bodies are cleared by phagocytic cells, a phenomenon known as efferocytosis. This process has been recognized as a way of evading immunity by intracellular pathogens. The present study evaluated the impact of efferocytosis of apoptotic cells either infected or not on macrophages and subsequently challenged with Encephalitozoon cuniculi microsporidia. Macrophages were obtained from the bone marrow monocytes from C57BL mice, pre-incubated with apoptotic Jurkat cells (ACs), and were further challenged with E . cuniculi spores. The same procedures were performed using the previously infected Jurkat cells (IACs) and challenged with E . cuniculi spores before macrophage pre-incubation. The average number of spores internalized by macrophages in phagocytosis was counted. Macrophage expression of CD40, CD206, CD80, CD86, and MHCII, as well as the cytokines released in the culture supernatants, was measured by flow cytometry. The ultrastructural study was performed to analyze the multiplication types of pathogens. Macrophages pre-incubated with ACs and challenged with E . cuniculi showed a higher percentage of phagocytosis and an average number of internalized spores. Moreover, the presence of stages of multiplication of the pathogen inside the macrophages, particularly after efferocytosis of infected apoptotic bodies, was observed. In addition, pre-incubation with ACs or IACs and/or challenge with the pathogen decreased the viability of macrophages, reflected as high percentages of apoptosis. The marked expression of CD206 and the release of large amounts of IL-10 and IL-6 indicated the polarization of macrophages to an M2 profile, compatible with efferocytosis and favorable for pathogen development. We concluded that the pathogen favored efferocytosis and polarized the macrophages to an M2 profile, allowing the survival and multiplication of E . cuniculi inside the macrophages and explaining the possibility of macrophages acting as Trojan horses in microsporidiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3134790690,"Fragility fracture of the hip is associated with reduced functional status and mortality. Poor self-rated health (SRH) might be such an indicator. Our aim was to study if SRH was associated with hip fractures and all-cause mortality within the next 10 years in community-dwelling older women. A population-based sample of 350 women aged between 69 and 79 years (median 72.4) assessed their SRH by answering the question “How would you rate your health right now” by putting a mark on a visual-analogue scale (0–100 mm). Information on hip fracture and mortality over the next 10 years was retrieved from health care registers. The association between SRH and hip fracture and all-cause mortality was tested with a Cox proportional hazards regression model. SRH was divided into low, intermediate, and high (reference) assessed SRH. During the study, 40 hip fractures and 72 deaths occurred. The median value of SRH was 62 mm (IQR 50–81 mm). The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for hip fracture was significantly higher in the group with low and intermediate SRH; HR: 3.17 (95% CI 1.25–8.01), and HR: 2.75 (95% CI 1.08–7.04), compared with high SRH. Adding bone mineral density (at the femoral neck) gave even greater risk. We did not find the hypothesized association between SRH and mortality. In our study, SRH indicated a higher risk of future hip fracture in older women. SRH might be a marker that could add information about the risk of hip fracture independently of bone mineral density."
https://openalex.org/W3134851942,"A tropical storm (TS) Roanu occurred in northern Sri Lanka in 2016, which transported northwards along the west coast of the Bay of Bengal (BoB). During the development of the TS, ocean eddies on its track had an important effect on the intensity of Roanu. The dynamic mechanism was investigated with multisource reanalysis and Argo float data in this study. The results show that ocean eddies were the main reason why Roanu first enhanced, weakened, and then enhanced again. Warm eddy W1 supports the initial development of the TS, cold eddy C1 weakens Roanu, and warm eddy W2 continues to support Roanu. On May 19, 2016, the maximum average latent heat flux over W1 was 260.85 w/m 2 , while that of C1 was only 200.71 w/m 2 . After the passage of Roanu, the tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) of eddies significantly decreased. The TCHP of W1, W2, C1 and C2 decreased by 20.95 kJ/cm 2 , 11.07 kJ/cm 2 , 29.82 kJ/cm 2 , 9.31 kJ/cm 2 , respectively. The mixed layer of warm eddies deepened much more than that of cold eddies, supporting Roanu development. In addition, changes in potential vorticity (PV) values caused by the disturbance of eddies may also reflect changes in the TS intensity. This study offers new insights on the influence of ocean eddies in regulating the development of tropical cyclone (TC) in the BoB."
https://openalex.org/W3135197650,"Copper is essential for the activity and stability of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Loss-of-function mutations in genes required for copper transport to CcO result in fatal human disorders. Despite the fundamental importance of copper in mitochondrial and organismal physiology, systematic identification of genes that regulate mitochondrial copper homeostasis is lacking. To discover these genes, we performed a genome-wide screen using a library of DNA-barcoded yeast deletion mutants grown in copper-supplemented media. Our screen recovered a number of genes known to be involved in cellular copper homeostasis as well as genes previously not linked to mitochondrial copper biology. These newly identified genes include the subunits of the adaptor protein 3 complex (AP-3) and components of the cellular pH-sensing pathway Rim20 and Rim21, both of which are known to affect vacuolar function. We find that AP-3 and Rim mutants exhibit decreased vacuolar acidity, which in turn perturbs mitochondrial copper homeostasis and CcO function. CcO activity of these mutants could be rescued by either restoring vacuolar pH or supplementing growth media with additional copper. Consistent with these genetic data, pharmacological inhibition of the vacuolar proton pump leads to decreased mitochondrial copper content and a concomitant decrease in CcO abundance and activity. Taken together, our study uncovered novel genetic regulators of mitochondrial copper homeostasis and provided a mechanism by which vacuolar pH impacts mitochondrial respiration through copper homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3135640164,"Introduction HIV/AIDS remains a public health concern affecting millions of people across the world. Although the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients living with HIV has significantly improved after treatment, its chronicity makes the HRQoL uncertain. This study assessed factors associated with the health-related quality of life among people living with HIV/AIDS on HAART in North-East Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2018, and systematic random sampling was used to select 235 participants who were on HAART. HRQoL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analysis were computed using the statistical package for social sciences version 20. Results The study revealed one-factor structure and had good overall internal consistency (78.5). Over one-third (42.6%; 95% CI; 36.2%, 48.9%) of participants had good HRQoL. The least HRQoL mean score was found for cognitive functioning 32.21(±19.78), followed by social functioning 40.58(±29.8). Factors associated with the overall HRQoL were 25–45 years of age (β = − 3.55, 95% CI;-6.54, -0.55), working in private sector (β = -5.66, 95% CI;-9.43, -1.88), government (β = -4.29, 95% CI;-7.83, -0.75) and self-employment (β = -8.86, 95% CI;-13.50, -4.21), 100–200 (β = − 4.84, 95% CI;-9.04, -0.63) and 201–350 CD4 at the time of diagnosis (β = − 7.45, 95% CI;-11.73, -3.16), 351–500 current CD4 level (β = 8.34, 95% CI;5.55, 11.41), 6–10 years of disease duration (β = -8.28, 95% CI;-12.51, -4.04), WHO stage II (β = -4.78, 95% CI;-8.52, -1.04) and III (β = 3.42, 95% CI;0.06, 6.79) during treatment initiation and not taking of Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (β = -5.79, 95% CI;-8.34, -3.25). Conclusions High proportion of participants had a poor HRQoL. Routine assessment and appropriate interventions at each visit is recommended to improve HRQoL."
https://openalex.org/W3134628155,"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of scriptaid during pre-maturation (PIVM) and/or maturation (IVM) on developmental competence of bovine oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were submitted to PIVM for 6 h in the presence or absence of scriptaid. COCs were distributed into five groups: T1-IVM for 22 h, T2-PIVM for 6 h and IVM for 22 h, T3-PIVM with scriptaid for 6 h and IVM for 22 h, T4-PIVM for 6 h and IVM with scriptaid for 22 h, and T5-PIVM with scriptaid for 6 h and IVM with scriptaid for 22 h. Nuclear maturation, gene expression, cumulus cells (CCs) expansion, and embryo development and quality were evaluated. At the end of maturation, all groups presented the majority of oocytes in MII (P&gt;0.05). Only HAT1 gene was differentially expressed (P&lt;0.01) in oocytes with different treatments. Regarding embryo development at D7, T4 (23%) and T5 (18%) had lower blastocyst rate (P&lt;0.05) than the other treatments (T1 = 35%, T2 = 37% and T3 = 32%). No effect was observed when scriptaid in PIVM was used in less competent oocytes (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, presence of scriptaid in PIVM and/or IVM did not improve developmental competence or embryo quality."
https://openalex.org/W3135872441,"The present study aimed to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction of 16 agronomic traits in a diverse bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm under terminal drought stress and well-watered conditions in semi-arid environments. An association panel including 87 bread wheat cultivars and 199 landraces from Iran bread wheat germplasm was planted under two irrigation systems in semi-arid climate zones. The whole association panel was genotyped with 9047 single nucleotide polymorphism markers using the genotyping-by-sequencing method. A number of 23 marker-trait associations were selected for traits under each condition, whereas 17 marker-trait associations were common between terminal drought stress and well-watered conditions. The identified marker-trait associations were mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms with minor allele effects. This study examined the effect of population structure, genomic selection method (ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction, genomic best-linear unbiased predictions, and Bayesian ridge regression), training set size, and type of marker set on genomic prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracies were low (-0.32) to moderate (0.52). A marker set including 93 significant markers identified through genome-wide association studies with P values ≤ 0.001 increased the genomic prediction accuracy for all traits under both conditions. This study concluded that obtaining the highest genomic prediction accuracy depends on the extent of linkage disequilibrium, the genetic architecture of trait, genetic diversity of the population, and the genomic selection method. The results encouraged the integration of genome-wide association study and genomic selection to enhance genomic prediction accuracy in applied breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3134103555,"The tumultuous inception of an epidemic is usually accompanied by difficulty in determining how to respond best. In developing nations, this can be compounded by logistical challenges, such as vaccine shortages and poor road infrastructure. To provide guidance towards improved epidemic response, various resource allocation models, in conjunction with a network-based SEIRVD epidemic model, are proposed in this article. Further, the feasibility of using drones for vaccine delivery is evaluated, and assorted relevant parameters are discussed. For the sake of generality, these results are presented for multiple network structures, representing interconnected populations—upon which repeated epidemic simulations are performed. The resource allocation models formulated maximise expected prevented exposures on each day of a simulated epidemic, by allocating response teams and vaccine deliveries according to the solutions of two respective integer programming problems—thereby influencing the simulated epidemic through the SEIRVD model. These models, when compared with a range of alternative resource allocation strategies, were found to reduce both the number of cases per epidemic, and the number of vaccines required. Consequently, the recommendation is made that such models be used as decision support tools in epidemic response. In the absence thereof, prioritizing locations for vaccinations according to susceptible population, rather than total population or number of infections, is most effective for the majority of network types. In other results, fixed-wing drones are demonstrated to be a viable delivery method for vaccines in the context of an epidemic, if sufficient drones can be promptly procured; the detrimental effect of intervention delay was discovered to be significant. In addition, the importance of well-documented routine vaccination activities is highlighted, due to the benefits of increased pre-epidemic immunity rates, and targeted vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W3134250989,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of feeding frequency on behavioral patterns and on diurnal fermentation and bacteriome profiles of the rumen and feces in Holstein and Jersey cows. Ten Holstein and 10 Jersey cows were offered a TMR (53:47 forage-to-concentrate ratio dry matter basis) for ad libitum consumption and were randomly allocated within breed to one of the following feeding frequencies: (1) TMR delivered 1×/d (at 0600 h) or (2) TMR delivered 2×/d (at 0600 and 1800 h). The experiment lasted for 28 d with the first 14 d for cow adaptation to the Calan gates and the next 14 d for data collection. On d 23 and 24, an observer manually recorded the time budget (time spent lying, eating, drinking, standing, and milking), rumination activity, and number of visits to the feeding gate from each animal. On d 28, 5 concomitant collections of rumen and fecal samples were performed at intervals of 6 h via esophageal tubing and fecal grab, respectively. The bacteriome composition from these samples was determined through sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Feeding frequency did not affect behavioral patterns; however, Holstein cows spend more time lying (15.4 vs. 13.5 ± 0.8 h) and ruminating (401 vs. 331 ± 17.5 min) than Jersey cows. Fermentation profiles were similar by feeding frequency in both breeds. While no major diurnal fluctuations were observed in the fecal bacterial community from both breeds, diurnal fluctuations were identified in the rumen bacterial community from Holstein cows which appeared to follow pH responses. Overall, the bacterial community composition was not differentiated by industry standard feeding frequencies but was differentiated by breed and sample type."
https://openalex.org/W3135322460,"The Mexican Axolotl is able to regenerate missing limb structures in any position along the limb axis throughout its life and serves as an excellent model to understand the basic mechanisms of endogenous regeneration. How the new pattern of the regenerating axolotl limb is established has not been completely resolved. An accumulating body of evidence indicates that pattern formation occurs in a hierarchical fashion, which consists of two different types of positional communications. The first type (Type 1) of communication occurs between connective tissue cells, which retain memory of their original pattern information and use this memory to generate the pattern of the regenerate. The second type (Type 2) of communication occurs from connective tissue cells to other cell types in the regenerate, which don’t retain positional memory themselves and arrange themselves according to these positional cues. Previous studies suggest that molecules within the extracellular matrix (ECM) participate in pattern formation in developing and regenerating limbs. However, it is unclear whether these molecules play a role in Type 1 or Type 2 positional communications. Utilizing the Accessory Limb Model, a regenerative assay, and transcriptomic analyses in regenerates that have been reprogrammed by treatment with Retinoic Acid, our data indicates that the ECM likely facilities Type-2 positional communications during limb regeneration."

In existing methods, it is fairly popular to apply a deep learning method to the text classification task. Aiming at solving information loss, weak context and other problems, this paper makes an improvement based on the transformer model to reduce the difficulty of model training and training time cost and achieve higher overall model recall and accuracy in text sentiment classification. The transformer model replaces the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) and is fully based on the attention mechanism; therefore, the transformer model effectively improves the training speed and reduces training difficulty. This paper selects e-commerce reviews as research objects and applies deep learning theory. First, the text is preprocessed by word vectorization. Then the IN standardized method and the GELUs activation function are applied based on the original model to analyze the emotional tendencies of online users towards stores or products. The experimental results show that our method improves by 9.71%, 6.05%, 5.58% and 5.12% in terms of recall and approaches the peak level of the F1 value in the test model by comparing BiLSTM, Naive Bayesian Model, the serial BiLSTM_CNN model and BiLSTM with an attention mechanism model. Therefore, this finding proves that our method can be used to improve the text sentiment classification accuracy and effectively apply the method to text classification."
https://openalex.org/W3135654793,"Background Few studies have explored the association between depressive symptoms, HIV infection and stigma in vulnerable populations. The objective of this study is to examine factors associated with depressive symptoms among caregivers living in vulnerable households in Malawi and assess how reported depressive symptoms and other factors affect ART adherence among caregivers who report testing positive for HIV and currently on ART. Methods We interviewed 818 adult caregivers of children aged 0–17 years living in vulnerable households in 24 health facility catchment areas in five districts in rural southern Malawi in 2016–2017. Vulnerable households had either economic and food insecurity, or chronic illness. Questions on five depressive symptoms were used. ART adherence was self-report of not forgetting to take ART medication in the last week. Perceived and anticipated measures of stigma were used. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions documented relationships between depressive symptoms, self-reported HIV status, HIV-related stigma, and ART adherence. Results Most caregivers were women (86.2%); about one third had no spouse or live-in partner. Fifty-seven percent of caregivers reported having three or more depressive symptoms. Forty-one percent of caregivers reported testing positive for HIV. Self-reported HIV positive status was associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted coeff = 0.355, p-value &lt;0.001), which were in turn associated with poorer ART adherence among caregivers (aOR 0.639, p-value = 0.023). HIV-related stigma was also associated with depressive symptoms for caregivers who reported having HIV (coeff = 0.302, p-value = 0.028) and those who reported testing negative for HIV (coeff = 0.187, p-value &lt;0.001). Having social support was associated with lower depressive symptoms (coeff = -0.115, p = 0.007). HIV-related stigma, having social support, and other socio-demographic characteristics were not found to be associated with ART adherence. Conclusions Addressing mental health among caregivers in vulnerable households may be an important step toward achieving viral suppression among vulnerable populations living with HIV in Malawi. Integrating depression screening into HIV care and treatment protocols could be a promising intervention to improve longer-term outcomes."

HR status changed in 21(23.1%) patients, with a significant difference between patients with stable receptors and those with any receptor conversion; p = 0.000. Five (5.5%) initially HER2 negative tumors became HER2 positive and 10 (11%) initially HER2 positive tumors became HER2 negative after NAC. The difference in HER2 expression level before and after NAC was not statistically significant (p = 0.302). Univariate analysis relating patients' characteristics and 10-years disease-free survival (DFS) showed only significant correlations with the expressions of ER, PR, and any receptor conversion, (ER and/or PR) p< 0.001, p< 0.001, and p = 0.001; respectively. In the univariate analysis, none of the clinicopathological features showed a significant correlation with the OS except for the molecular subtypes P<0.001.Patients with LABC have significant changes in the ER and PR receptor status following NAC. Post-NAC expressions change of ER and PR (ER and/or PR) are correlated to DFS. Retesting of the hormone receptors should be considered after NAC in Saudi patients with LABC."

https://openalex.org/W3135415083,"Background This study examines the dynamics of the eculizumab patenting, orphan designation, and marketing authorization process in different countries and regulatory systems and analyzes drug revenues since its first marketing authorization. Methods A retrospective case study was conducted. Multiple information sources were used to: determine the status of eculizumab patents; examine the designation of orphan drug status by US, European, Japanese, and Brazilian regulatory authorities to determine registration status and approved clinical indications; estimate the prevalence of associated clinical conditions; investigate the history of the drug manufacturer, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and its financialized business model; and examine global eculizumab sales revenues since its first marketing authorization. Results Our search yielded 32 patent families divided into 98 applications. The first patent granted was filed in 1995 by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the US. Eculizumab has always been as an orphan drug, except in the Brazilian regulatory agency. All clinical indications approved thus far refer to rare diseases (e.g., paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria syndrome, atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, refractory and generalized myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder). Alexion’s revenues amounted to more than US$25 billion between 2007 and 2019, showing a growing trend. Eculizumab led sales from the beginning, being the only product in the company’s portfolio until 2015. In 2019, the drug accounted for 79.1% of all revenues. Discussion Our findings show that a strategy focused on obtaining orphan drug designation, expanding therapeutic indications and the geographic range of marketing approvals, extending monopoly periods, and prioritizing public procurement niches has enhanced revenues and helped the company achieve leadership in a highly specific and profitable market."
https://openalex.org/W3133684626,"Phenotype Prediction Scores (PPS) might be powerful tools to predict traits or the efficacy of treatments based on combinations of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism ( SNPs) in large samples. We developed a novel method to produce PPS models for small samples sizes. The set of SNPs is first filtered on those known to be relevant in biological pathways involved in a clinical condition, and then further filtered repeatedly in a survival strategy to select stabile positive/negative risk alleles. This method is applied on Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (FSIAD), for which two subtypes has been proposed: 1) a relatively insensitive excitatory system in the brain for sexual cues, and 2) a dysfunctional activation of brain mechanisms for sexual inhibition. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over experiment was conducted on 129 women with FSIAD. The women received three different on-demand drug-combination treatments during 3 two-week periods: testosterone (0.5 mg) + sildenafil (50 mg), testosterone (0.5 mg) + buspirone (10 mg), or matching placebos. The resulted PPS were independently validated on patient-level and group-level. The AUC scores for T+S of the derivation set was 0.867 (95% CI = 0.796–0.939; p&lt;0.001) and was 0.890 (95% CI = 0.778–1.000; p&lt;0.001) on the validation set.

https://openalex.org/W3134862588,"Darwin’s finches are an iconic example of adaptive radiation and evolution under natural selection. Comparative genetic studies using embryos of Darwin’s finches have shed light on the possible evolutionary processes underlying the speciation of this clade. Molecular identification of the sex of embryonic samples is important for such studies, where this information often cannot be inferred otherwise. We tested a fast and simple chicken embryo protocol to extract DNA from Darwin’s finch embryos. In addition, we applied minor modifications to two of the previously reported PCR primer sets for CHD1 , a gene used for sexing adult passerine birds. The sex of all 29 tested embryos of six species of Darwin’s finches was determined successfully by PCR, using both primer sets. Next to embryos, hatchlings and fledglings are also impossible to distinguish visually. This extends to juveniles of sexually dimorphic species which are yet to moult in adult-like plumage and beak colouration. Furthermore, four species of Darwin’s finches are monomorphic, males and females looking alike. Therefore, sex assessment in the field can be a source of error, especially with respect to juveniles and mature monomorphic birds outside of the mating season. We caught 567 juveniles and adults belonging to six species of Darwin’s finches and only 44% had unambiguous sex-specific morphology. We sexed 363 birds by PCR: individuals sexed based on marginal sex specific morphological traits; and birds which were impossible to classify in the field. PCR revealed that for birds with marginal sex specific traits, sexing in the field produced a 13% error rate. This demonstrates that PCR based sexing can improve field studies on Darwin’s finches, especially when individuals with unclear sex-related morphology are involved. The protocols used here provide an easy and reliable way to sex Darwin’s finches throughout ontogeny, from embryos to adults."

Background Sleep is a natural physiological phenomenon, and sleep disorders may cause severe mental hazards leading to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and β -glucan are the essential active ingredients of RB and mushroom, respectively, exhibited stress-reduction and nerve stabilizing potential through regulation of melatonin and serotonin hormones. Methods Cytotoxicity of the extracts (RBS) was evaluated through WST-1 assay. The melatonin and serotonin concentrations in the blood serum were measured through ELISA kits. The Ig ELISA kit measured the immunoglobulin’s (IgG, IgM, and IgA) concentrations. Results Improved cell viability was observed in RBS treated groups than control, indicating their biocompatibility. The melatonin and serotonin levels were high in RBS (5:5 and 7:3) treated groups compared to the control. Enhanced expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G level was observed in RBS treated rats. The serotonergic genes (5-HTT, 5-HT 1B, and MAO-A) expression levels were upregulated in RBS treated groups vis-à-vis the control. Conclusion Based on these results, we anticipated that RBS supplements could promote the sleep phenomenon by elevating the serotonin/melatonin level in the blood through the serotonergic system. Therefore, RBS supplements can be utilized as functional food material for sleep promotion."

Cross-sectional U.S. trend data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) database (2006, 2009, 2012, 2016) was used to estimate overall national expenditure associated with brain MRI among infants with gestational age (GA) ≤36 weeks, and also when classified as ‘not indicated’ (NI-MRI) i.e., equivalent to routine use without clinical indications and regarded as low-value service (LVS). Associated cost was determined by querying CMS-database for physician-fee-schedules to find the highest global procedure-cost per cycle, then adjusting for inflation. Sensitivity-analyses were conducted to account for additional clinical charges associated with NI-MRI. 3,768 (0.26%) of 1,472,236 preterm-infants had brain MRI across all cycles (inflation-adjusted total $3,690,088). Overall proportion of brain MRIs increased across 2006–2012 from 0.25%-0.33% but decreased in 2016 to 0.16% ( P &lt;0.001). Inflation-adjusted overall expenditure by cycle was: 2006, $1,299,130 (95% CI: $987,505, $1,610,755); 2009, $1,194,208 (95% CI: $873,487, $1,516,154); 2012, $931,836 (95% CI: $666,114, $1,197,156); and 2016, $264,648 (95% CI: $172,061, $357,280). Prevalence for NI-MRI in 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016 was 86% (n = 809), 88% (n = 940), 89% (n = 1028) and 50% (n = 299), respectively; and 70% were in infants 35–36 weeks GA. NI-MRI prevalence was not different over time by payer-type (Medicaid, private), sex or race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic); larger hospital size was significantly associated across 2006–2012 but this declined for all sizes in 2016, with most decline in larger hospitals ( P for interaction &lt;0.05). NI-MRI expenditure sensitivity-analysis with addition of cycle median total-admission-charge to inflation-adjusted CMS-fee was $1,190,919/$518,343, for 2012/2016 cycles respectively. National MRI prevalence in preterm infants (both overall and LVS) and associated expenditure decreased substantially post recommendation; however, annual savings are modest and unlikely to be &gt;$1.2 million."
https://openalex.org/W3135547569,"Background Salmonid rickettsial septicemia is an emergent and geographically widespread disease of marine-farmed salmonids caused by infection with the water-borne bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis . Very little is known about the route, timing, or magnitude of bacterial shedding from infected fish. Methodology/principal findings A cohabitation challenge model was used to assess shedding from chum Oncorhynchus keta , pink O . gorbuscha and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar . Infections in donor fish were established by intraperitoneal injection of P . salmonis . Naïve recipients were cohabitated with donor fish after which cumulative percent morbidity and mortality (CMM) was monitored, and bacterial burdens in kidney and in tank water were measured by qPCR. All donor fish died with mean days-to-death (MDD) among species ranging from 17.5 to 23.9. Among recipients, CMM ranged from 42.7% to 77.8% and MDD ranged from 49.7 to 56.4. In each trial, two peaks of bacterial DNA concentrations in tank water closely aligned with the MDD values of donor and recipient fish. Bacterial tissue burden and shedding rate, and plasma physiological parameters were obtained from individual donors and recipients. Statistically significant positive correlations between the shedding rate and P . salmonis kidney burden were measured in donor pink and in donor and recipient chum salmon, but not in donor or recipient Atlantic salmon. In Atlantic salmon, there was a negative correlation between kidney bacterial burden and hematocrit, plasma Ca ++ and Mg ++ values, whereas in infected chum salmon the correlation was positive for Na + and Cl - and negative for glucose. Conclusions A dependency of bacterial shedding on species-specific patterns of pathogenesis was suggested. The coincidence of bacterial shedding with mortality will inform pathogen transmission models."
https://openalex.org/W3133515264,"In China, the majority of food enterprises are small-sized and medium-sized. While the supervision costs are high, food safety issues are still emerging. Food circulation is an indispensable part in the entire food chain. At present, there are few studies on the regional spread of food safety risks in the circulation field from a macro perspective. This study combines GIS and social network analysis methods to deeply explore the regional circulation characteristics of substandard foods. First, we crawl the dataset of Food Safety Sampling Inspection Result Query System. Then we obtain the geographical locations of the manufacturers and distributors by GIS. Finally, we construct the province-level and city-level substandard foods’ circulation networks, and employ social network analysis to target key cities and paths. The experimental results show that the circulations of substandard foods are characterized by dense province-level network and sparse city-level network, and they are mostly local and short-distance trafficking. 361 cities are divided into 13 city clusters considering the network connection characteristics. Chongqing, Beijing, Zhengzhou, and Changsha are identified as key cities by all measurement indicators, and at least four indicators can identify Shanghai and Wuhan. These cities have the highest priority for combating substandard foods’ circulation networks."
https://openalex.org/W3134872494,"A viscosity estimation model for fluorine-containing mold flux for continuous casting was investigated based on the Arrhenius formula and the rotating cylinder method combined with nonlinear regression analysis. This model is highly applicable and not limited by the slag of a certain composition. For most slag compositions, the viscosities estimated with this model deviated from the measured values by no more than 10%, which was in better agreement with the measured values than the viscosities estimated by the Riboud, Iida and Mills models. According to the model calculation and experimental detection, a viscosity isogram of CaF2-Na2O-Al2O3-CaO-SiO2-MgO slag was produced, and the mass fraction of CaF2 in the low-viscosity zone was nearly 14%. An X-ray fluorescence spectrometric analysis of slag after the viscosity test showed that CaF2 and Na2O were significantly reduced, and the measured viscosity was greater than the theoretical viscosity due to the volatilization."
https://openalex.org/W3135403194,"Continuous darkness decreases seedling quality during storage, whereas appropriate light quality and intensity can overcome these negative effects. In this study, we determined the light intensity, storage time (ST), and storage temperature suitable for cucumber ( Cucumis sativa L.) seedlings. We stored cucumber seedlings under four different photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFDs; 0, 15, 30, and 45 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 ) at 12°C, and examined how the morphological, physiological, and photosynthetic changes in seedlings during storage affected their ability to recover after transplanting. Our results indicated that at least 15 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 PPFD was needed for cucumber seedlings stored in the dark for 2 or 4 d, and at least 30 μmol·m -2 ·s -1 PPFD was needed when the ST was extended to 6 d. Overall, our results showed that cucumber seedlings require light-emitting diode (LED) illumination during storage to maintain their quality and recovery ability."
