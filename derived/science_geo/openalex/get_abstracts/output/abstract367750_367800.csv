https://openalex.org/W2004235182,"Absolute metabolite concentrations are critical to a quantitative understanding of cellular metabolism, as concentrations impact both the free energies and rates of metabolic reactions. Here we use LC-MS/MS to quantify more than 100 metabolite concentrations in aerobic, exponentially growing Escherichia coli with glucose, glycerol or acetate as the carbon source. The total observed intracellular metabolite pool was approximately 300 mM. A small number of metabolites dominate the metabolome on a molar basis, with glutamate being the most abundant. Metabolite concentration exceeds K(m) for most substrate-enzyme pairs. An exception is lower glycolysis, where concentrations of intermediates are near the K(m) of their consuming enzymes and all reactions are near equilibrium. This may facilitate efficient flux reversibility given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints. The data and analyses presented here highlight the ability to identify organizing metabolic principles from systems-level absolute metabolite concentration data."

Gut homeostasis is maintained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that divide to replenish the intestinal epithelium, but little is known about how ISC division and differentiation are coordinated with epithelial cell loss. We show here that when enterocytes (ECs) in the Drosophila midgut are subjected to apoptosis, enteric infection, or JNK-mediated stress signaling, they produce cytokines (Upd, Upd2, and Upd3) that activate Jak/Stat signaling in ISCs, promoting their rapid division. Upd/Jak/Stat activity also promotes progenitor cell differentiation, in part by stimulating Delta/Notch signaling, and is required for differentiation in both normal and regenerating midguts. Hence, cytokine-mediated feedback enables stem cells to replace spent progeny as they are lost, thereby establishing gut homeostasis. Cells in intestinal epithelia turn over rapidly due to damage from digestion and toxins produced by the enteric microbiota.

Upd/Jak/Stat activity also promotes progenitor cell differentiation, in part by stimulating Delta/Notch signaling, and is required for differentiation in both normal and regenerating midguts. Hence, cytokine-mediated feedback enables stem cells to replace spent progeny as they are lost, thereby establishing gut homeostasis. Many animal tissues undergo homeostatic growth in which spent differentiated cells are replaced by the progeny of resident stem or progenitor cells. In the epithelial lining of animal intestines, high rates of cell turnover are presumed to vary according to changes in food composition and dietary exposures to toxins, pathogens, and chemical or mechanical injury. To maintain normal gut structure and function (i.e., homeostasis), intestinal stem cells (ISCs) likely respond to variations in cell loss with corresponding changes in rates of self-renewal and differentiation. How this occurs is not well understood. According to a prevalent view of the vertebrate intestine, stem and transient amplifying cell divisions in the crypts of Lieberkühn, promoted by WNT signaling, drive gut epithelial renewal in a “conveyor-belt” fashion, generating a constant supply of differentiated cells to the villi, where they are autonomously exfoliated (Gregorieff and Clevers, 2005Gregorieff A.

Clevers H. Signaling pathways in intestinal development and cancer.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 695-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In its simplest form, this model does not incorporate feedback from the differentiated epithelium to progenitor cells and, therefore, lacks the means to maintain stasis when rates of epithelial cell loss vary. More sophisticated models that do incorporate feedback have been discussed; for instance, negative cross-talk between BMP signaling in the villi and WNT signaling in the crypts might allow true homeostasis (Crosnier et al., 2006Crosnier C.

However, rigorous tests of the cross-regulatory interactions required have so far not been possible in a vertebrate. In this respect, the Drosophila midgut, which is simpler than its vertebrate counterparts but has similar cell types and signaling interactions, is technically advantageous. The Drosophila adult midgut is maintained by ISCs that self-renew and also produce the two principal differentiated cell types of the intestinal epithelium: absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and secretory enteroendocrine (EE) cells (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A.

Spradling A. The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The midgut also maintains many nondividing, undifferentiated ISC daughters termed enteroblasts (EBs), which can differentiate directly. Differentiation requires Delta/Notch signaling from the ISC to its EB daughter, and, as in mammals, the fate decision taken (absorptive versus secretory) is thought to depend on the intensity of Notch signaling received by an EB (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Multipotent Drosophila intestinal stem cells specify daughter cell fates by differential notch signaling.Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Lineage analysis suggests that, in well-fed flies, differentiated cells in the midgut epithelium turn over roughly weekly, as in mammals. Studies of dissociated Lepidopteran midguts found that cell death caused by Bacillus thuringiensis endotoxin stimulated the division of a population of cells that were probably ISCs (Hakim et al., 2001Hakim R.S.

Broderick N.A. Poidevin M. Pradervand S. Lemaitre B. Drosophila intestinal response to bacterial infection: activation of host defense and stem cell proliferation.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 200-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the loss of damaged ECs stimulates ISC division. Since EB differentiation coincides with a reduction in their contact with a basement membrane, it has also been proposed that this membrane or underlying visceral muscle might provide a niche that promotes stemness and suppresses differentiation (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Multipotent Drosophila intestinal stem cells specify daughter cell fates by differential notch signaling.Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the WNT ligand wg is expressed in visceral muscle, and is important for ISC survival (Lin et al., 2008Lin G. Xu N. Xi R. Paracrine Wingless signalling controls self-renewal of Drosophila intestinal stem cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We show here that the Drosophila midgut can rapidly regenerate after enterocytes are ablated, or subjected to enteric infection or stress signaling. Damaged or stressed ECs produce the Unpaired cytokines (Upd, Upd2, and Upd3). These ligands and their downstream effectors Domeless (dome, an IL-6R-like receptor), Hopscotch (hop, a Janus Kinase; Jak), and Stat92E (a STAT3-like transcription factor) have important roles in germ stem cell maintenance and the immune response in Drosophila. In the midgut, Upds produced by spent ECs trigger Jak/Stat signaling in ISCs and EBs, promoting their division and differentiation, respectively, and thereby driving renewal of the gut epithelium. To determine whether ISCs are required for midgut maintenance, we sought to ablate them. To express cell death effectors, we used esgGal4 and the temperature-sensitive Gal4 repressor, tubGal80ts (McGuire et al., 2004McGuire S.E. Mao Z. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal gene expression targeting with the TARGET and gene-switch systems in Drosophila.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: pl6Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) (together referred to as esgts), to allow temporal activation of UAS-linked target genes in ISCs and EBs (Jiang and Edgar, 2009Jiang H. Edgar B. EGFR signaling regulates the proliferation of Drosophila adult midgut progenitors.Development. 2009; 136: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Although induction of reaper (rpr, an inhibitor of Drosophila Inhibitor of Apoptosis-1; DIAP-1) had little effect on progenitor cells (i.e., ISCs and EBs), ricin A or Drosophila p53 effectively ablated them (Figures 1A and 1B). Fifteen days of p53 induction ablated nearly all esg+ progenitor cells and reduced EE numbers, but the midguts were otherwise intact. After 30 days of p53 induction, all ISCs, EBs, and EEs and many ECs were lost, and the midguts were shrunken (Figure 1B). Remaining ECs had grown in size, perhaps to compensate for the loss of absorptive surface area. This result concurs with clonal analyses (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A. The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) showing that the midgut epithelium turns over rapidly and must be constantly replenished by ISC progeny. To determine whether ISC division responds to epithelial cell loss, we sought to ablate ECs. To express genes in ECs we used the MyoIAGal4 driver (NP1-Gal4), an enhancer trap in the gut-specific brush border myosin IA gene (Morgan et al., 1994Morgan N.S. Skovronsky D.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Mooseker M.S. The molecular cloning and characterization of Drosophila melanogaster myosin-IA and myosin-IB.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in combination with tubGal80ts. UAS-GFP driven by MyoIAGal4 was strongly expressed in all midgut ECs, identified by their large nuclei and expression of brush border Myosin IA. No expression was detected in ISCs, EBs, EEs, or visceral muscle (Figures 1C and 1D). We used the inducible MyoIAGal4 tubGal80ts system (heretofore referred to as MyoIAts) to express the proapoptotic gene reaper (rpr), to trigger EC apoptosis. MyoIAGal4 tubGal80ts UAS-Rpr (MyoIAts>Rpr) animals were raised to adults at 18°C (Gal4 “off”), shifted to 29°C (Gal4 “on”) for 12 hr, and then shifted to 18°C to extinguish rpr expression. Twelve hour induction of Rpr reduced midgut size due to widespread apoptosis (Figures 1F and 1J). Tissue sections showed the loss of EC brush borders and apical extrusion (Figures 1G and 1H). Within days, however, the damaged midguts had regenerated substantially (Figures 1K–1M). We assayed the mitotic response of ISCs using antibodies to phospho-Ser10-histone 3 (PH3). PH3+ mitotic figures rose to >100/midgut by 48 hr after a 12 hr pulse of reaper, whereas controls maintained a mitotic index of 1–3 mitoses/midgut (Figures 1I–1K and 1N). Rpr-induced mitoses could be suppressed by coexpression of the caspase inhibitors p35 or DIAP1 (Figure 2K), indicating that apoptosis was required. Most (88%) PH3+ cells were positive for the ISC marker Delta, and all PH3+ cells were negative for the EE marker prospero (Figure 1P; see Table S1 available online). Delta+ cells in regenerating midguts were enlarged, consistent with increased growth, had higher Delta levels than in controls, and were often paired or clustered (Figures 1P). Midgut mitoses declined after 2 days and reached basal levels within a week (Figures 1L–1N). Regenerating midguts regained their normal size by 60 hr of recovery, before the cessation of ISC proliferation or replenishment of the EC population. At this stage, the midgut epithelium consisted of fewer ECs than normal, but these ECs were larger and more polyploid than those in controls (Figures 1K and 1L). Following Rpr expression, extensive BrdU incorporation was rapidly induced not only in small cells (ISCs and EBs), but also in large polyploid ECs (Figure 1R). This finding suggests that existing ECs might respond directly to gut epithelial damage by compensatory EC growth and endoreplication. By one month of recovery, Rpr-damaged midguts had regained normal cellularity and EC size (Figure 1M). To summarize, the midgut can compensate for epithelial cell loss by increasing progenitor cell divisions and the consequent generation of new ECs. To further investigate midgut regeneration, we tested the Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway, a MAPK-type kinase cascade that is activated in response to cellular stress and that is involved in compensatory cell proliferation following injury in both insects and mammals (McEwen and Peifer, 2005McEwen D.G.

Steller H. Apoptotic cells can induce compensatory cell proliferation through the JNK and the Wingless signaling pathways.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). We activated JNK signaling in ECs by expressing RNAi directed against puckered (puc) using the MyoIAts system. puc encodes Drosophila Jun N-terminal kinase phosphatase. It is a potent suppressor of JNK activity and also a direct downstream target of JNK signaling (Martin-Blanco et al., 1998Martin-Blanco E. Gampel A. Ring J. Virdee K. Kirov N. Tolkovsky A.M. Martinez-Arias A. puckered encodes a phosphatase that mediates a feedback loop regulating JNK activity during dorsal closure in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Inducing puc RNAi in ECs for 2 days caused a large increase in ISC mitoses (Figure 2A). A similar but more rapid mitotic response was observed when an activated form of hemipterous (HepAct, Drosophila JNK kinase) was used to activate JNK in ECs (Figure 2B). We noted that HepAct induction increased the number and density of small Delta+ cells, suggesting that JNK activation elevated the numbers of ISC-like progenitors (Figures 5B, 5D, and S1B). As observed in other contexts (Kanda and Miura, 2004Kanda H. Miura M. Regulatory roles of JNK in programmed cell death.J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, McEwen and Peifer, 2005McEwen D.G. Peifer M. Puckered, a Drosophila MAPK phosphatase, ensures cell viability by antagonizing JNK-induced apoptosis.Development. 2005; 132: 3935-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), prolonged JNK activation caused significant cell death (data not shown), but the onset of mitoses commenced long before EC apoptosis was observed. Moreover, coexpression of the caspase inhibitor p35 with HepAct did not prevent JNK-mediated mitoses (Figure 2K). Thus, apoptosis appeared not to be responsible for JNK-induced ISC divisions. Control experiments showed that coexpressed puc significantly inhibited ISC mitoses induced by HepAct (Figure 2K), but interestingly, puc or another JNK inhibitor, BskDN (Adachi-Yamada et al., 1999Adachi-Yamada T. Nakamura M. Irie K. Tomoyasu Y. Sano Y. Mori E. Goto S. Ueno N. Nishida Y. Matsumoto K. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase can be involved in transforming growth factor beta superfamily signal transduction in Drosophila wing morphogenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2322-2329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not suppress ISC divisions induced by Rpr (Figure 2K and data not shown). This indicates that stem cell divisions can be triggered by at least two independent pathways: a caspase-independent relay involving JNK signaling, and a caspase-dependent relay. Because cytokine signaling has been implicated in several models of regeneration (Lin and Karin, 2007Lin W.W. Karin M. A cytokine-mediated link between innate immunity, inflammation, and cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar, Prieto, 2008Prieto J. Inflammation, HCC and sex: IL-6 in the centre of the triangle.J. Hepatol. 2008; 48: 380-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we investigated its role in ISC proliferation. Drosophila has three leptin-like (IL-6 family) cytokines called Unpaireds (Upd, Upd2, and Upd3). These cytokines bind an IL-6R type receptor, Domeless (dome), that activates a Janus kinase (Jak) called Hopscotch (hop) and thereby promotes the translocation of a STAT3-like transcription factor (STAT92E) to the nucleus. Transcriptional targets of STAT92E include the receptor, Dome, and a repressor of receptor/Jak complexes, Socs36E. We first tested this pathway's effect on ISCs by overexpressing UAS-Upd either in ECs using MyoIAts, or in ISCs and EBs using esgts. Expression of Upd in either cell type induced ISC mitosis (Figures 2C, 2F, and 2G) and resulted in dramatic gut hyperplasia with large increases in numbers of MyoIA+ ECs (Figures 2D and 2J), pros+ EEs (Figures 2D and 2J), and small Delta+ ISCs (Figures 5B and 5F). Ectopic expression of Upd2 had similar effects (data not shown). We also observed increased midgut mitoses after expressing Hop (JAK) in progenitor cells using esgts (Figure 2C), and in hop gain-of-function mutants (hopTumL; data not shown). Thus, Upd/Jak/Stat signaling is a potent ISC mitogen, but does not block differentiation. Compared with other signals reported to cause midgut hyperplasia (Wnt signaling (Lin et al., 2008Lin G. Xu N. Xi R. Paracrine Wingless signalling controls self-renewal of Drosophila intestinal stem cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and loss of Notch signaling (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar)), Upd or Hop caused a much more rapid, dramatic increase in ISC mitoses and midgut cell numbers. Remarkably, hyperplastic midguts generated by Upd induction returned to normal size, morphology, and cellularity within 2 weeks of silencing the UAS-Upd transgene (Figure 2H). Similarly, JNK-induced hyperplasia was also reversible (Figures S1B–S1D). Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays showed that all three Upd mRNAs were strongly up-regulated after EC apoptosis was triggered by Rpr, or after JNK was activated by HepAct or Puc RNAi (Figure 3A). Upd3 was the most induced, to nearly 200 fold. A reporter for Upd transcription (UpdlacZ) (Chao et al., 2004Chao J.L. Tsai Y.C. Chiu S.J. Sun Y.H. Localized Notch signal acts through eyg and upd to promote global growth in Drosophila eye.Development. 2004; 131: 3839-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was also induced after JNK activation or EC ablation (Figures 3B–3D), mainly in small progenitor cells and larger MyoIA− cells (GFP−), which we believe are early, partially differentiated ECs. Levels of the STAT target, Socs36E, were also profoundly increased by either JNK signaling or EC apoptosis (Figure 3A). Epistasis tests showed that ISC mitoses induced by either HepAct or Rpr were strongly reduced in hop25/Y mutant animals (Figure 2L), which have reduced JAK activity. Control hop25/Y mutants had normal numbers of esg+ progenitor cells (data not shown), and thus the reduction in induced mitoses was unlikely to be due to decreased ISC numbers. These results indicate that Upd/Jak/Stat signaling is both sufficient and required for triggering ISC mitoses during regeneration. Upd/Dome/Hop signaling drives the nuclear translocation of Stat92E, the sole Drosophila STAT homolog. In normally fed wild-type midguts, nuclear Stat92E was observed in esg+ progenitors (ISCs and EBs; Figure 4A), but not in ECs or EEs. STAT activity was also assayed using three transcriptional reporters, 10XStat-DGFP (Bach et al., 2007Bach E.A. Ekas L.A. Ayala-Camargo A. Flaherty M.S. Lee H. Perrimon N. Baeg G.H. GFP reporters detect the activation of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway in vivo.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), (Gas)3lacZ (Gilbert et al., 2005Gilbert M.M. Weaver B.K. Gergen J.P. Reich N.C. A novel functional activator of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway, unpaired2, is revealed by an in vivo reporter of pathway activation.Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and an enhancer trap at the domeless locus, domeGal4. In normal midguts, each Stat reporter was also expressed only in esg+ progenitor cells (Figures 4B and 4C; data not shown). Thus, Stat signaling is normally active in ISCs and EBs, but not in ECs or EEs. To further test the function of Jak/Stat signaling, we generated ISC clones mutant for strong loss-of-function alleles of Stat92E, Stat85C9, or Stat397 (Bach et al., 2007Bach E.A. Ekas L.A. Ayala-Camargo A. Flaherty M.S. Lee H. Perrimon N. Baeg G.H. GFP reporters detect the activation of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway in vivo.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). While control clones comprised both small diploid progenitors and large polyploid ECs positive for the differentiation marker, MyoIAlacZ, (Figures 4D–4D″), all cells in Stat85C9 mutant clones had small nuclei and lacked MyoIAlacZ expression (Figures 4E–4E″). Most Stat85C9 mutant cells lacked Pros and Delta (data not shown), suggesting that they were EBs that failed to differentiate, rather than ISC-like cells defective in Notch signaling. Stat397 mutant clones showed a similar inability to differentiate into ECs (Figure S2E), and this could be rescued by Gal4-driven Stat92E (Figure S2F). Similar differentiation defects were observed when Stat92E or the Upd receptor, dome, were depleted with RNAi either clonally (Figure S2) or in progenitors using esgGal4ts (Figures 4G and 4H). Cells homozygous for Stat85C9 or Stat397 or expressing RNAi against Stat92E or dome appeared to divide at rates comparable to WT cells (Figures 4I and S2). Thus, Jak/Stat signaling is required for EC differentiation, though it may not be required for basal rates of ISC division. Next, we applied assays of Delta/Notch signaling, which is essential for differentiation of EBs to the EC fate (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A. The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Multipotent Drosophila intestinal stem cells specify daughter cell fates by differential notch signaling.Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Delta mRNA was reduced when Stat92E or dome was depleted in progenitor cells (Figure 5A). Conversely, Delta mRNA and protein were increased following induction of Upd, Rpr, or HepAct in ECs (Figures 5A and 5F). In these cases, increased numbers of small Delta+ cells were observed, suggesting that the pool of functional stem cells was expanded (Figures 5B and 5F). These results suggested that Jak/Stat signaling might promote differentiation by increasing Delta expression and stimulating Notch receptor activity. This notion was supported by RT-qPCR showing that E(spl)-complex genes, which are Notch targets, were up-regulated by expressing HepAct in ECs and down-regulated when Stat was depleted in progenitor cells (Figure 5G). Consistently, HepAct expression caused widespread activation of a Notch activity reporter, GbeSu(H)lacZ (Furriols and Bray, 2001Furriols M. Bray S. A model Notch response element detects Suppressor of Hairless-dependent molecular switch.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 60-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (Figures 5H and 5I). However, overexpressing Delta in Stat85C9 mutant ISCs, or in progenitor cells expressing Stat RNAi or Domeless RNAi, did not restore the ability of these cells to differentiate (Figure S3F). Thus, Stat targets, in addition to Delta, are required for EC differentiation. The dual function of Upd/Jak/Stat signaling as a mitogen for ISCs and a differentiation factor for EBs may serve to couple these processes. To investigate the physiological relevance of the regenerative responses described above, we searched for natural environmental challenges that might stimulate ISC proliferation in Drosophila. Ingestion and enteric infection with Pseudomonas entomophila, a gram-negative bacterium, has been reported to kill ECs and activate JNK signaling (Vodovar et al., 2005Vodovar N. Vinals M. Liehl P. Basset A. Degrouard J. Spellman P. Boccard F. Lemaitre B. Drosophila host defense after oral infection by an entomopathogenic Pseudomonas species.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 11414-11419Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Feeding flies P. entomophila for 2 days induced a strong mitotic response in the midgut (Figure 6A), and RT-qPCR showed that this coincided with the induction of the JNK target puc, all three Upd cytokines, the Stat target Socs36E, and Delta (Figure 6B). Temporal analysis (data not shown) indicated that these genes were appreciably induced by 2 hr after infection and had plateaued by 8 hr, and that the mitotic response began within 4 hr. The locations of JNK activation and cytokine induction were assessed using reporter genes. The JNK reporter, puclacZE69, was expressed at low levels in scattered ECs prior to infection and was induced to high levels in most ECs after infection (Figures 6E and 6F). UpdlacZ was not detected prior to infection and was induced in small esg+ progenitor cells (ISCs/EBs) and slightly larger early ECs (pre-ECs) after infection (Figures 6G and 6H; see also Figures 3B–3D). Upd3Gal4-driven GFP (Agaisse et al., 2003Agaisse H. Petersen U.M. Boutros M. Mathey-Prevot B. Perrimon N. Signaling role of hemocytes in Drosophila JAK/STAT-dependent response to septic injury.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was found in a few scattered ECs in controls but was highly induced in almost all ECs after infection (Figures 6I and 6J). The 10XSTAT-DGFP Stat reporter was heavily induced by P. entomophila, in both small and large cell types (Figures 6K and 6L). Since these cells turned over rapidly (Figure 7), however, some or all of the DGFP observed in ECs could have been inherited from progenitors.Figure 7Midgut Renewal after P. entomophila InfectionShow full captionMidgut turnover in 3- to 10-day-old adult males, measured using the esgtsF/O system.(A) Gut turnover in a control after 2 days.

Exit of cholesterol from lysosomes requires two proteins, membrane-bound Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and soluble NPC2. NPC2 binds cholesterol with its isooctyl side chain buried and its 3β-hydroxyl exposed. Here, we describe high-resolution structures of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1 and complexes with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. NPC1(NTD) binds cholesterol in an orientation opposite to NPC2: 3β-hydroxyl buried and isooctyl side chain exposed. Cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD) requires reorientation of a helical subdomain in NPC1(NTD), enlarging the opening for cholesterol entry. NPC1 with point mutations in this subdomain (distinct from the binding subdomain) cannot accept cholesterol from NPC2 and cannot restore cholesterol exit from lysosomes in NPC1-deficient cells. We propose a working model wherein after lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesteryl esters, cholesterol binds NPC2, which transfers it to NPC1(NTD), reversing its orientation and allowing insertion of its isooctyl side chain into the outer lysosomal membranes.

Over the last 30 years, much has been learned about the receptor-mediated endocytosis of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in coated pits and its subsequent delivery to endosomes and lysosomes (Brown and Goldstein, 1986Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. A receptor-mediated pathway for cholesterol homeostasis.Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar, Roth, 2006Roth M.G. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis before fluorescent proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Each LDL particle contains ∼500 molecules of free cholesterol and ∼1500 molecules of esterified cholesterol that are hydrolyzed by acid lipase in the lumen of the lysosome (Goldstein et al., 1975Goldstein J.L. Dana S.E. Faust J.R. Beaudet A.L. Brown M.S.

Chem. 1975; 250: 8487-8495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liberated cholesterol must then exit the lysosomal compartment in order to reach the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it performs structural and regulatory roles, respectively (Demel and De Kruyff, 1976Demel R.A.

Protein sensors for membrane sterols.Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). A major unanswered question is how this exit process is accomplished. Insight into two proteins required for cholesterol exit from lysosomes comes from Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease (Pentchev et al., 1995Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Niemann-Pick disease type C: A cellular cholesterol lipidosis.in: Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2625-2639Google Scholar), a fatal hereditary disorder characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and other lipids in endosomes and lysosomes. Evidence indicates that the primary cause is a failure of LDL-derived cholesterol to exit the lysosomes, which secondarily causes the buildup of other lipids. Mutations in either of two genes underlie NPC disease. Both genes encode lysosomal cholesterol-binding proteins. One gene encodes NPC1, a large 1278-amino acid polytopic membrane protein that is localized to the limiting membranes of endosomes and lysosomes (Carstea et al., 1997Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The other gene encodes NPC2, a small soluble protein of 132 amino acids that resides in endosomes and lysosomes and is also secreted from the cell (Naureckiene et al., 2000Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Identification of HE1 as the second gene of Niemann-Pick C disease.Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutations in either gene produce the same pattern of lysosomal lipid accumulation and the same clinical phenotype, providing strong genetic evidence that both proteins are required for cholesterol egress (Sleat et al., 2004Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M. Tint G.S. Vanier M.T. Walkley S.U. Lobel P. Genetic evidence for nonredundant functional cooperativity between NPC1 and NPC2 in lipid transport.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5886-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). NPC2 was shown previously to bind with high affinity to cholesterol but not to cholesterol derivatives with hydrophilic substitutions on the isooctyl side chain, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and 27-HC (Okamura et al., 1999Okamura N.

Their data explained why hydrophilic substitutions on the isooctyl side chain prevent binding (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). When cholesterol binds to NPC2, its isooctyl side chain is buried deep within a hydrophobic pocket. In contrast, the 3β-hydroxyl group is exposed on the surface. This exposure explains why a sulfate substitution (as in cholesterol sulfate) or a reversal of the orientation of the hydroxyl from 3β to 3α (as in epicholesterol) does not prevent binding. On the other hand, hydrophilic additions to the side chain, as in 25-HC, prevent burial of the side chain in the deep hydrophobic pocket. NPC1 is much more complex than NPC2, and no high-resolution structural information is available. NPC1 contains 13 predicted membrane-spanning helices and 3 large luminal domains (Davies and Ioannou, 2000Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. Topological analysis of Niemann-Pick C1 protein reveals that the membrane orientation of the putative sterol-sensing domain is identical to those of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and sterol regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24367-24374Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The first luminal domain is designated the N-terminal domain (NTD). It consists of ∼240 amino acids, which project into the lumen. This domain is hereafter designated NPC1(NTD). The other two large luminal domains are loops that span between transmembrane helices 2/3 and 8/9. We previously showed that full-length NPC1 binds [3H]cholesterol with nanomolar affinity (Infante et al., 2008aInfante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A. Dale J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Purified NPC1 protein: I. Binding of cholesterol and oxysterols to a 1278-amino acid membrane protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1052-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the binding site is localized to the soluble NTD (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to NPC2, NPC1(NTD) binds not only cholesterol but also its oxygenated derivatives, 25-HC and 27-HC. On the other hand, NPC1(NTD) does not bind sterols, such as cholesterol sulfate or epicholesterol, with modifications at the 3β-hydroxyl position. These data led to the suggestion that NPC1(NTD) binds cholesterol in an orientation opposite to that of NPC2 with the 3β-hydroxyl of cholesterol facing the interior of NPC1(NTD) and the isooctyl side chain exposed (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study, we provided evidence that cholesterol could transfer between purified NPC1(NTD) and NPC2 in a bidirectional fashion (Infante et al., 2008cInfante R.E. Wang M.L. Radhakrishnan A. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. NPC2 facilitates bidirectional transfer of cholesterol between NPC1 and lipid bilayers, a step in cholesterol egress from lysosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15287-15292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). When [3H]cholesterol was bound to NPC1(NTD) at 4°C, the dissociation rate into detergents was extremely slow, but the [3H]cholesterol transferred rapidly to NPC2. The transfer could also proceed in the opposite direction: NPC2 transferred its bound [3H]cholesterol to NPC1(NTD) two orders of magnitude faster than when [3H]cholesterol was delivered to NPC1(NTD) in detergent solution (Infante et al., 2008cInfante R.E. Wang M.L. Radhakrishnan A. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

USA. 2008; 105: 15287-15292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). NPC2 can deliver bound cholesterol directly to liposomes even in the absence of NPC1 (Cheruku et al., 2006Cheruku S.R. Xu Z.

Although these studies showed a unique ability of NPC2 to facilitate entry and exit of cholesterol from NPC1(NTD), they did not indicate which direction this transfer took within lysosomes, i.e., LDL to NPC2 to NPC1 versus LDL to NPC1 to NPC2. Although the NPC2-to-NPC1 model seems more logical (Infante et al., 2008cInfante R.E. Wang M.L. Radhakrishnan A. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Cellular topology and biochemistry of lysosomal lipid degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), direct data in support of this model are lacking. In the current studies, we used X-ray crystallography to determine a high-resolution structure of NPC1(NTD) in the apoprotein (apo) form and in complex with cholesterol or 25-HC. The protein contains a deep pocket that surrounds the sterol, burying the 3β-hydroxyl group and the tetracyclic ring but leaving the isooctyl side chain partially exposed. This orientation is opposite to the orientation of cholesterol bound to NPC2 in which the side chain is buried and the 3β-hydroxyl exposed. Through mutational analysis, we identified two functional subdomains of NPC1(NTD)—one for sterol binding and the other for NPC2-mediated transfer. We use these data to advance a hypothetical working model for cholesterol transfer in which soluble NPC2 accepts cholesterol from LDL and carries it to the membrane-bound N-terminal domain of NPC1, which then inserts the cholesterol into the lysosomal membrane. For structural studies, human NPC1(NTD) was produced in Hi-5 insect cells using a baculovirus vector. The soluble secreted protein was purified from the culture medium. Initial attempts at crystallization were hampered by heterogeneity attributable to the five potential N-linked glycosylation sites (four of which are conserved in various species) and a proline-rich C-terminal region. After carrying out a systematic screen of mutations of these four conserved glycosylation sites in combination with C-terminal deletions, we obtained crystals from a construct that spanned residues 23–252 and harbored three mutations (N70Q, N122Q, N185Q) that removed three of the four conserved glycosylation sites. When assayed for its binding to [3H]cholesterol and [3H]25-HC, this protein exhibited binding kinetics similar to that of wild-type (WT) NPC1(NTD) produced in CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Crystals were grown in the absence and presence of cholesterol or 25-HC (Figure 1A). The structure of NPC1(NTD) was determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing (Table 1) and refined to 1.8 Å (apoprotein and cholesterol complex) and 1.6 Å (25-HC complex).Table 1Data Collection and Refinement Statistics for NPC1(NTD)25-HCCholesterolApoSeMethionineData CollectionSpace groupP64P64P64P64Cell dimensions (Å) a,b65.92665.69166.18165.441 c82.98882.36782.64482.672Wavelength (Å)0.979400.979400.979400.97915Resolution (Å) (final shell)50–1.60 (1.63–1.60)50.0–1.80 (1.83–1.80)50–1.80 (1.83–1.80)50–2.00 (2.03–2.00)Reflections Total113183873128598469646 Unique26443185041853813189Completeness (%)97.8 (88.3)98.8 (94.0)98.1 (98.2)96.3 (78.0)Rsym (%)3.15.98.07.6RefinementRcryst (%)17.517.418.0Rfree (%)20.320.722.1rmsd Bond length (Å)0.0120.0120.012 Bond angle (°)1.4761.4771.374Bave Protein (Å2)26.136.735.7 Ligand (Å2)22.943.654.6 Open table in a new tab NPC1(NTD) is composed of eight α helices that are flanked by a three-strand mixed β sheet (Figure 1B). NPC1(NTD) contains 18 cysteine residues, all of which form disulfide bonds (C25-C74, C31-C42, C63-C109, C75-C113, C97-C238, C100-C160, C177-C184, C227-C243, C240-C247). Electron density is present for two N-acetyl glucosamine molecules attached to Asn222 (Figure S1B available online), and they form hydrogen bonds with Glu110 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly65 (Figure S1C). Electron density for an N-acetyl glucosamine is also present at a previously unanticipated site, Asn158 (sequence, NAC) (Figure S1A). A comparison of the apoprotein (Figure 2A) and the sterol-bound forms (Figures 2B and 2C) reveals virtually no change in the structure of the protein upon sterol binding with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.1 and 0.2 Å (apo versus cholesterol and 25-HC, respectively) across all Cα atoms (Figure S2). For the three structures, electron density is visible for residues 23–247. Cholesterol and 25-HC are both clearly visible, but cholesterol is less well ordered than 25-HC (see B-factors in Table 1). In the apo structure, the sterol-binding pocket is occupied by two glycerol molecules and three water molecules (Figure 2A). The glycerol in the apo structure likely results from diffusion into the crystal during cryoprotection, as glycerol was not present during protein purification or crystallization. In the absence of sterols, the sterol-binding pocket is likely lined with water molecules. At each end of the sterol-binding pocket are openings toward solvent. One opening, located near the 3β-hydroxyl group of the sterol, is just large enough for a single water molecule to enter or exit (Figure 1C). We designate this region as the water opening (W-opening). The other opening, located at the end of the isooctyl side chain of the sterol molecule, is slightly larger but not large enough to permit passage of the tetracyclic ring without a conformational change (Figures 1C and 2D). We designate this region as the sterol opening (S-opening). Cholesterol and 25-HC bind in a similar manner. The 25-hydroxyl group on 25-HC does not form a specific interaction with the protein, instead forming a water-mediated interaction with the main chain carbonyl of Leu175 (Figure 3B). Based on size exclusion chromatography, soluble NPC1(NTD) was hypothesized to exist as a dimer (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Previous results with glycosylated proteins have shown anomalous migration behavior on size exclusion chromatography (Andrews, 1965Andrews P. The gel-filtration behaviour of proteins related to their molecular weights over a wide range.Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar). We used analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity (SV) analysis to determine the oligomerization state of NPC1(NTD) in solution. SV analysis of NPC1(NTD) produced in CHO-K1 cells with all six of the predicted or identified glycosylation sites intact showed a single species of 3.2 S corresponding to a molecular mass of 41.9 kDa (∼35% carbohydrate content by mass) (Figure S3). SV analysis of the protein produced in insect cells, with three of the glycosylation sites mutated, showed a single species of 2.2 S corresponding to a molecular mass of 30.3 kDa (∼15% carbohydrate content by mass) (Figure S3). Both results are consistent with NPC1(NTD) being a monomer in solution. Similar results were obtained from sedimentation equilibrium analysis (data not shown). The sterol-binding pocket of NPC1(NTD) is lined predominately with hydrophobic residues (Figure 3A), including Trp27, Leu83, Phe108, Pro202, Phe203, and Ile205, consistent with the hydrophobicity of cholesterol. The exceptions lie at the site of the 3β-hydroxyl group. Two polar residues, Asn41 and Gln79, form direct hydrogen bonds with the 3β-hydroxyl group (Figure 3B). In addition, Glu30 forms a water-mediated interaction with the 3β-hydroxyl, helping to stabilize binding of sterols and imposing stereospecificity. The residues in this region would not permit binding of the 3α-epimer of cholesterol (epicholesterol) or bulky additions at this position (Figure S4). These structural findings are consistent with our previous binding data showing that NPC1(NTD) does not bind epicholesterol or cholesterol sulfate (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The binding pocket of NPC1(NTD) tightly encloses the four rings of the sterol. The pocket narrows around the C20 and C22 positions of the isooctyl side chain (Figure 2D) and begins to expand and open toward solvent after C23. The binding pocket is wider prior to C20, accommodating the larger size of the sterol tetracyclic ring. Our previous binding data showed that hydroxyl substitutions on the tetracyclic ring or on C20 diminish binding, while modifications on C24, C25, and C27 permit binding (Infante et al., 2008aInfante R.E. Abi-Mosleh L. Radhakrishnan A. Dale J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Purified NPC1 protein: I. Binding of cholesterol and oxysterols to a 1278-amino acid membrane protein.J. Biol.

These data are consistent with the size and shape of the binding pocket. The size and shape of the binding pocket restrict the entry and exit of sterols from NPC1(NTD) and would require expansion of the S-opening. Displacement of helix3, helix7, helix8, and/or the loop between helix8/strand7 would allow sterols to bind or dissociate (Figure 1B, orange). To determine key residues in NPC1(NTD) that are important for sterol binding, we performed an alanine scan mutagenesis across the protein (amino acids 23–264) and assayed each mutant for binding to [3H]cholesterol and [3H]25-HC (Figure S5). We generated a panel of 84 mutant plasmids in which one, two, or three contiguous amino acids were changed to alanines. This panel included all 242 residues in NPC1(NTD) except for the following: 4 conserved residues previously shown to have normal binding activity when replaced with alanine (Asn103, Gln117, Phe120, Tyr157) (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); 1 conserved residue that when mutated to alanine showed reduced cholesterol binding (60% of normal) and virtually no 25-HC binding (Gln79) (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); 6 naturally occurring mutations that were shown previously to have normal binding activity (Gln92, Thr137, Pro166, Asn222, Asp242, Gly248) (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); 18 cysteines; and the C-terminal 32 residues (amino acids 233–264), which when deleted do not decrease binding of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]25-HC (data not shown). As described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures, we developed a rapid assay that allowed measurement of 3H-sterol binding to aliquots of concentrated media from CHO-K1 cells that had been transfected with plasmids encoding epitope-tagged WT or mutant versions of NPC1(NTD). The amount of secreted protein was determined by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the FLAG epitope tag. Of the 84 mutants, 5 did not produce secreted protein (Y28-E30, L80/Q81, W189/I190, M193/F194, and V208/F209). Binding assays were performed by trapping the His-tagged proteins with bound 3H-sterol on nickel columns as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Media from cells transfected with mock vector showed no binding of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]25-HC (<20 fmol/tube), whereas media from cells transfected with WT NPC1(NTD) showed 860–1500 fmol/tube and 780–1000 fmol/tube for [3H]cholesterol and [3H]25-HC, respectively (Figure S5B). Six of the 84 NPC1(NTD) mutant proteins showed binding that was less than 25% of WT (Figure S5B, blue). All of these mutations (R39-N41, T82/L83, N106-F108, D197/N198, P202/F203, and T204/I205) replaced residues that mapped to the binding pocket (Figure 4, blue). These residues include the majority of the hydrophobic amino acids that line the binding pocket around the tetracyclic ring, except for Trp27, whose replacement reduced [3H]cholesterol binding to a level slightly above the 25% threshold (Figure S5B). Of the two hydrophilic residues that form direct hydrogen bonds with the 3β-hydroxy group (Figure 3B), the replacement of Asn41 with alanine disrupted [3H]cholesterol binding by 90% (Figure S5B). The other hydrophilic residue (Gln79) was previously shown to produce a 40% reduction in cholesterol binding when replaced with alanine (Infante et al., 2008bInfante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Abi-Mosleh L. Kinch L.N. Wang M.L. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Purified NPC1 protein: II. Localization of sterol binding to a 240-amino acid soluble luminal loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The only amino acid in the sterol-binding domain that could not be evaluated in the alanine scan was Glu30, which forms a water-mediated bond with the 3β-hydroxyl. This mutant protein was not secreted into the media. We identified seven mutant NPC1(NTD) proteins that exhibited a preferential reduction of binding of [3H]25-HC as compared with [3H]cholesterol (Figure S5B, pink). All seven of these mutations replaced amino acids that mapped either to the binding pocket (V26/W27 and G199/Q200) or to adjacent amino acids (F101/Y102, L144/Q145, Y146/Y147, T187/N188, and N195/K196) (Figure S7, pink). To validate the major findings from the assays with unfractionated culture media, we purified the mutant protein with the least amount of cholesterol binding (P202A/F203A) and analyzed it in detail. As shown in Figures 5A and 5B, the purified protein showed no detectable binding of either [3H]cholesterol or [3H]25-HC. Previously, we showed that NPC2 catalyzes the bidirectional transfer of cholesterol between NPC1(NTD) and liposomes in vitro (Infante et al., 2008cInfante R.E. Wang M.L. Radhakrishnan A. Kwon H.J.

The C-terminal half of the juxtamembrane segment latches the activated kinase domain to the activator, and the N-terminal half of this segment further potentiates dimerization, most likely by forming an antiparallel helical dimer that engages the transmembrane helices of the activated receptor. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which the extracellular domains block the intrinsic ability of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to dimerize and activate, with ligand binding releasing this block. The formation of the activating juxtamembrane latch is prevented by the C-terminal tails in a structure of an inactive kinase domain dimer, suggesting how alternative dimers can prevent ligand-independent activation.

The formation of the activating juxtamembrane latch is prevented by the C-terminal tails in a structure of an inactive kinase domain dimer, suggesting how alternative dimers can prevent ligand-independent activation. Intercellular signaling in animals relies on receptor tyrosine kinases that consist of an extracellular ligand binding domain and a cytoplasmic kinase domain (Hubbard and Miller, 2007Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Receptor tyrosine kinases: mechanisms of activation and signaling.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A distinct subfamily of these receptors includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB1 or Her1) and its three homologs in humans: ErbB2/Her2 and ErbB4/Her4, which are kinase active, and ErbB3/Her3, which is not (Landau and Ben-Tal, 2008Landau M.

The ligand-dependent dimerization of various combinations of EGFR family members results in phosphorylation of their C-terminal tail segments, which is crucial for cellular proliferation and survival. Activation of the catalytic domain of EGFR family members is controlled primarily by an allosteric interaction between two protein kinase domains in an asymmetric dimer, rather than by phosphorylation (Gotoh et al., 1992Gotoh N.

The kinase domain of one receptor molecule (the activator) plays a role analogous to that of a cyclin bound to a cyclin-dependent protein kinase and activates the kinase domain of a second receptor (the receiver) (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X.

Upon binding ligand, the extracellular domains of EGFR family members dimerize such that their C-terminal ends are brought close together at the junction with the transmembrane segments (Burgess et al., 2003Burgess A.W. Cho H.S. Eigenbrot C. Ferguson K.M. Garrett T.P. Leahy D.J. Lemmon M.A. Sliwkowski M.X. Ward C.W. Yokoyama S. An open-and-shut case? Recent insights into the activation of EGF/ErbB receptors.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The transmembrane segments connect to the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane segments of the receptor. The role of the juxtamembrane segment of EGFR family members is distinct from that of typical receptor tyrosine kinases because it activates, rather than inhibits, the kinase domain (Thiel and Carpenter, 2007Thiel K.W. Carpenter G. Epidermal growth factor receptor juxtamembrane region regulates allosteric tyrosine kinase activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19238-19243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The nature of this coupling between the juxtamembrane segment and the kinase domain is not understood. The juxtamembrane segment of human EGFR spans residues 645 to 682, and we refer to the N-terminal half (residues 645 to 663) as JM-A and the C-terminal half (residues 664 to 682) as JM-B (Figure 1B). An examination of crystal lattice contacts in a previously reported structure of the Her4 kinase domain (Wood et al., 2008Wood E.R. Shewchuk L.M. Ellis B. Brignola P. Brashear R.L. Caferro T.R. Dickerson S.H. Dickson H.D. Donaldson K.H. Gaul M. et al.6-Ethynylthieno[3,2-d]- and 6-ethynylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-anilines as tunable covalent modifiers of ErbB kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reveals that the JM-B portion of the juxtamembrane segment forms a clamp that reaches across from the N-terminal lobe of the receiver kinase domain in an asymmetric dimer to engage the C-terminal lobe of the activator kinase domain. The significance of this interaction has not been noted previously, but we demonstrate that this interface involving JM-B, which we refer to as the “juxtamembrane latch,” is crucial for receptor activation. We show that JM-A segments on the receiver and the activator are both required for dimerization and activation, and we propose that the two JM-A segments in an asymmetric kinase domain dimer form short α helices that are likely to interact in an antiparallel manner and connect to the C-terminal ends of the dimeric form of the transmembrane helices. This allows a model for the entire activated receptor to be built, in which ligand engagement by the extracellular domains stabilizes the formation of the JM-A helical dimer, which in turn stabilizes the asymmetric kinase domain dimer, resulting in activation. We have determined a structure of the EGFR kinase core in which formation of the juxtamembrane latch is blocked by the C-terminal tails of the receptor. This structure forms a symmetrical dimer of inactive kinase domains and suggests a potential mechanism whereby alternative dimers can prevent ligand-independent activation. The core kinase domain has low activity when measured in solution with purified protein (the catalytic efficiency, kcat/KM, is 0.0049 ± 0.0005 s−1mM−1, Figure 2A). Introduction of the L834R mutation, commonly found in lung cancer patients, increases the activity of the kinase core by ∼14-fold, consistent with previous results (Yun et al., 2007Yun C.H. Boggon T.J. Li Y. Woo M.S. Greulich H. Meyerson M. Eck M.J.

An allosteric mechanism for activation of the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Attachment of the juxtamembrane segment to the wild-type kinase domain results in substantially greater activity. The value of kcat/KM for the JM-kinase construct (0.33 ± 0.02 s−1mM−1) is ∼70-fold greater than that for the kinase core alone. The activity of the kinase core is increased ∼20-fold by concentrating it on lipid vesicles (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. An allosteric mechanism for activation of the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar), but the addition of the juxtamembrane segment results in greater catalytic efficiency in solution, without concentration on vesicles (Figure 2A). Deletion of the JM-A segment reduces catalytic efficiency by 10-fold, to 0.032 ± 0.003 s−1mM−1 (Figure 2A), showing that an intact juxtamembrane segment is required for full activation. In order to determine whether the JM-A segment is required on both the activator and receiver, we made mutant kinases that can only take the activator or the receiver position. We refer to kinases with an I682Q mutation, which can take only the activator position, as “receiver impaired” (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. An allosteric mechanism for activation of the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Kinases with a V924R mutation cannot be activated and are referred to as “activator impaired.” Both the activator-impaired and receiver-impaired JM-kinase constructs have low activity alone, but mixing these constructs recovers ∼50% of the activity of wild-type JM-kinase constructs in solution, as observed in cell transfection studies (Thiel and Carpenter, 2007Thiel K.W. Carpenter G. Epidermal growth factor receptor juxtamembrane region regulates allosteric tyrosine kinase activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19238-19243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). In contrast, activity is reduced significantly if the JM-A segment on either the activator-impaired or the receiver-impaired kinase is missing (Figure 2B). Thus, both JM-A and JM-B segments are required on both the activator and the receiver kinases for robust stimulation of activity. The core kinase domain is a monomer, based on static light scattering at a concentration of 150 μM, whereas the JM-kinase construct is predominantly a dimer with no detectable monomer (Figure S1 available online). The specific activity of the JM-kinase construct increases with concentration, and the dissociation constant (KD) for dimerization is estimated to be ∼200 nM (Figure 2C). Deletion of the JM-A segment increases the midpoint value of the concentration dependence curve to at least ∼8 μM (Figure 2C). The >40-fold increase in the estimated values for KD for dimerization upon deletion of the JM-A segment provides strong evidence for a role of the JM-A segment in dimerization. We used cell-based assays to compare the activities of various constructs containing the JM-kinase portion of the receptor. One construct includes the transmembrane and intracellular domains of EGFR (TM-ICD). The other construct is a fusion of the intracellular domains to 29 residues of the coiled-coil portion of the transcriptional activator GCN4 (O'Shea et al., 1991O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. X-ray structure of the GCN4 leucine zipper, a two-stranded, parallel coiled coil.Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), which is expected to enforce constitutive dimerization on the intracellular domains. We transfected COS7 cells with an ∼5-fold lower level of DNA than used in the previous study (Thiel and Carpenter, 2007Thiel K.W. Carpenter G. Epidermal growth factor receptor juxtamembrane region regulates allosteric tyrosine kinase activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19238-19243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). Under these conditions, the intracellular domains alone display very low levels of autophosphorylation in an immunoprecipitation assay. In contrast, a construct that contains the transmembrane segment, but without the extracellular segment (TM-ICD), shows high activity. The activity of the TM-ICD construct is about the same as that for the GCN4-ICD construct, indicating that the effect of the juxtamembrane segment, when fused to the transmembrane domain and localized to membranes, is comparable to that of enforced dimerization. This result is consistent with previous experiments showing that removal of the extracellular domains activates the kinase domains of EGFR (Chantry, 1995Chantry A. The kinase domain and membrane localization determine intracellular interactions between epidermal growth factor receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Nishikawa et al., 1994Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J.

Many kinases are activated by imposed dimerization, where the effect could simply be due to enhancement of transphosphorylation. Introduction of the V924R mutation in the GCN4-ICD construct, which is expected to disrupt the asymmetric dimer interface, results in a complete loss of activity (Figure 2D). Thus, even when dimerization is enforced by GCN4, formation of the asymmetric dimer appears to be essential for activity. A crystal structure of the Her4 kinase domain bound to a covalently linked inhibitor (PDB ID: 2R4B) (Wood et al., 2008Wood E.R. Shewchuk L.M. Ellis B. Brignola P. Brashear R.L. Caferro T.R.

USA. 2008; 105: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) provides insight into the structural basis for the role of the juxtamembrane segment. Crystallization of the Her4-inhibitor complex utilized a construct that includes the JM-B portion of the juxtamembrane segment (Wood et al., 2008Wood E.R. Shewchuk L.M. Ellis B. Brignola P. Brashear R.L. Caferro T.R. Dickerson S.H. Dickson H.D. Donaldson K.H. Gaul M. et al.6-Ethynylthieno[3,2-d]- and 6-ethynylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-anilines as tunable covalent modifiers of ErbB kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the authors do not comment on this fact, the kinase domains in their crystal structure form an asymmetric dimer that is similar in general terms to that seen in other crystal structures for active forms of EGFR and Her4. The kinase domain of Her4 in this complex is in an inactive conformation, which is required for accommodation of the covalently bound inhibitor (Wood et al., 2008Wood E.R. Shewchuk L.M. Ellis B. Brignola P. Brashear R.L. Caferro T.R. Dickerson S.H. Dickson H.D. Donaldson K.H. Gaul M. et al.6-Ethynylthieno[3,2-d]- and 6-ethynylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-anilines as tunable covalent modifiers of ErbB kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the crystal lattice generates a “daisy chain” of kinase domains in which each molecule in the chain is docked on the next one, as in crystals of the active kinase domain. The last ten residues of JM-B (corresponding to Gly 672 to Ile 682 in EGFR) have been visualized previously at the asymmetric dimer interface, and are critical for EGFR activation (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. An allosteric mechanism for activation of the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor.Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). What is new in the Her4-inhibitor complex is that the rest of the JM-B segment, provided by the kinase domain in the receiver position, latches two kinase domains together by running along the surface of the C-lobe of the activator kinase domain (Figure 3A). Formation of the juxtamembrane latch involves residues in the receiver and activator kinases that are conserved in EGFR family members (Figure 3B). The interaction involves several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts (see Figure 3C). Mutations in C-lobe residues that anchor the JM-B region (e.g., Asn 972, Arg 949, Asp 950, Arg 953 in the C-lobe) have substantial inhibitory effects on EGFR autophosphorylation in cell-based assays (Figure 3D). Mutation of Glu 666 in the JM-B region, which forms an ion pair with Arg 949, is also inhibitory. Three hydrophobic residues in the JM-B segment (Leu 664, Val 656, Leu 668) are also essential for EGFR activation (Figure 3D). Leu 668 packs against Pro 951 in the C-lobe of the kinase domain. Leu 664 and Val 665 are located near the junction of JM-B with the N-terminal JM-A segment. A segment spanning residues 315–374 of the EGFR inhibitor Mig6 blocks asymmetric dimer formation (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang X. Pickin K.A. Bose R. Jura N. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Inhibition of the EGF receptor by binding of MIG6 to an activating kinase domain interface.Nature. 2007; 450: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A six residue motif (EPLTPS) in the juxtamembrane latch is almost identical in sequence with six residues in Mig6 (residues 323–327, with sequence EPLSPS). This sequence motif is located six residues upstream of the first ordered residue in the crystal structure containing Mig6, and so was not seen in that complex. The EPLSPS motif of Mig6 can be docked onto the C-lobe of the kinase domain, based on the corresponding motif in the juxtamembrane latch, while allowing the rest of Mig6 to block the interface between the activator and receiver kinase domains (Figure 3E). This indicates that part of the function of Mig6 is to prevent formation of the juxtamembrane latch. A crucial assumption in our subsequent modeling is that the JM-kinase portion of the receptor forms a closed dimer, in which the two juxtamembrane segments interact with each other rather than repeating identical interactions in a daisy chain. We used cell transfection assays to confirm that the juxtamembrane latch is engaged only by the activator and not by the receiver in activated full-length receptors. When EGFR variants that are receiver impaired or activator impaired are coexpressed, robust EGF-dependent activity is observed (Figure 3F). We introduced a mutation in the C-lobe of the kinase domain (R953A) that disrupts the juxtamembrane latch (see Figure 3F). If the mutation is introduced only in the receiver-impaired EGFR construct, which presumably serves only as an activator, activity is reduced in cotransfection experiments. There is essentially no effect on EGFR activity if the R953A mutation is introduced in the activator-impaired kinase domain. These results are consistent with the formation of a closed dimer and imply that the juxtamembrane segment of the activator may be free to interact with the receiver. The JM-A segments have three elements that are conserved among EGFR family members (Figure 4A). The N-terminal region contains five to seven basic residues, including several arginines. At least some of these residues are likely to interact with phosphate groups in the membrane bilayer (McLaughlin et al., 2005McLaughlin S. Smith S.O. Hayman M.J. Murray D. An electrostatic engine model for autoinhibition and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB) family.J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The central portion contains hydrophobic residues in an i, i+3, i+4 pattern within an LRRLL motif in EGFR. The C-terminal region contains acidic residues. The i, i+3, i+4 pattern of hydrophobic residues in JM-A suggests an α-helical structure. The structure of a micelle-bound peptide containing the juxtamembrane segment of EGFR has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Choowongkomon et al., 2005Choowongkomon K. Carlin C.R. Sonnichsen F.D. A structural model for the membrane-bound form of the juxtamembrane domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24043-24052Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The relevance of this structure, in which the JM-A segment is helical, is uncertain because one portion of this peptide is normally integrated into the folded structure of the kinase domain core as a β strand, but instead adopts an α-helical conformation in this micelle-bound peptide. We analyzed an isolated 15 residue peptide spanning the JM-A segment by solution NMR. These data provide evidence for the transient formation of an α helix spanning the length of the peptide, and also for a concentration-dependent interaction between peptides (see Figure S2 and the Supplemental Data). We used cell transfection experiments to probe the conformation of the JM-A segment in the full-length receptor, taking advantage of the fact that glycine residues weaken an α helix but alanine residues do not (Pace and Scholtz, 1998Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. A helix propensity scale based on experimental studies of peptides and proteins.Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the activity of full-length EGFR constructs with arginine residues in the 655LRRLL659 motif in JM-A replaced by glycines. This led to a significant reduction in EGFR activity (Figures 4B and S3A). To account for the effects of charge removal, as opposed to helix weakening, we compared the effects of the glycine substitutions to that of alanine substitutions. The effect of alanine substitutions is smaller than that of glycine substitutions, consistent with a helical conformation for the JM-A segment (Figures 4B and S3A). The results of cotransfection experiments using activator-impaired and receiver-impaired kinases show that replacement of Arg 656 and Arg 657 by glycines on either the activator or receiver kinase individually also results in a reduction of EGFR activity relative to alanine substitutions (Figures 4B and S3A). These data indicate that a helical conformation for the JM-A segment is important for both the activator and the receiver. Mutation of the three leucine residues in the LRRLL motif (residues 655, 658, and 659) to either alanine or aspartic acid attenuates the activity of the receptor (Figure S3B). This led us to consider models for helical dimers in which the JM-A segments are packed closely together with a hydrophobic interface, in either an antiparallel or a parallel arrangement. We based our models on the structures of coiled coils (Woolfson, 2005Woolfson D.N. The design of coiled-coil structures and assemblies.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), but because we are considering only a short helical segment, the predicted intermolecular contacts are similar for tightly packed straight helices. For each choice of orientation, parallel or antiparallel, there are two choices of sequence register, corresponding to whether the first leucine or the fifth one is at the a position of a heptad sequence motif (Woolfson, 2005Woolfson D.N. The design of coiled-coil structures and assemblies.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). If the orientation were parallel, several basic residues would be brought close together at the N-terminal ends of the two helices, which is likely to be energetically unfavorable. Only one intermolecular ion pair is predicted for the parallel arrangement, and it involves Arg 662 and a glutamate side chain (Glu 661 in one register and Glu 663 in the other; Figure S4A). The parallel arrangement puts two such ion pairs close together by symmetry, as shown in Figure S4A. Mutation of Arg 662 to glutamate would therefore place four glutamate side chains in close proximity in the parallel dimer (Figure S4A), which should destabilize the dimer. Mutation of Arg 662 to glutamate has little or no effect on EGFR activity (Figures S3B and S4B), arguing against a parallel arrangement. A parallel helical dimer is also inconsistent with the formation of heterodimers between the JM-A segments of EGFR family members. A single amino acid deletion in the JM-A segment of Her4 (Figure 4A) results in Glu 693 of Her4 being directly apposed to another glutamate residue in modeled parallel heterodimers involving either Her2 or EGFR, in both possible sequence registers (Figure S4C). In addition, no favorable intermolecular ion pairs are formed in these parallel heterodimers. In an antiparallel coiled coil, residues at the a and d positions of the heptad repeat in one helix interact with the residues at the d and a positions, respectively, in the other (Woolfson, 2005Woolfson D.N. The design of coiled-coil structures and assemblies.Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Additional interhelical interactions can be made by the side chains at the e or g positions. The LxxLL motif in EGFR JM-A fits into this pattern if the first leucine is at either the a position or the d position, with the second two leucines at the d and e positions or the g and a positions, respectively. We favor placement of the first leucine at the d position because it provides a role for both arginine residues in the LRRLL motif, consistent with the strong effects of mutating these residues (Figures 4B and S3B). In this pairing, Leu 658 and Leu 659 at the g and a positions in each helix form a V-shaped crevice into which the side chain of Leu 655 at the d position from the other helix is inserted (Figure 4C). An antiparallel dimer leads naturally to interhelical ion pairing between arginine or lysine side chains at the N-terminal end of each helix with the acidic side chains located at the C-terminal end of the partner helix, and so we favor this arrangement for the helical dimer over a parallel one (Figures 4C and S5). The pattern of interhelical ion pairs predicted in this way for EGFR is also consistent with the formation of relevant heterodimer pairs (Figure S6). Additional support for the antiparallel model is provided by NMR measurements on a 35 residue peptide containing two copies of the JM-A segment of EGFR with a five residue flexible spacer (see the Supplemental Data and Figure S7A). The first and last leucine residues in the LRRLL motif in the first JM-A segment (Leu 655 and Leu 659) are labeled with 15N. The second glutamate in the first segment (Glu 663) is labeled with 15N and 13C. As for the 15 residue JM-A peptide, NMR data for the tandemly linked JM-A segments provide evidence for transient rather than stable adoption of helical structure in both JM-A segments under the conditions of the NMR experiment (see the Supplemental Data). Despite the transient nature of these helices, the NMR data demonstrate that the two JM-A segments in the peptide interact with each other. Data from Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) experiments are consistent with an antiparallel rather than parallel orientation of two JM-A helices. This is not surprising, since an antiparallel interaction could occur in an intramolecular fashion within this peptide, whereas a parallel interaction would require dimerization. Nevertheless, the significance of these NMR data arises from the evidence that they provide for a specific register in the antiparallel interaction, in which the first leucine of the LRRLL motif is at the d position of a heptad repeat, with the second two leucines at the g and a positions, respectively (Figure 4D and th"

Our work uncovers a sophisticated mechanism of cooperative force generation between two major forces driving morphogenesis. During early development, dramatic tissue rearrangements shape the organism and its organs. Genetic studies have uncovered complex signaling networks that are sequentially activated to coordinate these movements in space and over time. Much less is known about how the forces driving such collective cell movements are generated, because it is challenging to measure forces directly in whole living organisms. Furthermore, when a moving tissue is observed, it is usually difficult to define the origin of the underlying force. For example, forces generated by any moving tissue will automatically affect neighboring cells. In principle, this can be sufficient to indirectly drive their rearrangement, too. Nevertheless, elegant experiments have addressed the issue of force generation in embryos. Most combine real-time fluorescence imaging with laser incisions to release tension (Farhadifar et al., 2007Farhadifar R. Roper J.C. Aigouy B. Eaton S. Julicher F.

This allowed describing the relative distribution of forces within and in between tissues. In that respect, one of the probably best-studied processes is dorsal closure (DC), which takes place during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. DC results in the closure of an opening that occurs naturally during morphogenesis in the dorsal epidermis (Figure 1A). It has been intensively studied because of its similarity to wound healing (Harden, 2002Harden N. Signaling pathways directing the movement and fusion of epithelial sheets: Lessons from dorsal closure in Drosophila.Differentiation. 2002; 70: 181-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Both processes involve the activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, which triggers the formation of a supracellular actin cable (AC) in the row of epidermis cells at the leading edge (LE) of the opening. The AC surrounds the opening and is believed to act like a purse string constricting the LE (Kiehart et al., 2000Kiehart D.P. Galbraith C.G. Edwards K.A. Rickoll W.L. Montague R.A. Multiple forces contribute to cell sheet morphogenesis for dorsal closure in Drosophila. J.Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, Ricos et al., 1999Ricos M.G.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1225-1235PubMed Google Scholar). During DC, the cells of the amnioserosa (AS) tissue that fills the opening provide an additional force in cooperation with the contractile forces of the AC. The current view is that, with the onset of DC, the AS cells begin to pull the two LEs toward the dorsal midline by gradually decreasing their apical cell surfaces (Franke et al., 2005Franke J.D. Montague R.A. Kiehart D.P. Nonmuscle myosin II generates forces that transmit tension and drive contraction in multiple tissues during dorsal closure.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2208-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Kiehart et al., 2000Kiehart D.P. Galbraith C.G. Edwards K.A. Rickoll W.L. Montague R.A. Multiple forces contribute to cell sheet morphogenesis for dorsal closure in Drosophila. J.Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the epidermal cells that constitute the opposing LEs eventually come within close proximity of each other. At this stage, the LE cells grow dynamic protrusions at their dorsal apical edges. These protrusions extend over the AS tissue and will eventually encounter protrusions from the matching LE cell on the other side of the embryo upon which they intertwine in a zipper-like manner (Jacinto et al., 2000Jacinto A. Wood W. Balayo T. Turmaine M. Martinez-Arias A. Martin P. Dynamic actin-based epithelial adhesion and cell matching during Drosophila dorsal closure.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1420-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This interaction pulls the two cells together and pushes the AS cells down inside the embryo. Because the opening is eye shaped, the zippering process starts at its anterior and posterior corners and progresses from both ends toward the middle (Figure 1A). If zippering is impaired, the two LEs continue their approach normally along the length of the opening but closure ceases, probably because the AS cells, which are not internalized in the absence of zippering, have reached their maximal contraction potential (Jankovics and Brunner, 2006Jankovics F. Brunner D. Transiently reorganized microtubules are essential for zippering during dorsal closure in Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This suggests that zippering forces mainly mediate the final gap sealing whereas the major tissue movement, the congressing of the LEs, is driven by AS cell constriction and AC activity. To date it is not clear how the last two forces are coordinated. In JNK mutant embryos that lack a fully functional AC, closure is not completed (Homsy et al., 2006Homsy J.G. Jasper H. Peralta X.G.

Similarly, DC is impaired in embryos depleted of AS cells by the cell-autonomous toxin Ricin-A (Scuderi and Letsou, 2005Scuderi A. Letsou A. Amnioserosa is required for dorsal closure in Drosophila.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Laser cutting experiments had suggested that the various forces may simply be additive because interfering with one of the force-generating processes during DC progression strongly delays closure but does not lead to an arrest (Franke et al., 2005Franke J.D. Montague R.A. Kiehart D.P. Nonmuscle myosin II generates forces that transmit tension and drive contraction in multiple tissues during dorsal closure.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2208-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Kiehart et al., 2000Kiehart D.P. Galbraith C.G. Edwards K.A. Rickoll W.L. Montague R.A. Multiple forces contribute to cell sheet morphogenesis for dorsal closure in Drosophila. J.Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In addition, recent experiments showed that in these situations a wound healing process is triggered, leading to the formation of ectopic ACs that generate additional contractile forces (Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2008Rodriguez-Diaz A. Toyama Y. Abravanel D.L. Wiemann J.M. Wells A.R. Tulu U.S. Edwards G.S. Kiehart D. Actomyosin purse strings: Renewable resources that make morphogenesis robust and resilient.HFSP J. 2008; 2: 220-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored an intriguing pulsing behavior of the AS cells. We found that pulsing is an intrinsic property of AS cells, which appears to be coordinated within the tissue by a tension-based mechanism. We show that the pulsed forces created by AS cells are sufficient to transiently displace the flanking epidermal cell layers dorsally, even before DC starts. Epidermal displacement is maintained when the AC forms, contributing a second force that acts like a ratchet. As a consequence of AC activity, the AS tissue becomes compressed and the pulsing amplitude of AS cells decreases. Simulations show that this creates a critical decline in AS tissue tension and a subsequent arrest of pulsation and force generation. In vivo, this loss of surface area is compensated by a selective pulsing arrest, which leaves a subset of AS cells in a contracted state and provides additional space for the remaining cells. Thus the period during which AS cells can generate pulsed forces is extended and the efficiency of DC is substantially improved. Our work describes a mechanism of cooperative force generation by AS tissue cells and uncovers a complex coupling between two major forces driving DC. When imaging early stages of DC, we observed a pulsing behavior of the apical surfaces of AS cells (Movie S1 available online; Figure 1B). To further investigate this behavior, we first attempted to describe the pulsing of individual cells. We therefore performed a detailed, time-resolved quantification of the displayed cell-shape changes in real-time fluorescence movie sequences of embryos expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Armadillo (GFP-Arm), a marker of the apical cell circumference (McCartney et al., 2001McCartney B.M. McEwen D.G. Grevengoed E. Maddox P. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Drosophila APC2 and Armadillo participate in tethering mitotic spindles to cortical actin.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We monitored the movement and constriction dynamics of AS cells, starting before the onset of DC (during germ band retraction), until approximately half-way into the process, a point when zippering started to contribute a significant additional force, thus complicating the system (Movie S1, Supplemental Data). Our analysis showed that AS cells already pulse long before DC starts (Figure 1C; Movie S2), indicating that pulsing behavior is an intrinsic property of AS cells, which occurs independently of DC initiation. To further analyze the movies, we developed an automated image segmentation technology that allows reliable detection and extraction of individual cell geometries (Figure 1B; Movie S1; Experimental Procedures). Our analysis showed that individual cells contracted their apical surfaces with a periodicity of 230 ± 76 s (Figures 1C and 1D). This raises the question of how such periodic contractions can be coordinated with the proposed gradual overall contraction of the apical cell surface during DC. We found that during the entire observation period, individual AS cells reached a remarkably constant minimal apical surface area when fully contracted (Figures 1E–1G). Their maximal surface extension, in contrast, remained constant until the onset of DC and subsequently decreased gradually. This shows that the overall apical surface constriction of AS cells observed during DC is the result of a decrease in pulsing amplitude. Pulsing amplitude continued to decrease for about 20 min on average, after which there was an almost complete arrest of pulsing with only minor cell surface variations remaining (Figure 1F). At this point, individual AS cells had reached a cell surface extension close to their respective minimal value. Both pulsing amplitude reduction and pulsing arrest were not synchronous but followed specific temporal sequences (Figures 1E–1G). At the onset of DC, only the ventral-most rows of AS cells that were in contact with the epidermal cells on each side of the dorsal opening significantly decreased their pulsing amplitude. Meanwhile, the second row of cells decreased its amplitude more slowly but accelerated when the first row of cells had decreased to about 40% of its original surface area. The third AS cell row significantly reduced its pulsing amplitude only at a stage when zippering had begun to influence the system. Our results show that during DC, the apical surface constriction of AS cells corresponds to a damping of the pulsations. They further show that damping and the subsequent pulsation arrest are sequential and coordinated in space and time. In cohesive tissue, the contraction of a cell creates a force that pulls on the neighboring cells. The pulsed forces generated by AS cells can in principle pull the epidermal cells dorsal-wards during DC. However, we have shown that these forces are generated before epidermal cells move dorsally, indicating that they may not influence DC. This would be possible if the pulsed forces were neutralized within the AS tissue, meaning that the pulling force of a contracting cell would be absorbed by the simultaneous relaxing of its neighbors. Movies covering the time period before DC onset showed that this is not the case. Instead, the LE displayed oscillatory movements in the dorsal/ventral direction (early time points in Figure 2B; Movie S2). LE oscillations were perfectly in phase with the contractions of the immediately neighboring AS cells. Each AS cell contraction resulted in a few micrometers of dorsal-ward displacement of the LE. When the respective AS cell subsequently relaxed, the LE retracted back toward the ventral side, also. At this stage we observed a net ventral-ward displacement of the LE (Movie S2). Our results demonstrate that AS cells constitutively exert force pulses pulling the surrounding epidermal tissue dorsally. This contradicts the current view in which AS cells start pulling on the LE only at the beginning of DC (Martin and Parkhurst, 2004Martin P. Parkhurst S.M. Parallels between tissue repair and embryo morphogenesis.Development. 2004; 131: 3021-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, Xia and Karin, 2004Xia Y. Karin M. The control of cell motility and epithelial morphogenesis by Jun kinases.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 94-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Before DC starts, the resulting LE displacement is not sustained because the LE behaves as an elastic, retracting after the pulse. Upon DC initiation, this ventral-ward relaxation of the LE became limited, resulting in a net displacement toward the dorsal midline (Figure 2B). Shortly after, when the first row of AS cells ceased their periodic pulsations, the stepwise LE movement continued in phase with the contractions of the next dorsal row of AS cells (Figure 2C). However, the oscillatory LE movement was simultaneously dampened. This was probably due to the interjacent first row of contracted AS cells, which had stiffened (for t = 1800–3000 s in Figure 2C). In summary, we find that AS cells constitutively create pulsed forces that translate into dorsal-ward LE displacement. However, the latter is maintained only when DC starts, revealing the existence of a timing mechanism. Previous work had suggested that DC is triggered by a signal that activates all cellular changes required for force production. Here we show that the pulsed pulling forces produced by AS cells precede such a signal and that the onset of DC is marked by suppression of ventral-ward LE relaxation after a force pulse. This raises the question of how this transition in LE behavior is regulated. A good candidate for this function is the AC, which provides a second force driving DC. To test this possibility, we monitored the interplay between AC formation and the change in LE oscillations. We performed real-time fluorescence imaging of embryos expressing the filamentous actin-binding domain of Moesin tagged with GFP (GFP-Moe [Kiehart et al., 2000Kiehart D.P. Galbraith C.G. Edwards K.A. Rickoll W.L. Montague R.A. Multiple forces contribute to cell sheet morphogenesis for dorsal closure in Drosophila. J.Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar]). Filamentous actin outlines cells and also provides a marker for AC formation (Kiehart et al., 2000Kiehart D.P. Galbraith C.G. Edwards K.A. Rickoll W.L. Montague R.A. Multiple forces contribute to cell sheet morphogenesis for dorsal closure in Drosophila. J.Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The mean intensity of the GFP-Moe signal along the LE showed that fluorescence was constant until germ band retraction was completed (Figures 3A and 3B). The fluorescence signal subsequently increased at the LE, indicating AC formation. The beginning of AC formation correlated perfectly with the beginning of the net dorsal-ward LE displacement (Figure 3B). The GFP-Moe signal increased slowly but constantly during the entire DC process (Figures 3A and 3B; Movie S3). This could reflect unspecific actin accumulation or indicate continuous AC enforcement. To distinguish between the two possibilities, we used the overall straightness of the LE as a quantifiable indicator of tension. The straightness was calculated as the ratio between the effective LE length and the distance between the two extremities. We found that LE straightness also continuously increased during DC, directly correlating with GFP-Moe fluorescence intensity increase (Figure 3B). This suggests that the AC tension builds up gradually throughout the DC process. To assess the correlation between AC formation and the onset of pulsation damping, we imaged GFP-Arm-expressing embryos and used LE straightening as for a measure of AC formation (Figure 3C). The beginning of the pulsation damping directly correlated with the beginning of LE stiffening (Figure 3D). Our results suggest that the newly appearing contractile force of the AC initiates DC by counteracting ventral-ward relaxation of the LE, which supports a model where the AC acts like a ratchet. To challenge this model, we examined DC in embryos that were homozygous for a deletion of basket (bsk−/bsk−), the gene encoding JNK (Sluss et al., 1996Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Goberdhan D.C.

These embryos show defective AC formation and cannot complete DC (Ricos et al., 1999Ricos M.G. Harden N. Sem K.P. Lim L. Chia W.

Movies of bsk−/bsk− embryos expressing GFP-Arm revealed that their phenotype was highly variable. Although in some embryos, as previously reported, DC arrested early, in a high percentage of mutants DC managed to proceed further, sometimes even up to the zippering stage (Figures 4A and 4B; Riesgo-Escovar and Hafen, 1997bRiesgo-Escovar J.R.

The Drosophila Jun-N-terminal kinase is required for cell morphogenesis but not for DJun-dependent cell fate specification in the eye.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2759-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This suggests that bsk−/bsk− embryos can build up AC activity to various extents, possibly because of maternal contribution of JNK. AS cell pulsations in the mutant embryos were indistinguishable from those in the wild-type but were sustained without damping in embryos displaying the severe phenotypes where little or no dorsal-ward net displacement and no straightening of the LE occurred (Figure 4A; Movie S4). In embryos that managed to initiate DC, this usually happened with a significant time delay (Figure 4B). With the onset of dorsal-ward LE movement, the LE began to straighten in a manner similar to that of the wild-type but with much slower kinetics (Figure 4B). In these mutant embryos, the damping of AS cell pulsation also started with a delay, and was slower and paralleled the behavior of the LE (Figure 4B). These observations confirm that AC formation is critical to the onset of DC and further support the model proposing a ratchet-like function of the AC. To gain further insight into the mechanics of AS cell pulsing and its coordination throughout the tissue, we looked for correlations in pulsing behavior among AS cells. Highlighting cells that were initiating a contraction did not reveal any patterns for contraction initiation such as propagating waves or any other regularity (Figure 5A; Movie S5). Examination of direct neighbors, however, indicated a recurrent in-phase or antiphase correlation (Figure 5B). To quantify this, we calculated the cross-correlation function of surface variations between all pairs of neighbors (Figure 5C; Supplemental Data). To improve time resolution, we did this for consecutive 800 s time windows that were shifted by 30 s. The observed time-resolved cross-correlation functions confirmed that neighboring AS cells mostly oscillate in-phase or in antiphase, with a clear preference for the latter (Figures 5D and 5E; Movie S6). This was not fixed as indicated by the fact that we observed frequent shifts between the two states (Figure 5D; Movie S6, Supplemental Data). The switches occurred quickly, revealing a high degree of plasticity within the tissue. Such plasticity is the signature of mechanical coupling between the AS cells pointing toward the possibility of a push or pull mechanism that triggers individual contractions. We also produced cross-correlation functions for all other possible pairs of cells and found that cells separated by another cell also were coupled. However, this coupling was weaker and showed a preference for in-phase pulsing (Figure S1). Oscillations of cells that were even further apart were not coupled, showing that coupling fades with distance. To further explore the coupling between neighboring cells, we produced laser-induced cuts of a single junction connecting two AS cells (Figure 6A). Each incision created a small, initially expanding opening, coinciding with a relaxation of the surrounding tissue. At the same time, the AS cells adjacent to the opening stopped pulsing almost instantaneously (Figure 6B; Movie S7). Cells further away were also affected: oscillations either stopped or were much less frequent (Figure 6C; Movie S7). We conclude that the pulsations of AS cells require tissue tension, which together with the observed cross-correlations suggests the presence of a mechanical control that couples the pulsing behavior of AS cells. Our analysis suggests that AS cells generate pulsed forces, which displace the surrounding epidermis dorsally, and that the AC sustains this displacement. To further explore this hypothesis, we modeled the system and used simulations to study its spatio-temporal dynamics. An ellipsoidal, two-dimensional tissue containing the apical cell surfaces approximated the geometry of the dorsal opening. The tissue was fixed at the two extremities and stretched open by an elastic surrounding the depicted epidermis (Figure 7A; Supplemental Data). To mimic the visco-elastic properties (the balance between the cell surface areas and the perimeter constrains), each cell was represented by a visco-elastic polygon sharing its edges and vertices with neighboring cells similarly to those used in previous studies (Bittig et al., 2008Bittig T.

Each polygon contained elastic springs connecting each vertex to the center of mass and to neighboring vertices (Figure 7B). Vertex displacements were affected by a homogeneous viscosity μ = 100 nN•s/μm. Our in vivo laser cutting experiments revealed a relaxation time of approximately 100 s, which determined the viscosity/elasticity ratio of the cells (Figure S2). In our model, the elastic properties of individual cells are equal and constant over time and in accordance with previously described typical values (Forgacs et al., 1998Forgacs G. Foty R.A.

We set the dynamic equations that define the position of all AS cell vertices in the tissue by balancing the elastic spring forces with the viscous force of the cells.

We have constructed a genetically encoded edge detection algorithm that programs an isogenic community of E. coli to sense an image of light, communicate to identify the light-dark edges, and visually present the result of the computation. The algorithm is implemented using multiple genetic circuits. An engineered light sensor enables cells to distinguish between light and dark regions. In the dark, cells produce a diffusible chemical signal that diffuses into light regions. Genetic logic gates are used so that only cells that sense light and the diffusible signal produce a positive output. A mathematical model constructed from first principles and parameterized with experimental measurements of the component circuits predicts the performance of the complete program. Quantitatively accurate models will facilitate the engineering of more complex biological behaviors and inform bottom-up studies of natural genetic regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2168201538,"Background The impact of scientific publications has traditionally been expressed in terms of citation counts. However, scientific activity has moved online over the past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a variety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network analysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate to each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific impact. Methodology We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by 39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on the basis of both citation and usage log data. Conclusions Our results indicate that the notion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more suitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not positioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus be used with caution."

The duplication of human chromosome 15q11-13 is known to be the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in autism. We have modeled this genetic change in mice by using chromosome engineering to generate a 6.3 Mb duplication of the conserved linkage group on mouse chromosome 7. Mice with a paternal duplication display poor social interaction, behavioral inflexibility, abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations, and correlates of anxiety. An increased MBII52 snoRNA within the duplicated region, affecting the serotonin 2c receptor (5-HT2cR), correlates with altered intracellular Ca2+ responses elicited by a 5-HT2cR agonist in neurons of mice with a paternal duplication. This chromosome-engineered mouse model for autism seems to replicate various aspects of human autistic phenotypes and validates the relevance of the human chromosome abnormality.

The first signs of autism appear at around 6 months, full diagnosis is usually made at 3 years, and symptoms usually persist throughout life. Autism is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders (Geschwind and Levitt, 2007Geschwind D.H. Levitt P. Autism spectrum disorders: developmental disconnection syndromes.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), suggesting that genetic factors play an important role in its etiology (Vorstman et al., 2006Vorstman J.A.

There are likely to be de novo mutations, chromosomal abnormalities and common genetic variants that contribute to the genetic etiologies of autism (Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008Abrahams B.S.

Several knockout mice have also been reported as “putative” autistic models, as judged from their phenotypes, but the molecular mechanism responsible for the pathophysiology of autism is far from complete. Abnormalities of chromosomes are thought to account for 10% to 20% of autism cases (Beaudet, 2007Beaudet A.L. Autism: highly heritable but not inherited.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 534-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent study has established de novo germline mutations including copy number variants (CNVs) as a more significant risk factor for ASD than previously recognized (Sebat et al., 2007Sebat J. Lakshmi B. Malhotra D. Troge J. Lese-Martin C. Walsh T. Yamrom B. Yoon S. Krasnitz A. Kendall J. et al.Strong association of de novo copy number mutations with autism.Science. 2007; 316: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Paternally or maternally inherited deletions of human chromosome 15q11-13 occur quite frequently, when they affect the imprinted region this is recognized as Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome, respectively (Nicholls and Knepper, 2001Nicholls R.D.

On the basis of conserved human/mouse linkage, we have generated mice with a 6.3 Mb duplication of mouse chromosome 7 mirroring the human chromosome 15q11-13 duplication. This mouse model displays several phenotypes that recapitulate aspects of the human condition and provides mechanistic insight into the disease. Human chromosome 15q11-13 has a conserved linkage group on mouse chromosome 7 (Figure 1). Chromosomal engineering (van der Weyden and Bradley, 2006van der Weyden L. Bradley A. Mouse chromosome engineering for modeling human disease.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2006; 7: 247-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used to construct an interstitial duplication of mouse chromosome 7 corresponding to the region between common breakpoints in human chromosome 15q11-13. Sequential rounds of insertional gene targeting were used to insert the selection cassettes and loxP sites required for chromosome engineering proximal to the Herc2 and distal to Mkrn3 (Figures 1 and 2A). A double-targeted clone in which the targeting had occurred on the homologous chromosomes (trans) was transiently transfected with a Cre expression plasmid to induce recombination between the loxP sites, which generated clones with a balanced duplication (Dp) and deletion (Df) (Figure 2C). Recombinants were recovered by hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) selection at a frequency of 26 × 10−7 per electroporated cell and confirmed via Southern blot analysis (Figures 2B and 2D) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Figure 2E). The deletion and duplication alleles were transmitted and established in the germ line by standard procedures, and the expected increase in genomic copy number of this region was confirmed with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray (Figure 2F).Figure 2Engineering an Interstitial Duplication on Chromosome 7Show full caption(A) Insertional double targeting and genomic coordinates, NCBI build m37.

(F) A BAC array-CGH profile of chromosome 7 from mice with the duplication. Log2-transformed hybridization ratios of duplicated mouse DNA versus WT DNA are plotted. The duplication allele was transmitted at normal Mendelian ratios from both females and males. Mice with a maternally (matDp/+) and paternally (patDp/+) inherited duplication bred normally and were fertile. The patDp/+ male mice began to show an increase in body weight compared to wild-type (WT) mice after 15 weeks, and the body weight of patDp/+ was significantly greater than that of the WT after 20 weeks (data not shown). We performed histological analyses of the adult brain as well as that of brains at postnatal day 0 (P0), P7, and P14 to screen for morphological changes. No significant abnormality was detected in H&E-stained sections of the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, corpus callosum, and cerebellum either macroscopically or at the microscopic level (Figure S1 available online). The number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum was not significantly different between mice with the duplication and WT mice (Figure S2). Bodian staining was also performed, and this did not reveal any significant abnormality in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum (data not shown). The 6.3 Mb duplication includes the region of genomic imprinting. The relative expression levels of genes in the duplicated region are expected to vary depending on whether they are imprinted and on their mode of inheritance (Figure 3A). Therefore, gene expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR in the brains from patDp/+ and matDp/+ mice, and the results were normalized to those in WT mice (Figure 3B). In the adult brain, Ndn, Snrpn, Ube3a, Gabrβ3, Gabrα5, and Herc2 genes in the duplicated region were highly expressed, whereas the expression of others was relatively less abundant. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the paternally expressed genes, Ndn, and Snrpn, were increased more than 2-fold in the patDp/+ mice. Unexpectedly, Ndn also exhibited increased expression levels in matDp/+, though the levels were lower, while Snrpn showed the expected level (no change). The maternally expressed gene, Ube3a, showed an approximately 2-fold increase in matDp/+ mice. The expression of Atp10a did not show any significant difference between patDp/+ and matDp/+ mice. The nonimprinting genes, GABAA receptor subunits and Herc2, showed the expected 1.5-fold increase in mice with the duplication. Chrna7 and Tubgcp5, both of which are located outside the duplicated region, did not show any significant change in their expression levels. In other tissues, the expression phenotypes reflected those in the brain (Figure S3). The expression of each gene in various areas of the adult mouse brains was examined by in situ hybridization (Figure 3C). Alterations in the expression patterns of these genes in patDp/+ and matDp/+ brains were unremarkable, although the expression level of Snrpn in the hippocampus seemed to be higher in the patDp/+ mice, whereas that of Ube3a seemed to be higher in the matDp/+ mice. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification in imprinted regions and is found in 15q11-13 (Nicholls and Knepper, 2001Nicholls R.D. Knepper J.L. Genome organization, function, and imprinting in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2001; 2: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The imprinting center (IC) is localized to the 5′ end of Snurf-Snrpn locus. This region is methylated (Me) or unmethylated (UnMe) in maternal and paternal alleles, respectively. We thus examined allele-specific methylation by Southern blotting with a Snurf probe by using methylation-sensitive (BssHII) and -insensitive (HpaI) restriction enzymes. The ratios of Me and UnMe bands were 1:2 and 2:1 in patDp/+ and matDp/+ mice, respectively, in contrast to 1:1 in the WT (Figure 3D). These results suggest that allele-specific methylation is conserved in the mice with the duplicated allele. To analyze the effect of the chromosomal duplication on behavior, we performed a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests (Crawley, 2007Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse?.Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2007Crossref Google Scholar, Takao et al., 2007Takao K. Yamasaki N. Miyakawa T.

We observed significant differences between the WT and mice with a duplication in the several tests described below (Tables S1 and S2). The diagnosis of autism is based on behavioral criteria (Volkmar and Pauls, 2003Volkmar F.R. Pauls D. Autism.Lancet. 2003; 362: 1133-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, a valid mouse model should reflect behavioral symptoms, including impairment in social interaction (Crawley, 2004Crawley J.N.

The mouse to be tested was placed in the central chamber and could move freely among the three chambers. A stranger mouse was placed in one of the side chambers in a wire cage, and only a cage was placed in the opposite chamber. WT mice tended to contact the stranger mouse, and the time spent with the stranger mouse in the quadrant location depicted by the line in Figure 4A was significantly higher than the time spent in the corresponding location in the opposite chamber with the empty cage (Figure 4B). In contrast, the patDp/+ mice exhibited no significant difference in time spent between the quadrant spaces of either side (Figure 4B). These phenotypes were also observed in mice with a different background under similar experimental conditions (Figure S4). To confirm that these results are due to specific changes in social behavior, we further performed the three-chamber test under different conditions. First, we assessed the reaction of mice to a novel inanimate object. Both patDp/+ and WT mice spent more time around the cage with a novel inanimate object compared with the empty cage, and no significant difference between patDp/+ and WT mice was observed (Figures 4C and S5A). Second, the simultaneous interactions with a novel mouse and another novel object were compared. WT mice spent more time around the cage with a novel mouse than with a novel object, whereas patDp/+ mice showed no significant difference in time spent around the cages with a novel mouse and object (Figures 4D and S5B). Third, the interactions of the mice with a novel and familiar mouse were also compared. In WT mice, although the time spent around the cages was not significantly altered, the number of entries around the novel mouse tended to be greater than that of the familiar mouse (p = 0.0541), whereas in patDp/+ mice, no significant difference between the novel and familiar mouse was found (Figure 4E and S5C). These results suggest that WT mice are more interested in a novel mouse than a novel inanimate object, but that patDp/+ mice have decreased sociability compared with the WT, which may be analogous to the impairment in appropriate social interaction often seen in autistic patients (Crawley, 2004Crawley J.N. Designing mouse behavioral tasks relevant to autistic-like behaviors.Ment. Retard. Dev. Disabil. Res. Rev. 2004; 10: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). On the other hand, matDp/+ mice were indistinguishable from WT mice (Figure S6). Since social behavior in mice is to a large extent olfactory driven, we examined the olfactory system of the mice anatomically (by immunohistochemistry) and functionally (by olfactory habituation/dishabituation test), and we excluded any defects of the olfactory system in patDp/+ mice (data not shown). To measure behavioral flexibility, we habitually trained mice and then analyzed their responses to a change in routine in a reversal task by using the Morris water maze test and the Barnes maze test, which have been generally validated for spatial learning and memory (Crawley, 2007Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse?.Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2007Crossref Google Scholar, Miyakawa et al., 2001Miyakawa T. Yared E. Pak J.H. Huang F.L. Huang K.P. Crawley J.N. Neurogranin null mutant mice display performance deficits on spatial learning tasks with anxiety related components.Hippocampus. 2001; 11: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Morris water maze is a spatial navigation task in which the mouse swims to find a hidden platform. Mice were trained to locate the correct platform to escape from the water. Both patDp/+ and WT mice learned the target quadrant (TA in Figures 5A–5C), suggesting that there was no impairment in spatial learning in patDp/+ mice. When the target platform was then moved to the opposite area (TA in Figure 5D), WT mice spent significantly more time in the new TA quadrant compared with the opposite quadrant (OP) (Figure 5E). On the other hand, patDp/+ mice exhibited no difference between time in the TA and OP (Figure 5F). The Barnes maze is a circular white platform with 12 holes (Figures 5G and 5J). One of the holes exits into a dark box called the target initially placed at 0 degrees (Figure 5G). Mice were trained to locate the correct hole to exit into the escape box. Both patDp/+ and WT mice learned to identify the target at the 0 degree point, and there was no observable difference between the two mice (Figures 5H and 5I), again suggesting that there was no impairment in spatial learning of patDp/+ mice. When the target was moved to the opposite side (Figure 5J), both patDp/+ and WT mice could find the target; however, compared with the WT, patDp/+ mice stayed less in the new target position and more in the 180 or ±150 degree position, which is the position of the original target or in its direction (Figure 5L). The time spent between the target and the 180 degree position was significantly different in WT mice (Figure 5K), whereas there was no significant difference in patDp/+ mice (Figure 5L). The Barnes maze test was also performed in mice with a different background, and the results were consistent (Figures S7A and S7B). Conversely, matDp/+ mice did not show any significant change even in reversal learning compared with WT mice (Figures S8A and S8B). These results suggest that patDp/+ mice do not respond as flexibly as WT and matDp/+ mice to a change in situation, which may be comparable to the inflexibility in routine that is characteristic of autism (Crawley, 2004Crawley J.N. Designing mouse behavioral tasks relevant to autistic-like behaviors.Ment. Retard. Dev. Disabil. Res. Rev. 2004; 10: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), although we should acknowledge that it is far from clear how cognitive deficits in reversal learning are related to the behavioral deficits in autism even in humans and even less clear from mouse to humans (Geurts et al., 2009Geurts H.M. Corbett B. Solomon M. The paradox of cognitive flexibility in autism.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2009; 13: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found the lack of reversal deficits in the T maze test (data not shown). Perhaps reversal deficits are only apparent during aversively motivated escape behaviors and not appetitively motivated approach behaviors. To see impairment in communicative behavior, we measured ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of neonatal mice that were separated from their dams (Figure 4F). These USVs are thought to be distress signals (Crawley, 2007Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse?.Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2007Crossref Google Scholar) and may be related to communication between a dam and her pups (Crawley, 2004Crawley J.N. Designing mouse behavioral tasks relevant to autistic-like behaviors.Ment. Retard. Dev. Disabil. Res. Rev. 2004; 10: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In WT mice, the USVs have a normal developmental course, emerging soon after birth, peaking at around P5, and then decreasing to almost zero at around P14, the time of eye opening when the development of alternative communication may occur (Noirot, 1966Noirot E. Ultra-sounds in young rodents. I. Changes with age in albino mice.Anim. Behav. 1966; 14: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The USVs emitted by patDp/+ pups at P7 and P14 were markedly greater than those of WT pups (Figure 4F). In the patDp/+ pups, the peak in the numbers of USVs seemed to be delayed, and the USVs were still present at P14, when those of WT mice had disappeared, suggesting that patDp/+ mice may be developmentally abnormal in comparison with the WT. Detailed frequency analysis revealed that most of the USVs at P7 and P14 emitted by patDp/+ pups were mainly in the 50–70 kHz frequency range, with some over 70 kHz, the latter of which was not seen in WT pups (Figure S9). No difference in USVs was observed between matDp/+ and WT pups (Figure S8C), suggesting that communicative development between dam and neonatal mice in patDp/+ is different from that in WT or matDp/+ pups. This larger number of USVs in patDp/+ pups may reflect higher anxiety and fear in response to stress (Crawle"

Ablation of AgRP neurons in adult mice results in Fos activation in postsynaptic neurons and starvation. Loss of GABA is implicated in starvation because chronic subcutaneous delivery of bretazenil (a GABAA receptor partial agonist) suppresses Fos activation and maintains feeding during ablation of AgRP neurons. Moreover, under these conditions, direct delivery of bretazenil into the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), a direct target of AgRP neurons that also relays gustatory and visceral sensory information, is sufficient to maintain feeding. Conversely, inactivation of GABA biosynthesis in the ARC or blockade of GABAA receptors in the PBN of mice promote anorexia. We suggest that activation of the PBN by AgRP neuron ablation or gastrointestinal malaise inhibits feeding. Chronic delivery of bretazenil during loss of AgRP neurons provides time to establish compensatory mechanisms that eventually allow mice to eat."
https://openalex.org/W2078663039,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) becomes dormant and phenotypically drug resistant when it encounters multiple stresses within the host. Inability of currently available drugs to kill latent Mtb is a major impediment to curing and possibly eradicating tuberculosis (TB). Most in vitro dormancy models, using single stress factors, fail to generate a truly dormant Mtb population. An in vitro model that generates truly dormant Mtb cells is needed to elucidate the metabolic requirements that allow Mtb to successfully go through dormancy, identify new drug targets, and to screen drug candidates to discover novel drugs that can kill dormant pathogen.We developed a novel in vitro multiple-stress dormancy model for Mtb by applying combined stresses of low oxygen (5%), high CO(2) (10%), low nutrient (10% Dubos medium) and acidic pH (5.0), conditions Mtb is thought to encounter in the host. Under this condition, Mtb stopped replicating, lost acid-fastness, accumulated triacylglycerol (TG) and wax ester (WE), and concomitantly acquired phenotypic antibiotic-resistance. Putative neutral lipid biosynthetic genes were up-regulated. These genes may serve as potential targets for new antilatency drugs. The triacylglycerol synthase1 (tgs1) deletion mutant, with impaired ability to accumulate TG, exhibited a lesser degree of antibiotic tolerance and complementation restored antibiotic tolerance. Transcriptome analysis with microarray revealed the achievement of dormant state showing repression of energy generation, transcription and translation machineries and induction of stress-responsive genes. We adapted this model for drug screening using the Alamar Blue dye to quantify the antibiotic tolerant dormant cells.The new in vitro multiple stress dormancy model efficiently generates Mtb cells meeting all criteria of dormancy, and this method is adaptable to high-throughput screening for drugs that can kill dormant Mtb. A critical link between storage-lipid accumulation and development of phenotypic drug-resistance in Mtb was established. Storage lipid biosynthetic genes may be appropriate targets for novel drugs that can kill latent Mtb."
https://openalex.org/W2135020156,"Mutations and deletions in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), as well as instability of the nuclear genome, are involved in multiple human diseases. Here, we report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of mtDNA leads to nuclear genome instability, through a process of cell-cycle arrest and selection we define as a cellular crisis. This crisis is not mediated by the absence of respiration, but instead correlates with a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Analysis of cells undergoing this crisis identified a defect in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis, which requires normal mitochondrial function. We found that downregulation of nonmitochondrial ISC protein biogenesis was sufficient to cause increased genomic instability in cells with intact mitochondrial function. These results suggest mitochondrial dysfunction stimulates nuclear genome instability by inhibiting the production of ISC-containing protein(s), which are required for maintenance of nuclear genome integrity.

https://openalex.org/W2005959793,"Background Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Murine colitis model induced by Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) is an animal model of IBD that is commonly used to address the pathogenesis of IBD as well as to test efficacy of therapies. In this study we systematically analyzed clinical parameters, histological changes, intestinal barrier properties and cytokine profile during the colitic and recovery phase. Methods C57BL/6 mice were administered with 3.5% of DSS in drinking water for various times. Clinical and histological features were determined using standard criteria. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, transepithelial permeability and proinflammatory mediators were determined in whole colon or proximal and distal parts of colon. Results As expected after administration of DSS, mice manifest loss of body weight, shortening of colon length and bloody feces. Histological manifestations included shortening and loss of crypts, infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophil, symptoms attenuated after DSS withdrawal. The MPO value, as inflammation indicator, also increases significantly at all periods of DSS treatment, and even after DSS withdrawal, it still held at very high levels. Trans-mucosal permeability increased during DSS treatment, but recovered to almost control level after DSS withdrawal. The production of proinflammatory mediators by colonic mucosa were enhanced during DSS treatment, and then recovered to pre-treated level after DSS withdrawal. Finally, enhanced expression of proinflammatory mediators also revealed a different profile feature in proximal and distal parts of the colon. Conclusion Experimental colitis induced by DSS is a good animal model to study the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and intervention against IBD, especially UC."
https://openalex.org/W2080683349,"Retinoic acid (RA) triggers antiproliferative effects in tumor cells, and therefore RA and its synthetic analogs have great potential as anticarcinogenic agents. Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) mediate RA effects by directly regulating gene expression. To define the genetic network regulated by RARs in breast cancer, we identified RAR genomic targets using chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression analysis. We found that RAR binding throughout the genome is highly coincident with estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binding, resulting in a widespread crosstalk of RA and estrogen signaling to antagonistically regulate breast cancer-associated genes. ERalpha- and RAR-binding sites appear to be coevolved on a large scale throughout the human genome, often resulting in competitive binding activity at nearby or overlapping cis-regulatory elements. The highly coordinated intersection between these two critical nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways provides a global mechanism for balancing gene expression output via local regulatory interactions dispersed throughout the genome."

https://openalex.org/W2068830954,"Malaria transmission intensity is a crucial determinant of malarial disease burden and its measurement can help to define health priorities. Rapid, local estimates of transmission are required to focus resources better but current entomological and parasitological methods for estimating transmission intensity are limited in this respect. An alternative is determination of antimalarial antibody age-specific sero-prevalence to estimate sero-conversion rates (SCR), which have been shown to correlate with transmission intensity. This study evaluated SCR generated from samples collected from health facility attendees as a tool for a rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity.The study was conducted in north east Tanzania. Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens MSP-1(19) and AMA-1 were measured by indirect ELISA. Age-specific antibody prevalence was analysed using a catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood to generate SCR. A pilot study, conducted near Moshi, found SCRs for AMA-1 were highly comparable between samples collected from individuals in a conventional cross-sectional survey and those collected from attendees at a local health facility. For the main study, 3885 individuals attending village health facilities in Korogwe and Same districts were recruited. Both malaria parasite prevalence and sero-positivity were higher in Korogwe than in Same. MSP-1(19) and AMA-1 SCR rates for Korogwe villages ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.07 to 0.21 respectively. In Same district there was evidence of a recent reduction in transmission, with SCR among those born since 1998 [MSP-1(19) 0.002 to 0.008 and AMA-1 0.005 to 0.014 ] being 5 to 10 fold lower than among individuals born prior to 1998 [MSP-1(19) 0.02 to 0.04 and AMA-1 0.04 to 0.13]. Current health facility specific estimates of SCR showed good correlations with malaria incidence rates in infants in a contemporaneous clinical trial (MSP-1(19) r(2) = 0.78, p<0.01 & AMA-1 r(2) = 0.91, p<0.001).SCRs generated from age-specific anti-malarial antibody prevalence data collected via health facility surveys were robust and credible. Analysis of SCR allowed detection of a recent drop in malaria transmission in line with recent data from other areas in the region. This health facility-based approach represents a potential tool for rapid assessment of recent trends in malaria transmission intensity, generating valuable data for local and national malaria control programs to target, monitor and evaluate their control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2002888616,"Background Estimating the number of genes in human genome has been long an important problem in computational biology. With the new conception of considering human as a super-organism, it is also interesting to estimate the number of genes in this human super-organism. Principal Findings We presented our estimation of gene numbers in the human gut bacterial community, the largest microbial community inside the human super-organism. We got 552,700 unique genes from 202 complete human gut bacteria genomes. Then, a novel gene counting model was built to check the total number of genes by combining culture-independent sequence data and those complete genomes. 16S rRNAs were used to construct a three-level tree and different counting methods were introduced for the three levels: strain-to-species, species-to-genus, and genus-and-up. The model estimates that the total number of genes is about 9,000,000 after those with identity percentage of 97% or up were merged. Conclusion By combining completed genomes currently available and culture-independent sequencing data, we built a model to estimate the number of genes in human gut bacterial community. The total number of genes is estimated to be about 9 million. Although this number is huge, we believe it is underestimated. This is an initial step to tackle this gene counting problem for the human super-organism. It will still be an open problem in the near future. The list of genomes used in this paper can be found in the supplementary table."
https://openalex.org/W1968369239,"Previous proteomic and transcriptional analyses of multiple sclerosis lesions revealed modulation of the renin-angiotensin and the opposing kallikrein-kinin pathways. Here we identify kinin receptor B1 (Bdkrb1) as a specific modulator of immune cell entry into the central nervous system (CNS). We demonstrate that the Bdkrb1 agonist R838 (Sar-[D-Phe]des-Arg(9)-bradykinin) markedly decreases the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in SJL mice, whereas the Bdkrb1 antagonist R715 (Ac-Lys-[D-betaNal(7), Ile(8)]des-Arg(9)-bradykinin) resulted in earlier onset and greater severity of the disease. Bdkrb1-deficient (Bdkrb1(-/-)) C57BL/6 mice immunized with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein fragment, MOG(35-55), showed more severe disease with enhanced CNS-immune cell infiltration. The same held true for mixed bone marrow-chimeric mice reconstituted with Bdkrb1(-/-) T lymphocytes, which showed enhanced T helper type 17 (T(H)17) cell invasion into the CNS. Pharmacological modulation of Bdkrb1 revealed that in vitro migration of human T(H)17 lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier endothelium is regulated by this receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system is involved in the regulation of CNS inflammation, limiting encephalitogenic T lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, and provide evidence that Bdkrb1 could be a new target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2058079473,"Background It is largely unknown how frequently low-abundance HIV drug-resistant variants at levels under limit of detection of conventional genotyping (<20% of quasi-species) are present in antiretroviral-experienced persons experiencing virologic failure. Further, the clinical implications of low-abundance drug-resistant variants at time of virologic failure are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Plasma samples from 22 antiretroviral-experienced subjects collected at time of virologic failure (viral load 1380 to 304,000 copies/mL) were obtained from a specimen bank (from 2004–2007). The prevalence and profile of drug-resistant mutations were determined using Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Genotypes were interpreted using Stanford HIV database algorithm. Antiretroviral treatment histories were obtained by chart review and correlated with drug-resistant mutations. Low-abundance drug-resistant mutations were detected in all 22 subjects by deep sequencing and only in 3 subjects by Sanger sequencing. In total they accounted for 90 of 247 mutations (36%) detected by deep sequencing; the majority of these (95%) were not detected by standard genotyping. A mean of 4 additional mutations per subject were detected by deep sequencing (p<0.0001, 95%CI: 2.85–5.53). The additional low-abundance drug-resistant mutations increased a subject's genotypic resistance to one or more antiretrovirals in 17 of 22 subjects (77%). When correlated with subjects' antiretroviral treatment histories, the additional low-abundance drug-resistant mutations correlated with the failing antiretroviral drugs in 21% subjects and correlated with historical antiretroviral use in 79% subjects (OR, 13.73; 95% CI, 2.5–74.3, p = 0.0016). Conclusions/Significance Low-abundance HIV drug-resistant mutations in antiretroviral-experienced subjects at time of virologic failure can increase a subject's overall burden of resistance, yet commonly go unrecognized by conventional genotyping. The majority of unrecognized resistant mutations correlate with historical antiretroviral use. Ultra-deep sequencing can provide important historical resistance information for clinicians when planning subsequent antiretroviral regimens for highly treatment-experienced patients, particularly when their prior treatment histories and longitudinal genotypes are not available."
https://openalex.org/W2151380386,"Post-Golgi vesicles target and deliver most biosynthetic cargoes to the cell surface. However, the molecules and mechanisms involved in fusion of these vesicles are not well understood. We have employed a system to simultaneously monitor release of luminal and membrane biosynthetic cargoes from individual post-Golgi vesicles. Exocytosis of these vesicles is not calcium triggered. Release of luminal cargo can be accompanied by complete, partial, or no release of membrane cargo. Partial and no release of membrane cargo of a fusing vesicle are fates associated with kiss-and-run exocytosis, and we find that these are the predominant mode of post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis. Partial cargo release by post-Golgi vesicles occurs because of premature closure of the fusion pore and is modulated by the activity of clathrin, actin, and dynamin. Our results demonstrate that these components of the endocytic machinery modulate the nature and extent of biosynthetic cargo delivery by post-Golgi vesicles at the cell membrane.

Our results demonstrate that these components of the endocytic machinery modulate the nature and extent of biosynthetic cargo delivery by post-Golgi vesicles at the cell membrane. Eukaryotic cells use vesicles to carry newly synthesized lipids and proteins to and across the cell membrane. Secretory biosynthetic cargo is made in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), traffics through the Golgi, and is packaged in vesicles that are transported to and fuse with the cell membrane, delivering their contents (Palade, 1975Palade G. Intracellular aspects of the process of protein synthesis.Science. 1975; 189: 867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these vesicles (post-Golgi vesicles) fuse shortly after arriving at the cell surface (constitutive exocytosis), and other vesicles (synaptic and dense core vesicles) remain there until a transient rise in calcium triggers their fusion (regulated exocytosis). Regulated secretion involves control over formation and expansion of the fusion pore by regulators such as Ca2+ level (Ales et al., 1999Ales E. Tabares L. Poyato J.M. Valero V. Lindau M.

Thus, it is believed that release of cargo by post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis is not regulated by controlled formation and expansion of the fusion pore. However, while rapid Ca2+ influx does not trigger post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis, it is possible that efflux of Ca2+ from the lumen of the post-Golgi vesicle may control formation and expansion of the fusion pore during post-Golgi vesicle fusion.

Thus there is a need to investigate whether Ca2+-dependent or independent mechanisms control formation and expansion of the post-Golgi vesicle fusion pore. Two features that have enabled studying the regulation of cargo release by formation and expansion of the fusion pore during regulated exocytosis are (1) the ability to synchronize fusion by Ca2+ increase and (2) the use of fluorescently tagged luminal and membrane cargoes. As no triggering mechanism is known for post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis, in mammalian cells this synchrony has been achieved by altering growth temperature to block biosynthetic cargo traffic and then reverting to normal temperature to release the block. However, temperature affects not only fusion pore formation and expansion (Zhang and Jackson, 2008Zhang Z. Jackson M.B. Temperature Dependence of Fusion Kinetics and Fusion Pores in Ca2+-triggered Exocytosis from PC12 Cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but also distribution of lipids and dynamics of transport throughout the secretory pathway (Patterson et al., 2008Patterson G.H. Hirschberg K. Polishchuk R.S. Gerlich D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Transport through the Golgi apparatus by rapid partitioning within a two-phase membrane system.Cell. 2008; 133: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). While constitutive secretion of biosynthetic membrane cargo has been monitored (Schmoranzer et al., 2000Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. Imaging constitutive exocytosis with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Kreitzer et al., 2003Kreitzer G. Schmoranzer J. Low S.H. Li X. Gan Y. Weimbs T. Simon S.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Three-dimensional analysis of post-Golgi carrier exocytosis in epithelial cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), secretion of luminal cargo from individual post-Golgi vesicle has not been monitored. To study formation and expansion of fusion pores during post-Golgi cargo secretion, other approaches to synchronize, label and monitor exocytosis of post-Golgi vesicles are needed. We had previously developed an approach to synchronize secretion of constitutive biosynthetic cargo by using a cell-permeable pharmacological regulator, to avoid shifting temperature (Rivera et al., 2000Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. et al.Regulation of protein secretion through controlled aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This approach allows us to selectively control trafficking of only the desired biosynthetic cargo (membrane or luminal). It is thus well suited for studying formation and expansion of fusion pores during post-Golgi cargo secretion. Here, we have used this approach together with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to simultaneously image secretion of luminal and membrane cargo by individual post-Golgi vesicles in live cells. We found that post-Golgi vesicles can undergo partial (kiss-and-run) exocytosis, resulting in incomplete release of luminal cargo and partial or no release of membrane proteins. Ca2+ had no detectable effect on triggering post-Golgi vesicle fusion, nor did it affect the nature of post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis. Instead, clathrin, dynamin and actin—known regulators of endocytosis—control the nature and extent of post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis. Our results identify kiss-and-run exocytosis as a significant regulator of the extent of biosynthetic cargo secretion by post-Golgi vesicles. It also provides evidence that this control is achieved via the activity of the endocytic machinery. To synchronize the delivery of biosynthetic cargo to the surface, we tagged the cargo of interest with F36M—a mutant version of protein FKBP12. F36M is termed as conditional aggregation domain (CAD) because its homodimerization is reversible by a small cell-permeant molecule AP21988 (Rivera et al., 2000Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. et al.Regulation of protein secretion through controlled aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, Rollins et al., 2000Rollins C.T. Rivera V.M. Woolfson D.N. Keenan T. Hatada M. Adams S.E. Andrade L.J. Yaeger D. van Schravendijk M.R. Holt D.A. et al.A ligand-reversible dimerization system for controlling protein-protein interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After synthesis in the ER, proteins with multiple CADs self-aggregate and are retained there until ligand addition causes the cargo to disaggregate and traffic through the secretory pathway (Figure 1A) (Rivera et al., 2000Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. et al.Regulation of protein secretion through controlled aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As a marker for luminal cargo, we expressed human growth hormone signal sequence (hGHss) fused to GFP, four CADs, and hGH. Our membrane marker was nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), which we have previously used to mark the post-Golgi vesicle membrane (Kreitzer et al., 2003Kreitzer G. Schmoranzer J. Low S.H. Li X. Gan Y. Weimbs T. Simon S.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Three-dimensional analysis of post-Golgi carrier exocytosis in epithelial cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), expressed with a fluorescent protein and CADs (Figure 1B). Within a few minutes of adding the CAD-disaggregating molecule AP21988 to the culture media, the fluorescence of the luminal cargo moved from the reticular distribution of the ER to a perinuclear distribution of the Golgi and then moved peripherally in small vesicles (Rivera et al., 2000Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. et al.Regulation of protein secretion through controlled aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C; Movie S1 available online). Within 15 min of ligand addition, we detected individual fluorescent vesicles at the cell membrane by TIRFM (data not shown). To determine whether the fluorescent marker was in post-Golgi vesicles, we simultaneously expressed either the LDL receptor or VSVGts, as fusions to YFP (Schmoranzer et al., 2000Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. Imaging constitutive exocytosis with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In cells at 20°C, LDLR is retained in the TGN, whereas at 40°C, VSVGts is retained in the ER. Both proteins traffic via post-Golgi vesicles upon shifting of cells to 37°C (Schmoranzer et al., 2000Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. Imaging constitutive exocytosis with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The CFP-tagged luminal or membrane marker colocalized with the vesicles carrying YFP-tagged LDLR or VSVGts (correlation coefficient 0.79 and 0.80, respectively; Figures S1A, S1B, S1E, and S1G). This indicated that the cell membrane-proximal vesicles carrying the CAD-containing fluorescent proteins were bona fide post-Golgi vesicles. To monitor secretion of cargo from these post-Golgi vesicles, we imaged cells expressing hGHss-GFP-CAD-hGH by TIRFM. During transit through the ER and Golgi, hGHss and hGH are cleaved from this protein. Thus, the fluorescent vesicle luminal marker is GFP fused to the CADs (GFP-CAD) (Rivera et al., 2000Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli Jr., F. et al.Regulation of protein secretion through controlled aggregation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). The fluorescence of these vesicles increased as they entered the evanescent field, and then dropped rapidly to background level as it spread laterally, indicating cargo exocytosis (Figure 2A). We also observed exocytic events where vesicle fluorescence decreased, but remained above the background (Figure 2B). This observation is consistent with the vesicle transiently opening its fusion pore to the outside, releasing only a part of its cargo. The fact that most of these vesicles do not move after fusion notwithstanding, the term “kiss-and-run fusion” is used to describe such partial fusion fates (Harata et al., 2006Harata N.C. Aravanis A.M. Tsien R.W. Kiss-and-run and full-collapse fusion as modes of exo-endocytosis in neurosecretion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1546-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We will thus refer to these fusion fates as kiss-and-run fusion. To test whether these partially fusing vesicles open a transient fusion pore, we used FM4-64 dye, which can access the vesicle membrane only when it contacts the extracellular media and has been used to test kiss-and-run fusion of synaptic and other vesicles (Harata et al., 2006Harata N.C. Aravanis A.M. Tsien R.W. Kiss-and-run and full-collapse fusion as modes of exo-endocytosis in neurosecretion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1546-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Indeed, FM4-64 labeled many GFP-containing post-Golgi vesicles (Figure 2C). Similarly, vesicles were labeled with the fluid phase marker Alexa fluor 546-hydrazine (data not shown). The ability of extracellular markers to enter the lumen of the vesicle indicates that partial release of the luminal marker is due to a transient opening to the outside. However, it does not rule out the possibility that this may involve photodamage to the cell and vesicle membrane, causing mixing of luminal and extracellular contents. To resolve between fusion, leakage, and lysis, we monitored the fate of vesicle membrane proteins during exocytosis. Only upon exocytosis of a vesicle will its membrane protein be delivered to the cell surface where it diffuses in two dimensions; thus, any decrease in vesicle fluorescence will cause a concomitant increase in cell membrane fluorescence, resulting in no change in integrated fluorescence. In case of leakage, the membrane marker would remain with the vesicle and not diffuse in the cell membrane, whereas in case of lysis, it will diffuse in the cytoplasm in three dimensions (Jaiswal and Simon, 2007Jaiswal J.K. Simon S.M. Imaging single events at the cell membrane.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Jaiswal et al., 2007Jaiswal J.K. Fix M. Takano T. Nedergaard M. Simon S.M. Resolving vesicle fusion from lysis to monitor calcium-triggered lysosomal exocytosis in astrocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14151-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Schmoranzer et al., 2000Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. Imaging constitutive exocytosis with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After ligand addition, CFP-tagged CAD-NGFR trafficked to the post-Golgi vesicles together with YFP tagged CAD (Figures S1C and S1D). Based on the fluorescence of the vesicle membrane marker, we observed two types of exocytic behaviors. In some cases, the fluorescence of the vesicular membrane protein reduced to the predocking background (Figure 2D, red symbol), indicating complete release. In other cases, the fluorescence of the vesicular membrane protein decreased, but remained above the predocking background (Figure 2E, red symbol), indicating partial release. In each of the observed fates of the vesicle (Figures 2D and 2E), the integrated (sum of vesicular and cell membrane) fluorescence of the fusing vesicle's membrane protein remained high (green symbols) even when there was a decrease in the luminal fluorescence (red symbols). This confirms that these events involve merger of the vesicle and cell membrane and thus indicate exocytosis, not leakage or lysis. To quantify the number of post-Golgi vesicles undergoing partial or complete fusion, we monitored the release of the luminal cargo or membrane cargo after the addition of CAD-disaggregating ligand. Based on luminal contents (GFP-CAD), we observed 32.7 ± 8.0 fusions/cell in a minute, of which 73% (23.8 ± 7.1) were kiss-and-run fusions and the rest (8.9 ± 2.9) were complete fusions (Figure 3A, gray bars). In contrast, using membrane cargo (NGFR-GFP), we observed only 12.2 ± 2.2 fusions/cell in a minute, of which 17% (2.1 ± 0.8) were kiss-and-run fusions and the rest 10.1 ± 2 were complete fusions (Figure 3A, black bars). While the difference in the number of complete fusions reported by luminal and membrane markers is not statistically significant (p = 0.4), there is an 11-fold difference in the number of vesicles that partially released their content (p = 10−6). These results are consistent with a population of vesicles that undergo kiss-and-run fusion, resulting in partial release of their luminal cargo but no release of the membrane cargo. To test this prediction, we coexpressed the membrane and luminal markers as CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins. Both of these cargoes were sequestered in the ER, and after addition of AP21988 they were packaged in the same post-Golgi vesicles (Figures S1C, S1D, and S2A–S2C). Quantification of the vesicle- and cell membrane-associated fluorescence indicates vesicles that fully released their YFP-tagged luminal cargo (Figure 3B, red line) also fully released their CFP-tagged membrane marker cargo (Figure 3B, open blue circles), and the released membrane cargo is delivered to the cell membrane: the integrated fluorescence of the vesicle and cell membrane remained relatively constant after exocytosis (Figure 3B, green line, filled symbols). Thus, vesicle luminal and membrane cargoes behaved similarly when coexpressed or expressed independently—their fluorescence returned to prefusion level (Figures 2A and 2D). Vesicles partially releasing their luminal content delivered either little or no membrane protein (Figures 3C–3E, S2B, and S2C). The fusion events where luminal cargo was partially released and membrane cargo was not released (state 3 in Figure 3E) account for the reduced number of partial fusions when only the vesicle membrane protein was used as exocytic marker (Figure 3A). To examine whether restricted fusion pore also slows release of luminal content during kiss-and-run fusion, we compared the time between start and end of luminal cargo release by individual exocytic vesicles from five cells. Cargo released faster during complete fusions (1.11 ± 0.30 s) compared to kiss-and-run fusions (1.49 ± 0.36 s) (p = 0.01; Figure 3F). It has been previously reported that dense core vesicles (DCVs) can partially release their luminal contents together with release of some membrane proteins, but not others (Tsuboi et al., 2004Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. Mechanisms of dense core vesicle recapture following “kiss and run” (“cavicapture”) exocytosis in insulin-secreting cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This was interpreted as a restriction on the ability of specific cargo to be released. Thus, incomplete release of membrane proteins could reflect a limitation of the particular reporter protein used and not the nature of the fusion. However, there are two observations, which indicate that this conclusion is not applicable to our membrane reporter, NGFR-GFP. First, our observation that ∼17% (2/12; Figure 3A) of post-Golgi vesicles containing the membrane protein NGFR-GFP undergo kiss-and-run fusion is consistent with the value we have observed with other biosynthetic membrane proteins. For example, we previously reported that 14% of vesicles labeled with the membrane protein LDLR-GFP undergo kiss-and-run fusion (Schmoranzer and Simon, 2003Schmoranzer J. Simon S.M. Role of microtubules in fusion of post-Golgi vesicles to the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1558-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Second, we find that a vesicle that undergoes kiss-and-run fusion with no release of membrane cargo can subsequently fuse and release its membrane cargo partially or completely (Figure 3D). Thus, the very same membrane cargo can be observed to not release, partially release, and then fully release from the very same vesicle. The fluorescence intensity changes observed in Figure 3D potentially can be accounted by successive fusion of multiple colocalized vesicles with different exocytic fates (Figure S2D). To test whether the fluorescence originated from a single or multiple vesicles, we curve fitted the observed fluorescence intensity profiles (Figure S2E). The fluorescence profile best fits a single source of <100 nm, confirming that the fluorescence signals we observed originated from a single post-Golgi vesicle undergoing multiple fusions (Figures S2D and S2E). Together, these results suggest that the incomplete release we observe is not a limitation of our reporter. Instead, it is consistent with a restriction in the dilation of the fusion pore similar to what is proposed for kiss-and-run fusion of regulated exocytic vesicles (Harata et al., 2006Harata N.C. Aravanis A.M. Tsien R.W. Kiss-and-run and full-collapse fusion as modes of exo-endocytosis in neurosecretion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1546-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Unlike regulated exocytic vesicles, exocytosis of post-Golgi vesicles is unaffected when extracellular Ca2+ is chelated with EGTA (Lew and Simon, 1991Lew D.J. Simon S.M. Characterization of constitutive exocytosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 123: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This indicates that Ca2+ influx is not required for post-Golgi vesicle exocytosis, but does not rule out that transient localized Ca2+ microdomains formed by the efflux from the docked post-Golgi vesicle may trigger its exocytosis. Such a mode of Ca2+ triggering has been identified for other membrane fusion reactions (Peters and Mayer, 1998Peters C. Mayer A. Ca2+/calmodulin signals the completion of docking and triggers a late step of vacuole fusion.Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we used two reagents—ionomycin to rapidly discharge vesicular Ca2+ (Williams et al., 1985Williams D.A. Fogarty K.E. Tsien R.Y. Fay F.S. Calcium gradients in single smooth muscle cells revealed by the digital imaging microscope using Fura-2.Nature. 1985; 318: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and BAPTA-AM to rapidly chelate cytosolic Ca2+ and prevent the formation of Ca2+ microdomains (Peters and Mayer, 1998Peters C. Mayer A. Ca2+/calmodulin signals the completion of docking and triggers a late step of vacuole fusion.Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Increase of Ca2+ by ionomycin triggered lysosomal exocytosis in HT1080 cells, as we have previously observed for other cells (Jaiswal et al., 2002Jaiswal J.K. Andrews N.W. Simon S.M. Membrane proximal lysosomes are the major vesicles responsible for calcium-dependent exocytosis in nonsecretory cells.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). BAPTA-AM prevents Ca2+ microdomain formation, which triggers yeast vacuole fusion (Peters and Mayer, 1998Peters C. Mayer A. Ca2+/calmodulin signals the completion of docking and triggers a late step of vacuole fusion.Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Using the Ca2+-sensitive ratiometric dye pair fura-red and fluo-3, we found that both these agents stably altered the cytosolic Ca2+ within 10 s (Figure 4A). Calcium is required for trafficking of biosynthetic cargo from ER to Golgi (Beckers and Balch, 1989Beckers C.J.M. Balch W.E. Calcium and GTP: essential components in vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and this treatment reduced the number of fluorescently labeled post-Golgi vesicles that newly appeared in the TIR field (Movie S2). Thus, assay of total cargo released from cells with altered cytosolic calcium cannot distinguish between effects of Ca2+ on vesicle exocytosis and effects on transport through the biosynthetic pathway. To resolve whether calcium affected steps after transp"

We used Affymetrix 500K genotyping data of KORA S3 cohort (n = 1,644; Southern-Germany) to address (i) SNP coverage in 160 BP candidate genes; (ii) the evidence for associations with BP traits in genome-wide and replication data, and haplotype analysis. In total, 160 gene regions (genic region+/-10 kb) covered 2,411 SNPs across 11.4 Mb. Marker densities in genes varied from 0 (n = 11) to 0.6 SNPs/kb. On average 52.5% of the HAPMAP SNPs per gene were captured. No evidence for association with BP was obtained for 1,449 tested SNPs. Considerable associations (P<10(-3)) were detected for the genes, where >50% of HAPMAP SNPs were tagged. In general, genes with higher marker density (>0.2 SNPs/kb) revealed a better chance to reach close to significance associations. Although, none of the detected P-values remained significant after Bonferroni correction (P<0.05/2319, P<2.15 x 10(-5)), the strength of some detected associations was close to this level: rs10889553 (LEPR) and systolic BP (SBP) (P = 4.5 x 10(-5)) as well as rs10954174 (LEP) and diastolic BP (DBP) (P = 5.20 x 10(-5)). In total, 12 markers in 7 genes (ADRA2A, LEP, LEPR, PTGER3, SLC2A1, SLC4A2, SLC8A1) revealed considerable association (P<10(-3)) either with SBP, DBP, and/or hypertension (HYP). None of these were confirmed in replication samples (KORA S4, HYPEST, BRIGHT). However, supportive evidence for the association of rs10889553 (LEPR) and rs11195419 (ADRA2A) with BP was obtained in meta-analysis across samples stratified either by body mass index, smoking or alcohol consumption. Haplotype analysis highlighted LEPR and PTGER3. In conclusion, the lack of associations in BP candidate genes may be attributed to inadequate marker coverage on the genome-wide arrays, small phenotypic effects of the loci and/or complex interaction with life-style and metabolic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2034036065,"Activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo and in cell culture models. Hypertrophic responses induced by pressure or volume overload are exacerbated by increased Gq activity and ameliorated by Gq inhibition. Gq activates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) subtypes, resulting in generation of the intracellular messengers inositol(1,4,5)tris-phosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which regulate intracellular Ca2+ and conventional protein kinase C subtypes, respectively. Gq can also signal independently of PLCβ, and the involvement of either Ins(1,4,5)P3 or DAG in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has not been unequivocally established. Overexpression of one splice variant of PLCβ1, specifically PLCβ1b, in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes causes increased cell size, elevated protein/ DNA ratio, and heightened expression of the hypertrophy-related marker gene, atrial natriuretic peptide. The other splice variant, PLCβ1a, had no effect. Expression of a 32-aa C-terminal PLCβ1b peptide, which competes with PLCβ1b for sarcolemmal association, prevented PLC activation and eliminated hypertrophic responses initiated by Gq or Gq-coupled α1-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, a PLCβ1a C-terminal peptide altered neither PLC activity nor cellular hypertrophy. We conclude that hypertrophic responses initiated by Gq are mediated specifically by PLCβ1b. Preventing PLCβ1b association with the sarcolemma may provide a useful therapeutic target to limit hypertrophy.—Filtz, T. M., Grubb, D. R., McLeod-Dryden, T. J., Luo, J., Woodcock, E. A.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD), procaspase-8, procaspase-10, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and Bid were also recruited into lipid rafts on resveratrol incubation with MM and T-cell leukemia cells. Raft disruption inhibited resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Bcl-XL overexpression prevented resveratrol-induced disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and apoptosis. A FADD dominant-negative mutant, that blocked Fas/CD95 downstream signaling, precluded resveratrol-induced DeltaPsi(m) loss and apoptosis, indicating a sequence of Fas/CD95 signaling-->mitochondrion in the apoptotic response triggered by resveratrol. Cells deficient in Fas/CD95 did not undergo resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of MM cells with interferon-gamma upregulated Fas/CD95 and caspase-8, and potentiated resveratrol-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that recruitment of Fas/CD95 death receptor and downstream signaling molecules into lipid rafts, followed by DeltaPsi(m) disruption, underlies the apoptotic action of resveratrol in MM and T-cell leukemic cells. Combination of resveratrol with perifosine or bortezomib potentiated the apoptotic response induced by each single drug.

https://openalex.org/W2049436043,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis with worldwide distribution caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. The leptospiral life cycle involves transmission via fresh water and colonization of the renal tubules of their reservoir hosts or infection of accidental hosts, including humans. Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs), particularly those with surface-exposed regions, play crucial roles in virulence mechanisms of pathogens and the adaptation to various environmental conditions, including those of the mammalian host. Little is known about the surface-exposed OMPs in Leptospira, particularly those with outer membrane-spanning domains. Herein, we describe a comprehensive strategy for identification and characterization of leptospiral transmembrane OMPs. The genomic sequence of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1–130 allowed us to employ the β-barrel prediction programs, PRED-TMBB and TMBETA-NET, to identify potential transmembrane OMPs. Several complementary methods were used to characterize four novel OMPs, designated OmpL36, OmpL37, OmpL47 and OmpL54. In addition to surface immunofluorescence and surface biotinylation, we describe surface proteolysis of intact leptospires as an improved method for determining the surface exposure of leptospiral proteins. Membrane integration was confirmed using techniques for removal of peripheral membrane proteins. We also demonstrate deficiencies in the Triton X-114 fractionation method for assessing the outer membrane localization of transmembrane OMPs. Our results establish a broadly applicable strategy for the elucidation of novel surface-exposed outer membrane-spanning proteins of Leptospira, an essential step in the discovery of potential virulence factors, diagnostic antigens and vaccine candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1968255867,"The highly conserved autophagy-lysosome pathway is the primary mechanism for breakdown and recycling of macromolecular and organellar cargo in the eukaryotic cell. Autophagy has recently been implicated in protection against cancer, neurodegeneration, and infection, and interest is increasing in additional roles of autophagy in human health, disease, and aging. To search for novel cytoprotective features of this pathway, we carried out a genetic mosaic screen for mutations causing increased lysosomal and/or autophagic activity in the Drosophila melanogaster larval fat body. By combining Drosophila genetics with live-cell imaging of the fluorescent dye LysoTracker Red and fixed-cell imaging of autophagy-specific fluorescent protein markers, the screen was designed to identify essential metazoan genes whose disruption causes increased flux through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The screen identified a large number of genes associated with the protein synthesis and ER-secretory pathways (e.g. aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, Oligosaccharyl transferase, Sec61alpha), and with mitochondrial function and dynamics (e.g. Rieske iron-sulfur protein, Dynamin-related protein 1). We also observed that increased lysosomal and autophagic activity were consistently associated with decreased cell size. Our work demonstrates that disruption of the synthesis, transport, folding, or glycosylation of ER-targeted proteins at any of multiple steps leads to autophagy induction.

The desensitization of mGluR signaling is mediated by both second messenger-dependent protein kinases and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Unlike mGluR1, the attenuation of mGluR5 signaling in HEK 293 cells is reported to be mediated by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. However, the mechanisms regulating mGluR5 signaling and endocytosis in neurons have not been investigated. Here we show that a 2-fold overexpression of GRK2 leads to the attenuation of endogenous mGluR5-mediated inositol phosphate (InsP) formation in striatal neurons and siRNA knockdown of GRK2 expression leads to enhanced mGluR5-mediated InsP formation. Expression of a catalytically inactive GRK2-K220R mutant also effectively attenuates mGluR5 signaling, but the expression of a GRK2-D110A mutant devoid in Gαq/11 binding increases mGluR5 signaling in response to agonist stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that the attenuation of mGluR5 responses in striatal neurons is phosphorylation-independent. In addition, we find that mGluR5 does not internalize in response to agonist treatment in striatal neuron, but is efficiently internalized in cortical neurons that have higher levels of endogenous GRK2 protein expression. When overexpressed in striatal neurons, GRK2 promotes agonist-stimulated mGluR5 internalization. Moreover, GRK2-mediated promotion of mGluR5 endocytosis does not require GRK2 catalytic activity. Thus, we provide evidence that GRK2 mediates phosphorylation-independent mGluR5 desensitization and internalization in neurons.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain and functions to activate two distinct classes of receptors (ionotropic and metabotropic) to regulate a variety of physiological functions (1.Dingledine R.

Group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are coupled to the activation of Gαq/11 proteins, which stimulate the activation of phospholipase Cβ1 resulting in diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of protein kinase C. metabotropic glutamate receptor (S)-3,5-dihydroxylphenylglycine days in vitro green fluorescent protein G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase human embryonic kidney inositol phosphate non-coding protein kinase C regulator of G protein signaling regulator of G protein signaling homology small interfering RNA phosphate-buffered saline.

GRK4 is also implicated in mediating the desensitization of mGluR1 signaling in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but does not contribute to the desensitization of mGluR5 (14.Sallese M. Salvatore L.

A role for GRK2 in promoting mGluR1 internalization is less clear as different laboratories have obtained discordant results (11.Mundell S.J. Pula G. McIlhinney R.A. Roberts P.J. Kelly E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7541-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14.Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G. Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knöpfel T. De Blasi A.

However, the only study examining the role of GRK2 in regulating mGluR1 endocytosis in a native system reported that GRK2 knockdown had no effect upon mGluR1 internalization in cerebellar Purkinje cells (14.Sallese M. Salvatore L. D'Urbano E. Sala G. Storto M. Launey T. Nicoletti F. Knöpfel T. De Blasi A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2569-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GRK2 is composed of three functional domains: an N-terminal regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology (RH) domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal Gβγ binding pleckstrin homology domain (18.Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells, mGluR1 desensitization is not dependent on GRK2 catalytic activity. Rather the GRK2 RH domain interacts with both the second intracellular loop domain of mGluR1 and the α-subunit of Gαq/11 and attenuates second messenger responses by disrupting the mGluR1/Gαq/11 signaling complexes (12.Dale L.B.

Although the molecular mechanism underlying GRK2-mediated attenuation of mGluR1 signaling is relatively well established in HEK 293 cells, the role of GRK2 in regulating the desensitization of mGluRs in neurons remains to be determined. Moreover, it is not known whether GRK2-dependent attenuation of mGluR5 signaling is mediated by the same phosphorylation-independent mechanism that has been described for mGluR1. In a previous study, GRK2-mediated mGluR5 desensitization was reported to be phosphorylation-dependent, based on the observation that the overexpression of a catalytically inactive GRK2 (K220R) did not attenuate mGluR5 signaling (15.Sorensen S.D. Conn P.J. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether a 2-fold overexpression of GRK2 in primary mouse striatal neurons to match GRK2 expression levels found in the cortex results in increased agonist-stimulated desensitization and internalization of endogenous mGluR5. We report here that GRK2 mediates phosphorylation-independent mGluR5 desensitization and internalization. Furthermore, GRK2 knockdown causes an increase in mGluR5 signaling, demonstrating that endogenous GRK2 plays a role in mGluR5 desensitization.

Mice were housed in an animal care facility at 23 °C on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. Animal care was in accordance with the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee. The mouse GRK2 cDNA used for adenovirus construction was FLAG-tagged in the N-terminal region (22.Gros R. Ding Q. Chorazyczewski J. Pickering J.G. Limbird L.E. Feldman R.D. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations (K220R and D110A) introduced to mouse GRK2 construct were created using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. cDNA encoding FLAG-tagged GRK2, GRK2-K220R, and GRK2-D110A or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used to generate adenoviral constructs (AdMax) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Microbix Biosystems, Toronto, ON). Neuronal cultures were prepared from the striatal region of E15 mouse embryo brains. Animal procedures were approved by The University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee. After dissection, either striatal or cortical tissue was submitted to trypsin digestion followed by cell dissociation using a fire-polished pasteur pipette. Cells were plated on poly-l-ornithine-coated dishes in neurobasal media supplemented with N2 and B27 supplements, 2 mm glutamax, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator and cultured for 12 days in vitro (DIV) with media replenishment every 4 days. The cultures were infected with the different adenoviruses (GFP, wild-type GRK2, GRK2-K220R, or GRK2-D110A) at DIV9 and used for experiments at DIV12. Striatal neurons seeded in 12-well plates were transfected in cultured medium using Hiperfect transfection reagent. Neurons were transfected with either non-coding (NC) or GRK2 siRNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA (20 nm final concentration) was added to 100 μl of Neurobasal medium, followed by addition of 6 μl of Hiperfect. Transfection mix was vortexed, incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature, and added to neuronal cultures. Neurons were transfected twice at DIV5 and DIV7 and used for experiments at DIV9. Both the GRK2 siRNA and NC siRNA (siGENOME control siRNA-non-targeting siRNA 1) were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The GRK2 mouse antisense oligonucleotide had the following sequence: 5′-AAGAAATATGAGAAGCTGGAG-3′ (23.Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The effect of siRNA transfection was assessed by measuring the total GRK2 protein expression by Western blotting analysis. Inositol lipids were radiolabeled by incubating the striatal neurons infected with different adenoviruses (GFP, GRK2, GRK2-K220R, or GRK2-D110A) overnight with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in Neurobasal medium. Unincorporated myo-[3H]inositol was removed by washing cells with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Cells were preincubated for 1 h in HBSS at 37 °C and then preincubated in 500 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mm LiCl for an additional 2 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated in the presence of either DHPG or carbachol for 5 min at 37 °C. Drug concentration is indicated in the figures. The reaction was stopped on ice by the addition of 500 μl of perchloric acid and then neutralized with 400 μl of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3. Total [3H]inositol incorporated into cells was determined by counting the radioactivity present in 50 μl of cell lysate. Total inositol phosphate was purified from cell extracts by anion exchange chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) 200–400 mesh anion exchange resin. [3H]Inositol phosphate formation was determined by liquid scintillation using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system (20.Dhami G.K. Anborgh P.H. Dale L.B. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol.

Striatal neurons infected with either GFP or GRK2 adenovirus were incubated at 37 °C in HBSS in the presence of 10 μm DHPG for 5 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold HBSS and solubilized in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm AEBSF and 10 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin). mGluR5 was immunoprecipitated from 500–1000 μg of total cell lysate using anti-mGluR5 antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads by 2 h rotation at 4 °C. Afterward, beads were washed one time with lysis buffer and two times with PBS, and proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer by warming the samples at 55 °C for 5 min. Eluted samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. To evaluate the effect of GRK2 overexpression on mGluR5 internalization, either cortical or striatal neurons infected with different adenoviruses (GFP, GRK2, GRK2-K220R, or GRK2-D110A) were incubated at 37 °C in HBSS in the presence of 10 μm DHPG for varying times (0, 5, or 10 min). Cells were washed with HBSS and incubated on ice. Plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin for 1 h on ice, as described previously (24.Ribeiro F.M. Pinthong M. Black S.A. Gordon A.C. Prado V.F. Prado M.A. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 3437-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To quench the biotinylation reaction, cells were washed and incubated for 30 min with cold 100 mm glycine in HBSS, followed by three washes with cold HBSS. Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.05 m EDTA, 1% nonidet P40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm AEBSF and 10 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin). Biotinylated proteins were separated from non-biotinylated proteins by Neutravidin bead pull-down from equivalent amounts of total cellular protein from each sample (100 μg per sample). Biotinylated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. To evaluate the effect of GRK2 overexpression on mGluR5 recycling, striatal neurons infected with either GFP or GRK2 adenovirus were incubated at 37 °C in HBSS in the presence of 10 μm DHPG for 10 min to stimulate internalization of plasma membrane mGluR5. Agonist was washed out, and cells were incubated in HBSS at 37 °C for 10 or 30 min to allow internalized mGluR5 to recycle to the plasma membrane. Cells were washed with HBSS and incubated on ice. Plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin, and subsequent steps were conducted as described in internalization assay section. Membranes were blocked with 10% milk in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit anti-GRK2 (1:2000), rabbit anti-mGluR5 (1:4000), rabbit anti-mGluR1 (1:1000), mouse anti-clathrin (1:1000), or rabbit anti-actin (1:10,000) antibodies in wash buffer containing 3% milk overnight. Membranes were rinsed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:10,000 in wash buffer containing 3% skim milk for 1 h. Membranes were rinsed three times with wash buffer and incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents. Whole cell phosphorylation experiments were performed as described previously (25.Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). To label the intracellular ATP pool with [32P]orthophosphate, striatal neurons infected with either GFP or GRK2 adenoviruses were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in HBSS containing [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml). Subsequently, the neurons were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm DHPG for varying times (0, 5, or 10 min). Cells were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm AEBSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were normalized to total protein content. mGluR5 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-mGluR5 antibody and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The extent of receptor phosphorylation was quantitated by densitometry of the resulting autoradiographs. Striatal neurons either uninfected or infected with FLAG-GRK2 adenovirus were washed twice in PBS and fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and preincubated with a permeabilization solution (PBS, 0.05% Triton, and 3% bovine serum albumin) for 10 min. Subsequently, rabbit anti-FLAG (1:500) and mouse anti-NeuN (1:1000) antibodies were added to cells and incubated for 1 h in permeabilization solution. Cells were washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 and Alexa Fluor 488, respectively for 40 min in permeabilization solution at 1:1000 dilution. Detection of immunolabeled proteins was performed using dual excitation (488 and 543 nm) and emission (505–530 nm for Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-FLAG antibody and GFP, and 590–610 nm for Alexa Fluor 555-labeled anti-NeuN antibody) filter sets. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63 × 1.3 NA oil immersion lens. Non-saturated, immunoreactive mGluR5 bands from both internalization and whole cell phosphorylation assays were quantified by scanning densitometry using Scion Image software. Means ± S.E. are shown for the number of independent experiments indicated in the figure legends. GraphPad Prism software was used to analyze data for statistical significance and for curve fitting. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing followed by post-hoc multiple comparison testing. Because the role of GRK2 in regulating Group I mGluR desensitization and internalization in neurons has not been investigated, we first examined which neuronal culture preparation represented the most appropriate model to study GRK2-dependent regulation of endogenous mGluR5 signaling. Primary striatal neurons obtained from E15 mouse embryos cultured 12 days in vitro expressed high levels of mGluR5 protein, whereas cortical neurons cultured under the same conditions expressed lower levels of mGluR5, but also expressed mGluR1 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, mGluR1 protein expression was not detected in striatal cultures (Fig. 1A). GRK2 protein expression levels were also ∼2-fold higher in the cortical neuronal cultures as compared with the striatal neuronal cultures (Fig. 1A). To determine whether anti-mGluR5 antibody was specific to mGluR5 protein, we compared whole cell lysates obtained from the cerebellum and cortex of either wild-type or mGluR5−/− mice. Anti-mGluR5 antibody detected a 130-kDa band only in wild-type striatal lysate (Fig. 1B). No band was detected in the cerebellum, which does not express mGluR5, or in the striatum of mGluR5−/− lysates (Fig. 1B). DHPG, a specific group I mGluR agonist, promoted a dose-dependent increase in InsP formation in striatal neuronal cultures, demonstrating the expected signaling function of endogenous group I mGluRs (Fig. 1C). Based on the results from the dose response curve, in all subsequent experiments either 1 or 10 μm DHPG were used. The specificity of the group I mGluR-mediated InsP formation in striatal neurons was further established by the pretreatment of cells with specific mGluR5 (10 μm MPEP) and mGluR1 (100 μm LY367385) antagonists. The pretreatment of cells with MPEP reduced DHPG-stimulated InsP formation to 15.5 ± 1.3% of control and LY367385 pretreatment had no effect on DHPG-stimulated InsP formation (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicated that mGluR5 was the primary group I mGluR expressed and activated by DHPG in embryonic-derived striatal cultures. Consequently, in all subsequent experimentation striatal neurons were used to examine GRK2-mediated regulation of mGluR5 desensitization. GRK2 protein expression in cortical neurons (which express mGluR5) was 2-fold higher than that of striatal neurons (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we tested whether a physiologically similar 2-fold increase in GRK2 expression would result in attenuated mGluR5 signaling in striatal neurons. GRK2 was overexpressed in neurons using a FLAG epitope-tagged GRK2 adenovirus. To determine whether the FLAG-GRK2 adenovirus efficiently infected neurons, we immunolabeled striatal neuronal cultures with both an antibody that recognizes the FLAG epitope tag and an antibody directed against the neuron-specific marker NeuN (neuronal nuclei) (26.Wolf H.K.

We found that the FLAG-GRK2 adenoviral construct was able to effectively infect striatal neurons as the NeuN-positive neurons also exhibited FLAG-positive labeling (Fig. 2). Infection of striatal neurons with a GRK2 adenovirus increased GRK2 expression to 193 ± 7% of control neurons infected with GFP adenovirus (Fig. 3A). Neurons infected with either GRK2- or GFP adenovirus were submitted to InsP formation assay and stimulated with DHPG for 5 min. GRK2 overexpression resulted in a significant attenuation of InsP formation in striatal neurons following stimulation with either 1 or 10 μm DHPG (Fig. 3B). Because the expression of mGluR5 was not altered by the moderate overexpression of GRK2 (Fig. 3A), the observed decrease in DHPG-stimulated InsP formation was the result of GRK2-mediated attenuation of mGluR5 responsiveness. To further establish the role of endogenously expressed GRK2 on mGluR5 desensitization, GRK2 siRNA was used to knockdown GRK2 protein expression in striatal neurons. Transfection of GRK2 siRNA into striatal neurons decreased GRK2 protein expression to 37 ± 9% of that in control neurons transfected with non-coding (NC) siRNA (Fig. 3C). siRNA transfection did not alter mGluR5 expression (Fig. 3C), but siRNA-mediated GRK2 knockdown led to an increase in DHPG-stimulated InsP formation (Fig. 3D). Thus, providing evidence that endogenously expressed GRK2 regulates mGluR5 activity in striatal neurons. A 2-fold increase in GRK2 expression was not sufficient to promote muscarinic receptor desensitization, as InsP formation stimulated by carbachol was not different between neurons infected with GFP or GRK2 adenovirus (Fig. 3E). However, it is possible that higher levels of GRK2 expression might lead to muscarinic receptor desensitization. Taken together, these data indicate that at the level of GRK2 expression tested mGluR5 but not muscarinic receptor signaling was desensitized by GRK2.FIGURE 3A, shown are representative immunoblots for mGluR5, GRK2, and actin protein expression in neurons infected with either GFP or GRK2 adenovirus. 50 μg of cell lysate were used for each sample.

Cutaneous melanomas, particularly the desmoplastic subtype, are highly neurotropic; thus we sought to determine the frequency of RETp in cutaneous melanoma and its functional responsiveness to GDNF. RETp was assessed in 71 non-desmoplastic cutaneous melanomas (non-DMs) and 70 desmoplastic melanomas (DMs). Melanoma cell lines with RETp, RET wild type (RETwt), BRAF V600E mutation (BRAFmt) or BRAF wild type (BRAFwt) were assessed for functional activity. RETp frequency was significantly higher in DMs (61%) than in non-DMs (31%, P<0.001). BRAFmt was detected in only 11% of DMs. GDNF stimulation significantly amplified cell proliferation, migration and invasion in RETp, but not in RETwt melanoma cells. GDNF stimulation of RETp cell lines enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt of the RET-RAS-RAF-ERK and RET-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways, respectively. GDNF response of RETp cells in signal transduction and other functional studies were not affected by BRAFmt. The study demonstrates that RETp is frequently found in cutaneous melanoma, particularly desmoplastic subtypes, and responds to GDNF inducing events favorable for tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2004922235,"During hibernation there is a slowing of all metabolic processes, and thus it is normally considered to be incompatible with reproduction. In Tasmania the egg-laying mammal, the echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) hibernates for several months before mating in mid-winter, and in previous studies we observed males with females that were still hibernating. We monitored the reproductive activity of radio-tracked echidnas by swabbing the reproductive tract for sperm while external temperature loggers provided information on the timing of hibernation. Additional information was provided by camera traps and ultrasound imaging. More than a third of the females found in mating groups were torpid, and the majority of these had mated. Some females re-entered deep torpor for extended periods after mating. Ultrasound examination showed a developing egg in the uterus of a female that had repeatedly re-entered torpor. The presence of fresh sperm in cloacal swabs taken from this female on three occasions after her presumed date of fertilization indicated she mated several times after being fertilized. The mating of males with torpid females is the result of extreme competition between promiscuous males, while re-entry into hibernation by pregnant females could improve the possibility of mating with a better quality male."
https://openalex.org/W2158610445,"Extracellular acidification by osteoclasts is essential to bone resorption. During proton pumping, intracellular pH (pH(i)) is thought to be kept at a near-neutral level by chloride/bicarbonate exchange. Here we show that the Na(+)-independent chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger 2 (Ae2) is relevant for this process in the osteoclasts from the long bones of Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice (deficient in the main isoforms Ae2a, Ae2b(1), and Ae2b(2)). Although the long bones of these mice had normal numbers of multinucleated osteoclasts, these cells lacked a ruffled border and displayed impaired bone resorption activity, resulting in an osteopetrotic phenotype of long bones. Moreover, in vitro osteoclastogenesis assays using long-bone marrow cells from Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice suggested a role for Ae2 in osteoclast formation, as fusion of preosteoclasts for the generation of active multinucleated osteoclasts was found to be slightly delayed. In contrast to the abnormalities observed in the long bones, the skull of Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice showed no alterations, indicating that calvaria osteoclasts may display normal resorptive activity. Microfluorimetric analysis of osteoclasts from normal mice showed that, in addition to Ae2 activity, calvaria osteoclasts--but not long-bone osteoclasts--possess a sodium-dependent bicarbonate transporting activity. Possibly, this might compensate for the absence of Ae2 in calvaria osteoclasts of Ae2(a,b)(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2042151581,"Adaptation to tumor hypoxia is mediated in large part by changes in protein expression. These are driven by multiple pathways, including activation of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor and the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK, a component of the unfolded protein response. Through gene expression profiling we discovered that induction of the HIF-1 target gene CA9 was defective in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from mice harboring an eIF2alpha S51A knock-in mutation. This finding was confirmed in two isogenic human cell lines with an engineered defect in eIF2alpha phosphorylation. We show that impaired CA9 expression was not due to changes in HIF activity or CA9 mRNA stability. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we show that the eIF2alpha-dependent translationally regulated gene ATF4 binds directly to the CA9 promoter and is associated with loss of the transcriptional repressive histone 3 lysine 27 tri-methylation mark. Loss or overexpression of ATF4 confirmed its role in CA9 induction during hypoxia. Our data indicate that expression of CA9 is regulated through both the HIF-1 and unfolded protein response hypoxia response pathways in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2035866342,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are negative regulators of cytokine-induced signal transduction, which play multiple roles in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. In this study, the regulatory role of SOCS in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was investigated. In Jurkat T cells and mouse splenocytes, we have found that SOCS1 is induced in response to tumor necrosis factor-α or H2O2, concomitant with the activation of Jaks which act as important mediators of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis upstream of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Using SOCS1 overexpressing or knockdown Jurkat T-cell systems we clearly demonstrate that, SOCS1 inhibits the ROS-mediated apoptosis. The antiapoptotic action of SOCS1 was exerted not only by suppressing Jaks, but also by sustaining protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities. Notably, SOCS1-transduced cells displayed increase in thioredoxin levels and decrease in ROS generation induced by oxidative stress. In addition, the Jak-inhibiting and PTP-sustaining effect of SOCS1 was significantly reduced on thioredoxin ablation. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation data revealed molecular interaction of SHP1 or CD45 with thioredoxin, which was promoted in SOCS1-transfected cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that both the protection of PTPs by thioredoxin from ROS attack and the attenuation of Jaks account for the antiapoptotic function of SOCS1 in immune cells under oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2136906683,"Methanogens are a phylogenetically diverse group belonging to Euryarchaeota. Previously, phylogenetic approaches using large datasets revealed that methanogens can be grouped into two classes, ""Class I"" and ""Class II"". However, some deep relationships were not resolved. For instance, the monophyly of ""Class I"" methanogens, which consist of Methanopyrales, Methanobacteriales and Methanococcales, is disputable due to weak statistical support. In this study, we use MSOAR to identify common orthologous genes from eight methanogen species and a Thermococcale species (outgroup), and apply GRAPPA and FastME to compute distance-based gene order phylogeny. The gene order phylogeny supports two classes of methanogens, but it differs from the original classification of methanogens by placing Methanopyrales and Methanobacteriales together with Methanosarcinales in Class II rather than with Methanococcales. This study suggests a new classification scheme for methanogens. In addition, it indicates that gene order phylogeny can complement traditional sequence-based methods in addressing taxonomic questions for deep relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1983854089,"BAX is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family. At the onset of apoptosis, monomeric, cytoplasmic BAX is activated and translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it forms an oligomeric pore. The chemical mechanism of BAX activation is controversial, and several in vitro and in vivo methods of its activation are known. One of the most commonly used in vitro methods is activation with detergents, such as n-octyl glucoside. During BAX activation with n-octyl glucoside, it has been shown that BAX forms high molecular weight complexes that are larger than the combined molecular weight of BAX monomer and one detergent micelle. These large complexes have been ascribed to the oligomerization of BAX prior to its membrane insertion and pore formation. This is in contrast to the in vivo studies that suggest that active BAX inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane as a monomer and then undergoes oligomerization. Here, to simultaneously determine the molecular weight and the number of BAX proteins per BAX-detergent micelle during detergent activation, we have used an approach that combines two single-molecule sensitivity technique, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and fluorescence-intensity distribution analysis. We have tested a range of detergents as follows: n-octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside, Triton X-100, Tween 20, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, and cholic acid. With these detergents we observe that BAX is a monomer before, during, and after interaction with micelles.

In a simplified apoptosis model, monomeric inactive BAX is localized in the cytoplasm of healthy nondying cells (1.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). During apoptosis BAX is activated and translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane (2.Wolter K.G.

Once in the cytoplasm, these apoptotic factors induce the activation of the effector caspases that execute the cell death process. This mechanism, which is generally correct, requires that soluble BAX becomes integrated into the mitochondrial membrane where it forms a functional oligomeric pore capable of cytochrome c release. However, the molecular mechanism of BAX activation remains controversial (5.Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S. Manon S. Bechinger B. Vallette F.M.

It has been understood for some time, but frequently ignored, that activity of the BCL-2 family proteins is exhibited in cells when these proteins are associated with the hydrophobic environment of membranes. Therefore, it has always seemed that attention to the effect of hydrophobic environments on the BCL-2 family proteins would be rewarding. It has been shown that BAX can be directly activated by treatment with nonionic detergents such as n-octyl glucoside, dodecyl maltoside, and Triton X-100 (1.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 7.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). During activation by nonionic detergents, to gain the ability to form pores in a bilayer membrane, BAX needs to undergo a major conformational transition from a globular protein with two pore-forming α-helices 5 and 6 hidden in the protein core (8.Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) to a conformation in which these two helices are exposed and inserted into a lipid membrane (3.Annis M.G. Soucie E.L. Dlugosz P.J. Cruz-Aguado J.A. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 5.Lalier L. Cartron P.F. Juin P. Nedelkina S.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10930-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The nature of this active conformation of BAX is important for the understanding of the death decision in cells. Most proposals suggest that in a cell this activated form of BAX protein is initiated and maintained by the interactions with other proteins, such as tBID, or by BAX itself as a homo-oligomer (7.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 10.Lovell J.F. Billen L.P. Bindner S. Shamas-Din A. Fradin C. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Cell. 2008; 135: 1074-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Nonionic detergents have been commonly used to activate BAX for in vitro studies because they are reliably effective and simple to employ. However, little is known about the detailed molecular mechanism of BAX activation by these detergents and its comparability with in vivo activation of BAX. What is known is that concentrations of detergent above their critical micelle concentration (CMC) are necessary for BAX activation. This suggests that, to be activated, BAX needs to interact with detergent micelles instead of monomeric detergent molecules. For example, in the case of BAX activation by n-octyl glucoside, it has been shown that n-octyl glucoside concentration should be 1% (w/v) (7.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), which is well above the CMC for this detergent (0.6% w/v) (11.le Maire M. Champeil P. Moller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 86-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been shown that above their individual CMC concentrations most BAX-activating detergents produce a change in BAX conformation that can be detected by a conformation-sensitive 6A7 antibody against BAX (1.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 12.Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In cellular experiments this feature of BAX reactivity to 6A7 antibody is commonly associated with the onset of apoptosis (14.Dewson G. Snowden R.T. Almond J.B. Dyer M.J. Cohen G.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15.Hou Q. Hsu Y.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H477-H487Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, CHAPS does not generate the antibody-detected conformational change or the activation of BAX. The small micelle size of this detergent (10 kDa) suggests that perhaps BAX cannot adopt an activated state with this detergent. However, cholic acid with even smaller micelle size (4 kDa) can partially activate BAX (1.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Many important detergent properties are associated with micelles. The formation of detergent micelles in solution is concentration-dependent beginning at the CMC. The CMC value for a detergent has practical importance because in most cases only monomers of detergent can be removed by dialysis, and therefore, it is easier to remove detergent monomers for a detergent with high CMC value than for a detergent with low CMC (11.le Maire M. Champeil P. Moller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 86-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). For BAX this same consideration applies to its activation with n-octyl glucoside (CMC ∼23 mm) as compared with its activation with Triton X-100 (CMC ∼0.25 mm). The ease of dialysis is why, in most cases, OG is used to activate BAX in vitro. It has been shown by analytical gel filtration that, when incubated with n-octyl glucoside, BAX creates complexes with molecular weight larger than the combined size of a BAX monomer (21 kDa) and an n-octyl glucoside micelle (∼26 kDa) (7.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 11.le Maire M. Champeil P. Moller J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 86-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that in defined liposomes BAX pore formation requires oligomerization (16.Saito M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schlesinger P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These data combined with the knowledge that oligomerization is important for the biological function of BAX led to a hypothesis that BAX oligomerizes during its detergent activation prior to membrane insertion (7.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that in vivo activated BAX inserts into the outer mitochondrial membrane as a monomer (3.Annis M.G. Soucie E.L. Dlugosz P.J. Cruz-Aguado J.A. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and to create a pore, BAX undergoes oligomerization in this membrane (4.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This discrepancy between the oligomeric state of active BAX prior to its insertion into a lipid membrane in vivo (monomer) and in vitro (possibly hexamer or octamer) led us to study the oligomerization state of BAX in detergent micelles. The important issue is whether BAX activation requires protein oligomerization or whether active BAX conformation can be generated from a single protein monomer. To solve this issue we used two single-molecule sensitivity techniques: fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (17.Haustein E. Schwille P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and fluorescence-intensity distribution analysis (FIDA) (18.Kask P. Palo K. Ullmann D. Gall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13756-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Combined use of FCS and FIDA allows simultaneous determination of the apparent molecular weight and the number of fluorescently labeled BAX monomers per protein-detergent micelle. Our results are consistent with previously established results in which BAX forms high molecular weight protein-detergent micelles with n-octyl glucoside (4.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and show that BAX is present as a monomer in these complexes. In addition, we determined the apparent molecular weight and the number of BAX proteins bound per protein-detergent micelles formed by BAX and micelles of five additional detergents (dodecyl maltoside, Triton X-100, Tween 20, cholic acid, and CHAPS). Our data show that BAX is a monomer before, during, and after interaction with the micelles of all tested detergents. All chemicals used in this paper were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. All lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Fluorescent dyes for protein labeling were purchased from Molecular Probes. The cDNA for human BAX with 19-amino acid truncation on the C terminus (BAXΔC) was fused to the C-terminal intein/chitin-binding domain of the pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs) (8.Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Three mutations (G40C, C62A, and C126A) were introduced into each of the DNA plasmids using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing. The resulting construct and purified protein were dubbed as BAXΔC(G40C). All proteins (human BAXΔC and human BAXΔC(G40C)) were purified from BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells without detergent. Briefly, bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth (19.Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Focus. 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar) to an A600 of 1.5–2.0, and then the cultures were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Research Products International. Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL), and the temperature was dropped to 25 °C. After 12–15 h, bacteria were collected via centrifugation; the resulting pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cells were broken by four passages through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics) at 1000 bar. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing BAX was incubated with chitin affinity resin (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C on a rocker. Resin was subjected to a high salt wash and then equilibrated in cleavage buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 48 h at 4 °C. The purity of the proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE. BAXΔC(G40C) was labeled with Bodipy FL c5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled protein was separated from the free dye using a Sephadex G-25 column. The degree of protein labeling was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (for protein concentration) and 504 nm (for Bodipy FL concentration). Resulting protein was ∼ 80% labeled and was stored in EB buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl) at 4 °C. Prior to FCS studies and cytochrome c and carboxyfluorescein release experiments, fluorescently labeled BAXΔC(G40C) or BAXΔC (20–30 μm) was incubated with 2% (w/v) of the indicated detergent in EB buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. For FCS studies of the fluor-BAXΔC in detergent micelles, after incubation with detergent, protein was diluted to a concentration below 0.5 μm in a solution containing the same detergent concentration as the activated protein. This dilution was done to ensure that the fluorescent signal emitted by the protein sample is within the dynamic range of the detector in the ConFocor 3 (Zeiss, Germany). To remove detergent micelles for the cytochrome c release and for the FCS studies of post-micelle-activated fluor-BAXΔC, the BAX/detergent mixture was diluted below the CMC of each particular detergent. The disappearance of micelles occurred at different rates (<1 min for OG and longer but <60 min for Triton X-100) but was allowed to finish before further studies on the sample (cytochrome c release or FCS) proceeded. Mitochondria from HeLa cells were isolated using a previously published procedure (20.Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 200 mm sucrose. For the cytochrome c release assay isolated mitochondria were incubated with 100 nm of protein that was detergent-activated but micelle-diluted as described above or inactive protein at 37 °C for 20 min. After the incubation with BAX protein or detergent control solutions, mitochondria were spun down at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then pellet and supernatant fractions were collected and stored at −20 °C. For the cytochrome c release assay we used 0.5 μg of mitochondria in a 30-μl volume. Protein concentration in the preparation of isolated mitochondria was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cytochrome c content in the pellet and supernatant fractions was determined using TiterZyme EAI human cytochrome c enzyme immunometric assay kit (Assay Designs) in combination with Synergy HT plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). These studies were done using Biacore X instrument (GE Healthcare) at an ambient temperature of 25 °C. Liposomes with lipid composition of DOPC:DOPA:bovine heart cardiolipin (70:20:10 mol %) were prepared using the reverse-phase evaporation method (21.Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar) following the procedure described in detail in Ref. 22.Christenson E. Merlin S. Saito M. Schlesinger P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1168-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. The buffer was EB unless otherwise noted. The rest of the experimental conditions, experimental protocol, and data analysis were the same as described previously (22.Christenson E. Merlin S. Saito M. Schlesinger P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1168-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration experiments were performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. In the corresponding samples, 2% (w/v) of the indicated detergent was included in the equilibration buffer. Prior to loading the sample on the column, 2.5 nmol of BAXΔC(G40C) were incubated in 2% (w/v) of the corresponding detergent for 1 h at 4 °C. Then samples were loaded into the column and run at 0.5 ml/min. BAXΔC(G40C) elution was detected by light absorption at 280 nm. Liposomes containing 50 mm carboxyfluorescein (CF) were prepared following the procedure described previously (22.Christenson E. Merlin S. Saito M. Schlesinger P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1168-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Incubation with detergent protein was diluted into wells in a black bottom 96-well plate (NUNC, Denmark) using EB buffer. Liposomes (200 nm in diameter, DOPC:DOPA, 70:30 mol %) were added to the wells last. Immediately upon addition of liposomes, measurement of CF fluorescence was done using a Synergy HT plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). CF releases for all protein samples containing detergent were corrected for the base-line CF release in the presence of detergents without protein. Data were analyzed in Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp.). Samples for CD spectroscopy were prepared at 5 μm protein concentration in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Detergents (n-octyl glucoside (2% w/v), dodecyl maltoside (0.6% w/v), Triton X-100 (0.08%), Tween 20 (0.04% w/v), cholic acid (2% w/v)) were added to protein samples 1 h prior to measurements and stored at 4 °C. Samples were measured at 20 °C on Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length cell. Data were collected every 0.1 nm at 50 nm/min scan speed from 260 to 200 nm, and results were averaged from five scans. Because of high CD signal from Triton X-100 at 200 nm for samples containing this detergent, data were collected from 240 to 205 nm. Spectra for all protein samples containing detergent were corrected for the base line of detergents in the absence of protein. LSM 510 ConFocor 3 system coupled with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) was used for FCS and FIDA experiments. A water immersion C-Apochromat ×40 objective (Zeiss, Germany) focused the excitation light to a diffraction-limited spot. The pinhole size was set to 70 μm for 488 nm excitation laser light. The excitation light of a 25-milliwatt 488 nm argon laser was set at 1% of the acousto-optical tunable transmission. Laser power in the sample was 7 microwatts. In front of the detector LP 530-nm filter was used. For the FCS and FIDA analyses, each sample was measured at least nine times for 50 s. The detection volume was previously calibrated with free Bodipy FL maleimide in solution (diffusion time 22.6 ± 0.5 μs, structure parameter 5.0 ± 0.4). FCS measurements provide three characteristic parameters for interpretation as follows: τD, diffusion time of a fluorescent particle (i.e. the average time a particle spends in the detection volume); N, number of fluorescent particles in the detection volume, and the counts/particle (cpp) or the average fluorescent intensity per particle. These parameters are extracted by performing a fit of FCS auto-correlation data to one component diffusion model as shown in Equation 1, which takes into account photophysical dynamics of fluorophores, Gτ=1N⋅1+Texp−τ/τT1−T⋅1+ττD−1⋅11+τ/ω2τD(Eq. 1) In this equation G(τ) is the auto-correlation function; τ is the lag time; T is the fraction of molecules in the triplet state; τT triplet decay time; ω is the structure parameter (aspect ratio) of the Gaussian detection volume. Fitting of the FCS auto-correlation curves was done using Equation 1 with software written in MATLAB (Mathworks) using a weighted nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. For a particle in solution the diffusion time is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient as shown in Equation 2, τD=ω24D(Eq. 2) In general, protein molecules diffusing in solution are assumed to approximate a spherical shape permitting the Einstein-Stokes relationship to be used in evaluating the diffusion constant as shown in Equation 3, D=kBT6πηR(Eq. 3) where, kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is temperature in degrees Kelvin; η is viscosity of solution in which particle is diffusing, and R is the radius of the spherical particle. The radius of diffusing particle depends on the molecular weight of the particle (R ∝ (MW)). Under these conditions a relationship can be established between the FCS diffusion time of a particle and its molecular weight as shown in Equations 4 and 5. τD=ω24⋅6πηkBT⋅R(Eq. 4) τD∞ω24⋅6πηkBT⋅MW1/3(Eq. 5) In the case of BAXΔC, we know diffusion time of a BAXΔC monomer, τD,monomer, and its molecular weight, MWmonomer = 19 kDa. We also know the diffusion time of BAXΔC protein-detergent micelle, τD,oligomer. Using Equation 5 we can determine the apparent molecular weight of the BAXΔC protein-detergent micelle as shown in Equation 6. MWoligomer=MWmonmerτD,oligomerτD,monomer3(Eq. 6) FCCS employing BAX labeled with dyes having nonoverlapping fluorescence spectra and a two-channel collection of data was used to determine the presence or absence of BAX homo-oligomers in detergent micelles (23.Rika J. Binkert T. Phys. Rev. A. 1989; 39: 2646-2652Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24.Schwille P. Meyer-Almes F.J. Rigler R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1878-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using Bodipy FL maleimide-BAXΔC and Bodipy 630/650 maleimide-BAXΔC, we studied cross-correlation in micelle-associated protein. The cross-correlation value, a ratio of the number of the fluorescent complexes containing both proteins of interest to the number of the fluorescent species of one of the proteins, was used to estimate the micelles with more than one BAX molecule. As a positive control and as a calibration sample, the 21-bp-long double-stranded RNA labeled with AlexaFluor 488 and Cy5 on each 3′-end was used (25.Ohrt T. Merkle D. Birkenfeld K. Echeverri C.J. Schwille P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Analysis of the fluorescence brightness of a particle can provide an additional measure of the number of fluorescent proteins associated with a detergent micelle. The particle fluorescence brightness determined by FIDA is extracted by fitting the distribution of the number of photon counts and is similar to the cpp value determined by FCS for a monodisperse fluorophore solution. Determination of the particle brightness of the BAX-detergent micelle and comparison with particle brightness of monomeric BAX molecules estimate the number of BAX molecules in detergent micelles. FIDA was performed according to Kask et al. (18.Kask P. Palo K. Ullmann D. Gall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13756-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The raw data of photon arrival times was binned to 20 μs, and photon counting histograms were constructed. Parameters describing the detection volume were determined in a solution of fluor-BAXΔC in the absence of detergent. As indicated, histograms were fitted to model functions for one or two components, as described in Kask et al. (18.Kask P. Palo K. Ullmann D. Gall K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13756-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) subtracting a background of 310 Hz for the buffer solution. For the FCS and FIDA experiments, we prepared recombinant, fluorescently labeled human BAXΔC containing a fluorophore at a single cysteine residue (Fig. 1, A and B). Human BAXΔC contains two indigenous cysteines (Cys-62 and Cys-126), which we considered inappropriate for fluorophore conjugation due to structural and functional reasons (8.Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Previously full-length BAX with G40C, C62A, and C126A mutations has been reported to be functional in vivo (3.Annis M.G. Soucie E.L. Dlugosz P.J. Cruz-Aguado J.A. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, we removed cysteines, Cys-62 and Cys-126, by mutation to alanine and added an additional cysteine residue in place of glycine 40 creating BAXΔC(G40C) (Fig. 1A). BAXΔC(G40C) labeled with Bodipy FL maleimide fluorophore became fluor-BAXΔC. To check the biological activity of the fluor-BAXΔC protein, we studied its ability to release cytochrome c using mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Our results show that fluor-BAXΔC activated with 2% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside releases cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria similar to BAXΔC but with slightly lower efficiency. For both proteins significant cytochrome c release required detergent activation, suggesting that the detergent activation of fluor-BAXΔC was comparable with the detergent activation of the BAXΔC (7.Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 12.Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leb"
https://openalex.org/W1988365284,"Nestin is the characteristic intermediate filament (IF) protein of rapidly proliferating progenitor cells and regenerating tissue. Nestin copolymerizes with class III IF-proteins, mostly vimentin, into heteromeric filaments. Its expression is downregulated with differentiation. Here we show that a strong nestin expression in mouse embryo tissue coincides with a strong accumulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a key regulator of growth and differentiation in embryonic development. Microscopic studies on cultured cells show an association of GR with IFs composed of vimentin and nestin. Cells lacking nestin, but expressing vimentin, or cells expressing vimentin, but lacking nestin accumulate GR in the nucleus. Completing these networks with an exogenous nestin, respectively an exogenous vimentin restores cytoplasmic anchoring of GR to the IF system. Thus, heteromeric filaments provide the basis for anchoring of GR. The reaction pattern with phospho-GR specific antibodies and the presence of the chaperone HSC70 suggest that specifically the unliganded receptor is anchored to the IF system. Ligand addition releases GR from IFs and shifts the receptor into the nucleus. Suppression of nestin by specific shRNA abolishes anchoring of GR, induces its accumulation in the nucleus and provokes an irreversible G1/S cell cycle arrest. Suppression of GR prior to that of nestin prevents entry into the arrest. The data give evidence that nestin/vimentin specific anchoring modulates growth suppression by GR. We hypothesize that expression of nestin is a major determinant in suppression of anti-proliferative activity of GR in undifferentiated tissue and facilitates activation of this growth control in a precise tissue and differentiation dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2023651881,"The circadian clock facilitates a temporal coordination of most homeostatic activities and their synchronization with the environmental cycles of day and night. The core oscillating activity of the circadian clock is formed by a heterodimer of the transcription factors CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC). Post-translational regulation of CLK/CYC has previously been shown to be crucial for clock function and accurate timing of circadian transcription. Here we report that a sequential and compartment-specific phosphorylation of the Drosophila CLK protein assigns specific localization and activity patterns. Total and nuclear amounts of CLK protein were found to oscillate over the course of a day in circadian neurons. Detailed analysis of the cellular distribution and phosphorylation of CLK revealed that newly synthesized CLK is hypophosphorylated in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear import. In the nucleus, CLK is converted into an intermediate phosphorylation state that correlates with trans-activation of circadian transcription. Hyperphosphorylation and degradation are promoted by nuclear export of the CLK protein.

Transcript levels of Clk reveal robust circadian oscillations in Drosophila, due to rhythmic binding of the activator PAR-DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 and the repressor VRILLE to V/P-elements in the Clk-promoter (12.Cyran S.A.

Rhythmic Clk transcription appears however not essential for self-sustained molecular oscillations, because expression of CLK from a per-promoter in anti-phase to its endogenous rhythm was found to support normal clock function (15.Kim E.Y.

The post-translational regulation of CLK/CYC is however crucial for constitution of a circadian oscillator. Two CLK/CYC-activated genes period (per) and timeless (tim) feed back onto CLK/CYC activity, by binding and inhibition of CLK/CYC (16.Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N.

Activation of CLK/CYC is affected by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and mitogen-activated protein kinase, which both phosphorylate CLK in vitro (26.Weber F. Hung H.C. Maurer C. Kay S.A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CLK may also control recruitment of the transcription co-activator CREB-binding protein to the CLK/CYC complex, which is essential for trans-activation by CLK/CYC (27.Hung H.C.

Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a fundamental role of post-translational modifications for the temporal regulation of CLK/CYC-dependent transcription. Here we show that sequential and compartment-specific phosphorylation controls the life cycle of the CLK protein. Newly synthesized CLK accumulates in the cytoplasm in a hypophosphorylated state. Subsequent nuclear translocation converts the CLK protein into an intermediately phosphorylated form. Interestingly, we found that CLK is stored in subnuclear compartments, and homogeneously distributed CLK protein represents a transcriptionally active species. Hyperphosphorylation as well as degradation of CLK are promoted by nuclear export of the transcription factor. The data reveal specific localization and activity patterns for the phosphorylation states of the CLK protein that oscillate over the course of a day (29.Lee C. Bae K. Edery I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 857-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). CLK proteins were expressed from a pAc5.1/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) either without any tag (pAc-Clk) for Western blot analysis and transcription activation assays as described in a previous study (26.Weber F.

Mutations and deletions were inserted into these constructs with the QuikChange II XL system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions by the manufacturer and using the following primers: CLKNLS (substitution of Pro-484 to Leu, Lys-485 to Glu, and Lys-487 to Glu; fwd, CCA CAG GAA TAT CGC TCG AGG CCG AAC GAA AGT GC; rev, GCA CTT TCG TTC GGC CTC GAG CGA TAT TCC TGT GG), CLKΔNES (deletion of 25 amino acids from Gln-836 to Leu-860; fwd, GGC TCG CAA TCC ACC ATT AAT C; rev, TTG TTG CAG CTG CAA CTG TTG CTG). A 25tag-CLKΔNES construct carries an N- terminal 25-amino acid tag (MDYKDDDDKDYKDDDDKDYPRYFQS) that compensates for the change in protein size caused by the NES deletion. For cellular localization studies, DsRed-CLK constructs were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells or S2R+ cells as specified in the figure legends after transient transfection with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. 5 × 105 cells were transfected with 1 or 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectin, as described previously (16.Darlington T.K.

Cells were cultured in poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated cover slide chambers (Nalgene, Rochester, NY). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) fluorescence microscope or a Nikon C1Si-CLEM confocal microscope (Fig. 6) after staining of nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). At least 60 transfected cells from at least two independent experiments were analyzed per construct. Images were collected with a laser wavelength of 563 nm for DsRed-CLK and 352 nm for Hoechst 33342-stained nuclei. Third instar larvae were raised and collected at time points as indicated in the figure in cycles of 12-h light and 12-h darkness. Larvae were dissected and brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm magnesium sulfate) for 2 h, blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PT buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.3% Triton X-100) for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in 50 μl of primary antiserum solution containing 1:500-diluted rabbit anti-CLK (27.Hung H.C.

The rabbit anti-CLK antibody was incubated with ClkJrk protein extract to remove unspecific interactions prior to the application in immunohistochemistry. Brains were rinsed with PT buffer and PT buffer plus 5% NGS for 20 min each and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h in secondary antiserum solution containing 1:200-diluted TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) and 1:200-diluted Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PT buffer with 10% NGS. After incubation, brains were rinsed with PT buffer and PT buffer plus 5% NGS for 20 min each and mounted in the mounting medium (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 90% glycerol, 2.5% DABCO (Sigma)). Optical sections of larval lateral neurons (LNs) were imaged on a Nikon C1Si-CLEM confocal microscope. For each Zeitgeber Time (ZT), LNs from at least 10 brain hemispheres were scanned. For each LN sample, PAP staining was used to identify and select an optical section, which was then scanned for CLK immunoreactivity. A 0.31-μm Z-stack of images was taken per LN with single laser at 488 nm, 543 nm, and with both lasers together. Images were imported to NIH ImageJ 1.34S, and the localization of neuronal PAP and CLK staining was determined. Total pixel intensity of CLK staining was measured for the whole cell or nucleus only and the means ± S.E. from all brains at a particular ZT are reported in the graphs. Transcriptional activation assays in Drosophila S2 and S2R+ cells were performed as described previously (16.Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.D. Weitz C.J.

In brief, cells from 500 μl of culture (106 cells/ml) were transfected after 12-h incubation at 25 °C with 200 μl of serum-free Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) containing 1.5% Lipofectin (Invitrogen), 25 ng of pRLcopia, 10 ng of pGL3-(4-per-E-box)hs::luc+, 200 ng of pHT control vector, and 0.25 ng of pAc-Clk construct. Identical controls were performed for each condition without pAc-Clk. 200 μl of 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in Schneider's insect medium was added 4–6 h after transfection. After 40–48 h luciferase activities were determined using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized toward Renilla luciferase activity to control for transfection efficiency and lysate concentration (16.Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F.

Flies, 1–7 days old, were harvested in LD 2 h after lights were on (ZT 2), and 2 h after lights were off (ZT 14). 400–500 μl of fly heads were subjected to subcellular fractionation according to a protocol that was adapted from a previous study (32.Luo C. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fly heads were gently homogenized in liquid nitrogen and transferred to 800 μl of buffer A (1 m sorbitol, 7% Ficoll, 20% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Coarse debris was filtered by passing the homogenate through a nylon mesh. Subsequently, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and the mixture was passed through a 20-gauge needle. 1200 μl of ice-cold buffer B (10% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) were added during gentle mixing. The mixture was carefully added on top of 300 μl of buffer AB (at a ratio of 1:1.7) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 3 min. 120 μl of the supernatant was collected as total protein fraction, and the rest was layered on top of a sucrose step-gradient (1 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation at 9000 × g for 8 min, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-loading buffer. The supernatant was collected as cytosolic fraction, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) and re-dissolved in HU buffer (8 m urea, 200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol). CLK proteins were analyzed from fly head extracts or after expression in S2 or S2R+ cells that were transiently transfected as described for fluorescence microscopy with 2 μg of pAc-Clk constructs. After 40–48 h cells were harvested and lysed in 4× SDS loading buffer (240 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% glycerol) and boiled at 95 °C, and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6% gels. CLK protein was analyzed by Western blot using an antibody raised in rabbits against the C terminus of CLK (27.Hung H.C. Maurer C. Kay S.A. Weber F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31349-31357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For phosphatase treatment, CLK proteins were similarly expressed in S2R+ cells. Cells were lysed in RBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4% Nonidet P-40) (24.Yu W. Zheng H. Houl J.H. Dauwalder B. Hardin P.E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to which complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) was added. Proteins were subsequently de-phosphorylated by addition of 25 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to a total of a 50-μl reaction, which was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After denaturation by addition of SDS loading buffer and boiling at 95 °C, proteins were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and Western blot. To determine degradation kinetics, S2 cells (2 ml of 106 cells/ml) were transfected as described for fluorescence microscopy with 2 μg of pAc-Clk expression constructs. One day after transfection, cells were split in 24-well plates and incubated for a further 24 h. Subsequently, new protein synthesis was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide at a final concentration of 260 μm. Cells were harvested over a time course after the addition of cycloheximide, and CLK protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis on 6% SDS-PAGE. CLK protein levels were quantified for different time points by densitometry and normalized toward an unspecific control band, which was detected by the anti-CLK antibody. Amounts of CLK proteins are shown relative to the amount of CLK prior to the addition of cycloheximide (time point 0, set to 100). We first investigated the cellular distribution of the CLK protein in circadian neurons of the larval brain (Fig. 1A). We found that the majority of the CLK protein localizes inside the nucleus (33.Houl J.H. Yu W. Dudek S.M. Hardin P.E. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nuclear and total amounts of CLK revealed robust oscillations over the course of a day, with a maximum in the morning and trough levels in the evening (Fig. 1, A and B). These oscillations correlated with the circadian profile of Clk transcription that reaches a maximum toward the end of the night (16.Darlington T.K. Wager-Smith K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.D. Weitz C.J. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation states of the CLK protein oscillate in abundance over the course of a day (Fig. 1C) in accord with previous reports (25.Kim E.Y. Edery I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6178-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 29.Lee C. Bae K. Edery I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 857-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 33.Houl J.H. Yu W. Dudek S.M. Hardin P.E. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hypo- and hyperphosphorylated forms of CLK were mainly observed during late night and in the morning, whereas intermediate phosphorylation states were the predominant species in the evening, when CLK/CYC is transcriptionally active. To investigate the cellular localization of CLK in more detail, we expressed CLK with an N-terminal red fluorescent protein (DsRed) fusion tag in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells and analyzed the localization by fluorescence microscopy. The Drosophila CLK sequence reveals two consensus nuclear localization signals (NLSs) (Fig. 2A). The first consensus NLS is located in the N terminus at the beginning of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding domain. Although this region is conserved in mammalian CLK orthologs, mutagenesis of this site did not affect the subcellular localization of the CLK protein, indicating that the consensus NLS in the bHLH domain is not involved in nuclear translocation (data not shown). A second consensus NLS located C-terminal of the PAS domains is unique to the Drosophila CLK protein. Rendering this site non-functional by mutagenesis (Fig. 2A) caused a cytoplasmic localization of the CLKNLS mutant protein in S2 cells (Fig. 2B). These results show that the consensus NLS located C-terminal of the PAS domains is a functional nuclear translocation site and essential for nuclear import of the CLK protein. Interestingly, nuclear import-deficient CLKNLS localized largely in cytoplasmic speckles (Fig. 2B). These speckles were also observed for non-tagged CLKNLS mutants, indicating that the localization pattern is not due to the fluorescent protein fusion tag (data not shown). Similarly, PER/TIM complexes were found to localize in cytoplasmic foci shortly before they translocate into the nucleus (21.Meyer P. Saez L. Young M.W. Science. 2006; 311: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The nuclear import incompetent mutant of CLK may therefore be stalled in pre-import cytoplasmic foci. Cellular fractionation experiments of mammalian CLK from mouse liver (34.Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) revealed a hypophosphorylation of cytoplasmic mCLK, whereas nuclear mCLK was hyperphosphorylated. We therefore analyzed the phosphorylation state of nuclear and cytoplasmic CLK proteins (Fig. 2, B and C) in Drosophila S2 cells. Different hypo-, intermediate, and hyperphosphorylated forms of CLK could be resolved by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Phosphatase treatment converted these phosphorylated forms into two bands with increased electrophoretic mobility that likely represent a non- and a hypophosphorylated species (supplemental Fig. S1). Wild-type CLK showed predominantly hyperphosphorylated, low electrophoretic mobility forms (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cytoplasmic CLKNLS accumulated mainly in a hypophosphorylated state, indicating that newly synthesized CLK protein is converted to a low phosphorylated species in the cytoplasm, whereas hyperphosphorylation requires nuclear import (Fig. 2C). The nuclear localization of wild-type CLK in S2 cells (Fig. 2) mimics the predominant nuclear localization of CLK in circadian neurons of the larval brain (Fig. 1). When we investigated the cellular localization of CLK in S2R+ cells, we made the surprising observation that CLK showed a strong cytoplasmic localization in most cells, in addition to nuclear staining (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of CYC facilitated, however, an efficient nuclear localization of CLK in S2R+ cells, suggesting that CYC promotes the nuclear localization of CLK. Such a role of CYC is consistent with the finding of reduced endogenous cyc levels in S2R+ cells that reached only 50% of the transcript levels found in S2 cells, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of CRM1-dependent nuclear export by leptomycin B significantly increased the amount of nuclear CLK, suggesting that rapid nuclear export causes an inefficient nuclear localization of CLK in S2R+ cells (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, deletion of a C-terminal consensus nuclear export signal (NES) resulted in a complete nuclear localization of the mutant CLKΔNES protein in most cells, indicating that this sequence is important for nuclear export of CLK (Fig. 3A). The CLKΔNES mutant activated transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in S2R+ cells similar as wild type (Fig. 3B) demonstrating that deletion of the NES did not compromise CLK function and allowed a native fold of the mutant protein. The results are consistent with a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the CLK protein, which, in the absence of CYC, results in a cytoplasmic localization of CLK, due to inefficient nuclear retention. When the phosphorylation states of cytoplasmic and nuclear CLK proteins were investigated after expression in S2R+ cells, we observed that cytoplasmic CLKNLS/ΔNES was hypophosphorylated (Fig. 3C and data not shown), whereas wild-type CLK showed predominantly hyperphosphorylated forms (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the nuclear export-deficient CLKΔNES protein accumulated in an intermediate and a hyperphosphorylated state. The phosphorylation level of CLKΔNES was increased compared with nuclear import-deficient CLKNLS/ΔNES, indicating that nuclear translocation is important for hyperphosphorylation of CLK. On the other hand, CLKΔNES showed a stronger accumulation in the intermediate phosphorylation state compared with shuttling wild-type CLK (Fig. 3C), which was mainly hyperphosphorylated. These findings suggest that nuclear export promotes phosphorylation of the CLK protein and further phosphorylation events may take place in the cytoplasm after nuclear export. Because the CLKΔNES construct carries a 25-amino acid deletion of the NES, we validated these findings using a CLKΔNES construct that carries a 25-amino acid tag (25tag-CLKΔNES) (supplemental Fig. S2). No significant differences were however observed in the phosphorylation patterns of CLKΔNES and 25tag-CLKΔNES (supplemental Fig. S2A). Similarly, 25tag-CLKΔNES accumulated in a phosphorylation state that was intermediate compared with mainly hyperphosphorylated wild-type CLK and hypophosphorylated cytoplasmic CLKNLS (supplemental Fig. S2B). The above observations rev"
https://openalex.org/W2050144228,"Oxidative stress plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the presence of oxidative stress markers and a decreased antioxidant capacity in CF airway lining fluid, few studies have focused on the oxidant/antioxidant balance in CF cells. The aim of the current study was to investigate the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage and enzymatic antioxidant defenses in the lung of Cftr-knockout mice in basal conditions and as a response to oxidative insult. The results show that endogenous ROS and lipid peroxidation levels are higher in Cftr−/− lung when compared to wild-type (Cftr+/+) in basal conditions, despite a strong enzymatic antioxidant response involving superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6). The latter has the unique capacity to directly reduce membrane phospholipid hydroperoxides (PL-OOH). A dramatic increase in PL-OOH levels in Cftr−/− lung consecutive to in vivo oxidative challenge by paraquat (PQ) unmasks a susceptibility to phospholipid peroxidation. PQ strongly decreases Prdx6 expression in Cftr−/− mice compared to Cftr+/+. Similar results were obtained after P. aeruginosa LPS challenge. Two-dimensional gel analysis of Prdx6 revealed one main molecular form in basal conditions and a PQ-induced form only detected in Cftr+/+ lung. Mass spectrometry experiments suggested that, as opposed to the main basal form, the one induced by PQ is devoid of overoxidized catalytic Cys47 and could correspond to a fully active form that is not induced in Cftr−/− lung. These results highlight a constitutive redox imbalance and a vulnerability to oxidative insult in Cftr−/− lung and present Prdx6 as a key component in CF antioxidant failure. This impaired PL-OOH detoxification mechanism may enhance oxidative damage and stress-related signaling, contributing to an exaggerated inflammatory response in CF lung."
https://openalex.org/W2088198635,"Nucleophosmin (NPM), an oligomeric phosphoprotein and nucleolar target of the ARF tumor suppressor, contributes to several critical cellular processes. Previous studies have shown that the human NPM's phosphorylation by cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) on threonine (Thr) 199 regulates its translocation from the centrosome during cell cycle progression. Given our previous finding that ARF directly binds NPM, impeding its transit to the cytoplasm and arresting cells before S-phase entry, we hypothesized that ARF might also inhibit NPM phosphorylation. However, ARF induction did not impair phosphorylation of the cdk2 target residue in murine NPM, Thr198. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr198 occurred throughout the cell cycle and was concomitant with increases in overall NPM expression. To investigate the cell's presumed requirement for NPM-Thr198 phosphorylation in promoting the processes of growth and proliferation, we examined the effects of a non-phosphorylatable NPM mutant, T198A, in a clean cell system in which endogenous NPM had been removed by RNA interference. Here, we show that the T198A mutant is fully capable of executing NPM's described roles in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, ribosome export and cell cycle progression. Moreover, the proliferative defects observed with stable NPM knockdown were restored by mutant NPM-T198A expression. Thus, we demonstrate that the reduction in NPM protein expression blocks cellular growth and proliferation, whereas phosphorylation of NPM-Thr198 is not essential for NPM's capacity to drive cell cycle progression and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2090532872,"Objective Rosiglitazone was found associated with approximately a 43% increase in risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a two meta-analyses of clinical trials. Our objective is to estimate the magnitude of the association in real-world patients previously treated with metformin. Research Design and Methods We conducted a nested case control study in British Columbia using health care databases on 4.3 million people. Our cohort consisted of 158,578 patients with Type 2 diabetes who used metformin as first-line drug treatment. We matched 2,244 cases of myocardial infarction (AMI) with up to 4 controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate matched odds ratios for AMI associated with treatment with rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and sulfonylureas. Results In our cohort of prior metformin users, adding rosiglitazone for up to 6 months was not associated with an increased risk of AMI compared to adding a sulfonylurea (odds ratio [OR] 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91–2.10), or compared to adding pioglitazone (OR for rosi versus pio 1.41; 95% CI, 0.74–2.66). There were also no significant differences between rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and sulfonylureas for longer durations of treatment. Though not significantly different from sulfonylureas, there was a transient increase in AMI risk associated with the first 6 months of treatment with a glitazone compared to not using the treatment (OR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13–2.07) Conclusions In our British Columbia cohort of patients who received metformin as first-line pharmacotherapy for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, further treatment with rosiglitazone did not increase the risk of AMI compared to patients who were treated with pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea. Though not statistically significantly different compared from each other, an increased risk of AMI observed after starting rosiglitazone or sulfonylureas is a matter of concern that requires more research."
https://openalex.org/W2042345702,"Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) maintain pluripotency and indefinite self-renewal through yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. Leukemia inhibitory factor has been utilized to maintain the symmetrical self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs in culture. It has been suggested that molecules with significant cellular effects on retinoblastoma protein (pRb) or its related pathways should have functional impact on mESC proliferation and differentiation. However, the involvement of pRb in pluripotent differentiation of mESCs has not been extensively elaborated. In this paper, we present novel experimental data indicating that Cdk2ap1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associating protein 1), an inhibitor of G(1)/S transition through down-regulation of CDK2 and an essential gene for early embryonic development, confers competency for mESC differentiation. Targeted disruption of Cdk2ap1 in mESCs resulted in abrogation of leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal-induced differentiation, along with altered pRb phosphorylation. The differentiation competency of the Cdk2ap1(-/-) mESCs was restored upon the ectopic expression of Cdk2ap1 or a nonphosphorylatable pRb mutant (mouse Ser(788) --> Ala), suggesting that the CDK2AP1-mediated differentiation of mESCs was elicited through the regulation of pRb. Further analysis on mESC maintenance or differentiation-related gene expression supports the phosphorylation at serine 788 in pRb plays a significant role for the CDK2AP1-mediated differentiation of mESCs. These data clearly demonstrate that CDK2AP1 is a competency factor in the proper differentiation of mESCs by modulating the phosphorylation level of pRb. This sheds light on the role of the establishment of the proper somatic cell type cell cycle regulation for mESCs to enter into the differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2039408119,"Background The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved signal transduction pathway involved in embryonic patterning and regulation of cell fates during development and self-renewal. Recent studies have demonstrated that this pathway is integral to a complex system of interactions, involving as well other signal transduction pathways, and implicated in distinct human diseases. Delta-like 1 (Dll1) is one of the known ligands of the Notch receptors. The role of the Notch ligands is less well understood. Loss-of-function of Dll1 leads to embryonic lethality, but reduction of Delta-like 1 protein levels has not been studied in adult stage. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present the haploinsufficient phenotype of Dll1 and a missense mutant Dll1 allele (Dll1C413Y). Haploinsufficiency leads to a complex phenotype with several biological processes altered. These alterations reveal the importance of Dll1 mainly in metabolism, energy balance and in immunology. The animals are smaller, lighter, with altered fat to lean ratio and have increased blood pressure and a slight bradycardia. The animals have reduced cholesterol and triglyceride levels in blood. At the immunological level a subtle phenotype is observed due to the effect and fine-tuning of the signaling network at the different levels of differentiation, proliferation and function of lymphocytes. Moreover, the importance of the proteolytic regulation of the Notch signaling network emphasized. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, slight alterations in one player of Notch signaling alter the entire organism, emphasizing the fine-tuning character of this pathway in a high number of processes."
https://openalex.org/W2025112589,"Our laboratory has previously described the presence of five tumor-specific low molecular weight isoforms of cyclin E in both tumor cell lines and breast cancer patient biopsies. We have also shown that one of these low forms arises from an alternate start site, whereas the other four appear as two sets of doublets following cleavage through an elastase-like enzyme. However, the origin of both sets of doublets was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the larger isoform of each doublet is the result of phosphorylation at a key degradation site. Through site-directed mutagenesis of different phosphorylation sites within the cyclin E protein, we discovered that phosphorylation of threonine 395 is responsible for generating the larger isoform of each doublet. Because phosphorylation of threonine 395 has been linked to the proteasome-mediated degradation of full length cyclin E, we examined the stability of T395A phospho-mutants in both non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells and tumor cells. The results revealed that the low molecular weight isoforms appear to be stable in both a tumor cell line and a non-tumor forming cell line regardless of the presence of this critical phosphorylation site. The stability of low molecular weight cyclin E may have implications for both tumorigenesis and treatment of tumors expressing them."
https://openalex.org/W2117922692,"Researchers and scientific organizations are becoming aware of the greenhouse-gas emissions and waste associated with attending scientific conferences. Fledgling efforts are now underway to address this problem by offering carbon offsets, recycling at conferences, reducing conference travel, or replacing meetings with teleconferences. Researchers and scientific organizations are becoming aware of the greenhouse-gas emissions and waste associated with attending scientific conferences. Fledgling efforts are now underway to address this problem by offering carbon offsets, recycling at conferences, reducing conference travel, or replacing meetings with teleconferences. In the scientific realm, as in society writ large, environmentalism is taking hold. As scientists begin to look for ways to make their day-to-day activities more environmentally benign, it has become clear that jetting around the globe to attend scientific conferences is environmentally costly. With conferences ranging from the huge annual Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meeting in the US with more than 30,000 attendees to the much smaller Gordon Research Conferences with several hundred attendees, some scientists are urging their colleagues to assume more responsibility for reducing the carbon footprint associated with conference travel and attendance. Climate change, says Chris Hill, a biochemist at the University of Utah, “is a scientific challenge, and we should really make our actions match the scientific consensus.” Efforts to make scientific conferences “green” have garnered a few enthusiastic converts, but most scientists remain unaware of such attempts and some are skeptical of them. Says microbiologist Samuel Kaplan at the University of Texas-Houston Medical School, “I have not given it one iota of thought ever.” John Wallingford, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas, agrees: “I can understand why the carbon footprint might be a concern,” he says. “But I'd be curious to know how it stacks up against that of, say, disposable pipette tips or the energy used by lasers on my confocal.” One enthusiastic convert to the cause is Hill. He has made it a priority to counteract the carbon emissions associated with traveling to and attending the conferences he organizes. For example, at the Gordon Conference on Proteins that he chaired in 2007, he offered attendees the option to purchase carbon offsets—a way to invest in renewable energy, tree planting, or other activities that aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by an amount equal to that produced by attending the conference. Hill asked for $5 donations from each attendee at this conference to pay for a wind energy program run by the University of Utah. Not every attendee gave money, Hill says, but because some people gave more than the suggested amount, he was able to raise enough funds to offset the carbon emissions associated with his conference. “It can be very frustrating if you focus on the few people who don't get it,” he says. “I just ignore them.” Hill emphasizes that now he only attends conferences that attempt to be carbon neutral. He had hoped that the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology would introduce carbon offsets for its April 2009 meeting in New Orleans, but because of restrictions posed by being part of the larger Experimental Biology conference, the society was unable to do so. Hill still attended the conference. “The world isn't perfect,” he says. “They tried. If you're trying to take a step forward, that's OK.” Meanwhile, Rick Lindroth, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, also wanted to provide carbon offsets for the 2007 Gordon Conference that he was chairing on plant-herbivore interactions, held in Ventura, California. Working with the nonprofit organization Carbonfund.org, Lindroth estimated that the 5 day conference attended by 146 people would produce about 190 tons of CO2. The vast majority of greenhouse-gas emissions, nearly 160 tons, would come from air travel to and from the conference, with the rest associated with the conference venue, hotel accommodations, food service items, and ground transportation. Carbonfund.org offered to offset the carbon footprint of Lindroth's conference for around $7 per attendee. Lindroth circulated an envelope for donations each day of the conference, made announcements about the carbon offset program, and distributed a two-page primer. But he was disappointed with the results. “We came up a couple hundred dollars short,” he says. “The co-chair and I pitched in and covered the rest of it.” The attempts by Hill and Lindroth to offset the carbon footprint of scientific conferences are unusual. Nancy Ryan Gray, director of the Gordon Research Conferences, says that to date, no other conference chairs have approached the organization about offering carbon offsets to conference attendees. The conferences do not plan to offer carbon offsets as a general rule, Gray says. “The Gordon Research Conferences have a policy against political activities,” she notes. “But we are open and maintain close contact with our chairs and the specific interests their communities have.” She emphasizes that the organization itself attempts to be environmentally friendly: the headquarters building features solar panels on the roof, the conferences produce no paper reports, and the organization buses attendees from the airport to the meeting site to reduce car travel. A report in 2000 by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that, on average, an attendee at a 3 day meeting used 846 gallons of water (three times as much as the American average) and produced 61 pounds of solid waste (more than 10 times as much as usual). The same conference attendee might have used 21 cans or bottles and perhaps 40 cups and napkins. Enthusiastic individuals like Hill and Lindroth are often the drivers of action to cut waste or carbon emissions associated with conferences. In the absence of such fervor from members, scientific organizations tend to take smaller steps to address concerns about the environmental impact of their meetings. For example, the annual SfN meeting has implemented recycling and reduced printing needs by having most of the meeting information online. “Our leadership certainly recognizes that [the meeting] comes with environmental responsibility,” says Mona Miller, SfN's senior director of communications. A few scientific conferences such as the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) are more aggressively pursuing an environmental agenda. Every ESA attendee's registration fee includes $5 for carbon offsets. The organization no longer prints handouts and brochures for attendees and does not give new tote bags every year. (For attendees who want a new bag, ESA provides bags made of recycled plastic.) For the printed program, ESA uses paper certified by the Forest Stewardship Council to come from sustainably managed forests. The badge-holders are made from corn and the lanyards from recycled bottles. ESA also takes the environment into account when choosing locations for its annual meetings, selecting cities that have hotels close enough to the conference center that attendees can walk instead of taking a bus or taxi. And ESA works with conference centers and vendors to use biodegradable materials for cups and plates. “It does cost us extra,” says Michelle Horton, ESA's meetings manager. But, she adds, “It's driven by our membership.” This summer, the society will meet in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “We're trying to buy wind power to run the convention center while we're there,” Horton says. Future meetings will take place only in cities with green initiatives, she adds. Despite these efforts, some scientists say that the best way to reduce the environmental impact of meetings is to skip traveling to them altogether and to attend remotely by teleconference or videoconference. “A lot of meetings are just scientific tourism,” says Rustum Roy, a materials scientist at Pennsylvania State University. He says that the corporate boards he sits on use videoconferencing to communicate. “It's highly interactive,” he says. “It's time saving. It's travel saving.” Other scientists argue that scientific meetings are too valuable to miss attending in person, given that tele- and videoconferencing facilities do not offer all of the benefits of face-to-face interactions. Kevin Moses, associate director for science and training at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm Research Campus, says that through conferences “we wish to promote discussion and collaboration among scientists.” Telecommunication is “very poor at allowing people to meet for the first time, and to cross barriers into new fields,” he says. In-person meetings may be the only place to work out particularly sensitive or controversial topics, says Marcia McNutt, the president of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. People speak more openly in person and in private, she says, than when they are being recorded online or over the phone. David Liberles, a molecular biologist at the University of Wyoming, says, “What one gets from a videoconferenced presentation isn't that different from what one gets by reading a paper.” But when scientists attend conferences in person, he says, “you find out that people are doing things you didn't know they were doing, or you meet people you'd never met before who are thinking about things related to what you are doing.” Very little information exists about the impact or extent of green initiatives in the meetings industry. “We're in the new-adopter stage,” comments Elizabeth Henderson, director of corporate social responsibility for the trade group Meeting Professionals International (MPI). Andrew Walker, an event specialist in Toronto who is working on a master's degree in environmental studies at York University, says, “There isn't a lot of research. There's a lot of anecdotal stuff.” Collecting data on travel by scientists can be difficult to do, even within a single institution. Some universities have tried to estimate the carbon footprint of all of their activities and have posted their results online (http://www.aashe.org/resources/ghg_inventories.php). Many left out faculty travel because of difficulties with gathering data. At the University of Pennsylvania, the travel office booked 13,000 miles of flights in the last 6 months of 2006; assuming faculty members flew at that rate every year, their air travel would make up about 8% of the university's total greenhouse-gas emissions. Because not all faculty members book flights through the travel office, the fraction is likely to be higher. Utilities account for the vast majority, about 85%, of carbon emissions associated with the university, says Daniel Garofalo, U. Penn's environmental sustainability coordinator. The meetings industry needs standards to help event planners, suppliers, and venues get a handle on what they can do, and what is worth doing. Many environmental choices are not obvious: Is it less wasteful to make signs from recycled paper or to use electricity to light digital signs? In the US, several groups including the Convention Industry Council and the EPA are developing standards for hosting a greener meeting (http://wp.apexsolution.org). The standards tend to focus on categories including the destination, the meeting venue, accommodations, travel, and food services. Thus far, the draft standards include steps such as developing a written commitment to sustainability, implementing recycling, and choosing locations that require the shortest distances to be traveled by attendees. Information about green conferences appears online. MeetGreen, a consulting firm, has summarized trends in sustainable meetings (http://www.meetgreen.com/files/docs/MSWW_2009SustainableMeetingIndustry.pdf), and the trade group MPI has gathered links to websites about environmentally friendly meetings (http://www.mpiweb.org/Archive/196/82.aspx). Meanwhile, the Convention Industry Council's Green Meetings Report (http://www.conventionindustry.org/projects/green_meetings_report.pdf) outlines best practices for event organizers and suppliers. The current gold standard for certifying an event as green is the UK's British Standard 8901. This report (http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Standards-and-Publications/Industry-Sectors/Environment/more-products/BS-8901/) was prepared to help make the 2012 Olympic Games, to be held in London, a sustainable event. Unlike the American standards, which focus on logistics, British standards focus more on process, says MPI's Henderson. She notes that the British standards ask: “What are your sustainability objectives? How well do you engage your stakeholders in the process? And educate them? How do you measure what you've done? It's a process of sustainability.” She adds, “What is built into the standard is each time you are certified you need to do better than you did last time.” This year, many scientists are reluctantly reducing their travel—not because of the environment but because of the economy. Hill says that to save money, his department has decided to bring in half the usual number of seminar speakers and has asked the other half to give talks remotely. Many scientists doing interdisciplinary or inter-institution research are reducing the number of in-person meetings and are switching to teleconferences. So even though most scientists may not be thinking about the environmental impact of their conference travel, they may be reducing it anyway. And Hill, ever the optimist, looks forward to a day when travel itself may be environmentally less costly. “Sustainable air travel seems a long way in the future,” he says, “but it's not forever in the future.”"
https://openalex.org/W1971142600,"Allograft tolerance of ACI (RT1(a)) recipients to WF (RT1(u)) hearts can be induced by allochimeric class I MHC molecules containing donor-type (RT1A(u)) immunogenic epitopes displayed on recipient-type (RT1A(a)) sequences. Here, we sought the mechanisms by which allochimeric sequences may affect responding T cells through T cell receptor (TCA) repertoire restriction.The soluble [alpha(1h) (u)]-RT1.A(a) allochimeric molecule was delivered into ACI recipients of WF hearts in the presence of sub-therapeutic dose of cyclosporine (CsA). The TCR Vbeta spectrotyping of the splenocytes and cardiac allografts showed that the Vbeta gene families were differentially expressed within the TCR repertoire in allochimeric- or high-dose CsA-treated tolerant recipients at day +5 and +7 of post-transplantation. However, at day 30 of post-transplantation the allochimeric molecule-treated rats showed the restriction of TCR repertoire with altered dominant size peaks representing preferential clonal expansion of Vbeta7, Vbeta11, Vbeta13, Vbeta 14, and Vbeta15 genes. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between the alteration of Vbeta profile, restriction of TCR repertoire, and the establishment of allograft tolerance.Our findings indicate that presentation of allochimeric MHC class I sequences that partially mimic donor and recipient epitopes may induce unique tolerant state by selecting alloresponsive Vbeta genes."
https://openalex.org/W2014358386,"We identified a somatic mutation in estrogen receptor-α (ERα) in breast cancer causing a lysine to arginine transition (K303R) resulting in hypersensitivity to estrogen, altered associations with coactivators and corepressors and altered posttranslational modifications of ERα. We have developed a transgenic mouse expressing the K303R mutant ERα under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. At 4 months of age, K303R ERα transgenic animals demonstrate precocious alveolar budding compared with wild-type ERα transgenic mice or nontransgenic littermates. Despite these morphologic differences, K303R ERα transgenic mice displayed no differences in levels of ERα, progesterone receptor or proliferation at this time-point. Pregnancy or chronic estrogen plus progesterone exposure in K303R ERα transgenic mice also resulted in significantly more alveolar budding, increased β-casein production and dilated ducts when compared with nontransgenic littermates. To examine the effects of mutant expression on tumorigenesis, mutant ERα mice were crossed with FVB-MMTVneu mice and significantly delayed time to neu-mediated tumorigenesis in bigenic animals. In contrast, mutant expression did not affect carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that aberrant estrogenic signaling through the K303R ERα mutation may lead to precocious alveolar budding in virgin mice, and to an expedited maturation and differentiation phenotype in the mammary glands of hormonally stimulated animals."
