Ablation of the ovaries, adrenals, or pituitary did not alter this effect, thus indicating a direct trophic action of this agent on the uterus. It is apparent that the application of this insecticide to animals used for hormonal experiments introduces an additional variable."

https://openalex.org/W46955057,"When the oligonucleotides obtained by the digestion of desoxyribonucleic acid by splenic desoxyribonuclease are subjected to digestion by pancreatic desoxyribonuclease, neither nucleosides nor mononucleotides are among the products, but mononucleoside 3', 5' -diphosphates are present. This suggests that monoesterified phosphate in position 3' labilizes the preceding internucleotide linkage while monoesterified phosphate or free hydroxyl in position 5' makes the following linkage resistant. The predominant products are dinucleotides and their derivatives, suggesting that they represent the ultimate product of the reaction. Increased hydrolysis can be achieved both by removal of products and increased enzyme concentration. (auth)"

Similar results have been obtained by Mäkelä et al. 2. My work concerned with the chemistry of MN blood group-active mucoids from human erythrocytes has revealed that N-acetylneuraminic acid-containing mucoids, which carry MN-active groupings, were liberated into the supernatant by the action of papain3. A review of the MN blood group active substances, their isolation and inactivation by several methods has been published elsewhere4. Further work led to the examination of other enzymes which are known to inactivate M and N: trypsin, ficin, bromelin, and stem-bromelain4. In all cases the isolation procedure to recover the non-dialysable split products was similar to that described previously2 for papain-treated red cells, which involved phenol/extraction of the supernatant after incubation with enzyme and centrifugation. Some chemical data of the mucoids obtained are given in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W189260379,"Although stereospecificity is characteristic of the reactions of single enzymes, both optical antipodes are usually metabolized in a qualitatively similar manner in the intact animal (l-4) where numerous possibilities of enzyme attack exist. When dl-aldosterone and other racemic steroids are added to enzyme or microbial systems (5, 6), only the naturally occurring d antipodes undergo reaction, whereas the 1 isomers are recovered unchanged. The fate of the 1 steroids in vivo, however, is not known. Since aldosterone has been available chiefly in racemic form,’ the metabolism of its I antipode was of interest. In the present study, a method for comparing the metabolism of a pair of antipodes has been applied to measure the conversion of I-aldosterone to each of the two known urinary products of the d isomer in man, the conjugate which is hydrolyzed at pH 1 (10) and tetrahydroaldosterone2 (11). The method consisted of administering a known mixture of d- and dl-aldosterone and comparing the ratio of d to dl forms in the administered mixture with that found in the urinary metabolites. Two methods were used to measure the ratio of d-aldosterone to dl-aldosterone. 1. When the endogenous production of aldosterone was negligible, the d isomer was administered in labeled form and racemic aldosterone in unlabeled form. The ratio of d- to racemic aldosterone was determined from the specific activity. 2. Alternatively, d- and racemic aldosterone were each labeled with different isotopes, H3 and CY4. The ratio of d- to racemic aldosterone was determined from the ratio of H3 to Cl*. Both methods demonstrated that over-all metabolism of aldosterone in man is stereospecific. Z-Aldosterone was not converted either to the conjugate hydrolyzed at pH 1 or to tetrahydroaldosterone."

Analogues of B(12), including cobinamide and alpha-(adenyl) cobamide cyanide, satisfactorily substitute for vitamin B(12). Methionine alone or in combination with other compounds supports only a low level of growth."
https://openalex.org/W2010126001,"A CONVENIENT method for the isolation of bovine submaxillary mucin in a relatively undegraded and homogeneous state compared to earlier methods1 has been developed in this Laboratory. Fresh glands (640 gm.) were ground and stirred mechanically with three changes of 500 ml. of cold water for a total of 54 hr. The pooled extracts were clarified by centrifuging at 26,3600g for 30 min. and adjusted to pH. 3.5. The resulting mucin clot was separated and dissolved in cold water by neutralization to 7.5, and lyophilized. The product was purified by solution in 500 ml. of cold 50 per cent (w/v) aqueous calcium chloride. After centrifugation at 26,360g for 30 min., the supernatant was fractionated with cold ethanol. The fraction separating at 60–75 per cent (v/v) ethanol was collected by centrifugation at 26,360g for 30 min., dissolved in water, dialysed against water and lyophilized. All procedures were carried out at 0–4° C. The yield was 0.64 and 2.5 per cent of the glands on fresh and dry weight basis, respectively. The recovery of sialic acid was 36 and 60 per cent of that in the extract and mucin clot, respectively. A repetition of the procedure did not alter the composition of the product. The lyophilized powder could be stored at 2–4° C. without change of its properties."

M., unpublished results), it was noted that added chitin strongly adsorbed tobacco mosaic virus. At least a portion of the adsorbed virus could be released with concentrated phosphate buffers. This investigation describes the Chromatographic properties of chitin for TMV."

https://openalex.org/W1985166148,"THE isolation of pathogenic fungi producing superficial or systemic diseases in man from clinical materials is made difficult by different contaminating bacteria and saprophytic fungi overgrowing the culture medium and suppressing or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic fungi. In order to obtain pathogenic fungi in a pure culture, attempts were made to mix various substances in the medium in such a way that they would be liable to prevent the growth of contaminants. After a great deal of effort, the most satisfactory result was obtained by cultivation media containing actidione. Actidione (cycloheximide)2 was the only antifungal antibiotic which, though exerting no antibacterial effect, inhibits the growth of most saprophytic fungi, yet does not inhibit the development of fungi pathogenic to man. For this very reason, it can be used with penicillin and streptomycin2,3 or chloramphenicol4 for the preparation of selective culture media."

https://openalex.org/W2022211565,"ONE of the greatest discoveries of the past years in penicillin research was the discovery, isolation1 and preparation of 6-amino-penicillanic acid (6-APA) forming the common ‘nucleus’ of natural penicillins2,3, and the successful introduction into therapy of semi-synthetic penicillins produced from it4,5. The new semi-synthetic penicillin preparations have already made great progress in the fight against resistant bacteria. The possibility is now laid open for the preparation of penicillins possessing novel effectiveness6. The basis for efforts of this kind is 6-APA research, and its quick identification in fermentation liquor and other reaction mixtures."

https://openalex.org/W1485626894,"A micromanometric modification of the ninhydrin-CO/sub 2/ method for determining carboxyl CO/sub 2/ of alpha -amino acids is described together with transfer of the CO/sub 2/ to a Bernstein-Ballentine gas counter for counting C/ sup 14/O/sub 2/. The procedure serves for amounts of carboxyl carbon in the range 10 to 30 mu g. When CO/sub 2/ is transferred from a manornetric chamber to a gas counter, a small amount of CO/sub 2/, sufficient to be significant when the sample is less than 2 mg of carbon, may be trapped in the connecting tube between the manometric chamber and the counter. The trapped CO/sub 2/ can be quantitatively washed into the counter by a few milliliters of methane admitted into the mano- metric chamber after the usual transfer operation. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2000897287,"Landsteiner and Wiener1 discovered that the sera of rabbits immunized by the erythrocytes of the rhesus (macacus) monkey would agglutinate those of certain human subjects irrespective of their ABO groups. They added, therefore, the Rh-antigen to the list of antigens characterizing the human red cells. Some human red cells, therefore, must be assumed to possess a receptor-substance for antibodies which rabbits or still better guinea pigs can form when immunized with rhesus erythrocytes. Later, Wiener and Peters2 demonstrated the anti-genicity of the Rh-receptor of human erythrocytes in man, thus establishing the principal cause for erythroblastosis in the new-born."
