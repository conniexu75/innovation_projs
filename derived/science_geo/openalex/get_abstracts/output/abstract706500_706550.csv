https://openalex.org/W4313379823,"Engineered destruction of target proteins by recruitment to the cell's degradation machinery has emerged as a promising strategy in drug discovery. The majority of molecules that facilitate targeted degradation do so via a select number of ubiquitin ligases, restricting this therapeutic approach to tissue types that express the requisite ligase. Here, we describe a new strategy of targeted protein degradation through direct substrate recruitment to the 26S proteasome. The proteolytic complex is essential and abundantly expressed in all cells; however, proteasomal ligands remain scarce. We identify potent peptidic macrocycles that bind directly to the 26S proteasome subunit PSMD2, with a 2.5-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy complex structure revealing a binding site near the 26S pore. Conjugation of this macrocycle to a potent BRD4 ligand enabled generation of chimeric molecules that effectively degrade BRD4 in cells, thus demonstrating that degradation via direct proteasomal recruitment is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W4313270535,"Cefiderocol (CFDC) is a novel siderophore-cephalosporin, effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. As it has a siderophore side chain, it can utilize iron acquisition systems for penetration of the bacterial outer membrane. We aimed to elucidate the role of siderophores and iron uptake receptors in defining Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptibility to CFDC.Initially, 103 K. pneumoniae strains were characterized for susceptibility to different antibiotics including CFDC. CFDC minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined in iron-depleted and iron-enriched conditions. Iron uptake genes including siderophores, their receptors, ferric citrate (fecA) and iron uptake (kfu) receptors were detected by PCR in all the strains. For 10 selected strains, gene expression was tested in iron-depleted media with or without CFDC treatment and compared to expression in iron-enriched conditions.CFDC exhibited 96.1% susceptibility, being superior to all the other antibiotics (MIC50: 0.5 and MIC90: 4 μg/ml). Only three strains (2.9%) were intermediately susceptible and a pandrug resistant strain (0.97%) was resistant to CFDC (MIC: 8 and 256 μg/ml, respectively). The presence of kfu and fecA had a significant impact on CFDC MIC, especially when co-produced, and if coupled with yersiniabactin receptor (fyuA). CFDC MICs were negatively correlated with enterobactin receptor (fepA) expression and positively correlated with expression of kfu and fecA. Thus, fepA was associated with increased susceptibility to CFDC, while kfu and fecA were associated with reduced susceptibility to CFDC. CFDC MICs increased significantly in iron-enriched media, with reduced expression of siderophore receptors, hence, causing less drug uptake.Iron acquisition systems have a significant impact on CFDC activity, and their altered expression is a factor leading to reduced susceptibility. Iron concentration is also a major player affecting CFDC susceptibility; therefore, it is essential to explore possible ways to improve the drug activity to facilitate its use to treat infections in iron-rich sites."
https://openalex.org/W4313252834,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a paradigmatic neurodegenerative disease in that it is caused by a mutation in a broadly expressed protein, ATXN1; however, only select populations of cells degenerate. The interaction of polyglutamine-expanded ATXN1 with the transcriptional repressor CIC drives cerebellar Purkinje cell pathogenesis; however, the importance of this interaction in other vulnerable cells remains unknown. Here, we mutated the 154Q knockin allele of Atxn1154Q/2Q mice to prevent the ATXN1-CIC interaction globally. This normalized genome-wide CIC binding; however, it only partially corrected transcriptional and behavioral phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of additional factors in disease pathogenesis. Using unbiased proteomics, we identified three ATXN1-interacting transcription factors: RFX1, ZBTB5, and ZKSCAN1. We observed altered expression of RFX1 and ZKSCAN1 target genes in SCA1 mice and patient-derived iNeurons, highlighting their potential contributions to disease. Together, these data underscore the complexity of mechanisms driving cellular vulnerability in SCA1."
https://openalex.org/W4313203467,"The China's economy is developing rapidly, and it affects the environment on several levels. Therefore, this study examines the effect of environmental management accounting, green human resource management (HRM), on green organisational behaviour (OB). We collected 383 questionnaires completed by human resource managers and accounting managers in the Chinese hospitality industry. We used a covariance-based structural equation model to test the hypotheses in this study. The empirical evidence shows a positive and significant effect between environmental management accounting (monetary environmental management accounting, and physical environmental management accounting) and green HRM (β = 0.262, p < 0.01, β = 0.378, p< 0.01). Green HRM mediates the influence of environmental management accounting (monetary environmental management accounting, β = 0.059, p < 0.01; physical environmental management accounting, β = 0.084, p< 0.01) on green OB. The analysis confirmed the importance of environmental management accounting (as opposed to green human resource management) in predicting green behaviour and the critical role of green human resource management in connecting environmental management accounting and green OB. Thus, this study extends the literature's perspective on green OB to environmental management accounting and green HRM."
https://openalex.org/W4313203686,"Background Understanding national trends of heart failure (HF) is crucial for establishing prevention and treatment strategies. We aimed to investigate the 11-year trends of HF in the South Korean population. Methods Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, we identified 3,446,256 patients with HF between 2004 and 2014. Results The prevalence of HF was 1.42% in 2004, steadily increasing to 1.98% in 2014. However, the age-adjusted prevalence of HF remained stable (1.43% in 2014). The incidence of HF was 6.1/1000 person-years in 2004 and remained at similar levels, reaching 5.4/1000 person-years in 2014. The age-adjusted incidence of HF slowly decreased to 3.94/1000 person-years in 2014. The event rate for hospitalized patients with HF remained stable increasing from 1.40 in 2004 to 1.87/1000 person-years in 2014, and the age-adjusted event rate of hospitalized HF decreased to 1.22 in 2014. Conclusions In South Korea, between 2004 and 2014, the prevalence of HF increased while the incidence of HF remained stable. Furthermore, the age-adjusted HF prevalence was stable, and the age-adjusted incidence decreased. This indicates that the aging population is the main cause of the increasing national burden associated with HF and that further attention is warranted in the management of HF in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4313203696,"This study investigated whether the coughing behaviors of virtual agents encourage infection avoidance behavior, i.e., distancing behaviors. We hypothesized that the changes in people’s lifestyles in physical environments due to COVID-19 probably influence their behaviors, even in virtual environments where no infection risk is present. We focused on different types of virtual agents because non-human agents, such as robot-like agents, cannot spread a virus by coughing. We prepared four kinds of virtual agents (human-like/robot-like and male/female) and coughing behaviors for them and experimentally measured the personal distance maintained by participants toward them. Our experiment results showed that participants chose a greater distance from coughing agents, regardless of the types, and negatively evaluated them. They also chose a greater distance from male agents than from female agents."
https://openalex.org/W4313270869,"Client-owned cats who underwent a post-mortem examination (n = 3,108) at a veterinary medical teaching hospital between 1989 and 2019 were studied to determine longevity and factors affecting mortality. Demographic factors, environmental factors, age, and causes of death were assessed. Sexes included 5.66% intact females, 39.86% spayed females, 6.95% intact males and 47.49% neutered males. 84.2% were mixed breed cats. Age at death was known for 2,974 cases with a median of 9.07 years. Cancer was the most common pathophysiologic cause of death (35.81%) and was identified in 41.3% of cats. When categorized by organ system, mortality was most attributed to multiorgan/systemic (21.72%). Renal histologic abnormalities were noted in 62.84% of cats but was considered the primary cause of death in only 13.06% of cats. Intact female and male cats had significantly shorter lifespans than their spayed or neutered counterparts. FeLV positive status was associated with decreased longevity (P<0.0001) while FIV status was not. This study reports on risk factors associated with mortality and highlights areas of research that may contribute to improved lifespan in cats."
https://openalex.org/W4313288841,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of patients in ICUs leading to a worldwide shortage of the intravenous sedative agents obligating physicians to find alternatives including inhaled sedation. Inhaled sedation in French ICU has been previously explored in 2019 (VOL'ICU study). This survey was designed to explore the use of inhaled sedation two years after our first survey and to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the use of inhaled sedation.We designed a national survey, contacting medical directors of French ICUs between June and October 2021. Over a 50-item questionnaire, the survey covered the characteristics of the ICU, data on inhaled sedation, and practical aspects of inhaled ICU sedation for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Answers were compared with the previous survey, VOL'ICU.Among the 405 ICUs contacted, 25% of the questionnaires were recorded. Most ICU directors (87%) knew about the use of inhaled ICU sedation and 63% of them have an inhaled sedation's device in their unit. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of inhaled sedation in French ICUs. The main reasons said by the respondent were ""need for additional sedative"" (62%), ""shortage of intravenous sedatives"" (38%) and ""involved in a clinical trial"" (30%). The main reasons for not using inhaled ICU sedation were ""device not available"" (76%), ""lack of familiarity"" (60%) and ""no training for the teams"" (58%). More than 70% of respondents were overall satisfied with the use of inhaled sedation. Almost 80% of respondents stated that inhaled sedation was a seducing alternative to intravenous sedation for management of COVID-19 patients.The use of inhaled sedation in ICU has increased fastly in the last 2 years, and is frequently associated with a good satisfaction among the users. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic could have impacted the widespread use of inhaled sedation, it represents an alternative to intravenous sedation for more and more physicians."
https://openalex.org/W4313203423,"Clinicians' perspectives of the reasons for performing caesarean section (CS) are fundamental to deepening knowledge and understanding of factors influencing decision-making for CS. The aim of this study was to explore midwives' and obstetricians' views of factors influencing decision-making for CS for first-time mothers. A qualitative descriptive study with semi-structured one-to-one audio-recorded interviews was used to gather data from clinicians (15 midwives and 20 senior obstetricians). Following research ethics committee approval, clinicians, who were directly involved in the decision-making process for CS during the period of data collection, were purposively selected from three maternity units in the Republic of Ireland between June 2016 to July 2017. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Three interrelated themes with several subthemes reflective of clinicians' views and experiences emerged following data analysis. These were: 'A fear factor' describing clinicians' fear of adverse outcomes and subsequent litigation, 'Personal preferences versus a threshold-clinician driven factors emphasising the influence of clinicians' personal beliefs, and 'Standardised versus individualised care-a system perspective' explaining the effects of, or lack of, organisational policy and its direct and indirect impact on the decision-making process. Findings show that decisions to perform a CS are, on occasion, based on clinicians' personal beliefs and interpretation, similar to findings from other published literature. Consideration of broader issues related to organisational, socio-cultural and political context is essential when seeking solutions to the rising CS rates. The findings will enable clinicians to reflect on their day-to-day practice, in order to look for modifiable factors that influence their decision-making, and help women understand the multitude of factors that can lead to a decision to perform a CS. Findings will also contribute to the development of the 'next step action' and assist in devising future intervention studies to reduce any unnecessary CSs."

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) focusing on the effects of virtual reality on depressive state as a primary outcome will be included. Grey literature and the following databases will be consulted: PubMed, Cinahl, PsycInfo, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. The recently revised Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess the quality of included studies. Data will be extracted and meta-analyses will be performed within the specific condition of the emotional state of stroke patients admitted to neurorehabilitation units. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be used to identify effective modes and patterns of therapy delivery. The approach of assessment, development and evaluation of recommendations will be applied to reach a convincing conclusion.An accurate, transparent and standardized review process is expected to provide recommendations on the use of VR technology in the healthcare of stroke patients.Emotional difficulties are common after stroke and have an impact on rehabilitation outcome. VR seems to have an important role in the treatment and depression in neurological patients, as it is able to improve levels of well-being, coping strategies and social relationships. The systematic review may contribute to a more convincing and specific conclusion compared to existing studies of this type.Systematic review registration: CRD42022303968."
https://openalex.org/W4313203501,"Background Smoking is the biggest preventable factor causing mortality and morbidity and the health benefits of smoking cessation are commonly known. Smoking cessation-related weight gain is well documented. We evaluated the association between smoking cessation and the incidence of obesity-related morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome as well as mortality. We also evaluated telomere length related to smoking cessation. Material and methods This study was part of the OPERA (Oulu Project Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis) study. The mean follow up time among the 600 study subjects was 20 years. We divided the study subjects into four groups by smoking status (“never”, “current”, “ex-smokers” and “quit”) and analyzed their health status. “Ex-smokers” had quit smoking before baseline and “quit” quit during the follow-up time. Information about total mortality between the years 2013–2020 was also utilized. Results During the follow-up time systolic blood pressure decreased the most in the “current” and in the “ex-smoker” groups. Office SBP decreased the least in the “quit” group (p = 0.001). BMI increased the most in the “quit” and the least in the “ex-smokers” group (p = 0.001). No significant increases were seen in the incidence of obesity-related-diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension and diabetes was seen. There was no significant difference in the shortening of telomeres. Odds of short-term mortality was increased in the “current” group (2.43 (CI 95% 1.10; 5.39)), but not in the “quit” (1.43 (CI 95% 0.73–2.80)) or “ex-smoker” (1.02 (CI 95% 0.56–1.86)) groups when compared to “never” group. Conclusions Even though, the blood pressure levels were unfavorable in the “quit” group, there was no significant increase in the incidence of obesity-related-diseases, and a noticeable benefit in short-term mortality was seen during the 6-year follow-up. The benefits of smoking cessation outweigh the disadvantages in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W4313203731,"We aimed to define the shared and unshared functional neurobiological underpinnings of binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN). These disorders both involve loss of control over binge eating, but differ based on purging behavior and body image distortion. BED and BN have also been found to show differences in brain activation patterns in reward sensitivity. We enrolled 13 and 12 drug-naive and medication-free women with BED and BN, respectively, and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We performed an orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-seeded resting-state whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis among the groups. In this study, BED patients exhibited significantly higher impulsivity than controls, whereas the difference in impulsivity between BN and controls was not significant. Participants with BED and BN showed weaker FC between the left lateral OFC and the right precuneus than controls. In the BED only group, the FC strength between these regions was negatively correlated with self-reported impulsivity. In both BED and BN, FC between the left lateral OFC and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was weaker than that in controls. In BED, FC between the left medial OFC and the right cerebellar lobule IV was stronger than that of other groups. Our current results suggest similarities and differences between BED and BN in OFC-seeded FC with respect to reward processing. In particular, FC of the OFC in BED patients showed a significant correlation with their high impulsivity, which may reflect a decline in executive control over binge eating."
https://openalex.org/W4313203756,"Background Dietary magnesium intake inversely correlated to risk of death in general population. However, it is relatively unknown whether the beneficial effect remains significant in individuals with diabetes. Our study purpose is to evaluate the association of dietary magnesium intake with mortality risk in diabetic population. Methods The study population is recruited from 2003–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, totaling 2,045 adults with diabetes being included. Participants were divided based on glycohemoglobin (HbA1c &lt; 7% and ≥ 7%) and daily dietary magnesium intake (≤ and &gt; 250mg/day) ascertained by 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Results The average age of the study population was 52.9±10.1 years, with 49.1% being male. During a median follow-up of 77.0 months (interquartile range: 45.0–107.0 months), a total of 223 participants died (1.5 per 1000 person-months). Our results showed that individuals with lower dietary magnesium intake (≤250mg/day) had higher risk of all-cause (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.13–2.16) and other-cause (non-cardiovascular and non-cancer) mortality (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09–2.60), while cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality were similar compared with individuals with magnesium intake &gt; 250mg/day. We also showed that the risk of all-cause (HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.33–2.60) and other-cause mortality (HR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.29–3.19) were higher in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c ≥7.0%) compared with HbA1c &lt;7.0%; however, the association attenuated in the subgroup of higher magnesium intake (&gt;250mg/day). When combining HbA1c and dietary magnesium intake, we showed that individuals with HbA1c ≥ 7% and dietary magnesium intake ≤ 250 mg/day had higher all-cause and other-cause (non-cardiovascular and non-cancer) mortality risk compared with those with HbA1c &lt; 7% and/or dietary magnesium intake &gt; 250 mg/day. Conclusion Higher magnesium intake may help reduce mortality risk in individuals with diabetes and attenuate mortality risk of poor diabetic control."
https://openalex.org/W4313203781,"Recruitment and retention remains a concern in obstetrics and gynecology, with consultants having a unique perspective on the daily challenges. We aimed to examine these and examine their solutions to future-proofing the workforce.Primary data were collected from consultant obstetrician-gynecologists in the Republic of Ireland. Using a qualitative methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 participants recruited through purposive sampling. Following transcription, deductive content analysis was conducted to identify themes and categories with respect to challenges and solutions in the specialty.Findings revealed four superordinate themes of professional and personal factors, opinions of the specialty and the role of the consultant. Respondents expressed fear about low morale in the specialty, but also threats posed by resource availability and training limitations, in addition to medico-legal and media challenges. Solutions centered around re-evaluating training pathways and implementing improved advocacy and support structures for the specialty and for those working within it.This study provides a unique standpoint from which to explore an international in obstetrics and gynecology. Its solution-based outlook provides the framework to implement changes to protect and retain the current workforce as well as future-proofing recruitment to secure the specialty."
https://openalex.org/W4313203787,"Records of anthropogenic marine debris and the threats it poses are increasing worldwide, yet we know relatively little about the distribution of benthic debris. The seafloor is the final destination for a large proportion of debris due to the degradation and sinking of items. A more detailed understanding of debris distributions in hotspots such as urbanised estuaries can help decision makers target management and remediation activities. We selected sites frequented by fishers and boaters in Sydney Harbour, an urbanised estuary, to investigate the impacts of recreational activities on debris abundance. The aim of this study was to examine variation in macro debris (>5mm in diameter) type and abundance at two habitat types (piers and non-piers). We chose five locations at various distances from the estuary mouth. In each location SCUBA teams performed fixed transects at two sites, one under a pier and one over nearby soft-sediment habitat. Debris was recovered by the divers and brought to the surface for classification and disposal. Surveys were repeated multiple times at each location between November 2019 and February 2020, recording a total of 2803 debris items over 36 survey events. Overall, piers had more than ten times the debris abundance of soft-sediment sites, and much higher proportion of debris types related to recreational fishing. Over half of the debris items in this study were plastic (65%), and approximately 70% of the total debris was classified as related to recreational fishing. This trait was most prominent in debris at sites closest to the estuary mouth, likely reflecting increased fishing activity in this area. This study indicates that policy makers and community groups in urbanised estuaries should focus monitoring, reduction, and remediation efforts near artificial structures such as piers, and that public awareness campaigns should target the behaviour of recreational users of these structures."
https://openalex.org/W4313203822,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to lifestyle changes across Europe with a likely impact on sleep quality. This investigation considers sleep quality in relation to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in five European countries. Using panel regressions and keeping policy responses to COVID-19 constant, we show that an increase in the four-week average daily COVID-19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (our proxy for the evolution of the pandemic) significantly reduced sleep quality in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden between April 2020 and June 2021. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity tests and are larger for women, parents and young adults. Additionally, we show that about half of the reduction in sleep quality caused by the evolution of the pandemic can be attributed to changes in lifestyles, worsened mental health and negative attitudes toward COVID-19 and its management (lower degree of confidence in government, greater fear of being infected). In contrast, changes in one's own infection-status from the SARS-CoV-2 virus or sleep duration are not significant mediators of the relationship between COVID-19-related deaths and sleep quality."
https://openalex.org/W4313203844,"With fast and reliable international transportation, more people with different language backgrounds can interact now. As a result, the need for communicative agents fluent in several languages to assist those people is highlighted. The high cost of hiring human attendants fluent in several languages makes using social robots a more affordable alternative in international gatherings. A social robot capable of presenting a piece of information in more than one language at the same time to its audience is the goal of this line of study. However, the negative effect of background noise on speech comprehension in humans is well-established. Hence, presenting a piece of information in two different languages at the same time by the robot creates an adverse listening condition for both individuals listening to the speech of such a bilingual robot. In this study, we investigated whether manipulating the pitch and gender of the robot’s voice could affect human subjects’ memory of the presented information in the presence of background noise. The results indicate that the pitch and gender of the speaking voice do indeed affect our memory of the presented information. when a male voice was used, a higher pitch resulted in significantly better memory performance than a lower pitch. Contrarily, when a female voice was used, a lower pitch resulted in significantly better memory in participants than a higher pitch. Both male and female subjects performed significantly better with a female voice in a noisy background. In nutshell, the result of this study suggests using a female voice for robots in noisy conditions, as in the case of simultaneously speaking robots, can significantly improve the retrieval of presented information in human subjects."
https://openalex.org/W4313270587,"Prescription of PCSK9-inhibitors has increased in recent years but not much is known about its off-target effects. PCSK9-expression is evident in non-hepatic tissues, notably the brain, and genetic variation in the PCSK9 locus has recently been shown to be associated with mood disorder-related traits. We investigated whether PCSK9 inhibition, proxied by a genetic reduction in expression of PCSK9 mRNA, might have a causal adverse effect on mood disorder-related traits. We used genetic variants in the PCSK9 locus associated with reduced PCSK9 expression (eQTLs) in the European population from GTEx v8 and examined the effect on PCSK9 protein levels and three mood disorder-related traits (major depressive disorder, mood instability, and neuroticism), using summary statistics from the largest European ancestry genome-wide association studies. We conducted summary-based Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the causal effects, and attempted replication using data from eQTLGen, Brain-eMETA, and the CAGE consortium. We found that genetically reduced PCSK9 gene-expression levels were significantly associated with reduced PCSK9 protein levels but not with increased risk of mood disorder-related traits. Further investigation of nearby genes demonstrated that reduced USP24 gene-expression levels was significantly associated with increased risk of mood instability (p-value range = 5.2x10-5-0.03), and neuroticism score (p-value range = 2.9x10-5-0.02), but not with PCSK9 protein levels. Our results suggest that genetic variation in this region acts on mood disorders through a PCSK9-independent pathway, and therefore PCSK9-inhibitors are unlikely to have an adverse impact on mood disorder-related traits."
https://openalex.org/W4313270889,"Research has shown that sensor data generated by a user during a VR experience is closely related to the user’s behavior or state, meaning that the VR user can be quantitatively understood and modeled. Eye-tracking as a sensor signal has been studied in prior research, but its usefulness in a VR context has been less examined, and most extant studies have dealt with eye-tracking within a single environment. Our goal is to expand the understanding of the relationship between eye-tracking data and user modeling in VR. In this paper, we examined the role and influence of eye-tracking data in predicting a level of cybersickness and types of locomotion. We developed and applied the same structure of a deep learning model to the multi-sensory data collected from two different studies (cybersickness and locomotion) with a total of 50 participants. The experiment results highlight not only a high applicability of our model to sensor data in a VR context, but also a significant relevance of eye-tracking data as a potential supplement to improving the model’s performance and the importance of eye-tracking data in learning processes overall. We conclude by discussing the relevance of these results to potential future studies on this topic."
https://openalex.org/W4313271007,"While a large body of research exists on the processing of monetary rewards, less is known about sexual reward processing. This study aimed to identify effective connectivity for the consumption of sexual (erotic and sexual humor) and non-sexual (monetary) rewards, using dynamic causal modeling and parametric empirical Bayes with subjective hedonic ratings included. Our results support the importance of the amygdala for sexual humor amusement, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) for monetary rewards, and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) for erotic pleasure. The amygdala, NAc, and lOFC are major dopaminergic targets with known roles in the reward circuitry. Appreciating sexual humor was associated with ventral tegmental area (VTA) to amygdala connectivity. Enjoying monetary gains was associated with VTA-to-NAc and amygdala-to-NAc connectivity. The mesolimbic dopamine system originates in the VTA and sends major projections to the amygdala and NAc. Specifically, sexual humor appreciation was associated with effective connectivity from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to the amygdala, suggesting that subjective pleasure triggers activation of the vmPFC which exerts an excitatory influence on the amygdala. Unexpectedly, processing pleasure from monetary gains was linked to VTA-to-vmPFC connectivity, rather than the expected vmPFC-to-NAc connectivity. Importantly, we identified core roles for the amygdala . Sexual humor appreciation was associated with VTA-to-amygdala and vmPFC-to-amygdala effective connectivity, while we found amygdala-to-lOFC connectivity for erotic pleasure and amygdala-to-NAc connectivity for pleasure from monetary gains. Our findings represent an important step in understanding how effective connectivity in the mesocorticolimbic-amygdala circuitry differs for processing the consumption of sexual and monetary rewards."
https://openalex.org/W4313271009,"A growing number of studies have shown that labeling negative feelings can down-regulate distress. The present study aimed to test the effectiveness of affect labeling while manipulating two factors known to influence the emotion regulation process, namely timing, and emotional intensity. In Experiment 1, sixty-three participants completed a performance-based affect labeling paradigm in which they had to choose between two labels that best describe their feeling. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Simultaneous labeling- the labeling occurs while watching the aversive picture. (2) Subsequent labeling- the labeling occurs immediately after watching the aversive picture. (3) Delayed labeling- the labeling occurs 10 seconds after watching the aversive picture. We found that affect labeling efficiently down-regulated distress independent of the labeling timing. In Experiment 2, seventy-nine participants utilized simultaneous labeling for aversive pictures with low and high intensity. We revealed that while affect labeling reduces distress in high-intensity aversive conditions, it increases distress in low-intensity conditions. The results question the standard advice, which calls to count to 10 before you speak in highly aversive states. In addition, it suggests that affect labeling can be beneficial in high-intensity conditions. However, it should be used with caution in low-intensity conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4313289209,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in Malaysia is increasing, and most CRC patients are diagnosed at a late stage. This study investigated participant awareness of CRC and their perceptions and views about CRC screening, barriers, benefits, and facilitators towards CRC screening participation as well as health-seeking behaviour and the use of preventative health services.Eleven focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with a purposive sample of 89 participants aged > 50 from the major ethnic groups in the Segamat District, Johor State. FGDs were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.We identified trust in doctors as a key reason for whether or not to seek health care. Generally, the participants had low awareness of CRC sign/symptoms and screening. Emotional and logistic concerns about sending a stool sample to a clinic emerged as the main barriers to screening. Simplified illustrated instructions about stool collection in Malay, Chinese and Tamil, free screening at health clinics and reminders to complete the iFOBT test were perceived to facilitate engagement in screening, and posited as strategies that were likely to increase iFOBT uptake.Primary care physicians play a crucial role in terms of reducing patient's misperceptions, recommending screening to patients, enhancing attendance, and improving uptake of CRC screening. There is a need for further research to investigate ways in which to reduce identified barriers and implement and test potential facilitative strategies as well as examine adherence by doctors to clinical guidelines about CRC screening."

Opportunities for data breaches may also arise when working with non-study staff who are not on-site. We detail a free, user-friendly protocol for constructing indices of the neighborhood risk environment during multisite, clinic-based cohort studies that rely on participants' protected health information. This protocol can be implemented by study staff who do not have prior training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and can help minimize the operational costs of integrating geographic data into public health projects.This protocol demonstrates how to: (1) securely geocode patients' residential addresses in a clinic setting and match geocoded addresses to census tracts using Geographic Information System software (Esri, Redlands, CA); (2) ascertain contextual variables of the risk environment from the American Community Survey and ArcGIS Business Analyst (Esri, Redlands, CA); (3) use geoidentifiers to link neighborhood risk data to census tracts containing geocoded addresses; and (4) assign randomly generated identifiers to census tracts and strip census tracts of their geoidentifiers to maintain patient confidentiality.Completion of this protocol generates three neighborhood risk indices (i.e., Neighborhood Disadvantage Index, Murder Rate Index, and Assault Rate Index) for patients' coded census tract locations.This protocol can be used by research personnel without prior GIS experience to easily create objective indices of the neighborhood risk environment while upholding patient confidentiality. Future studies can adapt this protocol to fit their specific patient populations and analytic objectives."
https://openalex.org/W4313289343,"Parental age at conception often influences offspring’s longevity, a phenomenon referred as the “Lansing effect” described in large variety of organisms. But, the majority of the results refer to the survival of juveniles, mainly explained by an inadequate parental care by the elderly parents, mostly the mothers. Studies on the effect of parental age on offspring’s longevity in adulthood remain few, except in humans for whom effects of parental age vary according to statistical models or socioeconomic environments. In a small primate in which the longevity reaches up to 13 years, we investigated the effects of parental age at conception on the longevity of offspring (N = 278) issued from parents with known longevity. None of the postnatal parameters (body mass at 30 and 60 days after birth, size and composition of the litter) influenced offspring’s longevity. Mothers’ age at conception negatively affected offspring’s longevity in males but not in females. By contrast, fathers’ age at conception did not influence offspring’s longevity. Finally, the longevity of female offspring was significantly positively related to the longevity of both parents. Compared with current studies, the surprisingly minor effect of fathers ‘age was related to the high seasonal reproduction and the particular telomere biology of mouse lemurs."
https://openalex.org/W4313339503,"Fracture configuration is often more complex than is radiographically appreciable. The objective of this study is to describe the influence of pre-operative computed tomography (CT) for surgical planning in a variety of fracture types. This has not been described in previous studies.All cases with pre-operative radiographs, admitted for CT and surgical repair of a suspected limb fracture from January 2010-December 2020 were reviewed. CT was acquired under general anaesthesia in a multi-slice helical scanner; any surgery was then performed immediately. Three diplomates (two surgical; one diagnostic imaging) performed a blinded retrospective review of the radiographs and CT for each horse. A consensus decision was made on any change in surgical plan prior to and after CT review, and cases divided into three categories: CT of major, intermediate or minor relevance, as previously described by Genton et al, 2019.55 cases were collated. Thoroughbred racehorses predominated. The median age was 3 years. A diverse range of fractures were presented: proximal phalanx (18/55), carpal (17/55), metacarpal/tarsal (11/55), sesamoid (5/55), tarsal (3/55), and middle phalanx (1/55). In 13 of 55 cases (23.6%, 95% CI[12%,35%]) CT was of major relevance. In 21 of 55 cases CT was of intermediate relevance (38.2%, 95% CI[25%,51%]). In 21 of 55 cases CT was of minor relevance (38.2%, 95% CI[25%,51%]). A Fisher's exact test demonstrated no statistical difference in CT relevance between fracture types (p<0.05).This study demonstrates that CT has a significant role in surgical planning, and in the majority (61.8%) of cases added additional information or significantly changed the surgical plan. In all cases CT ensured confidence in surgical planning."
https://openalex.org/W4313339689,"The amygdala is a brain region with a complex internal structure that is associated with psychiatric disease. Methodological limitations have complicated the study of the internal structure of the amygdala in humans. In the current study we examined the functional connectivity between nine amygdaloid nuclei and existing resting-state networks using a high spatial-resolution fMRI dataset. Using data-driven analysis techniques we found that there were three main clusters inside the amygdala that correlated with the somatomotor, ventral attention and default mode networks. In addition, we found that each resting-state networks depended on a specific configuration of amygdaloid nuclei. Finally, we found that co-activity in the cortical-nucleus increased with the severity of self-rated fear in participants. These results highlight the complex nature of amygdaloid connectivity that is not confined to traditional large-scale divisions, implicates specific configurations of nuclei with certain resting-state networks and highlights the potential clinical relevance of the cortical-nucleus in future studies of the human amygdala."
https://openalex.org/W4313339979,"War and conflict environments result in long-term physical and psychological consequences. Sexual violence, displacement, malnutrition, death, illness, injury, torture, and disability are some of the physical effects, whereas stress, depression, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety are some of the emotional complications of war. Hence, evidence-based interventions are required particularly to monitor mental health disorders. Thus, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of perceived stress and its associated factors among people living in post-war situations, Northern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed among 812 samples from April 1 to May 15, 2022. The study participants were selected using a multistage sampling technique. The data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured and pre-tested tool. Data were cleaned and entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and transferred to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of perceived stress. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit was applied to test for model fitness and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.The prevalence of perceived stress was 76.1%, 95% CI (72.9-78.8). Age above 45 years (AOR (CI) = 2.45 (1.07-5.62), poor educational level (AOR (CI) = 5.92 (2.36-14.8), large family size (AOR (CI) = 0.48 (0.31-0.74), alcohol consumption (AOR (CI) = 0.63 (0.42-0.94), smoking (AOR (CI) = 0.17 (0.06-0.56), and exposure to multiple traumatic events (AOR (CI) = 2.38 (1.23-4.62) have shown a statistically significant association with perceived stress.This study revealed that more than three-fourths of participants living in post-war settings were found to have perceived stress. Older age, poor level of education, large family size, alcohol consumption, smoking, and the number of traumatic events were significant associates of perceived stress. Psychotherapy that can effectively address the medical, social, and psychological well-being of the community is important to reduce the burden of perceived stress."
https://openalex.org/W4313340522,"Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is characterized by balance impairment and mobility limitations, which both increase the risk of falling. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of a rehabilitation program aimed at increasing trunk and lower limb motor control on balance and walking abilities, and accomplishment of activities of daily living. In this exploratory study, a group-supervised rehabilitation program was performed three times a week for 8 weeks (two sessions at a rehabilitation gym and one pool session). Outcome measures included the Ottawa Sitting Scale, Berg Balance Scale, modified Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, 30-Second Chair Stand Test, 10-Meter Walk Test, Barthel Index, and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Significant improvements in balance, trunk control, maximal and self-selected walking speed difference, ataxia severity and accomplishment of specific activities of daily living were noted for the whole group at the end of the program. At the individual level, all participants improved beyond the standard error of measurement in at least two outcome measures. Also, most participants reported many perceived improvements related to balance, posture and functional mobility. This study provides encouraging results on the effects of a rehabilitation program for ambulatory people with ARSACS. Group intervention could have a positive impact on their daily lives and improve the health care service offered to this population. Future studies with larger sample sizes including control groups and other forms of ataxia are necessary to validate our results to generalize them."
https://openalex.org/W4313203441,"Walking is an important skill with positive impacts on health, function, and well-being. Many disorders impair walking and its positive impacts through a variety of complex and interrelated mechanisms. Any attempt to understand walking impairments, or the effects of interventions intended to treat these impairments, must respect this complexity. Therefore, our main objectives in conducting this study were to (1) propose a comprehensive model for quantifying the causes and consequences of walking impairments and (2) demonstrate the potential utility of the model for supporting clinical care and addressing basic scientific questions related to walking. To achieve these goals, we introduced a model, described by a directed acyclic graph, consisting of 10 nodes and 23 primary causal paths. We gave detailed descriptions of each node and path based on domain knowledge. We then demonstrated the model’s utility using a large sample of gait data (N = 9504) acquired as part of routine care at a regional referral center. We analyzed five relevant examples that involved many of the model’s nodes and paths. We computed causal effect magnitudes as Shapley values and displayed the overall importance of variables (mean absolute Shapley value), the variation of Shapley values with respect to underlying variables, and Shapley values for individual observations (case studies). We showed that the model was plausible, captured some well-known cause-effect relationships, provided new insights into others, and generated novel hypotheses requiring further testing through simulation or experiment. To aid in transparency, reproducibility, and future enhancements we have included an extensively commented Rmarkdown file and a deidentified data set."
https://openalex.org/W4313203500,"Background The COVID-19 epidemic has shown that efficient prediction models are required, and the well-known SI, SIR, and SEIR models are not always capable of capturing the real dynamics. Modified models with novel structures could help identify unknown mechanisms of COVID-19 spread. Objective Our objective is to provide additional insights into the COVID-19 spread mechanisms based on different models’ parameterization which was performed using evolutionary algorithms and the first-wave data. Methods Data from the Our World in Data COVID-19 database was analysed, and several models—SI, SIR, SEIR, SEIUR, and Bass diffusion—and their variations were considered for the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models’ parameters were tuned with differential evolution optimization method L-SHADE to find the best fit. The algorithm for the automatic identification of the first wave was developed, and the differential evolution was applied to model parameterization. The reproduction rates (R0) for the first wave were calculated for 61 countries based on the best fits. Results The performed experiments showed that the Bass diffusion model-based modification could be superior compared to SI, SIR, SEIR and SEIUR due to the component responsible for spread from an external factor, which is not directly dependent on contact with infected individuals. The developed modified models containing this component were shown to perform better when fitting to the first-wave cumulative infections curve. In particular, the modified SEIR model was better fitted to the real-world data than the classical SEIR in 43 cases out of 61, based on Mann–Whitney U tests; the Bass diffusion model was better than SI for 57 countries. This showed the limitation of the classical models and indicated ways to improve them. Conclusions By using the modified models, the mechanism of infection spread, which is not directly dependent on contacts, was identified, which significantly influences the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4313203642,"Psychosocial problems in children and youth are common and may negatively impact their lives and the lives of their families. Since general practitioners (GPs) play a crucial role in detecting and intervening in such problems, it is clinically necessary to improve our insight into their clinical decision-making (CDM). The objective of this study was to explore which mechanisms underlie GPs' everyday CDM and their options for management or referral.This was a mixed methods study in which qualitative (interview substudy) and quantitative (online survey substudy) data were collected from GPs. Using a question framework and vignettes representative of clinical practice, GPs' CDM was explored. GPs were selected by means of an academic research network and purposive sampling. Data collection continued in constant comparison between both substudies. Using grounded theory, data from both substudies were triangulated into a flowchart consisting of mechanisms and management/referral options.CDM-mechanisms were divided into three groups. GP-related mechanisms were GPs' primary approach of the problem (somatically or psychosocially) and their self-assessed competence to solve the problem based on interest in and knowledge about youth mental health care. Mechanisms related to the child and its social context included GPs' assessment whether there was psychiatric (co)morbidity, their sense of self-limitedness of the problem and assessed complexity of the problem. Whether GPs' had existing collaboration agreements with youth care providers and how they experienced their collaboration were collaboration-related mechanisms.The current study contributes to a relatively unexplored research area by revealing GP's in-depth thought processes regarding their CDM. However, existing research in this area supports the identified CDM mechanisms. Future initiatives should focus on validating CDM mechanisms in a larger population. If confirmed, mechanisms could be integrated into GP training and may offer guidelines for regulating proper access to mental health care services."

Furthermore, a model of a seismic simulation vibration table array system is critical to increasing the accuracy of seismic testing in laboratory settings. Herein a model of the nine subarray shaking table system is identified by recursive extension of the least square method, which is used to accurately identify the structure parameters by simulation of the structure assuming a single degree-of-freedom. Then, through the displacement of the empty shaking table and the application of the recursive least squares algorithm, the model of the seismic simulation vibration table array is established. Through this study, the vibration table model of different construction forms can be obtained, and the parameters that are difficult to measure for some complex structures can effectively be determined."
https://openalex.org/W4313203693,"Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) is a cosmopolitan bacterium that is often found in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic humans. However, N . meningitidis also causes meningeal inflammation and/or sepsis in humans with a periodic resurgence in incidence and high mortality rates. The pathogen is highly diverse genetically and antigenically, so that genotyping is considered important for vaccine matching to circulating strains. Annual incidence of meningococcal disease in Kazakhstan ranges between 0.2 and 2.5 cases per 100 thousand population. In total, 78 strains of N . meningitidis were isolated from clinical patients and contact persons during the years 2017–2018 in Kazakhstan. Of these, 41 strains including four from the patients and 37 from contacts, were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. In silico typing was completed using the Neisseria pipeline 1.2 on the Galaxy Workflow Management System and PubMLST. Whole genome SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) trees were built using BioNumerics 8. Seven-gene multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identified ten sequence types (ST), two of which have not been previously described (ST-16025; ST-16027). ST-16025 was detected in two patients with invasive meningococcal disease in 2017 and 2018 in Akmola region and 16 contacts in 2017 in Turkistan region. This prevalent type ST-16025 demonstrates considerable intertypic diversity as it consists of three subcomplexes with a distance of more than 2000 SNPs. Invasive and carrier strains belong to different serogroups (MenB and MenC), PorA and FetA_VR. Two invasive strains were MenB, one MenC and one MenW (Hajj lineage). The strains from the contact persons were: MenC (n = 18), cnl (n = 9), MenY (n = 7), MenW (n = 1), MenB (n = 1) and one unidentifiable. Different numbers of alleles were present: 12, 11, 7, and 7 alleles for PorA, FetA, fHbp, and NHBA, respectively. This study is the first report of the genetic diversity of N . meningitidis strains in Kazakhstan. Despite limitations with the studied sample size, important conclusions can be drawn based on data produced. This study provides evidence for regulatory authorities with regard to changing routine diagnostic protocols to increase the collecting of samples for WGS."
https://openalex.org/W4313203700,"We analyze whether oil price uncertainty and U.S. stock uncertainty can simultaneously provide additional information to volatility forecast of six major stock indexes. For model settings, we find not only the uncertainty information of previous day, but that of previous week and month will also provide incremental predictive power for the stock market volatility. Based on that, from in-sample and out-of-sample perspective, the empirical evidences imply separately incorporating oil price uncertainty into the model can significantly improve the stock market volatility forecasting performance, but the improvements vanish after controlling the effects of volatility spillover from U.S. stock market while the effect of U.S. stock uncertainty is nonnegligible and sustainable for stock volatility forecasting. We confirm this finding from average and dynamic perspective. We further proceed the process in longer-horizon volatility forecasting, the evidences cannot overturn our conclusion. This conclusion implies that we should be cautious about the stock volatility predictability based on the oil price uncertainty, which further provide some important implications for researchers, regulators and investors."
https://openalex.org/W4313203723,"Synovial fluid is composed of hyaluronan and proteoglycan-4 (PRG4 or lubricin), which work synergistically to maintain joint lubrication. In diseases like osteoarthritis, hyaluronan and PRG4 concentrations can be altered, resulting in lowered synovial fluid viscosity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations within the synovial fluid increase. Synovial fibroblasts within the synovium are responsible for contributing to synovial fluid and can be targeted to improve endogenous production of hyaluronan and PRG4 and to alter the cytokine profile. We cyclically loaded SW982 synoviocytes to 0%, 5%, 10%, or 20% strain for three hours at 1 Hz. To assess the impact of substrate stiffness, we compared the 0% strain group to cells grown on tissue culture plastic. We measured the expression of hyaluronan turnover genes, hyaluronan localization within the cell layer, hyaluronan concentration, PRG4 concentration, and the cytokine profile within the media. Our results show that the addition of cyclic loading increased HAS3 expression, but not in a magnitude-dependent response. Hyaluronidase expression was impacted by strain magnitude, which is exemplified by the decrease in hyaluronan concentration due to cyclic loading. We also show that PRG4 concentration is increased at 5% strain, while higher strain magnitude decreases overall PRG4 concentration. Finally, 10% and 20% strain show a distinct, more pro-inflammatory cytokine profile when compared to the unloaded group. Multivariate analysis showed distinct separation between certain strain groups in being able to predict strain group, hyaluronan concentration, and PRG4 concentration from gene expression or cytokine concentration data, highlighting the complexity of the system. Overall, this study shows that cyclic loading can be used tool to modulate the endogenous production of hyaluronan, PRG4, and cytokines from synovial fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W4313203742,"Value-added (VA) models are used for accountability purposes and quantify the value a teacher or a school adds to their students' achievement. If VA scores lack stability over time and vary across outcome domains (e.g., mathematics and language learning), their use for high-stakes decision making is in question and could have detrimental real-life implications: teachers could lose their jobs, or a school might receive less funding. However, school-level stability over time and variation across domains have rarely been studied together. In the present study, we examined the stability of VA scores over time for mathematics and language learning, drawing on representative, large-scale, and longitudinal data from two cohorts of standardized achievement tests in Luxembourg (N = 7,016 students in 151 schools). We found that only 34-38% of the schools showed stable VA scores over time with moderate rank correlations of VA scores from 2017 to 2019 of r = .34 for mathematics and r = .37 for language learning. Although they showed insufficient stability over time for high-stakes decision making, school VA scores could be employed to identify teaching or school practices that are genuinely effective-especially in heterogeneous student populations."
https://openalex.org/W4313203764,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of perfluoroalkyl substances on early embryonic development and apoptosis in blastocysts using a porcine in vitro model. Porcine oocytes (N = 855) collected from abattoir ovaries were subjected to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (0.1 μg/ml) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) (40 μg/ml) during in vitro maturation (IVM) for 45 h. The gametes were then fertilized and cultured in vitro, and developmental parameters were recorded. After 6 days of culture, resulting blastocysts (N = 146) were stained using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and imaged as stacks using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Proportion of apoptotic cells as well as total numbers of nuclei in each blastocyst were analyzed using objective image analysis. The experiment was run in 9 replicates, always with a control present. Effects on developmental parameters were analyzed using logistic regression, and effects on apoptosis and total numbers of nuclei were analyzed using linear regression. Higher cell count was associated with lower proportion of apoptotic cells, i.e., larger blastocysts contained less apoptotic cells. Upon PFAS exposure during IVM, PFHxS tended to result in higher blastocyst rates on day 5 post fertilization (p = 0.07) and on day 6 post fertilization (p = 0.05) as well as in higher apoptosis rates in blastocysts (p = 0.06). PFHxS resulted in higher total cell counts in blastocysts (p = 0.002). No effects attributable to the concentration of PFOS used here was seen. These findings add to the evidence that some perfluoroalkyl substances may affect female reproduction. More studies are needed to better understand potential implications for continued development as well as for human health."
https://openalex.org/W4313203800,"Food insecurity impacts childhood nutritional status, physical and cognitive development, and increases lifetime risk for chronic disease. Previous South African studies have examined hunger at the sub-national level without a specific focus on children and adolescents. This study determines the national prevalence of childhood food insecurity, from birth to adolescence, and identifies factors associated with hunger within the household. Individual and household-level data were extracted from the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1). Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) index. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted on all households (with and without children) to determine the predictors of food insecurity, with additional analyses adjusting for child dependency and sociodemographic characteristics of household heads in households with children. Of 5 098 households surveyed, 68.6% had children and adolescents present (0-19 years). Of these households, 32.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 29.5-35.7) were experiencing hunger and 26.3% (95% CI: 23.9-28.8) were at risk of hunger. Among all the households, significant associations for experiencing hunger were the presence of children and adolescents: Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.12-2.53); being female-headed: AOR = 1.53 (95% CI: 1.21-1.94) and informally-located; AOR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.07-2.43). Of the racial groups, having a non-African household head, Coloured: AOR = 0.29 (95% CI: 0.19-0.44) and White/Indian/Asian: AOR = 0.12 (95% CI: 0.04-0.33) conferred lower odds of experiencing hunger; and, the household head having secondary/tertiary education conferred lower odds of experiencing hunger; AOR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.28-0.56) as well as being at risk of hunger; AOR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52-0.92). Receiving social grants, pensions, or remittances more than doubled the odds of experiencing hunger; AOR = 2.15 (95% CI: 1.49-3.09). After adjusting for child dependency in households with children, having at least one older child (age 15-19 years old) did not change the odds of food insecurity. In summary, only 41% of South African households with children and adolescents were food secure. The associations between household head sociodemographics, household location and size on household food insecurity indicate a need for multi-sectoral interventions to bolster sustainable food systems for households with children and adolescents and to improve public protections for female-headed, African-headed and informally-located households dependent on social grants."
https://openalex.org/W4313203824,"Mild proximal-to-distal tapering of the fingers is a relatively common trait in humans. When more extreme, finger tapering is a feature observed in many genetic syndromes. The range of variation for finger tapering in the general population is not well understood, and sex differences in the degree of tapering, while suspected, have not been documented. Part of the difficulty is a lack of objective methods to evaluate finger tapering. In the present report, we developed a tapering index based on linear measures derived from digital hand scans. We measured this index in a sample of 166 male and 166 age-matched female adults. We then looked at correlations both among fingers and with demographic and anthropometric variables, followed by tests for sex differences. We observed weak correlations between tapering and age, height and weight. Correlations between pairs of fingers tended to be more in the moderate range and were highest among the middle three fingers (ranging from 0.34 to 0.64). Tapering tended to increase slightly moving radially across the hand from the fifth finger to the second finger. Males showed less tapering than females for all fingers, with statistically significant differences involving the left second finger (p = 0.003), left fifth finger (p< 0.001), right second finger (p = 0.038), and right fourth finger (p = 0.021). Finally, we established baseline norms for both males and females out to three standard deviations. Our results indicate that finger tapering is present, to some degree, in most of the population and that the trait can be measured using a relatively simple and non-invasive method. These findings may have relevance for fields as diverse as medical genetics, forensics, and industrial design."
https://openalex.org/W4313203878,"Countless social problems demand solutions, from climate change and gun control to poverty and systemic racism. But while some of these problems inspire action (e.g., ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Me Too"" movements), most fail to gain traction or inspire new policy. Why do some problems garner more attention and response? We suggest that the relative timing of related events may play an important role. Specifically, action may be more likely when related events are concentrated in time. A multi-method investigation tests this possibility. Study 1 borrows a modeling strategy from the economics and marketing literatures to examine a particularly important domain: gun control. Analysis of over 40 years of gun control legislation finds that, even after controlling for the frequency of mass shootings, bills are more likely to be proposed (and passed) when shootings are concentrated in time. Study 2 further tests concentration's causal impact and demonstrates that concentration increases support against sexual assault. These findings illustrate how a modeling approach commonly used to study advertising goodwill can be applied to a broader set of situations, suggest why some social problems are more likely to catalyze action, and shed light on drivers of social movements and collective action."

Previous work has developed quantitative approaches to characterize the progression of science in different fields, but how individual scientists make progress through their careers is not well understood at a comprehensive scale. We characterize the regularity in the temporal dynamics of scientists' publishing behavior with computational algorithms that predict the historical emerging order of publications from individual scientists. We discover that scientists publish in ways following the processes of chaining that mirror those observed in historical word meaning extension, whereby novel ideas emerge by connecting to existing ideas that are proximal in semantic space. We report findings for predominant exemplar-based chaining that reconstructs the emerging order in the publications of 1,164 award-winning and random-sampled scientists from the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Economics, and Computer Science over the past century. Our work provides large-scale evidence that scientists across different fields tend to share similar publishing behavior over time by taking incremental steps that build on their past research outputs."
https://openalex.org/W4313270895,"Background Women of African ancestry are highly predisposed to preeclampsia which continues to be a major cause of maternal death in Africa. Common variants in the APOL1 gene are potent risk factor for a spectrum of kidney disease. Recent studies have shown that APOL1 risk variants contribute to the risk of preeclampsia. The aim of the study is to understand the contribution of APOL1 risk variants to the development of preeclampsia in pregnant women in Ghana. Methods The study is a case-control design which started recruitment in 2019 at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. The study will recruit pregnant women with a target recruitment of 700 cases of preeclampsia and 700 normotensives. Clinical and demographic data of mother- baby dyad, with biospecimens including cord blood and placenta will be collected to assess clinical, biochemical and genetic markers of preeclampsia. The study protocol was approved by Korle Bu Teaching Hospital Institutional Review Board (Reference number: KBTH-IRB/000108/2018) on October 11, 2018. Preliminary results As of December 2021, a total of 773 mother-baby pairs had been recruited and majority of them had complete entry of data for analysis. The participants are made up of 384 preeclampsia cases and 389 normotensive mother-baby dyad. The mean age of participants is 30.69 ± 0.32 years for cases and 29.95 ± 0.32 for controls. Majority (85%) of the participants are between 20-30years. At booking, majority of cases had normal blood pressure compared to the time of diagnosis where 85% had a systolic BP greater than 140mmHg and a corresponding 82% had diastolic pressure greater than 90mmHg. Conclusion Our study will ultimately provide clinical, biochemical and genotypic data for risk stratification of preeclampsia and careful monitoring during pregnancy to improve clinical management and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4313271038,"Perioperative services comprise a large portion of hospital budgets; the procurement and processing of surgical inventories can be an area for optimization in operational inefficiency. Surgical instrument trays can be customized as procedure-specific or standardized as trays that can be used in numerous procedure types. We conducted an interventional study to determine the cost savings from standardizing laparoscopic surgery instrument trays. A single-period inventory optimization model was used to determine the configuration of a standardized laparoscopic (SL) tray and its minimal stock quantity (MSQ). Utilization of instruments on the general surgery, gynecology, and gynecological oncology trays was recorded, and daily demand for trays (mean, SD) was assessed using daily operating room (OR) case lists. Pre- and post-intervention costs were evaluated by reviewing procurement data and quantifying medical device reprocessing (MDR) and OR processes. The SL tray was trialled in the OR to test clinical safety and user satisfaction. Prior to standardization, the customized trays had a total inventory size of 391 instruments (mean instruments per tray: 17, range: 12-22). Daily demand was an MSQ of 23 trays. This corresponded to a procurement cost of $322,160 and reprocessing cost of $41,725. The SL tray (mean instruments per tray: 15, mean trays/day: 9.2 ± 3.2) had an MSQ of 17 trays/day. The total inventory decreased to 255 instruments, corresponding to a procurement cost of $266,900 with savings of $55,260 and reprocessing cost of $41,562 with savings of $163/year. After 33 trial surgeries, user satisfaction improved from 50% to 97% (p < .05). Standardization to a single SL tray using the inventory optimization model led to increased efficiency, satisfaction, and significant savings through aggregating specific service demands. The inventory optimization model could provide custom solutions for various institutions with the potential for large-scale financial savings. Thus, future work using this model at different centres will be necessary to validate these results."
https://openalex.org/W4313288859,"In the latest version of ISO 4037-1:2019 standard, the minimum dimension of a gamma radiation reference field was not clearly specified, which makes the construction of a minitype gamma reference radiation field lack of scientific basis. This paper carried out the research on the relationship between the scattering contribution and physical factors of the reference radiation regulated by ISO 4037-1. LS-SVM was applied to construct the relational model between physical factors and scattering contribution based on the data simulated by Monte Carlo method. Then the minimum dimension of collimated reference radiation field is obtained by PSO algorithm. For Co-60 source, the minimum size of the radiation field obtained is 93 cm(L)×40 cm(W)×40 cm(H). For Cs-137 source, the minimum size of the radiation field obtained is 153 cm(L)×47 cm (W)×47 cm(H). The results meet the requirements of the standard based on the model and provides a technical reference for the design of a minitype reference radiation field."

The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism of CG and government green subsidies(GS) on green innovation(GI). In this regard, we integrated signaling theory and principal-agent theory to provide a new theoretical perspective for simultaneously focus on the impact of external resource acquisition and internal resource allocation on GI. We conducted a threshold regression analysis on the balanced panel data of 863 listed companies of China from 2016 to 2019 to clarify the input boundary between the promoting and inhibiting effects of corporate CG on corporate GI. And we further explored the relationship between GS and GI under the effect of different CG thresholds. Our findings indicate that there is an inverted U-shaped threshold effect of CG on GI. The impact of GS on GI shows a decreasing marginal benefit as the intensity of CG increases. Based on the findings, we propose corresponding countermeasures for the management of enterprises and the government."
https://openalex.org/W4313289429,"Ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) are triterpenoids. They are used to treat numerous diseases, including tuberculosis. Combinations of these drugs provide new insight into the management of tuberculosis. The major obstacle is the effective delivery of these drugs to the lungs, which are mainly affected due to M. tuberculosis. A metered-dose inhaler (MDI) was developed to address this issue containing UA and OA, followed by in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation.In the present study, MDI formulation was prepared by incorporating UA and OA at the dose level of 120 μg/ml in each actuation. In-vitro evaluation of this MDI formulation was performed to ensure its suitability to deliver UA and OA preciously. With prior approval of IAEC, a pharmacokinetic and acute inhalation toxicity study was conducted using MDI on Wistar rats.The pharmacokinetic study showed an increased biological half-life of UA (9.23±0.104 h) and OA (8.93±0.166 h) in combination therapy. In-vivo toxicity study demonstrated no adverse effects on body weight and vital organs in the treatment group compared with the control group. Histopathology examination of these essential organs showed no abnormalities. Mild alternation in the biochemical and hematological parameters was observed. However, these alterations did not affect the overall health of the animals.The present study documents a detailed study for the safety and pharmacokinetics of UA and OA in-vivo for their advanced application in tuberculosis disease."
https://openalex.org/W4313289611,"When listening to distorted speech, does one become a better listener by looking at the face of the speaker or by reading subtitles that are presented along with the speech signal? We examined this question in two experiments in which we presented participants with spectrally distorted speech (4-channel noise-vocoded speech). During short training sessions, listeners received auditorily distorted words or pseudowords that were partially disambiguated by concurrently presented lipread information or text. After each training session, listeners were tested with new degraded auditory words. Learning effects (based on proportions of correctly identified words) were stronger if listeners had trained with words rather than with pseudowords (a lexical boost), and adding lipread information during training was more effective than adding text (a lipread boost). Moreover, the advantage of lipread speech over text training was also found when participants were tested more than a month later. The current results thus suggest that lipread speech may have surprisingly long-lasting effects on adaptation to distorted speech."
https://openalex.org/W4313339951,"Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) classified as obesity constitute 27.7% of U.S. workers. These individuals are more likely to experience work-related injuries. However, ergonomists still design work tasks based on the general population and normal body weight. This is particularly true for manual lifting tasks and the calculation of recommended weight limits (RWL) as per National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) guidelines. This study investigates the effects of BMI on indicators of physiological stress. It was hypothesized that, for clinically elevated BMI individuals, repeated manual lifting at RWL would produce physiological stress above safety limits. A repetitive box lifting task was designed to measure metabolic parameters: volume of carbon dioxide (VCO2) and oxygen (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate (HR), and energy expenditure rate (EER). A two-way ANOVA compared metabolic variables with BMI classification and gender, and linear regressions investigated BMI correlations. Results showed that BMI classification represented a significant effect for four parameters: VCO2 (p < 0.001), VO2 (p < 0.001), HR (p = 0.012), and EER (p < 0.001). In contrast, gender only had a significant effect on VO2 (p = 0.014) and EER (p = 0.017). Furthermore, significant positive relationships were found between BMI and VCO2 (R2 = 59.65%, p < 0.001), VO2 (R2 = 45.01%, p < 0.001), HR (R2 = 21.86%, p = 0.009), and EER (R2 = 50.83%, p < 0.001). Importantly, 80% of obese subjects exceeded the EER safety limit of 4.7 kcal/min indicated by NIOSH. Indicators of physiological stress are increased in clinically elevated BMI groups and appear capable of putting these individuals at increased risk for workplace injury."
https://openalex.org/W4313340089,"Research that seeks to compare two predictive models requires a thorough statistical approach to draw valid inferences about comparisons between the performance of the two models. Researchers present estimates of model performance with little evidence on whether they reflect true differences in model performance. In this study, we apply two statistical tests, that is, the 5 × 2 -fold cv paired t -test, and the combined 5 × 2 -fold cv F -test to provide statistical evidence on differences in predictive performance between the Fine-Gray (FG) and random survival forest (RSF) models for competing risks. These models are trained on different scenarios of low-dimensional simulated survival data to determine whether the differences in their predictive performance that exist are indeed significant. Each simulation was repeated one hundred times on ten different seeds. The results indicate that the RSF model is superior in predictive performance in the presence of complex relationships (quadratic and interactions) between the outcome and its predictors. The two statistical tests show that the differences in performance are significant in quadratic simulation but not significant in interaction simulations. The study has also revealed that the FG model is superior in predictive performance in linear simulations and its differences in predictive performance compared to the RSF model are significant. The combined 5 × 2 -fold cv F -test has lower type I error rates compared to the 5 × 2 -fold cv paired t -test."
https://openalex.org/W4313340167,"Campus mass shootings have become a pressing policy and public health matter. Twitter is a platform used for processing events among interested community members. Examining the responses of invested community members to a mass shooting on a college campus provides evidence for how this type of violence affects the immediate community and the larger public. These responses may reflect either content (e.g. context-specific) or emotions (e.g. humor). Aims Using Twitter data, we analyzed the emotional responses as well as the nature of non-affective short-term reactions, in response to the April 2019 shooting at UNC Charlotte. Methods Drawn from a pool of tweets between 4/30/19-5/7/19, we analyzed 16,749 tweets using keywords related to the mass shooting (e.g. ""shooting,"" ""gun violence,"" ""UNC Charlotte""). A coding team manually coded the tweets using content and sentiment analyses. Results Overall, 7,148 (42.67%) tweets contained negative emotions (e.g. anger, sadness, disgust, anxiety), 5,088 (30.38%) contained positive emotions (e.g. humor, hope, appreciation), 14,892 (88.91%) were communal responses to the shooting (e.g. prayers, healing, victim remembrance), 8,329 (49.73%) were action-oriented (e.g. action taken, policy advocacy), and 15,498 (92.53%) included information (e.g. death/injury, news). All tweets except positive emotions peaked one day following the incident. Conclusions Our findings point to peaks in most emotions in the 24 hours following the event, with the exception of positive emotions which peaked one day later. Social media responses to a campus shooting suggest college preparedness for immediate deployment of supportive responses in the case of campus violence is needed."
