https://openalex.org/W1971253162,"The feeding behavior of three species of spionid polychaetes varied with water velocity. At moderate flows the worms ceased deposit feeding, formed their feeding tentacles into helices, and lifted them into the water column to capture material in suspension. This behavior was apparently a response to increased flux of suspended matter at high flows rather than to flow velocity alone. Organisms capable of switching their feeding behavior may be common in dynamically variable benthic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2066518452,"Dark-active North American fireflies emit green bioluminescence and dusk-active species emit yellow, in general. Yellow light and yellow visual spectral sensitivity may be adaptations to increase the signal-to-noise (that is, foliage-reflected ambient light) ratio for sexual signaling during twilight. The peaks of the electroretinogram visual spectral sensitivities of four species tested, two dark- and two dusk-active, correspond with the peak of their bioluminescent emissions."

https://openalex.org/W2020648580,The previously reported uplift in southern California may have resulted from systematic errors in leveling rather than tectonic activity. Errors are inferred from correlation between changes in elevation and topography at short and long wavelengths. Corrected data show no significant vertical motion except at the time of the San Fernando earthquake. Possible sources of error include inadequate rod calibration and refraction.
https://openalex.org/W1997146888,"A method is described for the synthesis of ethane from hydrogen that is at present used for the counting of low-level tritium activity at the La Jolla tritium laboratory. The reaction procedure is simple and involves the mixing of the hydrogen with acetylene over a colloidal palladium catalyst. Counting characteristics of ethane are found to be ideal. With a 1-liter counter filled to three atmospheres of ethane, only a tenfold tritium enrichment is necessary in order to obtain a sensitivity of 0.32 counts per minute per tritium unit."

https://openalex.org/W1972002868,"Texcocan-Aztec peoples in the Valley of Mexico used both picture symbols and lines and dots for numerical notation. Decipherment and analysis of mid-16th-century native pictorial land documents from the Texcocan region indicate that the line-and-dot system incorporated a symbol for zero and used position to ascribe values. Positional line-and-dot notation was used to record areas of agricultural fields, and analysis of the documentary data suggests that areas were calculated arithmetically. These findings demonstrate that neither positional notation nor the zero were unique to the Maya area, and they imply an equally sophisticated mathematical development among the Aztecs."
https://openalex.org/W2049009152,Crystalline authigenic dolomite in shallow-water marine sediments from the margins of the North American continent is described for the first time. Dolomite is probably forming at the water-sediment interface in Florida Bay because of an interaction between organic material and hypersaline sea water.
https://openalex.org/W2021255150,"An apparatus for mass culture of photosynthetic microorganisms has been developed to grow algae for use as foods for larval and juvenile mollusks in studies of their physiological requirements. The apparatus consists of a series of 5-gal growth chambers, and the system can be enlarged to yield any desired volume of algae by replication of basic units. Approximately 50 lit. of algal suspension, averaging about 0.5 ml of packed wet cells per liter, are produced daily."

https://openalex.org/W1898947512,"The startling claim that Earth has frozen over from pole to pole for millions of years at a time, a hypothesis widely known as the ""snowball Earth"" scenario, has intrigued many earth scientists but as yet convinced few. But the theory, which would explain some previously inexplicable observations from the Neoproterozoic era 600 million to 700 million years ago, is gaining adherents. Last year, for example, most researchers agreed that one part of the sweeping hypothesis--the claim that glaciers once flowed into ice-covered tropical seas--is correct, even though this idea had been rebuffed for more than 30 years."

https://openalex.org/W1968092549,"A voluntary system of prior restraints on research publications in cryptography was approved this month by the Public Cryptography Study Group, most of whose nine members represent professional societies in mathematics and computer science. The system will be tried for 2 years, reports Daniel Schwartz, the general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA). If, after that time, the process is not found to be “useful and efficient,” the NSA may decide to seek legislative authority for mandatory restraints."
