https://openalex.org/W1575172090,"Detergent-lysed BS-C-1, HeLa, and mouse L cells incorporate ADP-ribose from NAD+ into two classes of macromolecules. Metabolically stable products, which appear to be a variety of proteins to which are attached one or a few ADP-ribose residues, predominate when the cellular DNA remains intact. In addition, ghost cells have a potentially much greater capacity to synthesize poly(ADP-ribose), which is completely dependent upon the introduction of strand breaks into their DNA. The initial rate of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis increases linearly with prior x-ray dose or with the concentration of endonuclease added and, once synthesized, the polymer is rapidly degraded with a half-life of 10 min or less. It appears that sites on the DNA capable of supporting a certain amount of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis are created as a result of x-irradiation or nucleolytic cleavage and are rapidly eliminated, or repaired, during subsequent incubation. The sites accumulate if cells are irradiated at 0 degree C; further incubation of the lysed cells with NAD+ at 35 degrees C results in both a burst of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis and the elimination of the sites. NAD+ enhances the elimination of x-ray-induced sites. Thus, the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) may be required for the repair of DNA strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W1942790970,"Abstract 1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, derived chemically from choline plasmalogens of beef heart, has been shown to possess powerful antihypertensive activity (Blank, M. L., Synder, F., Byers, L. W., Brooks, B., and Muirhead, E. E. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 90, 1194-1200) and to be an extremely potent platelet-activating factor (Demopoulos, C. C., Pinckard, R. N., and Hanahan, D. J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9355-9358). In the present study, microsomal preparations of rat spleen were shown to synthesize 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by an acetyl-CoA:1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetyltransferase reaction; the acetyltransferase appears to be different from the acyltransferase responsible for the transfer of palmitate to glycerolipids. The apparent Km for acetyl-CoA was 67 microM; the optimal concentration of 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was 30 microM. Higher concentrations of the lyso substrate were inhibitory. When acetyl-CoA (100 microM) and 1-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (30 microM) were incubated wih spleen microsomes under optimal conditions, the specific activity was approximately 10 nmol of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/min/mg of protein. Although the reaction was inhibited by the addition of EDTA or EGTA to the incubation mixture, the acetyltransferase did not appear to require a divalent cation. An acyl analog, 1-palmitoyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, also served as a substrate for the acetyltransferase; however, the unnatural isomer, 3-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine, did not. The acetyltransferase activity was found in a variety of tissues, but the spleen had the highest activity of the tissues examined; lung, lymph nodes, and thymus also had high activities. Identification of the product and the possible physiological importance of the pathway are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1567594253,"NMR spectral analysis of the novel amino acid, diphthamide, in elongation factor 2 which is ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin suggests that it is 2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]histidine. Ribosyl-diphthamide was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis of ADP-ribosyl-elongation factor 2 and three compounds were produced by its chemical hydrolysis (Van Ness, B. G., Howard, J. B., and Bodley, J. W. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 10717-10720). Proton NMR spectroscopy in 2H2O of diphthine demonstrated the elements of histidine minus the carbon 2 proton plus 14 additional nonexchangeable protons. These protons were attributed to an extensive modification at carbon 2 of the imidazole ring. Proton NMR spectroscopy in 2H2O of ribosyl-diphthamide showed only those protons seen in diphthine plus those expected of a ribofuranosylmoiety. Chemical shift dependence on pH was demonstrated for the histidine-derived protons as well as several protons of the modifying side chain. Natural abundance carbon 13 NMR spectroscopy of ribosyldiphthamide also showed the elements of histidine and ribose plus 7 additional carbon atoms attributed to the modification of the imidazole ring. Based on the NMR spectral properties of the anomeric proton of ribosyldiphthamide we propose that the ribose is linked to one of the nitrogens of the histidine imidazole ring."
https://openalex.org/W1533165549,"Deoxycholate treatment of horse platelets previously labeled in their phospholipids with [14C]arachidonate produces selective conversion of [14C]phosphatidylinositol (PI) to [14C]1,2-diacylglycerol. This phospholipase C activity, which has a pH optimum of 7.5, is specific for phosphatidylinositol since other phospholipids or neutral lipids are not affected. Although exogenous Ca2+ is not required for activity, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N-tetraacetic acid or EDTA abolishes phosphatidylinositol degradation. However, in the presence of added Ca2+, other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) are also degraded but by a phospholipase A2 activity. This activity generates the respective lyso-derivatives as well as various [14C]arachidonate metabolites. The phospholipase A2 activity is further enhanced by increasing the pH (7.5 to 9.5), a condition which severely suppresses the phospholipase C activity. Most of the platelet phospholipase A2 activity is associated with the particulate fractions of the cell, while the phospholipase C activity appears to be almost completely restricted to the soluble fraction. Deoxycholate treatment of the particulate fractions results in cleavage by phospholipase A2 of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not of phosphatidylinositol. The preferred substrates for platelet phospholipase A2 appear to be phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine, while phosphatidylinositol seems to be degraded nearly exclusively by phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1538260006,"Isolated microfilament cores of intestinal microvilli are known to contain actin and four major associated proteins among which is calmodulin. Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that calmodulin is present in the microvilli prior to biochemical fractionation of intestinal cells and thus is not bound artifactually during the isolation procedure. Identification of the major microvillus calmodulin-binding protein was achieved by the use of an [125I]calmodulin gel overlay technique. Proteins of microvilli or brush borders were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After removal of sodium dodecyl sulfate, direct binding of radiolabeled calmodulin to the separated polypeptides was assayed by autoradiography. Three calmodulin-binding polypeptides are detected in brush borders. Two polypeptides (apparent Mr = 280,000 and 140,000) show Ca2+ -dependent binding, whereas the third polypeptide (Mr = 110,000) can bind calmodulin in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Microvillus core filaments contain only the latter species. Microvillus cores treated with 25 mM Mg2+ retain calmodulin and the 110,000 polypeptide, whereas the other two associated proteins are greatly reduced, consistent with the hypothesis that the 110,000 protein is the major calmodulin-binding protein of the core filament structure. We discuss the currently documentable structure of the core filaments and evaluate the general usefulness of the calmodulin gel overlay technique."
https://openalex.org/W1517742055,"Addition of [3H]palmitic acid to chick embryo fibroblasts labeled a set of membrane proteins that was distinct from those proteins labeled with [3H]leucine or [3H]mannose when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The palmitate label, but not the mannose or leucine label, was removed from the proteins by treating electropherograms with hydroxylamine prior to fluorographic analysis. This result and other data indicate that the fatty acid labeling of cell proteins was analogous to that recently described for fatty acid acylation of three virus membrane glycoproteins. Mouse and human cultured cell lines show a similar set of protein-bound fatty acid, and we propose that fatty acid acylation is a general cellular activity that modifies proteins destined to become membrane-bound."
https://openalex.org/W1560768773,"The decrement in functional capacity of the nicotinic receptor on intact BC3H-1 cells has been simultaneously compared with the fractional occupation of the receptor by cobra alpha-toxin. A parabolic, concave inward relationship between the fractional occupation of receptors by alpha-toxin and the decrement in permeability response is observed when the latter is tested over a range of agonist concentrations. Since alpha-toxin binding appears equivalent at each site on the receptor, the observed relationship is accommodated by a model where activation of a permeability response requires agonist occupation of two toxin-binding sites per functional receptor. Furthermore, the binding of alpha-toxin and agonist appears to be mutually exclusive, but occupation of either of the two sites by alpha-toxin is sufficient to block the functional capacity of the receptor. Consistent with this model, when a major fraction of sites is occupied by alpha-toxin, the concentration dependence for either carbamylcholine-mediated activation or desensitization of the remaining functional receptors is not detectably altered and retains positive cooperativity. In contrast, progressive occupation of the available sites by alpha-toxin leads to a decrease in apparent affinity and a corresponding loss of positive cooperation for agonist occupation functions generated upon instantaneous or following equilibrium exposure to the agonist. At high degrees of fractional occupancy to alpha-toxin, where the dominant species capable of binding agonist would contain a single bound toxin molecule, the Hill coefficient for the equilibrium occupation function for full agonists falls from a value of 1.4 to 0.7. By contrast, the binding isotherms for antagonists which typically exhibit values less than 1.0 are not altered following fractional irreversible occupation by alpha-toxin. Thus, the two binding sites on the receptor oligomer are not intrinsically equivalent for the binding of agonists and reversible antagonists. A scheme for desensitization of the receptor is presented which incorporates both nonequivalence in the two agonist binding-sites and the maintenance of symmetry in the receptor states undergoing transitions."
https://openalex.org/W1561752316,"The amounts of intracellular nucleotides of dThd and dUrd were measured in cultured human lymphoblasts with and without treatment with methotrexate (plus hypoxanthine) to inhibit thymidylate synthetase. dTTP fell from approximately 40 pmol/10(6) cells (untreated) to approximately 1 pmol/10(6) cells with drug treatment. dUMP, increased approximately 10(3)-fold with methotrexate. dUTP was not detected in the cell without drug treatment (less than or equal to 0.3 fmol/10(6) cells), but was easily measured at approximately 0.2 pmol/10(6) cells in drug-inhibited cells. Thus the ratio dUTP/dTTP incrased from less than or equal to 10(-5) in untreated cells to approximately 0.2 in cells treated with methotrexate, indicating that dUMP may be incorporated in substantial amounts into the DNA of the drug-treated cells. The magnitude of these effects on nucleotide pools suggests the possibility that the normal nucleolytic mechanism for removal of dUMP from DNA may play a part in the toxic effects on the cell that result from depression of thymidylate synthetase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585822492,"Since ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate cause an increase in the lateral mobility of integral membrane proteins in the erythrocyte (Schindler, M., Koppel, D., and Sheetz, M. P. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 1457-1461), we have studied their effects on the membrane skeletal complex or shell (composed of spectrin, actin, and bands 4.1 (78,000 daltons) and 4.9 (50,000 daltons)) and its interaction with the erythrocyte membrane. Both phosphate compounds dissociated the delipidated shell complex, with half-maximal dissociation at 2.5 mM 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and 8 mM ATP, whereas equivalent concentrations of EDTA did not. Concomitant with complex dissociation, spectrin was solubilized but band 4.1 and actin remained in a complexed or polymeric form. When proteins which were involved in linking spectrin to the membrane were present on the shell, higher concentrations of the phosphate compounds still dissociated the complex but less spectrin was solubilized. Treatment of erythrocyte membranes with the same phosphate compounds caused membrane vesiculation but no proteins were solubilized. We suggest that ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, at concentrations which are normally present in erythrocytes, can weaken associations in the shell but will not dissociate the complex from membrane attachment sites."
https://openalex.org/W1548124641,"meso-alpha,epsilon-Diaminopimelate D-dehydrogenase, which has been purified to homogeneity from the extract of Bacillus sphaericus IFO 3525, has a molecular weight of about 80,000 and consists of two subunits identical in molecular weight (approximately 40,000). The enzyme has a high substrate specificity. In addition to meso-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate, lanthionine is deaminated by the enzyme to a far lesser extent. NADP+ is the exclusive cofactor. The pH optima were at about 10.5 for the deamination of meso-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate and at 7.5 for its amination. L and D isomers of alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate and meso-alpha,delta-diaminoadipate competitively inhibit the oxidation of meso-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies show that the reductive amination proceeds through a sequential ordered ternary-binary mechanism. NADPH binds first to the enzyme followed by L-alpha-amino-epsilon-ketopimelate and ammonia, and the products are released in the order of meso-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate and NADP+. The Michaelis constants are as follows: meso-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate (2.5 mM), NADP+ (83 micro M), NADPH (0.2 mM), L-alpha-amino-epsilon-ketopimelate (0.24 mM), and ammonia (12.5 mM). The pro-S hydrogen at C-4 of the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADPH is transferred to the substrate; the enzyme is B-stereospecific. Fluorometric study on binding of NADPH to the enzyme revealed that the enzyme contains two coenzyme binding sites per molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1602995063,"A protease-resistant functional polypeptide domain of fibronectin that contains a heparin-binding site has been purified from chick cellular fibronectin following pronase digestion, heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and molecular sieve chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. This polypeptide migrates as a single band of apparent Mr = 50,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with or without reduction by dithiothreitol. It has a Stokes radius of 35 to 37 A and a calculated frictional ratio of 1.4 to 1.5. Its amino acid composition is unusual in that cysteine and methionine constitute only 1 and 2 mol/mol of the polypeptide, respectively. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence is Glu-Asp-Asp. In contrast to intact fibronectin, the heparin-binding polypeptide contains virtually no neutral sugars. This 50,000-dalton domain is inactive in four bioassays for intact fibronectin, including hemagglutination, spreading of cells on tissue culture plastic, restoration of alignment of tumor cells, and attachment of cells to collagen. Moreover, excess amounts of this polypeptide do not inhibit the activity of intact fibronectin in all of these assays; these results suggest that the heparin-binding domain does not contain a cell surface-binding site. This domain of fibronectin appears to be a unique region free of carbohydrate that is a globular, protease-resistant functional site."
https://openalex.org/W1507616016,"The long-term incubation of 125I-thrombin with cultured human endothelial cells is studied and compared to the previously described rapid equilibrium binding in this system (Awbrey, B. J., Hoak, J. C., and Owen, W. G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4092-4095). Following rapid initial binding of thrombin, a much slower association of thrombin with endothelium is seen. As opposed to equilibrium binding, this process is 1) irreversible, 2) active-site specific, and 3) associated with covalent linkage to an Mr 30,000 protein. In addition this nonequilibrium binding appears unrelated to high-affinity equilibrium binding since blocking the high-affinity binding sites with diisopropylphosphoryl thrombin has no effect on nonequilibrium binding. The physiological role of this process is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1483852862,"DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7) beta was purified to near homogeneity from chick embryos. The final preparation has a specific enzyme activity of 1,100,000 units (nanomoles of dTMP incorporation/h) per mg of protein with (rA)n X (dT)12-18 as a template-primer. The molecular weight of DNA polymerase beta is about 40,000 as judged by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 column. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the polypeptide of Mr = 40,000 accounted for 95% of total protein in the final preparation. The fingerprint analysis of tryptic peptides of polypeptide shows that 14 out of 24 125I-peptides from the Mr = 40,000 polypeptide are the same as those of the Mr = 40,000 polypeptide of DNA polymerase beta purified from rat ascites hepatoma cells. A Mr = 27,000 polypeptide, which was present in the less pure preparation, did not show any structure similar to Mr = 40,000 polypeptides from rat and chick cells. Thus, it is concluded that chick embryo DNA polymerase beta consists of a single polypeptide of Mr = 40,000. The minimal number of DNA polymerase beta molecules per chick embryo cell was estimated as about 5,000."

https://openalex.org/W1495805312,"Native mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (AATase) is cleaved selectively by trypsin at the peptide bonds after Arg 26 or after Lys 31 yielding two shortened enzyme derivatives, AATase 27-410, and AATase 32-410. Recent x-ray crystallographic determination of the spatial structure of AATase has shown that the NH2-terminal segments of the two polypeptide chains of this dimeric enzyme pass in front of the active site clefts and form two separate junctions with the neighboring subunit which are not contiguous with the main subunit interface (Eichele, G., Ford, G. C., Glor, M., Jansonius, J. N., Mavrides, C., and Christen, P. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 133, 161-180). The peptide bonds cleaved by trypsin are situated in the following stretch of the polypeptide chain which runs in exposed position on the surface of the subunit. The split-off peptide is lost during gel filtration. The molecular activity of AATase 27/32-410 (a mixture of about equal amounts of the two not readily separable derivatives) is about 3% of that of the native enzyme. In contrast, the K'm values for aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate are unchanged, indicating an unaltered geometry of the substrate binding site. A substantially diminished syncatalytic response of the reactivity of Cys 166 toward 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) suggests that the decrease in catalytic activity is due to an interference with the syncatalytic conformational dynamics observed previously in AATase (Gehring, H., and Christen, P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 3158-3163). Consonant with a role of the NH2-terminal segment in propagating the syncatalytic conformational rearrangements the rate of the tryptic cleavage is retarded 4-fold in the presence of the transaminating substrate pair aspartate and oxalacetate."
https://openalex.org/W1537468697,"Rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase when activated with phenylalanine becomes catalytically competent. In the experiments presented, the stoichiometry of binding of phenylalanine to activated rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase was measured. It was found 1) that there is 1 phenylalanine activation site/subunit of catalytically active enzyme, implying 4 activation sites/active phenylalanine hydroxylase molecule (tetramer); 2) that tryptophan (which is also a substrate for this enzyme) will not bind at the activation site, demonstrating that the activation site and catalytic site of the enzyme are not identical; additional indirect evidence suggests that the activation site and catalytic site of the enzyme do not physically overlap at all; and 3) that lysolecithin (which can also activate this enzyme) and phenylalanine do not appear to directly compete for the same activation site. An amino acid analysis of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase is presented; also, an addition to the purification procedure for phenylalanine hydroxylase (Shiman, R., Gray, D. W., and Pater, A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11300-11306) is described that allows one to obtain electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme of apparently 100% purity."
https://openalex.org/W1566104504,"When carbamyl phosphate is synthesized by isolated liver mitochondria in the absence of ornithine, the following is observed. 1. Carbamyl phosphate synthesis is progressively inhibited during the first 2 min of incubation, after which it reaches a steady rate which is 8% of that observed with ornithine. 2. Within 2 min, carbamyl phosphate accumulates in the matrix to very high levels (16 nmol/microliter) which are inhibitory to carbamyl phosphate synthetase; afterwards the levels decline, and by 15 min they are essentially the same as those found in the presence of ornithine (3 to 4 nmol/microliter). 3. The decrease in matrix carbamyl phosphate is the result of decreased synthesis and of leakage from mitochondria; 90% of the total carbamyl phosphate is in the medium after 10 min. 4. Addition of ornithine after 5 to 15 min results in rates of carbamyl phosphate synthesis essentially identical with those found when ornithine is added at the start of the incubation. 5. ATP synthesis appears to be somewhat inhibited. 6. When the accumulation of carbamyl phosphate in the medium is prevented by converting that compound to carbamyl aspartate, the total synthesis of carbamyl phosphate is not increased. Three factors appears to be involved in the low capacity of mitochondria to synthesize carbamyl phosphate in the absence of ornithine: a. inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthetase by matrix carbamyl phosphate early in incubations; b. slight inhibition of ATP synthesis throughout the incubations; c. quantitatively most important, a very low activity of carbamyl phosphate synthetase even when matrix carbamyl phosphate is low and ATP is not limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1489499052,"We have studied the specific binding of 1,3,5(10)-estratrien-2,3,17 beta-triol (2-hydroxyestradiol) to an enriched membrane fraction isolated from the rat anterior pituitary gland. Specific [6,7-(3)H]2-hydroxyestradiol-17 beta ([3H]2-hydroxyestradiol) binding is saturable and displays a high and low affinity binding component. The apparent dissociation constants, KD, are 4 +/- 2 x 10(-10) and 2 x 10(-6) M with 13 fmol and 2.6 pmol bound/mg of protein, respectively. The specific high affinity binding increases linearly with increasing amounts of tissue protein. The binding is both temperature- and pH-dependent, with maximal binding at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. The 2-hydroxyestradiol binding is shown to be stereospecific. Dopamine and spiroperidol (a dopamine antagonist) competitively inhibit the specific binding of [3H]2-hydroxyestradiol to the high affinity binding site with inhibition constants, KI, of 1 x 10(-6) M and 2 x 10(-5) M, respectively. Related catecholestrogens (2-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestriol) are also competitive inhibitors of [3H]2-hydroxyestradiol binding with KI values of 1.5 x 10(-5) M and 1.9 x 10(-5) M, respectively. None of the estrogens (estrone, estradiol, estriol) or 2-methoxyestrogen derivatives (2-methoxyestrone, 2-methoxyestradiol, 2-methoxyestriol) inhibits [3H]2-hydroxyestradiol binding at concentrations up to 10(-4) M. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin are also ineffective as inhibitors at concentrations of 10(-5) M and inhibited less than 20% at 10(-4) M. Centrifugation through a stepwise discontinuous sucrose density gradient is used to separate subcellular components of the anterior pituitary cells. Approximately 90 per cent of the specific [3H]2-hydroxyestradiol binding is associated with the material at the 47.4 to 52.9% sucrose interface, the layer most highly enriched for 5'-nucleotidase (an enzyme marker for plasma membranes). Studies of tissue specificity indicate that specific 2-hydroxyestradiol binding sites are heterogeneously distributed in nervous tissue with the highest concentration of binding sites in the anterior pituitary, cerebral cortex, and hypothalamus and lower levels found in the thalamus and striatum. Low levels 2-hydroxyestradiol binding sites are also identified in liver and uterus. The present demonstration of specific 2-hydroxyestradiol binding to the anterior pituitary membrane provides information on the mechanism of catecholestrogen action."
https://openalex.org/W1600102186,"Membrane-associated binding sites with high affinity and specificity for estrogens have been identified in calf uterine microsomes. The binding of 17 beta-[3H]estradiol is specific and saturable at low hormone concentration (2 nM) of high affinity (Kd = 0.5 nM) and sensitive to trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes. Binding of [3H]estradiol to membranes is inhibited by low concentrations of unlabeled 17 beta-estradiol and diethylstilbestrol (50 to 100 pM) while high concentrations of nonestrogenic steroids have little effect. The nondisplaceable binding is low and never exceeds 15% at the half-maximal point of specific binding. The maximum amount of ligand bound per mg of membrane protein is in the range of 0.4 to 1.0 pmol. Specific estradiol binding associated with microsomal fractions varies between 7 to 15% of the total binding sites. Estradiol appears not to be metabolized to any significant extent after binding to uterine membranes. Whereas the affinities of the estrogens tested are similar, the affinity of the antiestrogen, Tamoxifen, for the cytosolic receptor is at least 10 times higher than for the microsomal binding sites. In contrast to rat uterus and ovaries, the microsomal membranes from various nontarget rat tissues do not show any specific binding."
https://openalex.org/W1485095587,"The noncovalently associated alpha-gamma and beta subunits of the eighth component of human complement (C8) were isolated and examined for their ability to recombine to form C8. Each subunit was also examined to determine its capability to interact independently with the C8 binding site on the soluble form of the cytolytic complex of complement. Results indicate that alpha-gamma and beta physically recombine in solution to form native C8 when mixed in equimolar amounts, a finding consistent with the concomitant appearance of C8 hemolytic activity. The ability of each subunit to interact independently with SC5b-7, the precursor of the soluble cytolytic complex which binds C8, was determined by sucrose density gradient analyses. It was found that alpha-gamma exhibits little affinity for SC5b-7, while the beta subunit readily binds to yield a stable complex of SC5b-7(beta). Interaction of beta was specific for the C8 binding site on SC5b-7 as evidenced by the ability to compete with C8. Results indicate that structural domains which mediate specific interaction of C8 with the nascent cytolytic complex are located in the beta subunit of this unusual protein."

https://openalex.org/W1531227254,"Adenylate cyclase solubilized from bovine brain with Lubrol 12A9 or Triton X-100 can be resolved into two forms by gel filtration or sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The activity of one of these forms is not stimulatable by guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and represents the adenylate cyclase activity. In Lubrol 12A9, this form has Mr = 330,000 (total, protein and detergent) and Mr (protein only) = 265,000. The other form of adenylate cyclase can be activated by Gpp(NH)p and has a smaller molecular weight: Mr (protein and detergent) = 293,000, Mr (protein only) = 199,000. Upon activation by Gpp(NH)p, the size of the Gpp(NH)p-responsive form of adenylate cyclase increases: Mr (protein and detergent) = 330,000, Mr (protein only) = 251,000. Similar values were obtained in Triton X-100. The kinetics of heat inactivation are different in the two forms of the enzyme. Both forms are activated about 2-fold by 5 mM MnCl2. Neither of the forms is associated with measurable low Km GTPase activity. On the basis of these studies, we propose that the catalytic unit (C) of adenylate cyclase and the guanine nucleotide regulatory unit (G/F) may exist in solution in the following rapid equilibrium: (formula: see text) We propose that activation by Gpp(NH)p stabilizes the C . G/F complex and this accounts for the greater mass of the enzyme measured after activation with Gpp(NH)p. The size of the enzyme which represents the basal activity is very similar to that of the C . G/F complex. We suggest, therefore, that the basal activity is the result of a stable association of the catalytic unit with the guanine nucleotide regulatory site."

The purification protocol included acid and NH4SO4 precipitation, followed by chromatography on CM-Sephadex, phenyl-Sepharose, Sephadex G-150, and blue dextran Sepharose. Two peaks of enzyme activity were detected after blue dextran Sepharose chromatography containing an overall yield of approximately 4% of the starting enzyme activity. The final specific activity of the blue dextran fractions was 70 to 80 mumol of acetylcholine formed min-1 mg of protein-1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the blue dextran fractions revealed three closely spaced proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 67,000.

https://openalex.org/W1575116861,"After the moiety of hepatic cytochrome P-450 in rats had been destroyed by allylisopropylacetamide (AIA), intravenously injected significantly increased the cytochrome P-450 content and mixed function oxidase activity of liver microsomes. (The term heme is used throughout this paper for iron protorphyrin IX, irrespective of its redox state). In the absence of AIA treatment, administration failed to elicit these effects. The heme-mediated increase of cytochrome P-450 was most pronounced in phenobarbital-pretreated rats (46%), but was detectable also in 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated (6%) and in untreated animals (7%). Restoration of mixed function oxidase activity by appeared to depend on reconstitution of cytochrome P-450 and was greatest for oxidases whose activity is stimulated by phenobarbital. Under optimal experimental conditions, enhanced the residual activity of ethylmorphine N-demethylase 3-fold when 92% of the initial enzyme activity had been destroyed by AIA. Reconstitution of cytochrome P-450 was dependent on the relative amount of cytochrome P-450 destroyed by AIA and on the dose of administered. Formation of holocytochrome P-450 appeared to be independent of apoprotein synthesis as it was unaffected by cycloheximide. Thus, reconstitution of cytochrome P-450 following AIA-mediated destruction of its original prosthetic reflects direct incorporation of administered into residual apoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings demonstrate that exogenous can partially restore the structure and function of hepatic cytochrome P-450 following its drug-mediated destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1496479559,"In the presence of phosphate, both acetoacetate and palmitoyl-coenzyme A induce pyridine nucleotide oxidation, swelling of mitochondria, and Ca2+ release. However, when mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ in the presence of lactate, neither acetoacetate nor palmitoyl-CoA addition results in Ca2+ release and no swelling is observed. If ruthenium red is added prior to these releasing agents, a 10-fold greater rate of Ca2+ efflux is observed when phosphate is present compared to lactate alone. Although acetoacetate produces significant oxidation of NADH in the lactate-supplemented medium, no Ca2+ release occurs. In the lactate medium, no oxidation of pyridine nucleotide was seen following palmitoyl-CoA addition. Lactate-supported Ca2+ accumulation (+/- N-ethylmaleimide) produces a transient respiratory stimulation associated with active Ca2+ uptake. Addition of phosphate to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria (lactate medium) promotes respiratory stimulation and Ca2+ efflux upon addition of acetoacetate or palmitoyl-CoA. When N-ethylmaleimide is present to inhibit the phosphate-hydroxyl exchange, no efflux of Ca2+ occurs after addition of phosphate and acetoacetate or phosphate and palmitoyl-CoA. The ionophore, A23187, produces Ca2+ release from mitochondria in either lactate (+/- N-ethylmaleimide) or phosphate medium. These results suggest that activation by the reduction state of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides but may also depend upon the nature of the accompanying anion, as well as membrane permeability alterations."
https://openalex.org/W1510608624,"Histidyl-proline diketopiperazine is produced in brain as a product of the metabolism of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. A number of the previously observed central nervous system and pituitary activities resulting from an exposure to thyrotropin-releasing hormone appear to involve the conversion of the releasing factor to the cyclic dipeptide. In the present study, the development of a rabbit antiserum that is highly specific for histidyl-proline diketopiperazine is described; the antiserum has essentially no capability to bind thyrotropin-releasing hormone or a number of other related peptides. The antibody can also distinguish between the natural form of the cyclic dipeptide and a diastereomer containing D-proline. A procedure for extraction, with high yield, of histidyl-proline diketopiperazine from brain is described. With the aid of the specific antiserum it was found that the preponderance of the cyclic dipeptide in rat brain is bound to high molecular weight material, mainly in the range of Mr = 70,000; histidyl-proline diketopiperazine can be disassociated from this material by boiling in salt/methanol solution. The concentration of the dipeptide in rat brain is in the range of 275 to 565 pmol/brain, approximately 2.5 times the concentrations determined for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (113 to 210 pmol/brain). A study of the subcellular distribution of histidyl-proline diketopiperazine and thyrotropin-releasing hormone suggests that the releasing factor is concentrated in synaptosomal vesicles while the diketopiperazine is not. A determination of the regional distribution of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and histidyl-proline diketopiperazine indicated that both peptides are found in highest concentrations in pituitary and hypothalamus, but are detectable in other areas of brain as well."
https://openalex.org/W1512591149,"Chick limb buds from 4- to 7-day-old embryos and sterna from 14-day-old embryos were labeled with [35S]sulfate, and the sulfated proteoglycans (PGS) were extracted either with associative (0.5 M guanidine . HCl) or dissociative (4.0 M guanidine . HCl) solvents. The existence of several populations of PGS is revealed in each age group when the limb extracts are analyzed on sucrose density gradients under dissociative conditions. The major component of 7-day limbs has a faster sedimentation rate than does that of 4-day limb buds. These major components of 4- and 7-day extracts chromatograph in the void volume of a controlled-pore glass (CPG) 1400 column. They differ from each other immunologically. The CPG 1400 void volume material from 4-day limb mesenchyme (PGS(LM)-I) shows no cross-reactivity with antiserum against PGS from juvenile cartilage (A1-D1-1400 V0). In contrast, the CPG 1400 void volume material from 7-day limbs, which contain cartilage [PGS(LC)-I], gave a cross-reaction of 70%. When PGS(LM)-I is chromatographed on CPG 2500, 45% of the labeled material chromatographs in the void volume. When PGS(LM)-I is sedimented in a cesium chloride gradient under dissociative conditions, it can be shown that the PGS in the bottom fraction (D1) has a monomer-aggregate relationship. In the absence of hyaluronic acid, this fraction is included on CPG 2500, whereas in the presence of hyaluronic acid it is excluded. Limb mesenchyme, therefore, synthesizes a PGS molecule which can interact with hyaluronic acid to form an aggregate. The endogenous material of a 4-day limb mesenchyme which causes the aggregation of PGS cannot be separated from PGS by chromatography on CPG 240 or 1400 under dissociative conditions. In contrast, the aggregating material from sterna can be separated from PGS under these conditions. These observations are interpreted to mean that the aggregating material of limb mesenchyme is larger than is that of cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W1529959688,"Sea urchin sperm chromatin contains forms of H1, H2A, and H2B which differ from those present in adult tissues. We have delineated some effects of the variant H2A and H2B on chromatin by study of the structure of the core particle from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sperm. The particle contains 145 base pairs of DNA and equal amounts of the four smaller histones. It sediments at 11 S and has a circular dichroism spectrum similar to that of particles containing more typical histones. The sperm core particle undergoes a shape change at low ionic strength, as observed for chicken erythrocyte particles. In contrast to these similarities, the melting profile of the sperm particle is quite different from that of erythrocyte; both the reversible transition and the irreversible denaturation of the core particle occur at higher temperatures. The sperm core particle is digested by DNase I more slowly than the core particle from chicken erythrocyte. Cutting site maps for the sperm core particle reveal the same basic organization of DNA by these histones; however, certain features of the map differ significantly from that for chicken erythrocyte, demonstrating a modulation of the canonical core particle structure by the unusual histones present in sea urchin sperm."
https://openalex.org/W1535300582,"The location of the H+-translocating reactions within energy-conserving Site 2 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was evaluated from two sets of data. In the first, the H+/2e- ejection ratios and Ca2+/2e- uptake ratios were compared for electron flow from succinate dehydrogenase, whose active site is on the matrix side of the inner membrane and from glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, whose active site is on the cytosolic side. In intact rat liver mitochondria both substrates yielded H+/2e- ejection ratios close to 4.0 and Ca2+/2e- uptake ratios close to 1.0 during antimycin-sensitive reduction of ferricyanide. With rat liver mitoplasts and ferricytochrome c as electron acceptor, both substrates again gave the same stoichiometric ratios. The second approach involved determination of the sidedness of H+ formation during electron flow from succinate to ferricyanide via bypass of the antimycin block of the cytochrome b.c1 complex provided by N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), under conditions in which the TMPD-TMPD+ couple does not act as a membrane-penetrating protonophore. Electron flow in this system was inhibited by 2-then-oyltrifluoroacetone, indicating that TMPD probably accepts electrons from ubiquinol. The 2 H+ formed in this system were not delivered into the matrix but appeared directly in the medium in the absence of a protonophore. To accommodate the available evidence on Site 2 substrates, it is concluded that the substrate hydrogens are first transferred to ubiquinone, 2 H+ per 2e then appear in the medium by protolytic dehydrogenation of a species of ubiquinol or ubiquinol-protein having the appropriate sidedness (designated Site 2A), and the other 2 H+ are translocated from the matrix to the medium on passage of 2e- through the cytochrome b x c1 complex (designated Site 2B)."

Partially purified apoVLDL-II mRNA was translated in vitro in a wheat germ system in the presence of various labeled amino acids. The product, designated preapoVLDL-II, was purified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was subjected to automated Edman degradation in a Beckman Sequencer. The signal peptide was found to be a 23-amino acid NH2-terminal extension of the mature protein with the following sequence: Met-Gln-Tyr-Arg-Ala-Leu-Val-Ile-Ala-Val-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser-Thr-Val-Pro-Glu-Val-Cys-Ser-Lys where Lys is the NH2-terminal residue of mature apoVLDL-II. The abundance and distribution of the hydrophobic amino acid residues are very similar to those of other signal sequences and the average hydrophobicity for the 23 residues is -1227 cal/mol/residue. However, translocation of preapoVLDL-II would represent a unique case of vectorial migration of a protein through a membrane since apoVLDL-II is itself an apolipoprotein and binds lipid spontaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1608085279,"The lipoidal derivatives of steroids present in bovine corpora lutea have been identified and quantified. Nonpolar steroid derivatives were extracted from the tissue with a mixture of chloroform and methanol. The extract was subjected to column and high performance liquid chromatography in order to remove phospholipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and unesterified steroids. A portion of the purified nonpolar material was subjected to methanolysis. By gas-liquid chromatographic analysis, the products were shown to consist of the steroids 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (80%) and pregnenolone (20%), and the methyl esters of palmitic (34%), stearic (27%), oleic (22%), linoleic (7%), arachidonic (7%), palmitoleic (3%), and eicosatrienoic (1%) acids. Mass spectrometric analysis of the intact lipoidal derivatives and of their methoximes confirmed the presence of seven esters of allopregnanolone and pregnenolone: allopregnanolone palmitate, pregnenolone palmitate, allopregnanolone stearate, allopregnanolone oleate, allopregnanolone linoleate, allopregnanolone eicosatrienoate, and pregnenolone arachidonate. The mass spectral data suggested that four other esters were also present: pregnenolone stearate, pregnenolone oleate, pregnenolone linoleate, and allopregnanolone arachidonate."

It is proposed that leucine 2,3-aminomutase, the cobalamin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of leucine and beta-leucine, is the affected enzyme in pernicious anemia and causes these results by preventing the synthesis of leucine from beta-leucine. The synthesis of leucine by human leukocytes and hair roots and by rat liver extracts has been shown to occur when either branched chain fatty acids or valine metabolites are the substances. The synthesis is dependent upon adenosylcobalamin and is inhibited by intrinsic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1526756601,"The structure of the jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) protein canavalin, which forms the classical vicillin fraction of the seed protein in this species, has been determined for the rhombohedral (R3) crystal form to 3.0-A resolution. X-ray diffraction data were collected by the screened precession method for the native protein and five heavy atom derivatives and the phases were determined by conventional isomorphous replacement. The electron density map thus obtained, and a molecularly averaged electron density map, permitted tentative tracing of the polypeptide chains that comprise the asymmetric unit. It was found that the two major fragments that make up the canavalin monomer, which are derived from the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of a 42,000-dalton precursor polypeptide, are virtually identical in structure and are related by a near exact molecular dyad axis of symmetry. The halves of the monomer are themselves composed of two discrete domains, corresponding in one case to the secondary cleavage products of a major fragment. One domain provides the structure involved in binding the Zn2+ ion which lies near the pseudo 32 symmetry point. The other domain forms a distinct cleft on the exterior or the monomer that may be a substrate-binding region. The molecule is almost entirely beta structure, organized into a series of interrelated sheets. The proteolytic cleavage points have been identified, and a number of additional interesting features are described."
https://openalex.org/W1575284014,"The chemiluminescence earlier observed upon the incubation of arachidonic acid with prostaglandin-synthesizing microsomes of sheep vesicular gland (Marnett et al. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 60, 1286-1294) was reinvestigated with prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase purified from bovine vesicular gland microsomes. When the purified enzyme was incubated with arachidonic acid in the presence of hematin and tryptophan, a rapid light emission was observed. The fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase activity as demonstrated with manganese protoporphyrin was not responsible for the luminescence. When the hematin-requiring prostaglandin hydroperoxidase reaction (the conversion of prostaglandin G2 to H2) was carried out with tryptophan, skatole, or 3-indolepropionic acid, the light emission was observed, but not with either epinephrine or guaiacol in place of tryptophan. The light intensity was dependent on the concentration of enzyme, hematin, tryptophan, and prostaglandin G2. Various other hydroperoxides in addition to prostaglandin G2 were also active. The luminescence spectrum recorded by a spectrometer equipped with a filter spectral analyzer gave emission peaks around 500, 550, and 610 nm. The spectrum was distinguishable from that of singlet oxygen, and was similar to that reported for a photochemical reaction of tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W1895272372,"Abstract The inhibition of anti-immunoglobulin cap formation on lymphocytes by cis-unsaturated fatty acids, but not saturated or trans-unsaturated fatty acids, which recently been reported (Klausner, R. N., Bhalla, D. K., Dragsten, P., Hoover, R. L., and Karnovsky, M. J. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 437-441), can be accounted for quantitatively by the effects of the fatty acids on ATP levels in the intact cells. Only the cis-unsaturated fatty acids lowered the cellular ATP level sufficiently (to < 80%) to inhibit cap formation significantly. The profile for the dependence of cap formation on cellular ATP level obtained with the fatty acids is very similar to the corresponding profile described previously for several capping ligands and a range of metabolic inhibitors used to depress the cellular ATP levels. Oxygen electrode experiments indicate that the unsaturated, but not the saturated, fatty acids can uncouple lymphocyte mitochondria in intact cells, whereas both types of fatty acids can uncouple isolated rat liver mitochondria. The difference in the effect of the two types of fatty acids on ATP levels in the intact cells is attributed to the inability of the saturated fatty acids to penetrate in sufficient concentrations to the mitochondria to cause uncoupling. The protective action of external calcium against inhibition of capping by the free fatty acids is attributed to the effect of calcium in cross-bridging the anionic fatty acids and reducing their effective concentration. These interpretations account for all of the experimental data and are much simpler than the model proposed by Klausner et al."
https://openalex.org/W1589194753,"The amount of tubulin in a clone of neuroblastoma cells (Nb2a-AB-1) which undergoes microtubule-dependent neurite elongation has been determined. This clone undergoes shape differentiation without cessation of cell division, and both differentiated and nondifferentiated cells have the same cell cycle parameters. To quantitate tubulin pools, a radioimmunoassay was developed with a rabbit serum raised to sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated Tetrahymena axonemal tubulin. Using purified hog brain tubulin as labeled tracer and competitor, competition curves covering the range of 0.1 to 100 microgram/ml were obtained. Curves obtained using purified mouse brain or neuroblastoma tubulin as competitors were similar to those obtained with hog brain tubulin. The levels of competition obtained with hog tubulin, partially purified tubulin, or fixed microtubules were identical, indicating that the polymerization state of tubulin had no effect on measurements. Postmitochondrial supernatants derived either from cells grown in suspension culture (rounded morphology) or monolayer culture (neurite-bearing morphology) contained equivalent amounts of tubulin (3.6 +/- 0.5 pg/cell and 3.1 +/- 0.2 pg/cell, respectively); tubulin constituted 2.7% of the postmitochondrial supernatant protein in either cell type. These data indicated that cells utilizing microtubules primarily for mitosis or for cytoskeletal functions and mitosis show no net change in the total soluble tubulin pool."
https://openalex.org/W1640827759,"Large changes in the rate of synthesis of UDP-apiose synthase, an enzyme of the flavonoid glycoside pathway, were observed both in vivo and in vitro following irradiation of previously dark-grown cell suspension cultures of parsley (Petroselinum hortense). Irradiation of the cells with ultraviolet light for 2 1/2 h caused a large increase in UDP-adipose synthase mRNA activity which continued for several hours during the subsequent dark period. A sharp peak in this activity was followed by a rapid exponential decline. The timing of changes in mRNA activity was very similar for UDP-apiose synthase and chalcone synthase, a previously investigated enzyme of the flavonoid glycoside pathway, but differed from that for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, an enzyme of general phenylpropanoid metabolism. Thus, the present data provide further evidence for a differential regulation of the two groups of enzymes and a high degree of co-ordination within each group. The expected light-induced changes in UDP-apiose synthase activity were calculated from the observed changes in the rate of synthesis, allowing for an apparently constant rate of degradation (t 1/2 = 17 h). The resulting time course was in agreement with experimental data, suggesting that the changes in enzyme activity were caused by corresponding changes in the rate of synthesis. A protein of unknown function (Protein X), which is tightly associated with UDP-apiose synthase and co-purifies with the enzyme at a molar ratio of 1:1, is shown to be regulated independently of the enzymes of the flavonoid glycoside pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1669375354,"Highly purified rat liver fatty acid synthetase is completely inhibited when assayed in the presence of a coenzyme A-depleting system such as that catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase, acetyl-CoA synthetase, or ATP citrate lyase. The addition of free CoA causes a reversal of this inhibition. The requirement of free CoA is the same whether acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA serves as the primer for fatty acid synthetase. The CoA-depleted and thus inactive fatty acid synthetase system can be reactivated by the addition of a rat brain thioesterase or a rat mammary gland thioesterase II preparation. This reactivation appears to occur in the absence of free CoA. Long chain fatty acids (mainly palmitate) are formed by the thioesterase reactivated system. These results suggest that CoA is required for the termination of the fatty acid synthetase reaction. Possible mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W74434290,"The hydrogen exchange behavior of a small allosterically responsive set of exchanging hydrogens was studied in hemoglobin A and in some chemically modified hemoglobins. The set experiences an exceptionally large change in exchange rate through hemoglobin's allosteric transition. This indicates, according to the local unfolding model of H-exchange, that a large change in allosteric free energy impinges on the opening segment that exposes these protons to exchange. In oxyhemoglobin the set consists of 5 to 6 protons which exchange with a half-time of 20 s at pH 7.4 and 0 degrees C. In deoxyhemoglobin the set splits into a slower and a faster half. The slower 3 protons exchange more slowly than in oxyhemoglobin by a factor of 5000 (26 h half-time) and are 5-fold slower still in the presence of pyrophosphate or inositol hexaphosphate (136 h half-time). The other 2 to 3 protons exchange about 20-fold faster in both cases (about 2 h and 10 h half-times). The effect of some chemical modifications was tested, including reaction with iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide and cleavage with carboxypeptidases A and B. In all cases the 3 slower protons continue to behave as a cohesive set and in the various modified deoxyhemoglobins their exchange is accelerated by factors ranging between 1 and 3 decades. These factors correlate with the effect of the different modifications on hemoglobin cooperativity."

The oligo(u) segments are 89% UMP and range from 20 to 50 nucleotides in length. The poly(A+) oligo(U+) mRNAs appear to contain the oligo(U) in a region with secondary structure (possibly an intramolecular duplex with the 3'-poly(A) since they did not bind to poly(A) Sepharose without prior HCHO modification. HCHO modifies the exocyclic amino groups of CMP, GMP, and AMP and prevents hydrogen bonding but reacts only slightly with UMP. After removal of the excess HCHO, the oligo(U) of the mRNA was free to bind to the poly(A) Sepharose. Control experiments indicated that the binding of oligo(U+) mRNA to poly(A) Sepharose was specific and the HCHO did not cause cross-linking of the RNAs. The poly(A+) oligo(U+) RNAs appeared to contain one oligo(U)/molecule and could re-bind to poly(A) Sepharose with 31 to 75% efficiency. The poly(A+) oligo(U+) mRNA class was more heterogeneous in size and slightly larger (approximately 3 kb average length) than the other mRNA classes."
https://openalex.org/W1532793526,"The Bohr effect of carp hemoglobin has been determined by differential titration, by direct acid-base titration, and by calculation from precise oxygen equilibrium data over a wide pH variation. The results for the hemolysate and the two major components are essentially identical. At pH 6.9 in the vicinity of maximum cooperativity and maximum Bohr effect, the protein releases 3.7 protons in the absence of added ions. This Bohr curve above pH 7 is not changed by the presence of 0.05 M 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2-nitrilotriethanol (bis-Tris) buffer, but is changed below the pK of the bis-Tris amine, giving a maximum of 4.3 protons at pH 6.65. In 0.1 M phosphate, the maximum is increased to 6.1 protons and is shifted to pH 7.25. Addition of 1.4 mM P6-inositol lowers the magnitude of the Bohr effect and shifts its maximum to an even higher pH. At the limit of high pH (9.02), without buffer or in bis-Tris, there is a net uptake of about 0.5 proton upon oxygenation. The average heat of ionization of the Bohr groups is 5500 +/- 800 cal. Even though chloride ion has a pronounced effect on the oxygenation properties of carp hemoglobin, it has a small influence on the Bohr effect up to 0.5 M NaCl. In 5 M NaCl, the magnitude of the Bohr effect is reduced by approximately 30%., Acid base titrations give three to four oxygen-linked groups for carp hemoglobin in water; this is increased to about six groups in 2.5 M NaCl. The results suggest that carp hemoglobin is functionally versatile and may provide one way to regulate its CO2 transport via heterotropic allosteric interactions. In phosphate buffer at the pH value where carp hemoglobin is strongly cooperative, the proton release is linear with respect to ligand saturation. Lowering the cooperativity by either an increase or decrease in pH results in nonlinear relationships."

Before estrogen treatment, these rats were severely hypercholesterolemic and had high concentrations of lipoproteins of d < 1.006 g/ml (very low density lipoproteins, VLDL), d = 1.006 to 1.03 g/ml (intermediate density lipoproteins, IDL), and d = 1.03 to 1.063 g/ml (low density lipoproteins, LDL), and low concentrations of lipoproteins of d = 1.063 to 1.21 g/ml (high density lipoproteins, HDL). The VLDL contained two populations of particles with a mean diameter of 1150 and 350 A, respectively. The IDL contains only the latter particles. These particles are unusual in that they contain apolipoprotein A-I in addition to their usual complement of apolipoproteins. After estrogen treatment, the concentrations of both large and smaller particles in VLDL were greatly decreased as were the concentrations of IDL and LDL; apo A-I was no longer present in the residual VLDL and IDL. HDL phospholipid, protein, and cholesterol increased 7-fold, 4-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Studies by others have shown that large doses of estrogen enhance uptake of LDL by the liver and this is associated with an increase in the saturable binding sites for LDL on liver membranes. The present studies suggest that these binding sites recognize lipoproteins other than LDL. Furthermore, the enhanced uptake of these lipoproteins appears to result in transfer of their surface components to HDL."

The modified enzyme was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, and gel permeation chromatography. Under the experimental conditions used, the enzyme was only partially cross-linked; 74% of the enzyme was cross-linked dimer or monomer. Nonetheless, the modified enzyme is able to retain enzymic activity and the tetrameric structure under conditions where native enzyme would be completely dissociated and inactivated. The result suggests that cross-linked dimers strongly associate with each other and with monomers. Flame emission spectroscopy indicates that cross-linked enzyme contains two monovalent cations per tetramer."

The inactive enzyme was shown to retain the original dimeric structure and NAD, which is a coenzyme for this reaction, was not dissociated from the apoenzyme. The loss of activity was due to the direct modification of sulfhydryl groups and could not be attributed to any subsequent loss of structural integrity. The activity of the enzyme could be regained almost completely on incubation with mercaptoethanol alone and no exogenous NAD was needed for reactivation. The reactivated enzyme showed most of the characteristic properties of the native enzyme like activation by cations or inhibition by UMP. Presence of substrate provided partial protection against inactivation by the reagent. Formation of disulfide bond(s) across the subunits was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in absence of mercaptoethanol. Titration of native and diamide-inactivated enzyme with p-chloromercuribenzoate revealed that only two sulfhydryl groups were involved in the formation of the disulfide cross-linkage across the subunits. The above results indicate the possible presence of two conformationally vicinal sulfhydryl groups at two different subunits of the enzyme that constitute part of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W199579526,"UDP-glucose 4-epimerase from Saccharomyces fragilis exhibits a very characteristic intense fluorescence with an excitation maximum at 360 nm and an emission maximum at 433 nm. The fluorescence spectrum resembles the fluorescence of free NADH with an apparent blue shift and, although the exact nature of the fluorophore is not known, the protein-bound NAD, which is a coenzyme for this reaction, or its reduced form is obviously involved in the emission of the fluorescence. The fluorphore therefore constitutes part of the active site. The inactivation of epimerase with diazinedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N-diethylamide), a reaction shown in the previous paper to form a disulfide linkage across the subunits, results in a simultaneous and correlated loss of the characteristic fluorescence of the enzyme. Reaction with mercaptoethanol restores the native fluorescence with a 2 nm blue shift in emission maximum. These epxeriments provide additional evidence that the two conformationally vicinal sulfhydryl groups are located at the active site. Unlike the reconstituted enzyme obtained from the diamide-inactivated enzyme, the partialy active enzymes reconstituted from p-chloromercuribenzoate-inactivated and heat-inactivated enzymes fail to show the reappearance of the characteristic native fluorescence. Treatment with N-ethylmaleamide, on the other hand, leads to a form of the inactive enzyme that fully retains its fluorescent properties. A model depicting the minimal changes at the active site during the process of inactivation and reconstitution by these various treatments is presented."

For the reactions with hydrogen peroxide and cyanide dissolved in media the diffusion process was rate limiting both in the static and flowing media, and kinetic features of the enzyme were masked. The rate of CO recombination of the ferrous enzyme was measured by flash photolysis in the static media containing varying amounts of CO. Apparently, the initial rate of CO recombination was no more affected by the diffusion factor, and the second order rate constant could be measured for the reaction of the enzyme adsorbed on the membrane. The value was about 70% of that obtained from the enzyme in solution and exhibited the same pH dependence as did the value for the enzyme in solution. The difference of the reaction pattern between the enzymes on the membrane and in solution became distinct when flash photolysis was applied to the reaction system without free CO in the medium.

The increased phenylalanine aminotransferase activity was found to be due to a newly appeared aromatic aminotransferase without the aspartate aminotransferase activity in the cytosol of the small intestinal mucosa. The enzyme preparation had an isoelectric point of pH 8.5, a pH optimum near 8.0, and a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 with two identical subunits. The enzyme showed aminotransferase activities towards various aromatic L-amino acids with 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor. The order of effectiveness of aromatic L-amino acids was phenylalanine > tryptophan > tyrosine > 5-hydroxytryptophan; very little activity was detected with other L-amino acids that were tested. The enzyme was specific for 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor. The enzyme was not detected in other tissues (liver, kidney, heart, and brain) from both control and vitamin B6-deficient rats.

The crystals of both are tetragonal, space group P41212 or P43212, with 1 molecule per asymmetric unit. Moreover, the two appear to be isomorphous. Since the mother liquor can support Ca2+ ion without precipitation, crystals have been soaked with Ca2+ ion and preliminary results indicate that these remain closely isomorphous with parent crystals. Isomorphous heavy atom derivatives of mercury and platinum have been prepared of glycosylated fragment 1. In addition, crystals of human prothrombin fragment 1 have also been grown."
https://openalex.org/W1528713597,"Either NADH or NADPH can serve as a cofactor for oxidative demethylation of [30,31-14C]4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol and oxidative deformylation of 4-hydroxy[14C]methylene-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3-one. This report suggests that the cofactors interact with these two oxidase systems differently depending upon whether the reduced cofactor arises intra- or extramicrosomally. Marked differences in oxidative activity are observed depending on whether NADPH is generated in the microsomes or is added as an exogenous cofactor. Thus, the concentration of added NADPH required to yield maximal rates of sterol oxidation is 500 muM or greater. Nearly equivalent rates of sterol oxidation are obtained from NADPH generated in the microsomes where the NADPH concentration is no greater than 0.454 muM. Similar results are observed with NADH. In this case, NADH is generated in the microsomes from added NAD+ by microsomal reactions. The rate of sterol oxidation when NADH is generated from added NAD+ is nearly the same as that obtained from added NADH; although the concentration of NADH generated from NAD+ is 0.403 muM, the concentration of added NADH is 100 muM, and Km for added NADH is 1.7 muM."
