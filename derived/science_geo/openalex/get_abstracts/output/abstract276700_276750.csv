https://openalex.org/W2067818448,"Hybridization, the interbreeding of species, provides favorable conditions for major and rapid evolution to occur. In birds it is widespread. Approximately one in ten species is known to hybridize, and the true global incidence is likely to be much higher. A longitudinal study of Darwin's finch populations on a Gal√°pagos island shows that hybrids exhibit higher fitness than the parental species over several years. Hybrids may be at an occasional disadvantage for ecological rather than genetic reasons in this climatically fluctuating environment. Hybridization presents challenges to the reconstruction of phylogenies, formulation of biological species concepts and definitions, and the practice of biological conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2043560137,"A model for absolute free energies of solvation of organic, small inorganic, and biological molecules in aqueous solution is described. This model has the following features: (i) the solute charge distribution is described by distributed monopoles, and solute screening of dielectric polarization is treated with no restrictions on solute shape; (ii) the energetic effects of cavity formation, dispersion interactions, and solute-induced restructuring of water are included by a semiempirical cavity surface tension; and (iii) both of these effects are included in the solute Hamiltonian operator for self-consistent field (SCF) calculations to allow solvent-induced electronic and geometric distortion of the solute. The model is parameterized for solutes composed of H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Br, and I against experimental data for 150 neutral solutes and 28 ions, with mean absolute errors of 0.7 and 2.6 kilocalories per mole, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1981819665,"Mantle plumes and plate tectonics, the result of two distinct modes of convection within the Earth, operate largely independently. Although plumes are secondary in terms of heat transport, they have probably played an important role in continental geology. A new plume starts with a large spherical head that can cause uplift and flood basalt volcanism, and may be responsible for regional-scale metamorphism or crustal melting and varying amounts of crustal extension. Plume heads are followed by narrow tails that give rise to the familiar hot-spot tracks. The cumulative effect of processes associated with tail volcanism may also significantly affect continental crust."
https://openalex.org/W2004040028,Field observations and experimental evidence refute previous objections to the coral snake mimicry hypothesis. Concordant color pattern variation spanning hundreds of miles and several presumed venomous models strongly suggests that several harmless or mildly venomous colubrid snakes are indeed mimics of highly venomous elapids.
https://openalex.org/W2034464057,"Diamonds with delta(13)C values of -2 per mil and less than 50 parts per million (by mass) nitrogen have been isolated from the Abee enstatite chondrite by the same procedure used for concentrating Cdelta, the putative interstellar diamond found ubiquitously in primitive meteorites and characterized by delta(13)C values of -32 to -38 per mil, nitrogen concentrations of 2,000 to 12,500 parts per million, and delta(15)N values of -340 per mil. Because the Abee diamonds have typical solar system isotopic compositions for carbon, nitrogen, and xenon, they are presumably nebular in origin rather than presolar. Their discovery in an unshocked meteorite eliminates the possibility of origins normally invoked to account for diamonds in ureilites and iron meteorites and suggests a low-pressure synthesis. The diamond crystals are approximately 100 nanometers in size, are of an unusual lath shape, and represent approximately 100 parts per million of Abee by mass."
