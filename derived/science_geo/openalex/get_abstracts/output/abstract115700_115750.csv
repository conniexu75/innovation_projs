https://openalex.org/W2043707891,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2, also referred to as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. Rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells were permanently transfected with a COX-2 expression vector oriented in the sense (RIE-S) or antisense (RIE-AS) direction. The RIE-S cells expressed elevated COX-2 protein levels and demonstrated increased adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. E-cadherin was undetectable in RIE-S cells, but was elevated in parental RIE (RIE-P) and RIE-AS cells. RIE-S cells were resistant to butyrate-induced apoptosis, had elevated BCL2 protein expression, and reduced transforming growth factor beta 2 receptor levels. The phenotypic changes involving both increased adhesion to ECM and inhibition of apoptosis were reversed by sulindac sulfide (a COX inhibitor). These studies demonstrate that overexpression of COX-2 leads to phenotypic changes in intestinal epithelial cells that could enhance their tumorigenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2040040765,"Cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2) are key enzymes in prostaglandin biosynthesis and the target enzymes for the widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. To study the physiological roles of the individual isoforms, we have disrupted the mouse Ptgs1 gene encoding COX-1. Homozygous Ptgs1 mutant mice survive well, have no gastric pathology, and show less indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration than wild-type mice, even though their gastric prostaglandin E2 levels are about 1% of wild type. The homozygous mutant mice have reduced platelet aggregation and a decreased inflammatory response to arachidonic acid, but not to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Ptgs1 homozygous mutant females mated to homozygous mutant males produce few live offspring. COX-1-deficient mice provide a useful model to distinguish the physiological roles of COX-1 and COX-2."
https://openalex.org/W2083651943,"The prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase isoform 2, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), is induced at high levels in migratory and other responding cells by pro-inflammatory stimuli. COX-2 is generally considered to be a mediator of inflammation. Its isoform, COX-1, is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is thought to mediate ""housekeeping"" functions. These two enzymes are therapeutic targets of the widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To investigate further the different physiologic roles of these isoforms, we have used homologous recombination to disrupt the mouse gene encoding COX-2 (Ptgs2). Mice lacking COX-2 have normal inflammatory responses to treatments with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate or with arachidonic acid. However, they develop severe nephropathy and are susceptible to peritonitis."
https://openalex.org/W1968863167,"The molecular dynamics of nuclear protein import were examined in a solution binding assay by testing for interactions between a protein containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), the transport factors karyopherin alpha, karyopherin beta, and Ran, and FXFG or GLFG repeat regions of nucleoporins. We found that karyopherins alpha and beta cooperate to bind FXFG but not GLFG repeat regions. Binding of the NLS protein to karyopherin alpha was enhanced by karyopherin beta. Two novel reactions were discovered. First, incubation of a karyopherin heterodimer-NLS protein complex with an FXFG repeat region stimulated the dissociation of the NLS protein from the karyopherin heterodimer. Second, incubation of the karyopherin heterodimer with RanGTP (or with a Ran mutant that cannot hydrolyze GTP) led to the dissociation of karyopherin alpha from beta and to an association of Ran with karyopherin beta; RanGDP had no effect. We propose that movement of NLS proteins across the nuclear pore complex is a stochastic process that operates via repeated association-dissociation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2140336226,"Formation of double-strand breaks at recombination signal sequences is an early step in V(D)J recombination. Here we show that purified RAG1 and RAG2 proteins are sufficient to carry out this reaction. The cleavage reaction can be divided into two distinct steps. First, a nick is introduced at the 5' end of the signal sequence. The other strand is then broken, resulting in a hairpin structure at the coding end and a blunt, 5'-phosphorylated signal end. The hairpin is made as a direct consequence of the cleavage mechanism. Nicking and hairpin formation each require the presence of a signal sequence and both RAG proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2016493017,"Pre-mRNAs are associated with hnRNPs, and these proteins play important roles in the biogenesis of mRNAs. The hnRNP A1 is one of the most abundant hnRNPs, and although localized primarily in the nucleoplasm, shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. A 38 amino acid domain within A1, termed M9, which bears no resemblance to classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, localizes A1 to the nucleus. Here we show that M9 is also a nuclear export signal; placing M9 on a protein that is otherwise restricted to the nucleus, the nucleoplasmin core domain (NPc), efficiently exports it to the cytoplasm in a temperature-dependent manner. In contrast, classical NLSs cannot promote the export of NPc. These findings demonstrate that there is a signal-dependent, temperature-sensitive nuclear export pathway and strengthen the suggestion that A1 and other shuttling hnRNPs function as carriers for RNA during export to the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W2047106546,"The immunosuppressant drug FK506 binds to the immunophilin protein FKBP12 and inhibits its prolyl isomerase activity. Immunosuppressive actions, however, are mediated via an FK506-FKBP12 inhibition of the Ca(2+)-activated phosphatase calcineurin. Physiologic cellular roles for FKBP12 have remained unclear. FKBP12 is physically associated with the RyR and IP3R Ca2+ channels in the absence of FK506, with added FK506 disrupting these complexes. Dissociation of FKBP12 results in alteration of channel Ca2+ conductance in both cases. We now report that calcineurin is physiologically associated with the IP3R-FKBP12 and RyR-FKBP12 receptor complexes and that this interaction can be disrupted by FK506 or rapamycin. Calcineurin anchored to the IP3R via FKBP12 regulates the phosphorylation status of the receptor, resulting in a dynamic Ca(2+)-sensitive regulation of IP3-mediated Ca2+ flux."
https://openalex.org/W1987219070,"We have identified a novel 100 kDa coiled-coil protein, rabaptin-5, that specifically interacts with the GTP form of the small GTPase Rab5, a potent regulator of endocytic transport. It is mainly cytosolic, but a fraction colocalizes with Rab5 to early endosomes. Expression of a GTPase-deficient Rab5 mutant enhances the binding of rabaptin-5 to enlarged endosomes. Overexpression of rabaptin-5 alone is sufficient to promote expansion of early endosomes. Rab5 recruits rabaptin-5 to purified early endosomes in a GTP-dependent manner, demonstrating functional similarities with other members of the Ras superfamily. Immunodepletion of rabaptin-5 from cytosol strongly inhibits Rab5-dependent early endosome fusion. Rabaptin-5 is thus a Rab effector required for membrane docking and fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1997082598,"Crystal structures of haloalkane dehalogenase were determined in the presence of the substrate 1,2-dichloroethane. At pH 5 and 4 degrees C, substrate is bound in the active site without being converted; warming to room temperature causes the substrate's carbon-chlorine bond to be broken, producing a chloride ion with concomitant alkylation of the active-site residue Asp124. At pH 6 and room temperature the alkylated enzyme is hydrolysed by a water molecule activated by the His289-Asp260 pair in the active site. These results show that catalysis by the dehalogenase proceeds by a two-step mechanism involving an ester intermediate covalently bound at Asp124."
https://openalex.org/W2006271002,"Voltage-gated sodium channels in brain neurons are complexes of a pore-forming alpha subunit with smaller beta 1 and beta 2 subunits. cDNA cloning and sequencing showed that the beta 2 subunit is a 186 residue glycoprotein with an extracellular NH2-terminal domain containing an immunoglobulin-like fold with similarity to the neural cell adhesion molecule (CAM) contactin, a single transmembrane segment, and a small intracellular domain. Coexpression of beta 2 with alpha subunits in Xenopus oocytes increases functional expression, modulates gating, and causes up to a 4-fold increase in the capacitance of the oocyte, which results from an increase in the surface area of the plasma membrane microvilli. beta 2 subunits are unique among the auxiliary subunits of ion channels in combining channel modulation with a CAM motif and the ability to expand the cell membrane surface area. They may be important regulators of sodium channel expression and localization in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2039075455,"The par-3 gene is required for establishing polarity in early C. elegans embryos. Embryos from par-3 homozygous mothers show defects in segregation of cytoplasmic determinants and in positioning of the early cleavage spindles. We report here that the PAR-3 protein is asymmetrically distributed at the periphery of the zygote and asymmetrically dividing blastomeres of the germline lineage. The PAR-3 distribution is roughly the reciprocal of PAR-1, another protein required for establishing embryonic polarity in C. elegans. Analysis of the distribution of PAR-3 and PAR-1 in other par mutants reveals that par-2 activity is required for proper localization of PAR-3 and that PAR-3 is required for proper localization of PAR-1. In addition, the distribution of the PAR-3 protein correlates with differences in cleavage spindle orientation and suggests a mechanism by which PAR-3 contributes to control of cleavage pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2109088595,"Fibronectin (Fn) matrices are vital to vertebrate development and wound healing and modulate tumorigenesis. We used a recombinant Fn-binding integrin alpha IIb beta3, to define rules for integrin-initiated Fn matrix formation. We report the following. First, multiple Fn-binding integrins can support matrix assembly; their activation state controls fibrillogenesis. Second, Fn binding to cells expressing an activated integrin is necessary but not sufficient for matrix assembly. Additional ""postoccupancy"" events involving the integrin beta, but not the alpha subunit, cytoplasmic domain are needed. Third, these postoccupancy events require an intact actin cytoskeleton. We propose a model for integrin involvement in Fn fibrillogenesis that reconciles previous paradoxes and suggests novel approaches to the therapeutic control of Fn matrix assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1995771448,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, a cell sheet movement, dorsal closure, allows establishment of the dorsal epidermis. In this morphogenetic process, lateral epithelia undergo a dramatic movement toward the dorsal midline. In the mutant hemipterous (hep), spreading of the epithelia is blocked; in genetically sensitized hep embryos, cell sheet movement can be arrested at any time, indicating hep requirement in maintaining this morphogenetic activity. Further, hep is required for expression in the dorsal epithelium edges of another dorsal closure gene, puckered. The HEP protein is homologous to the Jun kinase kinase (JNKK) group of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs). These data suggest that hep functions in a novel Drosophila MAPK pathway, controlling puckered expression and morphogenetic activity of the dorsal epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W1978236923,"The fragile X syndrome is the most frequent form of inherited mental retardation after Down's syndrome, having an incidence of one in 1,250 males. The fragile X syndrome results from amplification of the CGG repeat found in the FMR-1 gene. This CGG repeat shows length variation in normal individuals and is increased significantly in both carriers and patients; it is located 250 base pairs distal to a CpG island which is hypermethylated in fragile X patients. The methylation probably results in downregulation of FMR-1 gene expression. No information can be deduced about the function of the FMR-1 protein from its predicted sequence. Here we investigate the nature and function of the protein encoded by the FMR-1 gene using polyclonal antibodies raised against the predicted amino-acid sequences. Four different protein products, possibly resulting from alternative splicing, have been identified by immunoblotting in lymphoblastoid cell lines of healthy individuals. All these proteins were missing in cell lines from patients not expressing FMR-1 messenger RNA. The intracellular localization of the FMR-1 gene products was investigated by transient expression in COS-1 cells and found to be cytoplasmic. Localization was also predominantly cytoplasmic in the epithelium of the oesophagus, but in some cells was obviously nuclear."
https://openalex.org/W2078338501,"Endosomes are intermediates for a complex series of sorting and transport events that occur during receptor-mediated endocytosis. These involve the recognition of targeting determinants on the cytoplasmic domains of many membrane proteins as well as the formations of specific transport vesicles. Accordingly, endosome function is likely to be governed by the regulated assembly of cytoplasmic coat complexes. We have found that, in vitro, endosomes recruit a characteristic set of cytoplasmic proteins in a GTP gamma S-stimulated and brefeldin A-sensitive fashion. Among these are members of the COP-I and ARF families of coat proteins. In addition, endosomes were also found to assemble distinct, clathrin-like coats. Since microinjection of antibodies to beta-COP inhibits the entry of enveloped viruses via the endocytic pathway, it is apparent that the recruitment of COP-I or COP-I-related proteins plays an important role in the function of endosomes in intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W2002707999,"T4 endonuclease V is a DNA repair enzyme from bacteriophage T4 that catalyzes the first reaction step of the pyrimidine dimer-specific base excision repair pathway. The crystal structure of this enzyme complexed with a duplex DNA substrate, containing a thymine dimer, has been determined at 2.75 A resolution. The atomic structure of the complex reveals the unique conformation of the DNA duplex, which exhibits a sharp kink with a 60 degree inclination at the central thymine dimer. The adenine base complementary to the 5' side of the thymine dimer is completely flipped out of the DNA duplex and trapped in a cavity on the protein surface. These structural features allow an understanding of the catalytic mechanism and implicate a general mechanism of how other repair enzymes recognize damaged DNA duplexes."
https://openalex.org/W2066677001,"A key problem in the cell cycle is understanding what brings about the initiation of DNA replication and how this is linked with global cell cycle controls. The fission yeast gene cdc18 is required for DNA replication and is transcriptionally activated by the cdc10/res1/res2 control acting at START in late G1. We show here that overexpressing cdc18 is able to bring about repeated rounds of DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis and of continuing protein synthesis. The level of the cdc18-encoded protein p65cdc18 is periodic in the cell cycle, peaking at the G1 to S phase transition, and p65cdc18 is located in the nucleus when cdc18 is overexpressed. We propose that p65cdc18 acts at the initiation of DNA replication and plays a major role in controlling the onset of S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1907444416,"The locations of the carboxyl-terminal two thirds of the A alpha chains, or the alpha C domains, were determined for fibrinogen and some of its derivatives by electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed preparations. A monoclonal antibody, G8, to the carboxyl-terminal 150 amino acids of the A alpha chain, binds near the central region of fibrinogen, indicating that the alpha C domains of most molecules are not normally visible because they are on or near the amino-terminal disulfide knot. At pH 3.5, fibrinogen and fibrin monomers appear to be similar, with a projection terminating in a small globular domain from each end of most molecules. In contrast, fragment X monomers, produced by cleavage of the alpha C domains from fibrinogen with plasmin, show no such projections. When fibrin monomer is brought to neutral pH under conditions where polymerization is delayed, individual molecules are still visible showing the alpha C domains as a single additional nodule near the central region. Moreover, analysis of clusters of molecules reveals some intermolecular associations via the alpha C domains. A 40-kDa fragment comprising the alpha C domain has been isolated from a plasmin digest of fibrinogen and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and determination of amino-terminal amino acid sequences. Electron microscopy of alpha C fragments reveals individual globular structures, as well as oligomeric aggregates. The addition of alpha C fragments to fibrin monomer followed by dilution to neutral pH to initiate polymerization results in lower turbidity, longer lag period, and slower maximum rate of turbidity increase. Also, electron microscopy reveals complexes of alpha C fragments with fibrin monomer at neutral pH. It appears that the free alpha C fragments can bind to the alpha C domains of fibrin, competing with the normal alpha C domain interactions involved in polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1978523653,"The Wassilewskija strain of Arabidopsis has four genes encoding the tryptophan enzyme phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (PAI) located at three unlinked sites. These four PAI genes are methylated over their regions of DNA homology. When PAI copy number is reduced by deletion of two tandemly arrayed genes (MePAI1-PAI4), a mutant with fluorescent, tryptophan-deficient phenotypes results, because the two remaining methylated PAI genes (MePAI2 and MePAI3) supply insufficient PAI activity. These two methylated genes can be inherited through meiosis, even when they are segregated away from each other in crosses to a strain with unmethylated PAI genes. However, the mutant phenotypes conferred by the methylated PAI genes are unstable, and mutant plants yield occasional revertant somatic sectors and progeny. Revertant lines display coordinately reduced methylation of both PAI2 and PAI3, implying that this hypomethylation acts in a concerted manner across the genome rather than at individual sites."
https://openalex.org/W2054780820,"Ovule development in Arabidopsis involves the formation of three morphologically defined proximal-distal pattern elements. Integuments arise from the central pattern element. Analysis of Bell 1 (Bel 1) mutant ovules indicated that BEL1 was required for integument development. Cloning of the BEL1 locus reveals that it encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. Prior to integument initiation, BEL1 RNA localizes to the central domain, providing molecular evidence for a central pattern element. Therefore, proximal-distal patterning of the ovule involves the regulated expression of the BEL1 gene that controls integument morphogenesis. A model for BEL1 function is evaluated with regard to new data showing the expression pattern of the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) early in wild-type and BEL1 ovule development."

https://openalex.org/W2031603502,"The structure of E. coli core RNA polymerase (RNAP) has been determined to approximately 23 A resolution by three-dimensional reconstruction from electron micrographs of flattened helical crystals. The structure reveals extensive conformational changes when compared with the previously determined E. coli RNAP holoenzyme structure, but resembles the yeast RNAPII structure. While each of these structures contains a thumb-like projection surrounding a channel 25 A in diameter, the E. coli RNAP holoenzyme thumb defines a deep but open groove on the molecule, whereas the thumb of E. coli core and yeast RNAPII form part of a ring that surrounds the channel. This may define promoter-binding and elongation conformations of RNAP, as E. coli holoenzyme recognizes promoter sites on double-stranded DNA, while both E. coli core and yeast RNAPII are elongating forms of the polymerase and are incapable of promoter recognition."

https://openalex.org/W1549319495,"Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to amplify mouse brain cDNA sequences homologous to conserved regions of known cGMP-dependent protein kinases, and two classes of products were identified. The first class (CGKI) of amplification products contained approximately 1.0 kilobase (kb) of DNA sequence between the oligonucleotide primers, and this sequence showed a high degree of homology (90% identity) with the known bovine and human type I cDNA sequences for cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The second class (CGKII) of amplification products contained approximately 1.1 kb of DNA sequence between the oligonucleotide primers, and this sequence showed a much lower homology (65% identity) with the bovine and human type I cDNA sequences. Northern blot analysis showed that CGKI transcripts of 8.5 kb were abundant in brain and lung, whereas a 7-kb transcript could be detected in testis. CGKII transcripts of 6 kb were also abundant in brain and lung but could be detected at lower levels in kidney. The CGKII amplification product was used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library, and four overlapping cDNA clones were isolated which comprised the entire CGKII coding region. The predicted CGKII protein consists of 761 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 87 kDa. The CGKII protein shows highest homology to the catalytic (66% amino acid identity) and regulatory domains (45% identity) of bovine and human CGKI. Little homology is observed at the amino terminus or in the region linking the regulatory and catalytic domains. An expression vector for mouse CGKII was constructed and transfected into COS-1 cells where it directed the expression of a protein kinase which was activated by cGMP with an apparent K alpha of 300 nM cGMP."
https://openalex.org/W2063069260,"Cardiac m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors reduce heart rate by coupling to heterotrimeric (alpha beta gamma) guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins that activate IKACh, an inward rectifier K+ channel (IRK). Activation of the GIRK subunit of IKACh requires G beta gamma subunits; however, the structural basis of channel regulation is unknown. To determine which sequences confer G beta gamma regulation upon IRKs, we generated chimeric proteins composed of GIRK and RB-IRK2, a related, G protein-insensitive channel. Importantly, a chimeric channel containing the hydrophobic pore region of RB-IRK2 joined to the amino and carboxyl termini of GIRK exhibited voltage- and receptor-dependent activation in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, carboxy-terminal sequences specific to this chimera and GIRK bound G beta gamma subunits in vitro. Thus, G beta gamma may regulate IRKs by interacting with sequences adjacent to the putative channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W1991272752,"During the growth of axons, the surface area of the neuron increases dramatically. Membrane addition as well as exchange could contribute to rapid membrane dynamics or flow. Using diffusing latex beads to monitor membrane flow, we find that axonal membrane flows rapidly (7 microns/min) from growth cone to cell body during axon growth and that flow is inhibited by brefeldin A. To power this flow, there is a membrane lesion gradient from growth cone to cell body that could draw the membrane over the axon at that rate. Further, when an artificial flow is induced to the center of the axon by use of laser tweezers, the primary source of the membrane is from the growth cone. We suggest that during neuron growth, there is excess membrane added at the growth cone in chick dorsal ganglia (DRGs) that undergoes edcocytosis at the cell body, thereby creating a flow that can rapidly alter the content of the axon membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2007320902,"R7 photoreceptor fate in the Drosophila eye induced by the activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase and the RAS/MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. We show that expression of a constitutively activated JUN isoform in ommatidial precursor cells is sufficient to induce R7 fate independent of upstream signals normally required for photoreceptor determination. We present evidence that JUN interacts with the ETS domain protein Pointed to promote R7 formation. This interaction is cooperative when both proteins are targeted to the same promoter and is antagonized by another ETS domain protein, YAN, a negative regulator of R7 development. Furthermore, phyllopod, a putative transcriptional target of RAS pathway activation during R7 induction, behaves as a suppressor of activated JUN. Taken together, these data suggest that JUN and Pointed act on common target genes to promote neuronal differentiation in the Drosophila eye, and that phyllopod might be such a common target."
https://openalex.org/W1584215988,"A transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activating element (TAE), with a nuclear factor-1 (NF-1)-like sequence, was previously located 1.6 kilobases upstream from the transcription start site in the alpha 1(I) collagen promoter (Ritzenthaler, J. D., Goldstein, R. H., Fine, A., Lichtler, A., Rowe, D. W., and Smith, B. D. (1991) Biochem. J. 280, 157-162). Double-stranded TAE, but not NF-1 consensus sequences, abrogated TGF-beta stimulation of co-transfected collagen promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs. Mutations in non-NF-1 binding sites, located by methylation interference, eliminated activity of the TAE oligonucleotide. However, TAE sequences failed to bind in vitro expressed NF-1 protein, to compete for NF-1-binding proteins, and to bind with protein which reacts with antibodies to NF-1 family of proteins. Within the TAE there was an activator protein 2 (AP-2) binding site. Although AP-2 protein bound to TAE, antibodies to AP-2 did not react with nuclear protein-TAE complexes. TAE bound to a 34,000-Da protein on Southwestern analysis. However, the UV-cross-linked TAE-nuclear protein complex was 82,000 Da. Finally, a dose-response study demonstrated that TGF-beta increased TAE nuclear binding proteins at lower doses with a different response curve than NF-1 nuclear binding proteins. Taken together these data demonstrated that TGF-beta functions in human lung fibroblasts to activate collagen transcription through TAE sites by protein complexes independent of NF-1 or AP-2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2062273992,"The solution structure of a 24.4 kDa specific complex of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the human ETS1 (hETS1) oncoprotein with a 17-mer DNA has been solved by NMR. The interaction of the hETS1 DBD with DNA reveals a surprising twist on the general features of helix-turn-helix (HTH)-DNA interactions. Major groove recognition involves the C-terminal two thirds of the HTH recognition helix, while minor groove recognition occurs via true intercalation of the side chain of Trp-28, which extends from the minor to the major groove. This results in a sharp kink of approximately 60 degrees and a widening of the minor groove over one-half turn of the DNA. The orientation of the HTH element of the hETS1 DBD with respect to the major groove is significantly rotated relative to other HTH proteins. These observations establish the ETS family of DNA-binding proteins as a distinct family of HTH proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1495707073,"Kinesin light chain (KLC) complexes with the kinesin heavy chain (KHC) to form native kinesin. Proposed functions of KLC include coupling of cargo to KHC or modulation of KHC ATPase activity. In this paper we use the KHC tail, which binds specifically to KLC in blot overlays, as a probe to clone a cDNA encoding KLC from a Drosophila expression library. The identified clone encodes a protein with 70% amino acid identity to rat KLC. Drosophila KLC is predicted to form an alpha-helical coiled-coil between residues 34 and 129, followed by five imperfect tandem repeats of unknown function and a sixth shorter motif. These repeats are highly conserved across species. The Drosophila KLC gene is located at 69D on the third chromosome and is widely expressed, with 1.8-kb transcripts in most tissues, and slightly smaller transcripts in gonads. Finally, we present evidence that the heptad repeats of KLC are required for interaction with the KHC tail. Since the KHC tail used in our assay includes about 20 heptad repeats, this result suggests that KHC and KLC interact via coiled-coils. Such an interaction could provide stability to the KHC-KLC complex in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W182149432,"Studies of the human m2 (hm2) muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR) have been performed to provide further insights into the potential regulation of these receptors by isoforms of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK). The hm2 mAChR and the isoforms beta ARK1 and beta ARK2 were individually expressed in, and purified from, insect Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. The expressed hm2 receptors were tested as substrates for beta ARK1 and beta ARK2 in vitro using concentrations of receptors and kinases similar to those found in intact cells. The hm2 mAChR were phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner to 4-5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor by beta ARK1 or beta ARK2. The reactions were highly dependent on agonist; the antagonist atropine, and heparin, a beta ARK inhibitor, both prevented the beta ARK-mediated phosphorylation. The rates of phosphorylation catalyzed by both isoforms were similar, with half-maximal phosphorylation occurring in less than 5 min. Under the conditions employed the stoichiometries, but not the rates, of phosphorylation catalyzed by both kinases were increased 2-3-fold by either the heterotrimeric G-protein G(o) or the beta gamma subunits of transducin. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments indicated that similar sites were phosphorylated by the two beta ARK isoforms. In order to test for functional effects of the phosphorylation mediated by the beta ARK isoforms, the receptors were reconstituted with purified G(o) and were tested for their ability to stimulate guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding. The conditions leading to maximal receptor phosphorylation resulted in a 30-50% reduction in the ability of the receptors to stimulate GTP gamma S binding to G(o). The results demonstrate that the hm2 mAChR are excellent substrates in vitro for both beta ARK1 and beta ARK2 and that extensive phosphorylation by these enzymes occurs in the presence of the beta gamma subunits of G proteins. The beta ARK-mediated phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR causes a perturbation of receptor/G-protein coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1561546882,"The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain is an essential component of high and intermediate affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2Rs), playing critical roles for ligand binding and internalization. We report here the isolation and characterization of the genomic locus for human IL-2R gamma, which, like IL-2R beta, is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The IL-2R gamma gene is composed of eight exons and seven introns and spans approximately 4.2 kilobases. Analogous to the IL-2R beta gene, the two pairs of conserved cysteines typical of cytokine receptor superfamily proteins are located in adjacent exons, and the conserved WSXWS motif is located in the exon preceding the one that encodes the transmembrane domain and a small part of the cytoplasmic domain. In each gene, the remainder of the cytoplasmic domain is encoded by the final two exons. Southern blot analysis suggests that IL-2R gamma is encoded by a single copy gene. Cross-hybridizing sequences were detected in DNA derived from a number of other mammalian species but not from yeast. Primer extension analysis and ribonuclease protection assays revealed that there are three principal transcription initiation sites located 32-38 nucleotides 5' to the translation initiation AUG codon. These sites are upstream of the 5' end of the published IL-2R gamma cDNA sequence. The region 5' to the transcription initiation sites exhibited promoter activity when cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. With this study, the organization of the genes encoding all three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the IL-2 receptor has been determined and promoters for each identified."

https://openalex.org/W1558021726,"The erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) is synthesized in transfected Ba/F3 cells as a major 64-kDa endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-sensitive species, with a single N-linked oligosaccharide, and a minor 62-kDa unglycosylated form. Approximately half of the newly made EPO-R is processed to a mature 66-kDa form with a Golgi-processed Endo H-resistant oligosaccharide, of which only a minor fraction is expressed at the cell surface. Both the Endo H-sensitive and the Endo H-resistant forms of the receptor have a half-life of 45-60 min (Yoshimura, A., D'Andrea, A. D., and Lodish, H. F. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 4139-4143). The mature, Endo H-resistant form of the EPO-R appears to be degraded in lysosomes or in other acidic organelles, since receptor degradation is blocked by treatment with NH4Cl, chloroquine, or leupeptin. A fraction of the Endo H-resistant EPO-R molecules is cleaved, generating two fragments of 46 and 39 kDa. The sizes of these fragments and their reactivities with carboxyl-terminal-specific antibodies indicate that the receptor is cleaved at two sites in the exoplasmic domain, 7 kDa apart, and carboxyl-terminal to the N-glycosylation site. Both fragments are membrane anchored and are probably formed in a late or post-Golgi compartment, since their formation is blocked by incubation of cells at 20 degrees C or by incubation with brefeldin A. These membrane-anchored COOH-terminal fragments are probably degraded in lysosomes or in other acidic vesicles as cell fractionation demonstrates that they colocalize with lysosomes, and similar to the intact EPO-R, their degradation is inhibited by NH4Cl. Finally, double labeling immunofluorescence experiments demonstrate that in NH4Cl-treated cells both intact mature EPO-R and the 46- and 39-kDa fragments accumulate in lysosomes and presumably are normally degraded there. The sensitivity of the EPO-R to endoproteolytic cleavages in its exoplasmic domain may relate to its low surface expression and to its extreme metabolic instability."
https://openalex.org/W1566434220,"Abstract Neutral glycosphingolipids (GSLs) from amastigote forms of Leishmania (L.) amazonensis were isolated, and their structures and biological properties were characterized. Based on various immunochemical methods, these GSLs were shown to be expressed at certain stages of amastigote development. GSLs were extracted and purified from amastigotes of hamster foot lesions by established procedures. Three mouse monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for carbohydrate epitopes of these GSLs were established, and their inhibition of parasite binding and macrophage invasion was analyzed. MoAb ST-3 inhibited 80% of macrophage invasion by amastigotes and 60% of that by promastigotes. Since GSLs reacting with MoAb ST-3 were found in amastigotes but not in promastigotes, ST-3 reactivity with promastigotes presumably depends on an epitope present on an unidentified promastigote glycoconjugate. MoAbs ST-4 and ST-5 inhibited 60-80% of macrophage invasion by amastigotes but were not effective in preventing macrophage invasion by promastigotes. Fab fragments of ST-3 inhibited invasion of cultured mouse macrophages by amastigotes (80%) or promastigotes (60%). The GSL with the simplest structure recognized by these MoAbs was isolated and characterized (by negative ion fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the permethylated compound, degradation with exoglycosidases, and 1H NMR) as the novel globoseries structure Gal beta 1-->3Gal alpha 1-->4Gal beta 1-->4Glc beta 1-->Cer, which has beta 1-->3Gal in place of the beta 1-->3GalNAc of globoside. The ceramide contains a 16:0 fatty acid and d18:1 sphingosine as the long chain base. The MoAbs also reacted with a series of GSLs from amastigote forms of L. amazonensis, with longer carbohydrate chains, probably containing identical end groups Gal beta 1-->3Gal alpha 1-->R. Expression of surface GSLs may render amastigote forms more effective than promastigotes in binding and invading host macrophages, thus enhancing the infectious process."
https://openalex.org/W1996092870,"The detection and discrimination of odorants in mammals is thought to be mediated by a family of 100-1000 seven transmembrane domain receptor proteins, although none of these putative olfactory receptors have been shown to bind individual odorants with high affinity. We have used a genetic approach to identify the genomic regions responsible for the differential ability of two inbred mouse strains to detect a single odorant, isovaleric acid. Results obtained with a behavioral assay were consistent with a limited number of genes conferring the ability to detect isovaleric acid. One genetic location mapped to a 0.3 cM region between D4MIT37 and D4MIT156 on mouse chromosome 4. A second locus mapped to the distal end of mouse chromosome 6. The most likely cause of the behavior difference between the two strains of mice is the loss of the receptor protein or proteins responsible for recognizing isovaleric acid. High resolution genetic mapping provides a novel approach to the identification of genes critical for the detection of particular odorants."
https://openalex.org/W2050151990,"Transposition of phage Mu takes place within higher order protein-DNA complexes called transpososomes. These complexes contain the two Mu genome ends synapsed by a tetramer of Mu transposase (MuA). Transpososome assembly is tightly controlled by multiple protein and DNA sequence cofactors. We find that assembly can occur through two distinct pathways. One previously described pathway depends on an enhancer-like sequence element, the internal activation sequence (IAS). The second pathway depends on a MuB protein-target DNA complex. For both pathways, all four MuA monomers in the tetramer need to interact with an assembly-assisting element, either the IAS or MuB. However, once assembled, not all MuA monomers within the transpososome need to interact with MuB to capture MuB-bound target DNA. The multiple layers of control likely are used in vivo to ensure efficient rounds of DNA replication when needed, while minimizing unwanted transposition products."
https://openalex.org/W1502501369,"The c-ski proto-oncogene product (c-Ski) is localized in the nuclei, but its function and biochemical properties are unclear. C-Ski can bind to DNA only in association with uncharacterized protein(s). A lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened with the biotinylated Ski to isolate genes encoding proteins capable of forming complexes with Ski. Two clones encoding Ski itself or the ski-related gene product SnoN were isolated in this manner, suggesting that Ski can form a complex with Ski itself or with SnoN. Trimerization of Ski with itself and SnoN was also confirmed by protein cross-linking and protein blot analysis. The carboxyl-terminal 1/5 regions of Ski and SnoN are required for complex formation. This region has a homology between two proteins and two putative leucine zipper-like structures, suggesting that these leucine zipper-like structures mediate trimerization by making side-to-side interactions between the conserved leucines. Thus, Ski and SnoN have the capacity to associate with other proteins, and a complex formation of c-Ski with itself, SnoN, and uncharacterized proteins might play a key role in the function of Ski."
https://openalex.org/W1895627146,"Single-chain antibodies are comprised of immunoglobulin light and heavy chain variable domains joined through a polypeptide linker. A single-chain autoantibody, containing the 14-amino acid 212-polypeptide linker (GSTSGSGKSSEGKG), was constructed based on the light and heavy chain variable region gene sequences of anti-single-stranded DNA autoantibody BV04-01 (IgG2b, kappa). Following protein expression in Escherichia coli, denaturation, refolding, and affinity purification, single-chain autoantibody 04-01 binding with single-stranded DNA and poly(dT) was characterized in solid-phase and solution-phase assays. Homopolymer ligand binding results demonstrated that single-chain autoantibody 04-01 possessed anti-DNA binding properties similar to BV04-01 IgG and Fab fragments. Based on x-ray crystallographic analyses of BV04-01, site-specific mutagenesis studies were conducted on 2 residues (L32Tyr and H100aTrp) involved in aromatic stacking interactions with the middle thymidine of a (dT)3 ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1530401741,"High mobility group (HMG) 14 is a ubiquitous chromosomal protein that binds specifically to nucleosomal DNA and may be involved in a process that confers distinct properties to the chromatin structure of transcriptionally active genes. To explore the involvement of this protein in regulation of gene expression, we studied the effect of aberrant expression of HMG-14 protein on cellular differentiation. We produced stably transfected C2C12 mouse myoblasts expressing the human HMG-14 protein under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Transformed colonies retained their potential do differentiate into myotubes. Induction of human HMG-14 expression by dexamethasone inhibited the myogenic process. Revertant colonies, which lost the ability to express human HMG-14, regained the ability to differentiate into myotubes. Inhibition of myoblast differentiation by aberrantly expressed HMG-14 correlated with down-regulation of myogenic determination factors. The results suggest that proper cellular differentiation requires regulated expression of HMG-14 protein and are consistent with the possibility that this protein may be involved in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1544176401,"We estimated in vivo turnover rates of sucrase-isomaltase and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase in adult rats. Fed animals received a primed continuous infusion of phenylalanine (300 microCi, 150 mumol Phe/100 g of body weight for 30 s, then 7.5 microCi, 3.75 mumol Phe/min for 10 to 140 min). Sucrase-isomaltase and lactase-phlorizin hydrolase were immunoprecipitated from jejunal mucosal membranes; isoforms were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Endoglycosidase H digestions and (for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase) N-terminal amino acid sequencing were performed on all isoforms. Specific radioactivity of prosucrase-isomaltase and prolactase-phlorizin hydrolase isoforms reached isotopic equilibrium by 60 and 90 min, respectively. Specific radioactivity of brush border sucrase and lactase did not reach steady state. The isotope kinetic, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and endoglycosidase H digestion data suggested that one of the high molecular weight lactase isoforms is a dimer of mature lactase. Compartmental modeling of specific radioactivity demonstrated that mean intracellular residence time is 59 min for prosucrase-isomaltase isoforms and 68 min for prolactase-phlorizin hydrolase isoforms. Mean residence time in the brush border was 5.8 h for sucrase and 7.8 h for lactase. Fractional synthesis rates were 414%/day for sucrase and 307%/day for lactase. Thus, in vivo brush border sucrase and lactase turn over at similar rates in the adult rat."
https://openalex.org/W119518471,"LR1 is a lipopolysaccharide-inducible B cell-specific DNA binding activity, with sites in the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer and switch regions. We describe the purification of this 106-kDa protein from nuclear extracts of PD31 murine pre-B cells, using three chromatographic steps. The DNA binding activity of LR1 is dependent upon phosphorylation, and we show that LR1 is post-translationally modified by N-acetylglucosamine addition. The importance of regulatory modification to LR1 DNA binding activity is apparent from the chromatographic pattern on the anion exchange resin Mono Q: while the LR1 polypeptide elutes over a broad salt range from the column, DNA binding activity is confined to a narrow peak eluting at the highest salt."
https://openalex.org/W202279686,"We describe here the identification, purification, and characterization of a semialdehyde dehydrogenase with a novel fatty acid binding function. The coenzyme A derivative of an 125I-labeled long chain saturated fatty acid (13-iodo-tridecanoate) was used to tag proteins which bind myristoyl-CoA. A prominent 57 kDa band was identified, which was isolated from bovine liver by a high salt extraction followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Sequential chromatographic separation using phenyl-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, DEAE-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Fast Flow S resins resulted in a purified protein that migrated as a single band of 57 kDa on denaturing gels. Sephacryl-200 gel filtration provided a native molecular mass estimation of 118 kDa suggesting that this protein exists as a dimer. Two-dimensional gel analysis resolved three isoform variants with pI values of 7.4, 7.7, and 7.9, respectively, and established that the pI = 7.9 form has the highest propensity for fatty acid binding. We proceeded to generate tryptic peptides from the purified protein and subjected several peptides to microchemical sequencing. Degenerate oligonucleotide probes were designed and polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a unique nucleotide sequence. Subsequent screening of a bovine liver cDNA library yielded a 1.7-kilobase clone which encodes a protein of 537 amino acids (58 kDa) with 95% identity to mammalian methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH). In vitro assays confirmed that the purified 57-kDa protein exhibited MMSDH activity, and that preincubation of the enzyme with fatty acyl-CoA inhibited its dehydrogenase activity. The myristyl-CoA analog therefore serves as an affinity label for MMSDH. We propose that fatty acyl CoAs may have the potential to function as enzyme regulators in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1561137813,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) is a heterotrimer composed of three subunits designated alpha, beta, and gamma. These proteins exist in equimolar amounts in the cell and have not been detected as isolated subunits. Our research examines the basis of their balanced synthesis. Northern analysis of K562 cell mRNA revealed that eIF-2 beta was five times more abundant than eIF-2 alpha. However, immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled K562 cells showed an equimolar rate of synthesis of eIF-2 alpha and -beta despite the 5-fold difference in the size of their mRNA pools. Addition of equal amounts of synthetic capped mRNA for eIF-2 alpha and eIF-2 beta to an in vitro translation reaction produced five times more eIF-2 alpha protein than eIF-2 beta. Determination of the polysome profile for alpha and beta mRNA in K562 cells indicated eIF-2 alpha was translated more efficiently than eIF-2 beta. Substitution of either the initiation codon context or the leader of the beta mRNA for that of alpha had only a minor effect on the translational efficiency of beta. Comparison of the rate of ribosomal elongation for the two mRNAs indicated that ribosomes associated with the beta mRNA elongate at a rate 4-fold less than that of eIF-2 alpha. Thus, the balanced translation of alpha and beta mRNA is primarily the result of a 4-fold difference in the rate of ribosomal elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1547560832,"Two distinct components, alpha and beta chains, which compose the high affinity receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) do not contain any catalytic domains of known enzymes. However, in mouse lymphoid cell lines transfected with cDNAs of the both chains, GM-CSF triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins and allows continuous proliferation. To elucidate whether the high affinity receptor functions in nonhematopoietic cells, we have reconstituted human GM-CSF receptor in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In NIH3T3 clones, in which the high affinity receptor is reconstituted, human GM-CSF has triggered rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, transfected beta chain, and another protein of 40-45 kDa. Moreover, human GM-CSF stimulated DNA synthesis and induced morphological transformation. These observations indicate that coordinately expressed alpha and beta chains of human GM-CSF receptor activates intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinases by the stimulation with human GM-CSF and that the activated protein-tyrosine kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues of an intrinsic 40-45-kDa protein and the transfected beta chain in NIH3T3 cells. Activation of the protein-tyrosine kinases is likely to have biological functions to induce DNA synthesis and morphological transformation of mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2462915857,"Mutant forms of Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase, W76F (Trp beta 76 replaced by Phe) (Nishimura, J. S., Mann, C. J., Ybarra, J., Mitchell, T., and Horowitz, P. M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 862-865), and W43,76,248F (all three Trp replaced by Phe) were found to be more sensitive to proteolysis by clostripain than the wild-type enzyme or other Trp mutant proteins. Like wild-type enzyme, sensitivity to trypsin was apparent when the enzyme forms were in the dephosphorylated state. Sensitivity to clostripain was the same, whether mutant or wild-type forms were in the phosphorylated or dephosphorylated state. The substrates ADP and ATP both protected the enzymes against inactivation by clostripain, with dissociation constants for protection of W76F of 33 and 125 microM, respectively. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of clostripain digests revealed preferential digestion of the beta-subunit and the appearance of 40- and 31-kDa species, with amino termini corresponding to residues 15 and 81, respectively, of the beta-subunit. Mutagenic replacement of Arg beta 80, but not Arg beta 14, with Lys resulted in an enzyme that was as resistant to clostripain as wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that Arg beta 80 is the principal site of inactivation by clostripain and may be involved in the binding of ADP and ATP to succinyl-CoA synthetase."
