https://openalex.org/W1597365737,"Abstract Adenosine kinase has been partially purified from homogenates of rabbit liver and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The kinase preparation obtained was free of adenosine deaminase and almost free of adenosine triphosphatase activity. In addition to adenosine, 34 analogues or derivatives of adenosine have been investigated with the enzyme. Of these compounds, 16 were substrates, and the Michaelis constants and maximal velocities of these substrates have been determined. In the presence of myokinase, at least 10 compounds were further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1607919806,"Abstract The structure of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region in the chondroitin 4-sulfate-protein complex of bovine nasal septum has been investigated. Three neutral oligosaccharides derived from the linkage region were isolated from chondroitin 4-sulfate: 3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-galactose, 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-xylose, and O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-d-xylose, respectively. On the basis of the present findings and previously published data, the following structure is proposed for the carbohydrate sequence in the chondroitin 4-sulfate-protein linkage region.

https://openalex.org/W1530303870,"Abstract Partial hepatectomy and acute stress (intraperitoneal injection of Celite) cause increases in the rates of synthesis of serum albumin and fibrinogen, proteins that are formed mainly or entirely by the liver. The rises in protein synthesis after removal of part of the liver differ kinetically from those after acute stress. In addition, only the response to partial hepatectomy is independent of the adrenal glands. Both responses seem to be related to an increase in the ability of liver polyribosomes to form protein."
https://openalex.org/W1534990853,"Abstract A microsomal fraction from developing seeds of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) catalyzes the hydroxylation of oleyl coenzyme A to ricinoleic acid and has the properties of a mixed function oxidase. Only preparations from seeds at a certain stage of development have hydroxylating activity. Oxygen and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are obligatory cofactors (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is relatively inactive), and an activated form of oleic acid, i.e. the CoA thioester, is required as substrate. Enzyme-bound iron is presumably involved in the hydroxylation, which is inhibited by thiol reagents, cyanide, azide, and chelating agents, but not by carbon monoxide. The hydroxylating enzyme shows a marked substrate specificity for oleic acid. Stearic, linoleic, vaccenic, and elaidic acids are not hydroxylated. Linoleic acid is not an intermediate in the conversion of oleic acid to ricinoleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1526373070,"Abstract The possible role of inorganic pyrophosphate as an energy source for synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate was evaluated by determining the equilibrium constants of three reactions in which CO2 is fixed into oxalacetate. The experimental constants (Kexp) were determined on the basis of total concentrations of reactants. Then K'ionic for 25°, 0.1 ionic strength, and selected ionic species was estimated from Kexp. For the reaction catalyzed by P-enolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase (pyrophosphorylase:oxalacetate carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.38), K'ionic expressed as (oxalacetate2-) (HPP3-) / (P-enolpyruvate3-) (HPi2-)(HCO3-) (H+) was found to be (9 ± 2) x 107. For the reaction catalyzed by P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (guanosine triphosphate:oxalacetate carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.32), K'ionic expressed as (oxalacetate2-) (ITP4-)/(P-enolpyruvate3-)(IDP3-)(HCO3-) (H+) is (2.2 ± 0.5) x 107. With pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate:CO2 ligase (adenosine diphosphate), EC 6.4.1.1), K'ionic expressed as (oxalacetate2-) (ADP3-)(HPi2-)(H+)/(pyruvate1-)(HCO3-)(ATP4-) is (1.4 ± 0.4) x 10-6. Equilibrium constants for other conditions have been calculated from Kionic. These constants are expressed in terms of total concentrations of each reactant and are designated K'anal· K'anal corresponds to the Kexp which would be observed under the selected conditions. It is shown that variations of the Mg2+ concentration and pH affect each equilibrium differently. Pyruvate carboxylase and P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, when linked, catalyze the formation of P-enolpyruvate from pyruvate with utilization of ATP and ITP. Likewise, it has been observed that pyruvate carboxylase and carboxytransphosphorylase may be linked and that P-enolpyruvate is synthesized from pyruvate with utilization of ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate. The ΔF'anal (ΔF'anal = -RT In K'anal) of the linked reaction with ATP and PPi is not as favorable for synthesis of P-enolpyruvate as it is with ATP and ITP. At 0.5 mm Mg2+, 0.1 ionic strength, and pH 8.0, it is 0.2 ± 0.3 kcal compared to -2.3 ± 0.3 kcal for the linked reaction with ATP and ITP. A low concentration of Mg2+ and an alkaline pH is most favorable for the synthesis with PPi. The linked reactions with carboxytransphosphorylase may provide a mechanism for the utilization of the energy of inorganic pyrophosphate. The free energy of hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate has been estimated as a function of Mg2+ concentration and pH. At 0.1 ionic strength, 25°, and pH 7.0, and in the absence of Mg2+, the ΔF'anal is -8.0 ± 0.3 kcal and with Mg2+ at 5 mm, the ΔF'anal is -4.5 ± 0.3 kcal."

https://openalex.org/W1575163814,"1. After infection of Escherichia coli B with T-even bacteriophages, a novel 3'-deoxynucleotidase activity appears. The induction is blocked by the presence of chloramphenicol and is not observed after infection with T-odd bacteriophages. This enzyme has been purified approximately 2000-fold from extracts of E. coli B infected with T4 am 82. In addition to its attack on 3'-deoxymononucleotides, the enzyme also catalyzes the selective removal of 3'-phosphoryl groups from DNA. The enzyme preparations are without effect on 3'-ribomononucleotides, 3'-phosphoryl groups of RNA, or any 5'-phosphate esters. 2. A survey of various strains of E. coli revealed strain C to be a rich source of 3'-nucleotidase activity. This activity was purified approximately 1300-fold and the final preparation was found to possess the following specificity. The enzymatic activity is nonspecific at the mononucleotide level, catalyzing the cleavage of 2',3'- and 5'-substituted ribomononucleotides as well as 3'- or 5'-deoxymononucleotides. The enzyme also cleaves 3',5'-nucleoside diphosphates. In its attack on pTp, the enzyme appears to remove first the 3'-phosphate group before cleaving the 5'-phosphoester bond. This apparent preference for the cleavage of the 3'-phosphate group in the presence of a 5'-phosphate substitution is supported by observations on the specificity of the enzyme with the use of polynucleotides as substrates. Thus, with polynucleotides, only the 2'- or 3'-terminal phosphate groups are removed, while the 5'-phosphoryl termini are not attacked at all. Thus, the purified E. coli C acid phosphatase can be used to measure specifically the 2'- or 3'-phosphate ends of RNA and DNA. 3. After infection of E. coli B with T4 am 82, an enzyme activity which attacks the 5'-phosphate group of RNA and DNA appears. The increase of activity upon infection is prevented if the infection process is carried out in the presence of chloramphenicol. This activity has been purified approximately 3000-fold. The final preparation shows a high degree of specificity in the cleavage of 5'-phosphoryl groups from polynucleotides and is without effect on 5'-mononucleotides. The products formed after the action of the 5'-polynucleotide phosphatase have been identified as inorganic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl-terminated polynucleotides. The latter were identified by their ability to be phosphorylated in the 5'-hydroxylpolynucleotide kinase reaction. The final preparation of 5'-polynucleotide phosphatase is contaminated with 3'-deoxynucleotidase."
https://openalex.org/W1603600328,"Abstract Lipoamide dehydrogenase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide:lipoamide oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.4.3) has been isolated from acid-precipitated human liver particles in a highly purified state by a freezing and thawing technique instead of the heat treatment used by other workers. The enzyme was found to have a molecular weight of 138,000, and to contain 2 moles of flavin adenine dinucleotide per mole of protein. In these respects, as in substrate specificity, Michaelis constant, absorption spectrum, and kinetic parameters, the enzyme is similar to preparations isolated from bovine liver, pig heart, and bacteria. This enzyme catalyzed the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by dihydrolipoamide and exhibited diaphorase and transhydrogenase activities. If the enzyme was incubated with the dithiol inhibitors such as arsenite and cadmium chloride in the presence of NADH, lipoamide dehydrogenase and transhydrogenase activities were strongly inhibited, but diaphorase activity was enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W1854743925,"The conversion of 3-enolpyruvylshikimate 5-phosphate (I) to phenylpyruvate was studied in extracts of Escherichia coli. A separation and partial purification was achieved of the two enzymic activities concerned: chorismate synthetase which catalyzed the 1,4-conjugate elimination (E2') of orthophosphate from I to yield chorismic acid (II), and the enzyme complex catalyzing the reactions chorismate → prephenate (III) → phenylpyruvate. Chorismate synthetase was inactive under aerobic conditions, and could be activated most effectively by a reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide-regenerating system in an atmosphere of H2 or N2. This was accomplished by the reduction of FAD with (a) reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and mammalian diaphorase or bacterial NADH dehydrogenase, or (b) platinum and H2. Reduced riboflavin, FMNH2, and platinum plus H2 alone could replace FADH2. Dithionite activated the enzyme with a short lag period. Sulfhydryl compounds were needed for maximal effect in these activation procedures, but were not indispensable. Chorismate synthetase was activated slowly by NADH, or by thorough removal of oxygen, but only in the presence of thiols. The activation by NADH was probably due to trace amounts of flavins, since their removal abolished this effect. Preliminary evidence suggested that Fe++ may be the labile component of the enzyme responsible for the sensitivity to oxygen, although added Fe++ was also inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W2047650162,"Atropine, administered to cats just prior to the time of the expected circadian rise in levels of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid in plasma, blocks this rise. Atropine does not alter this circadian pattern when administered at other times in the circadian cycle. Results similar to those obtained with atropine have been observed with short-acting barbiturates. Dibenzyline administered just prior to the time of the expected circadian rise is ineffective in blocking this rise. These findings support the hypothesis that the circadian pattern of plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels reflects activation, by the central nervous system, of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis during a ""critical time period"" in the circadian cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1496672682,"Abstract One of the four proteins involved in the cleavage of glycine to 1-carbon units and the transfer of electrons from glycine to diphosphopyridine nucleotide is a flavoprotein. Precipitation of the protein with acid ammonium sulfate in the presence of 1 m potassium bromide separated the coenzyme from the apoenzyme. The latter was fully reactivated by incubation with flavin adenine dinucleotide, but showed no activity with flavin mononucleotide. The flavoprotein could be reduced either by glycine or by reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. When reduced by the latter, no protein other than the flavoprotein was required for the electron transfer, but to achieve a measurable rate of reduction by glycine it was necessary to add the three other proteins plus tetrahydrofolate. Dihydrofolate was entirely inactive in the system."

Control cultures of embryonic mouse cells and 3T3 cells do not contain the particles, and no biologic activity has as yet been associated with them."
https://openalex.org/W2043483947,"Twenty-seven lines of murine tissue cultures derived from 12 different cell pools and grown on various media were examined with the electron microscope for morphologically detectable virus particles. They were also tested for complement-fixing mouse leukemia virus antigens and for recoverable virus. A 100-percent correlation between results obtained by these two methods is reported. An additional 19 lines from 8 different cell pools were examined for either virus particles or complement-fixing antigens. All lines were assayed for neoplastic transformation. Seven cell pools gave rise to lines showing evidence of contamination with leukemia virus. Since most of these lines had also undergone ""spontaneous"" neoplastic transformation in vitro, this virus cannot be excluded as a possible cause of the neoplastic change, or of influencing it. The remaining cell pools gave rise to lines with no evidence of contamination with leukemia virus;but most of these lines also underwent similar transformation. These results suggest that ""spontaneous"" neoplastic transformation can occur in the absence of detectable mouse leukemia virus."
https://openalex.org/W1587664246,"Abstract The enzyme diphosphopyridine nucleotide synthetase (deamido-DPN: ammonia amido-ligase (AMP)), was purified about 450-fold from a crude extract from Escherichia coli by protamine sulfate fractionation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. The reaction catalyzed by DPN synthetase in E. coli was shown to be ATP + deamido-DPN + NH3→DPN + AMP + PPi The enzyme is specific for ATP. Mg++ or Mn++ could satisfy the metal ion requirement. Ammonia was shown to be far superior to l-glutamine as the nitrogen donor for the enzyme. The apparent Km for ammonia was 6.5 x 10-5 m while that for l-glutamine was 1.6 x 10-2 m. Azaserine, an inhibitor of the DPN synthetase (deamido-DPN:glutamine amido-ligase (AMP)) from yeast, did not inhibit the E. coli DPN synthetase. On the other hand, psicofuranine (9-d-psicofuranosyl-6-aminopurine), which was an effective inhibitor of the E. coli DPN synthetase did not inhibit the yeast DPN synthetase. The kinetics and properties of the psicofuranine inhibition were studied."
https://openalex.org/W1616931445,"Abstract 1. Insulin prevented increases in liver glucose 6-phosphatase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase activities in response to cortisol administration, but it did not prevent increases in response to diets high in protein or in fructose. 2. Insulin increased pyruvate kinase activity in animals treated with cortisol or fed a high protein diet; both treatments decrease pyruvate kinase activity. Insulin did not increase the pyruvate kinase activity of animals receiving a high glucose diet. 3. Insulin administration had a more marked effect on glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity than on malic dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) activity. 4. The increases in serine dehydrase, glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase, and malic dehydrogenase in response to cortisol treatment were partially or completely prevented by insulin. The increases in glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase in response to cortisol administration were not affected by insulin. Insulin either had no effect on increases observed in these enzymes after high protein or high fructose feeding or caused even greater increases after dietary treatment. Two enzymes (glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase) not affected by insulin in the glucose-fed group were increased by insulin in groups receiving high protein or high fructose diets."
https://openalex.org/W1593702439,"Abstract Submitochondrial particles, in contrast to heavy mitochondria, are not made deficient in cytochrome c by extraction with isotonic KCl, and they are essentially impermeable to exogenously added cytochrome c. When the particles are made permeable with deoxycholate, however, the electron transfer chain interacts with cytochrome c. Submitochondrial particles which are deficient in cytochrome c may be prepared, however, from mitochondria rendered deficient in cytochrome c. These depleted submitochondrial particles show a decreased rate of those energy-linked processes which are dependent on substrate oxidation, such as phosphorylation, reduction of exogenous diphosphopyridine nucleotide by succinate, and transhydrogenation between pyridine nucleotides. Also, the deficiency in cytochrome c appears to cause a decreased efficiency in these processes. In contrast, when adenosine triphosphate is the source of energy, the systems catalyzing the processes of reversed electron transfer and transhydrogenation are intact and fully functional in the deficient particles."

More than 30 nucleotides have been separated from the three regions and characterized. One of the nucleotides isolated from the isthmus region has been shown, by a series of degradative procedures followed by comparison with authentic samples and oxidation with periodate, to be a new sugar nucleotide in which a disaccharide, O-α-l-fucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranose, and uridine 5'-diphosphate are joined through a glycosidic link."
https://openalex.org/W1568155406,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase catalyzes reversibly the formation of oxalacetate and pyrophosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate, bicarbonate, and orthophosphate, and also catalyzes in the absence of bicarbonate the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and inorganic orthophosphate to pyruvate and inorganic pyrophosphate. Conditions have been investigated which influence the yield of the enzyme from Propionibacterium shermanii. The yield is higher with glycerol than with glucose as a substrate and increases with time of fermentation, 17 to 50 days being optimum. The enzyme has been purified by ammonium phosphate or sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on cellulose-phosphate and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The enzyme has been crystallized in the form of very small needles. The resulting enzyme is nearly homogenous on sedimentation, and the molecular weight is 430,000 ± 30,000. The electrophoretic mobility (microns) descending was 10.3 x 10-5 cm2 per volt. Treatment with 6 m urea yields a subunit or units which after dialysis have a sedimentation constant of s20,w = 7.0 S. The pH optimum of the forward reaction, P-enolpyruvate to oxalacetate, extends over the broad range of 6.3 to 8.0. It is somewhat narrower for the back reaction from oxalacetate to P-enolpyruvate. Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ is required for both the forward and back reactions. The reaction is about 7 times faster from P-enolpyruvate to oxalacetate than from oxalacetate to P-enolpyruvate. The Km values, expressed as millimolar concentration, were as follows for the forward reaction: P-enolpyruvate, 0.5; phosphate, 1.2; Mg2+, 1.2; Mn2+, 0.5; Co2+, 0.5; CO2 plus HCO3-, 4.0 at pH 6.5 and 9.5 at pH 7.8. In the back reaction, the values were: oxalacetate, 0.47; Mg2+, 2.5; and pyrophosphate, 0.22. The catalysis is inhibited by numerous compounds, including KCl and NaCl at high ionic strength. Sulfate is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the forward reaction with a Ki of about 20 mm. Buffers such as Tris-HCl, glycylglycine, and imidazole inhibit both the forward and back reactions. All the products and substrates inhibit the back reaction at quite low concentrations. The enzyme is stable in the absence of thiols, but the reaction is stimulated by a large variety of such compounds. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate inhibits the forward reaction but the inhibition is reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1584357038,"Abstract An activity, named nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, has been found in plasma membrane preparations from rat liver. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of inorganic pyrophosphate from adenosine triphosphate (but not from adenosine diphosphate) and other nucleoside triphosphates by a reaction that appears to be a simple hydrolysis. Evidence is presented to show that the activity is an authentic component of the membranes and that it is largely or completely absent from the liver microsome fraction."

https://openalex.org/W1482096479,"Abstract The purification and properties of geranyl pyrophosphate synthetase are reported. This enzyme is purified simultaneously with the enzyme for the synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate. It does not, however, have geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase activity. This enzyme, obtained as a single band of protein by starch gel electrophoresis, catalyzes the formation of both geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphates from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and 4-14C-isopentenyl pyrophosphate. These products have been identified by paper and gas-liquid chromatography. A pH range of 7.0 to 7.8 is optimum for the reaction. A metal ion is required and either Mg++ or Mn++ may be used, but Mn++ inhibits the reaction at concentrations greater than 4 x 10-3 m. Km values for isopentenyl and dimethylallyl pyrophosphates are 1.25 x 10-6 and 2.2 x 10-6 m, respectively. N-Ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoate strongly inhibit the synthetase reaction, but iodoacetamide has only a slight inhibitory effect. The s20,w value for the synthetase is 4.7."

https://openalex.org/W1520124666,"Abstract The malate-lactate transhydrogenase of Micrococcus lactilyticus has been purified and found to be a colorless protein with a molecular weight of approximately 99,000. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of hydrogen from 3- and 4-carbon straight chain l-α-hydroxy acids to α-keto acids. The reactions catalyzed are readily reversible and the Keq (l-malate) (pyruvate)/(oxalacetate) (l-lactate) = 1.8. The enzyme tightly contains bound pyridine nucleotide which is at its active center. This prosthetic group can be removed from the enzyme only by treatment which causes denaturation of the protein. Oxidation and reduction of the pyridine nucleotide can be measured by changes in absorbance at 345 mµ and by fluorescence. The catalytic activity is believed to be a direct transfer of reducing equivalents from the α-hydroxy acid to the keto acid mediated by the pyridine nucleotide. The oxidized enzyme in the absence of substrate undergoes a spontaneous reduction as measured by an increased fluorescence of the prosthetic group which is probably catalyzed by some groups on the enzyme itself. The non-involvement of this spontaneous reduction in the catalytic transhydrogenation reaction is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1500749600,"Abstract In each of several collagen and gelatin preparations of various origins exposed to the action of 0.06 m alkaline periodate, part of the hydroxylysine resisted destruction by the periodate. The resistant fraction varied from 50% of the total hydroxylysine in bone gelatin to 10% in a citrate-soluble collagen. The resistant fraction was not changed by prolonging the periodate action from 2 min to 2 hours or by digesting gelatin to peptides before the treatment with periodate. It appears that in the periodate-resistant fraction of the hydroxylysine either the hydroxyl group or the amino group of the amino alcohol moiety is bound in covalent combination. Other evidence (20) makes binding of the amino group improbable. Treatment with hydroxylamine under conditions that break ester linkages failed to increase the periodate-resistant fraction of hydroxylysine in bone gelatin, indicating that the resistance was not due to ester linkage of the hydroxyl group."

This increase in half-life has been shown to promote nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis for a longer period of time. These results, together with the increase in nicotinamide deamidase activity that occurs after hypophysectomy, are sufficient to explain the effect of hypophysectomy on the nicotinamide-induced elevation of NAD. The increase in nicotinamide half-life in hypophysectomized animals results, at least in part, from a decreased rate of urinary excretion of the vitamin."

Rous sarcoma virus will not only induce tumours in the original host and other avian species but will also cause in vivo and in vitro malignant transformation of mammalian cells. The induction of sarcomata in Old World non-human primates by Rous sarcoma virus preparations of the Carr-Zilber and Schmidt-Ruppin strains has been reported by four research groups1–5. In most of the in vivo experiments with primates ‘tissue minces’ from Rous sarcoma virus-induced chicken sarcomata were used for inoculation and the published reports gave no clear indication that the tumours were truly invasive and/or metastasizing."
https://openalex.org/W1559227306,"Abstract A new procedure for the isolation of the green a-type heme from bovine heart muscle is described. The heme is extracted with a pyridine-chloroform mixture and separated from lipids and other hemes chromatographically. The product is obtained in nearly quantitative yield, either as a pyridine iron(II) complex or as a disodium salt of a hydroxo iron(III) complex. No evidence was found to suggest that the cytochrome a and a3 components of cytochrome c oxidase have hemes of different structure, nor was a cryptohemin component detected. A previously undetected group of approximate composition C6H12NO4 was isolated as a part of the green heme, and for this reason the hemes isolated by the procedure described here have been designated heme A derivatives to distinguish them from heme a or cytohemin derivatives obtained by other workers with the Warburg and Gewitz procedure."
https://openalex.org/W1551976298,"Abstract Mechanisms of synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid in a thymine-requiring mutant strain (I) of Escherichia coli and its wild parent strain 15 were investigated by analysis of the incorporation of labeled phosphate (32P) into free nucleotides and nucleotidyl units of DNA and ribonucleic acid. After short incubations of strain I with 32P, the relative specific activity of the 5'-nucleotides of the DNA was: deoxythymidylate much greater than deoxyadenylate, which was approximately equal to deoxyguanylate, which was greater than deoxycytidylate. 3'-Deoxyribonucleotides from the same DNA showed only very slight heterogeneity. When 5-bromouracil and 32P were incorporated simultaneously into DNA of strain I, they appeared together in new long segments. A high 5'-phosphate to 3'-phosphate-labeling ratio found in natural DNA only for the case of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate units existed also in the bromodeoxyuridine 3',5'-diphosphate. The findings indicate that (a) the 32P-labeling heterogeneity among 5'-deoxyribonucleotides of E. coli DNA is determined exclusively by differences of specific activity values of proximal precursors of the DNA and (b) the precursors in vivo are activated 5'-deoxyribonucleotides, presumably the deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates. The pre-eminent labeling of 5'-deoxythymidylate or 5'-bromodeoxyuridylate of the DNA of strain I is attributable to acquisition of its phosphate directly from the rapidly renewed γ-phosphate of ATP, without isotope dilution inherent in passing through a large and more slowly renewed α-phosphate pool and 5'-ribonucleotides. An intermediate labeling of 5'-deoxythymidylate in the DNA of the wild strain 15, with no substantial change in the heterogeneity among the other 5'-deoxyribonucleotidyl units as compared with strain I, indicates that, in strain 15, 32P passes through the α-phosphate of diluting pools of 5'-uridylate to reach the 5'-deoxythymidylate even when this strain is grown in a medium with thymine."
https://openalex.org/W2056691882,"LACTATE dehydrogenase (L-lactate: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) occurs in most animal tissues in five different forms1,2, which can easily be separated by electrophoresis, and these dehydrogenases are enzymes of substrate specificity.

A portion of each tumour is preserved for histopathological examination and the remainder is stored at −65° C for future virus extraction.
https://openalex.org/W2045992200,"DURING investigations of the controlled inactivation of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, an acid phosphatase preparation has been used to effect co-enzyme destruction. Alkaline phosphatases of mammalian origin are known to hydrolyse both pyridoxal and pyridoxamine phosphates1,2 and an alkaline phosphatase preparation from E. coli has been used for the resolution of tryptophanase3. A preliminary report on the inactivation of L-α-alanine : phenylglyoxal transaminase by treatment with alkaline phosphatase has also appeared4. The breakdown of vitamin B6 phosphates by acid phosphatases does not appear to have previously been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1604500847,"Abstract Hematin a isolated from purified cytochrome oxidase reacts with poly-l-lysine and with proteins of high lysine content, such as histone, albumin, and globin, in neutral and alkaline media. At pH 11.6, spectral characteristics of these synthetic complexes are strikingly similar to those of cytochrome oxidase. Although absorbance indices differ, the positions of the band maxima are virtually the same in the oxidized, the reduced, the carbon monoxide-reduced, the borohydride-treated, and the borohydride-treated followed by carbon monoxide reduction forms. After borohydride reaction, the heme a in these complexes as well as in cytochrome oxidase is no longer extractable by acid-acetone. On the other hand, these characteristics are not shared when hematin a is replaced by protohematin. Hematin a does not react with histidine, lysine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, proline, alanine, polyglutamic acid, polyproline, or protamine in either neutral or alkaline media, or with polytyrosine in alkaline solutions under conditions similar to those used for polylysine, i.e. at less than 2 mg of nitrogenous compound per ml. However, the spectra of heme a in the presence of 5% lysine (but not other free amino acids tested, including methionine, histidine, and tyrosine) closely resemble those of the heme a-polylysine complex. Although hematin a reacts with polysarcosine and polyhistidine, the reaction differs from that with polylysine. From the data presented here, together with the behavior of cytochrome oxidase described previously (30), it is tentatively concluded that at least 1 lysine residue of cytochrome oxidase coordinates with the heme iron at pH 11.6, and another lysine residue forms a Schiff base with the formyl group on the porphyrin nucleus. The justification for the conclusion, along with certain reservations, has been pointed out."

https://openalex.org/W1502683882,"Abstract Crude homogenates of rat testicular tissue (centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min) do not convert mevalonic acid into squalene and sterols. Enzymes in the supernatant fraction from high speed centrifugation (105,000 x g) of testicular homogenate from rats or guinea pigs catalyze the formation of prenol pyrophosphates from mevalonate. Two cell-free preparations of rat testicular tissue have been obtained that catalyze the incorporation of mevalonate into squalene and lanosterol. In one system, prenol pyrophosphate is formed by incubation of the soluble enzymes with mevalonic acid, fluoride, and appropriate cofactors. After heat inactivation of the soluble enzymes, squalene is formed during subsequent anaerobic incubation with testicular microsomes, and squalene and lanosterol are formed during subsequent aerobic incubation with a crude homogenate of testicular tissue. In the second system, microsomes dialyzed against 5 mm Mn++ and soluble enzymes dialyzed against 30 mm F- are incubated together with mevalonic acid, cofactors, an adenosine triphosphate-generating system, and a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-generating system. The major product formed from mevalonate was squalene. Crude homogenates of rat testicular tissue contain many endogenous factors that affect the rate of incorporation of mevalonate into prenol pyrophosphates and nonsaponifiable lipids. Microsomes contain a very active adenosine triphosphatase that is inhibited by dialysis at 4° in the absence of Mn++ or by dialysis at 19° with Mn++. Microsomes also contain a prenol pyrophosphate pyrophosphohydrolase that is partially inhibited by 5 mm Mn++. A labile phosphatase has been isolated from the soluble fraction. The soluble phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate from mevalonate 5-phosphate. The phosphatase is inhibited completely by dialysis against 30 mm F-. Successful incorporation of mevalonate into prenol pyrophosphates and squalene by simultaneous incubation of microsomes and soluble enzymes is ascribed either to suitable inactivation of the competing enzymatic processes or to compensation by the addition of cofactor-generating systems. Comparison of similar synthetic and competitive activities from rat liver and rat or guinea pig testis indicates that the ratio of synthetic activities to competitive processes is much more favorable for sterol synthesis by liver enzymes than by testicular enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2005755897,"THE formation of free radicals in biological systems exposed to ionizing radiation is well established1–7. Some of the induced radicals, as well as some of those occurring naturally8, have long lives9–11. The surprising stability of the induced radicals may have far-reaching biological implications. As an example of stability, cystine, on irradiation in vacuo at room temperature, gave electron paramagnetic resonance signals even after 35 days12. Numerous investigations in connexion with irradiation damage of proteins and amino-acids confirm the stability of these radicals13–18. This stability must be considered carefully in assessing the wholesomeness of foods preserved by ionizing radiation. Such assessment involves the concepts of stored chemical energy and consequent radio-mimetic hazard19–20. Chromosomal aberrations have been shown to occur in germinating barley and onion seeds following treatment with orange or apple juice, which had been irradiated with 200 Krad of γ-rays21. Although the radiomimetic precursors generated by irradiation of fruit juices have not been ascertained, preliminary studies indicate that peroxides may be implicated."
