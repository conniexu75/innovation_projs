https://openalex.org/W1527081709,"Activated Factor V (Va) was prepared by treating a high molecular weight form of Factor V with thrombin. The activated Factor V was isolated by ion exchange chromatography and was composed of two polypeptide chains (Mr = 115,000 and 73,000). These chains were separated by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of EDTA. Biologically active Factor Va was restored from the inactive chains by incubation of the two chains in buffers containing MnCl2. Restoration of biological activity was correlated with formation of a complex between the chains as monitored by either disc gel electrophoresis or gel filtration chromatography. The apparent molecular weight of the activated Factor V was 290,000. Factor V was not dissociated in EDTA. However, this protein was split by thrombin to yield an activation intermediate composed of two chains (Mr = 210,000 and 115,000). Like activated Factor V, the two chains of the intermediate can be dissociated in EDTA and separated by gel filtration chromatography. The Factor V activity was restored by incubation of the two inactive chains in buffers containing MnCl2. Like Factor Va, restoration of the biological activity corresponds to formation of a complex between the chains with a higher molcular weight than either of the isolated chains. Incubation of the activation intermediate with thrombin increased the specific activity 3- to 4-fold. This increase in specific activity resulted from cleavage of the heavy chain of the Factor V intermediate by thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1536187233,"S-Adenosylhomocysteinase catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) to adenosine and L-homocysteine without added cofactors. A mechanism is proposed which involves oxidation of the 3'-hydroxyl group of AdoHcy by enzyme-bound NAD+. Following oxidation, L-homocysteine is eliminated, alpha-beta, to give 3'-keto-4'-5'-dehydroadenosine. This compound reacts with water in a Michael type addition to form 3'-ketoadenosine which is then reduced to adenosine. This mechanism is supported by these facts. 1) The enzyme contains 1 tightly bound NAD+ per subunit. Upon addition of substrate, this NAD is converted to NADH. 2) The enzyme catalyzes the exchange of the 4'-proton of substrate with solvent. This exchange is an integral part of the catalytic mechanism. 3) The hydrolysis of [4'-2H]S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine has a Vmax isotope effect of 1.44. This provides additional evidence that cleavage of the C-4' C-H bond is a step on the reaction pathway. 4) 4',5'-Dehydroadenosine is oxidized by the enzyme, then converted into adenosine or into AdoHcy in the presence of L-homocysteine. 5) An adenosine analog, 5'-deoxyadenosine, is oxidized by the enzyme to yield 3'-keto-5'-deoxyadenosine, and an analog of the proposed intermediate, 3'-ketoadenosine. 6) The enzyme catalyzes the exchange of the C-4' proton of 5'-deoxyadenosine. Since the enzyme catalyzes proton abstraction without OH elimination, it was concluded that the elimination of H2O from adenosine proceeds by a carbanion mechanism and not by a concerted elimination. Substrate analogs in which the 5'-OH group of adenosine is replaced by -F, -Cl, or -SMe are not substrates for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1490514699,"Examination of the topological distribution of the rat liver binding protein specific for desialylated serum glycoproteins has revealed a subcellular distribution wherein this receptor is located largely, if not entirely, on the luminal membrane surface of the Golgi complex and smooth microsomes. In contrast, the receptor protein has been identified on the external, or cytosolic, surface of the lysosomal membranes. Recovery of the purified binding protein from whole rat livers established an average half-life survival time of approximately 88 h. Subsequently, injection in vivo of the readily catabolized ligand, asialo-orosomucoid, was found to be without effect upon the turnover rate of the receptor purified from isolated plasma membranes. These observations are interpreted as suggesting the existence of a recycling mechanism wherein the receptor is spared destruction in the lysosomes and remains available for subsequent reinsertion into the hepatocyte plasma membrane as part of a continuing process for the clearance of galactose-terminated ligands from the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1531550096,"Abstract The thrombin-catalyzed activation of single chain bovine Factor V was found to proceed by cleavage of the parent molecule (Mr = 330,000) to intermediates of apparent Mr = 205,000 and 150,000 followed by cleavage of the latter to end products of 94,000 and 74,000 apparent molecular weights. The generation of Factor Va activity coincides with the second cleavage. Further cleavages of the Mr = 205,000 component to apparent Mr = 74,000 and 32,000 fragments and possibly to others also occurred at a slower rate with little or no further increase in activity. The nature of the products and intermediates was unchanged regardless of whether the activation process was complete in either 1 or 10 min. Factor Xa did not catalyze the cleavage nor enhance the activity of Factor V under conditions in which the activation by comparable amounts of thrombin was complete. It was shown using either discrete clotting assays or continuous thrombin analysis with a chromogenic substrate that Factor V was subject to activation in situ by newly formed thrombin in a system initially containing prothrombin, Factor Xa, Ca2+, phospholipid, and unactivated Factor V. The rate of activation of prethrombin 1 was found to be saturable with added Factor Va when all other components were present at fixed levels. The amount of Factor Va required to achieve saturation was linearly dependent on the amount of Factor Xa present, indicating that the two factors interact stoichiometrically in the prothrombinase complex."

https://openalex.org/W1560078646,"Limited proteolytic cleavage of fibronectin and plasma cold-insoluble globulin with cathepsin D produced two major fragments. The smaller, Mr = 72,000 fragment bound to collagen and contained most of the cysteine in the molecule. This region contains intrachain disulfide bonds which maintain a conformation that is necessary for interaction with collagen. Cleavage of the intact protein and the 72,000-dalton fragment with plasmin localized the collagen-binding region in cold-insoluble globulin to a sequence of about 42,000 daltons. This region is located approximately two-thirds of the linear distance from the NH2 terminus of each chain in the dimeric molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1584104642,"Oxygen uptake into intact and reconstituted human red blood cells was measured using dual wavelength, stopped flow techniques. The rate of oxygen uptake by human erythrocytes is roughly 40 times slower (t 1/2 congruent to 80 ms at 0.125 mM O2, 25 degrees C) than the corresponding rate of oxygen combination with free hemoglobin. Oxygen transport through the red cell cytoplasm accounts for part of this difference and predicts a half-time of uptake of about 15 ms, which is still 5 times smaller than that observed experimentally. Further limitation of uptake appears to be due to the presence of unstirred layers of solvent adjacent to the red cell surface. Very rapidly after mixing, these layers form and become depleted of O2 due to uptake by the cells. This requires that the bulk of the oxygen molecules must diffuse over rather large distances, 1.0 to 5.0 micrometer, before they can penetrate the erythrocytes. A mathematical model was developed to take into account diffusion through an unstirred solvent layer which increases in thickness with time. This scheme can account quantitatively both for the dependence of the apparent rate of uptake on O2 concentration and for the shape of the observed time courses. In addition, the diffusion parameters which were developed for the O2 reaction can also be used to describe quantitatively the rates and time courses of CO and ethyl isocyanide uptake and the rates and time courses of O2 release from cells in the presence of sodium dithionite. Finally, the parameters used to describe the stopped flow results can also be used to simulate quantitatively O2 uptake time courses obtained from previous studies with thin films of red cells (Sinha, A. K. (1969) Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, San Francisco; Thews, G. (1959) Arch. Gesamte Physiol. Mens. Tiere (Pflufgers) 268, 308-317)."
https://openalex.org/W1559834502,"The molecular properties of cold-insoluble globulin have been investigated by velocity centrifugation, circular dichroism, and fluorescence at neutral and alkaline pH. The stability of the protein to thermal and guanidine hydrochloride has been evaluated under both conditions. The close parallelism between the properties of cold-insoluble globulin and those of the cell surface protein (fibronectin) serve to establish the essential identity of the structures of the two proteins derived from different sources. It is suggested that the cold-insoluble globulin is composed of several domains connected by flexible polypeptide segments. The large increase in the frictional ratio observed between pH 7.0 and 11.0 can be explained by an expansion of the flexible segments without significant change in the domains. These domains are stable to about 55 degrees C at pH 7.0 but only to about 40 degrees C at pH 11.0."

https://openalex.org/W1504056926,"Monomer proteoglycan was isolated from porcine ovarian follicular fluid by isopycnic CsCl centrifugation in the presence of 4 M guanidine HCl and protease inhibitors. The elution profile of the D1 preparation on Sepharose 2B was similar to that of monomer proteoglycan from bovine nasal cartilage, indicating a similar molecular size. Follicular fluid proteoglycans consist of about 20% protein, 50% dermatan sulfate, and 20% oligosaccharides rich in sialic acid, galactose, mannose, glucosamine, and galactosamine. The amino acid composition of this proteoglycan is significantly different from that of cartilage proteoglycans, with a higher proportion of aspartic acid, threonine, and lysine, and lower amounts of proline and glycine. Alkali-released dermatan sulfate chains are larger on Sepharose 6B (average Mr = 56,000) than chondroitin sulfate chains from cartilage proteoglycans (average Mr = 25,000), and iduronic acid accounts for 9% of total hexuronic acid. Disaccharide units released by chondroitinase ABC consists of 67% 4-sulfated, 22% 6-sulfated, 5% non-sulfated, and 5% disulfated disaccharides. After treatment with 0.05 M NaOH, 1 M NaBH4 at 45 degrees C for 24 h, two major sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides were observed on Sephadex G-25, corresponding to penta- and hexasaccharides. The pentasaccharide contained sialic acid, galactose, glucosamine, and galactosamine in the proportions 1:2:1:1. The galactosamine is O-glycosidically linked to the protein core. This oligosaccharide accounts for approximately 77% of all the sialic acid in the follicular fluid proteoglycans. The hexasaccharide fraction contained sialic acid, galactose, mannose, and glucosamine in the proportions 1:2:1:2. It also contained a small amount of fucose and galactosamine. The linkage of these oligosaccharides to the protein core remains to be determined. The follicular fluid proteoglycans, unlike those from cartilage, do not interact with hyaluronic acid. Digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or plasmin released dermatan sulfate-peptides nearly as small as those released by papain or alkali; in contrast, cartilage proteoglycans were resistant to plasmin and released peptides containing an average of more than four chondroitin sulfate chains after trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion."

https://openalex.org/W1539849127,"The oxygen-consuming oxidation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) occurred much faster in the presence of horseradish peroxidase C (neutral isoenzyme) than in the presence of horseradish peroxidase A (acidic isoenzyme). An intermediate oxidation product of IAA was found to be a hydroperoxide species that reacted with the ferric enzymes to form Compound I at second order rate constants of 6.8 X 10(3) M-1–S-1 for peroxidase A and 2.0 X 10(6) M-1–S-1 for peroxidase C at pH 4.4 The hydroperoxide concentration reached about one-half of the initial IAA concentration at the end of the oxygen-consuming reaction and then decreased slowly. The main intermediate of the enzyme observed during the oxygen-consuming reaction was Compound II, which oxidized IAA to its free radical at rate constants of 1.5 X 10(3) M-1–S1 for peroxidase A and 1.2 times 10(4) M-1–S-1 for peroxidase C at pH 4.4 The results supported the mechanism that the oxygen consumption occurs mainly through the reaction of oxygen with the IAA free radical formed from the peroxidatic oxidation of IAA. The ferric enzymes were not reduced by IAA under strict anaerobic conditions in the presence of carbon monoxide but were reduced upon addition to a small amount of oxygen or hydrogen peroxide to the systems. The results suggested that the ferric enzyme is reduced by the IAA free radical but not by IAA itself. From a comparison of reactivities of oxyperoxidase and Compound II we concluded that the catalytic cycle of ferrous and oxyperoxidases is not involved in the IAA oxidase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1600497872,"We have investigated the mechanism of overproduction of the multifunctional protein catalyzing the first three steps of UMP biosynthesis in stable mutants of Syrian hamster cells in culture. The rate of degradation of this protein is unaltered in one mutant cell line which overproduces it by 118-fold. In all mutants tested, the increase in the rate of synthesis of this protein is equal to the increase in its steady state concentration. There is a similar correlation between steady state levels of this protein in vivo and the capacity of polysomal RNA isolated from these cells to direct the synthesis of the protein in vitro. The one mutant cell line studied contains large amounts of a polysomal poly(A)-containing RNA (Mr = 2.7 +/- 0.2 times 10(6)) that is not detected in wild type cells. This large RNA co-sediments in sucrose gradients with the capacity to direct the synthesis of the multifunctional protein in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1588877212,"The relative molar ratios of each of the histone classes and protein A24 have been determined in nuclei, chromatin, and different electrophoretic forms of mono- and dinucleosomes of cultured mouse cells. For this purpose, [3H]lysine- and [14C]arginine-labeled cells were used for sample preparations, and stoichiometries were estimated from protein radioactivity profiles and known amino acid compositions following sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis. The results demonstrate that upper limits of one and two histone H1 molecules exist per mono- and dinucleosome, respectively. However, isolated nuclei contain less than one copy of histone H1 per nucleosome. In addition, among the chromatin subfractions studied, histones H3, H2B, and H4 are essentially equimolar, while histone H2A is less than equimolar by 19 +/- 9%. This latter finding offers direct support to the proposal of Goldknopf (Goldknopf, I. L., French, M. F., Musso, R., and Busch, H. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 5492-5495) that protein A24 replaces histone H2A in the octamer protein core of the nucleosome, since about 10% of the total histone H2A of cultured mouse cells is in the form of protein A24 and is present in nucleosomes. From the results of the present study, it is concluded that electrophoretic fractionation of mono- and dinucleosomes is not due to variable molar ratios or amounts of the four smaller histone classes, but depends on part on DNA length, the number of associated histone H1 molecules, and non-histone chromosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1585165777,"The high mannose glycopeptide I from IgM (Patient Wa) contains, in addition to the two major oligosaccharides described earlier (Chapman, A., and Kornfeld, R. (1979) J. Biol Chem. 254, 816-823), four minor oligosaccharides. After release from glycopeptide I by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase Cu and reduction with NaBH4, all four oligosaccharides have been shown to have the basic structure: (see article of journal). Oligosaccharide IA-1 (Man9GlcitolNAc) has additional alpha1,2-linked mannose residues attached to positions a and b, and the sequence Man alpha1,2 yields to Man alpha1,2 yields to attached at position c. Oligosaccharide IA-2 (Man8GlcitolNAc) has additional alpha1,2-linked mannose residues attached to positions a, b, and c. Oligosaccharide IA-3 (Man7GlcitolNAc) has additional alpha1,2-linked mannose residues at positions b and c. In contrast, oligosaccharide IA-4 has a single N-acetyglucosamine residue beta1,2-linked to the mannose at position c. Oligosaccharides IA-1, -2 and -3 are thought to represent processing intermediates that are precursors of the major Man6 and Man5 oligosaccharides of glycopeptide I. IA-4 may arise from the Man5 oligosaccharide by the action of UDP-GlcNAc:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase, which catalyzes the first reaction leading to complex oligosaccharide synthesis."

It differs in amino acid composition, namely in the value for cyst(e)ine, from that previously reported. The analyses of the separated chains are given. Activity is related to the number of free cysteine residues and full activity is obtained only after complete reduction of the disulfide bonds. Specific modifications by sulfhydryl reagents and tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone of one thiol group, the one implicated in the activity, are reported. High specificity of alpha-clostripain is restricted to arginyl peptide bonds as tested on parvalbumin."

https://openalex.org/W1499210478,"The complexes formed by antithrombin III with activated bovine Factor X and thrombin have been studied by gel electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate. When subjected to electrophoresis at pH 7, the complexes remain intact, whereas electrophoresis at pH 9 in the presence of Tris results in their dissociation. Dissociation of both the Factor Xa-antithrombin III complex and the thrombin-antithrombin III complex in dodecyl sulfate produces a modified form of antithrombin III which, unlike the native inhibitor, apparently consists of two chains. Gel electrophoresis of the dissociated complexes has also been used to study the sites where the complexes are cleaved by the respective enzymes. The cleavage of the Factor Xa-inhibitor complex by Factor Xa apparently results from hydrolysis of a single bond in the enzyme part of the complex and releases a 15,000-dalton NH2-terminal fragment of the heavy chain, with the light chain attached. Cleavage of the thrombin-inhibitor complex by thrombin involves several cleavages of the heavy (B) chain of the thrombin part of that complex. Neither enzyme-inhibitor complex is subject to cleavage by free enzyme in the inhibitor part of the complex under the conditions used."

https://openalex.org/W1546439690,"The biologic properties of a purified hybrid protein containing the toxic subunit A of ricin and the cell-specific subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCGbeta) in a disulfide conjugate is reported. The biologic activity of the hybrid has been studied by assaying inhibition of protein synthesis in rat R2C Leydig cells and mouse L-cells. The results indicate that for the A subunit to exhibit its toxic effect it must first bind to cells through receptors which are specific for the beta subunit of the hybrid. Thus, only cells with beta-type receptors are sensitive to the toxic effects, which hCG is capable of blocking, while cells which are not target cells for hCG are not subject to the toxic effects. Thus it is concluded that the disulfide conjugate may act as a functional analog of ricin toxin but with altered cell specificity. Or, alternately, the hybrid may be regarded as an analog of hCG but with drastically altered physiologic effects."
https://openalex.org/W1640698669,"Alkaline phosphatase from human first trimester placentas was purified, characterized, and compared with alkaline phosphatases from term placenta and liver. Three forms of first trimester placental alkaline phosphatase (I, IIa, and IIb) were isolated; their relative amounts were 35%, 39%, and 26%, respectively. Phosphatases I and IIa were found to be dimers, whereas phosphatase IIb appeared to be a tetramer consisting of two dimers of phosphatase I or IIa. Phosphatase I was indistinguishable from liver phosphatase by several criteria including apparent molecular weight (Mr = 165,000), size of the monomeric subunit (Mr = 77,000), heat liability, insensitivity to inactivation by antiserum against term placental alkaline phosphatase, and sensitivity to inactivation by antiserum against liver alkaline phosphatase. In addition, phosphatase I and liver phosphatase were equally sensitive to inhibition by amino acids, levamisole, l-p-bromotetramisole, and EDTA. Phosphatase IIa, in contrast, was indistinguishable from term placental alkaline phosphatase by the same criteria: apparent molecular weight (Mr = 115,000), size of the monomeric subunit (Mr = 63,000), heat stability, inactivation by antiserum against term placental alkaline phosphatase, and sensitivity to inhibition by various compounds. These findings clearly demonstrate the existence of two distinct placental alkaline phosphatases, one (phosphatase I) specific for the first trimester placenta and the other (phosphatase IIa) occurring in both first trimester and term placentas."
https://openalex.org/W1505575910,"Translation of chick procollagen mRNA in a reticulocyte lysate system yields a larger proalpha1(I) chain than is observed in vivo. The NH2-terminal sequence of this putative precursor, determined by automated radiosequencing, is Met-Phe-Ser-Phe-Val-X-Ser-Arg-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ile-Ala-Ala-X-X-Leu-Leu. This sequence closely resembles the transient hydrophobic leader (signal) sequences observed on most secreted proteins. When synthesized in the presence of microsomal membranes from dog pancreas, which contain signal peptidase activity, proalpha chains with the electrophoretic mobility of underhydroxylated procollagen polypeptides synthesized in vivo are produced. Estimates of the molecular weight of the NH2-terminal extension of the precursor suggest that the leader sequence may be longer than those commonly found in precursors of secreted proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1577291600,"The conversion of [1-14C]lignoceroyl-CoA to nonhydroxy- and alpha-hydroxyceramides and cerebrosides by brain microsomes of developing rat in the presence of NADPH was investigated. A new technique of thin layer chromatography for the separation of these lipids and unreacted substrate was developed for this assay. The synthesis of nonhydroxy- and hydroxyceramides was significantly stimulated by the addition of heat-stable factor, a factor which is essential in the alpha-hydroxylation of free lignoceric acid (I. Singh and Y. Kishimoto, manuscript in preparation). The addition of sphingosine also stimulated the ceramide synthesis to a great extent. When the microsomes or heat-stable factor were crude, the ceramides formed were further converted to cerebrosides, apparently by UDP-galactose contamination. The purification of these subcellular components resulted in the formation of only ceramides which, in turn, were converted to cerebrosides by the addition of UDP-galactose. These observations indicate that hydroxyceramide is the precursor of hydroxycerebroside and is formed by alpha-hydroxylation of lignoceroyl-CoA and N-acylation of sphingosine. However, lignoceroyl-CoA, like free lignoceric acid, does not appear to be the immediate substrate of the alpha-hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1503741744,"With the use of two sterol biosynthetic mutants, LM cells with various sterol levels were obtained after extended periods of growth with suboptimal sterol concentrations. As was found in the preceding paper, sterol depletion resulted in reduction of the apparent Vmax values for 3-O-methylglucose transport with no change in the apparent Km values. Analysis of the lipid compositions of isolated plasma membranes and crude endoplasmic reticulum membranes showed that depletion of the cellular sterol levels led to a reduction in the sterol content of both membranes. Furthermore, there were significant changes in the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids of both membranes. The amount of 18:1 of the plasma membrane phospholipids increased dramatically accompanied by a marked decrease in 16:0. The loss of transport activity could be reproduced in vitro by removing cholesterol from cells with the use of liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, activity was restored to normal values when the cells were subsequently incubated with liposomes composed of phospholipids plus cholesterol. These findings indicate that 1) an inter-relation exists between the fatty acyl group structure of phospholipids and the sterol content of LM cell membranes which may serve to maintain membrane function and 2) that the reversible inactivation of a surface membrane transport system is directly related to reversible changes in the properties of membrane lipid."
https://openalex.org/W1605219812,"Native spectrin has trypsin-susceptible sites spaced at a constant molecular weight interval. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of spectrin treated with trypsin at low salt concentrations shows a ladder of fragments spaced at approximately 8,000-dalton intervals, from the intact Band 1 (240,000 daltons) and Band 2 (220,000 daltons) down to about 150,000 daltons. The five largest fragments were identified as products of Band 2 using tryptic 125I-peptide mapping of protein from gel slices. Endogenously incorporated [32P]phosphate is absent from the largest fragment, indicating that all phosphorylation sites on spectrin are within 8,000 daltons of a terminal of Band 2. Mapping of both [14C]carboxyamidomethylated cysteine-containing tryptic peptides and 125I-peptides reveals extensive sequence homology between the spectrin subunits. Further, only somewhat over half of the distinct spots expected from the cysteine content are found in both Band 1 and Band 2 peptides. These and the tryptic susceptibility results are interpretable as evidence for a repeating structure in spectrin."

The final N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase preparation was free of all lysosomal sulfatases known to act on sulfated polysaccharides and gave a single band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme appears to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of around 97,000 and displays considerable charge heterogeneity. Multiple forms with pI values between 5.4 and 8.3 with a maximum at pH 7.7 were detected. The enzyme acts on the 3H-trisaccharide with a pH optimum at 5.5 and is active towards the sulfated monosaccharides N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate and glucose 6-sulfate. Although predominantly in exosulfatase, the enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of sulfate from internal N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate moieties at a low rate. The Km for the 3H-trisaccharide, N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate, and glucose 6-sulfate were 0.15, 1.5, and 7.7 mM, respectively. The enzyme is inhibited by albumin, Hg2+, PO43-, SO42-, and CN-.

https://openalex.org/W1531990358,"The measurement of the initial rate of glucose uptake is of critical importance for the kinetic analysis of the effects of temperature, ions, or hormones on the uptake process. Presented here is a highly reproducible double isotope assay system which for the first time allowed the measurement of the initial rates of glucose uptake into isolated adipocyte plasma membrane vesicles by having time points as early as 1/2 s. Measurement of the initial rates of uptake at 1 s allowed the calculation of a Km of 9.0 mM and a Vmax of 3209 pmol/mg of protein/s for specific D-glucose transport (D-glucose minus L-glucose). The time course of specific D-glucose uptake is extremely rapid, reaching an equilibrium value in approximately 20 s with a half-time of 4 s. This uptake process is markedly inhibited by cytochalasin B. The similarity of these findings to those for intact adipocytes indicates that the plasma membrane preparation and the assay conditions used have retained the structural and functional integrity of the glucose transport system from the intact cell."

Sterol depletion inhibited the saturable as well as the nonsaturable components for both 3-O-methylglucose and thymidine uptake. The extent of inhibition of the saturable process was much more than that of the nonsaturable component at any stage of the sterol depletion. Furthermore, in the course of progressive sterol depletion the saturable component of 3-O-methylglucose or thymidine uptake was inhibited well before the nonsaturable process. Sterol depletion produced reductions in the Vmax values but no change in the Km values for the saturable uptake of these two substrates. The depletion of cellular sterol to 75% resulted in 70% and 90% reduction of the saturable uptake of 3-O-methylglucose and thymidine, respectively, and 30% and 50% reduction of the nonsaturable uptake of 3-O-methylglucose and thymidine, respectively. DNA and protein synthesis, however, were not affected at all when the saturable component of thymidine uptake was inhibited by 50% demonstrating that the observed decrease of transport activity was selective and not a reflection of a gross alteration in cellular physiology."

https://openalex.org/W1503886584,"Homoserine dehydrogenase in unpurified extracts of maize (Zea mays L.) cell suspensions is inhibited 73% by the feedback regulator threonine; the remaining 27% of the total activity is not affected even by high concentrations of threonine. The threonine-resistant and threonine-sensitive homoserine dehydrogenase activities were separated by affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose columns, and the two distinct homoserine dehydrogenases were purified. The threonine-resistant enzyme is an Mr = 70,000 dimer of two Mr = 38,000 subunits and the threonine-sensitive enzyme is an Mr = 190,000 dimer containing two apparently different subunits with molecular weights of 89,000 and 93,000. The threonine-resistant enzyme exhibits normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics and its activity is not affected by any of the amino acid end products of the aspartate pathway. The threonine-sensitive enzyme exhibits positive cooperative kinetics with respect to NADPH and is inhibited by threonine and stimulated by isoleucine. All attempts to affect interconversion of the two purified enzymes have been unsuccessful. Because the purified enzymes correspond to activities present in crude extracts of various maize tissues, it is concluded that the two types of homoserine dehydrogenase are natural in vivo constituents of maize."

https://openalex.org/W1536669259,"Purified reticulocyte initiation factors were assayed for their ability to stimulate the translation of uncapped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNA relative to capped VSV mRNA in reticulocyte lysates. Both eIF-3 and eIF-4B preparations contained such an activity. However, at least some of the activity was due to the presence of an as yet unidentified factor that contaminated the eIF-3 and eIF-4B preparations. A polypeptide of apparent molecular weight 24,000 that can be specifically cross-linked to the oxidized 5'-terminal cap structures of reovirus and other viral mRNAs co-purifies with this new factor, and may be a component of it. This stimulatory activity present in our eIF-4B preparations was found to be greater when lower concentrations of KCl were present in the reaction mixture, possibly explaining why uncapped VSV mRNA is translated relatively more efficiently at low K+ concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1566525524,"The serum of winter flounder contains a group of antifreeze peptides which lower the freezing point of their body fluid in the winter. These antifreeze peptides disappear from their serum in the summer when the water temperature rises. Messenger RNA isolated from the liver of flounder collected in January directs the synthesis of predominantly one protein in an in vitro protein synthesis system. This protein can be precipitated by the antiserum made from the purified antifreeze peptides and was identified as the precursor(s) of these peptides. There is a seasonal variation in the concentrations of mRNA coding for the antifreeze peptides in the liver which can be correlated with the appearance and disappearance of these peptides in the serum. However, the changes in the levels of mRNA occur much sooner than the changes in the levels of antifreeze peptides in the serum, suggesting that an additional control mechanism might have taken place at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1597793559,"Intraperitoneal administration of cycloheximide (100 mg/kg) to rats produces a time-dependent rise in nuclear RNA polymerase II activity which is maximum at 30 min. This same concentration of cycloheximide also reduces RNA polymerase I activity to 64% of control within this time period. When 10 mg/kg of cycloheximide was administered, there was a 2-fold increase in both RNA polymerases II and III activities within 30 min as assayed in isolated nuclei. When these enzymes are solubilized from nuclei and resolved by DEAE-Sephadex, there is no significant change in the activity of RNA polymerase I or II when assayed on an exogenous template. It is suggested that the dual enhancement of nuclear RNA polymerase II and III activities is the result of a compensatory feedback relationship which exists between translation and transcription in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1667492559,"Several proteins, glycoproteins, and iodoproteins are secreted from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes during phagocytosis of inert latex particles. The amount of 125I-labeled proteins increases during 10 to 60 min of incubation. The 125I-iodoproteins secreted into the incubation medium during the phagocytosis were first separated on Sephadex G-150 column and then characterized by column chromatography on Sepharose 4B, Sephadex G-200, and G-100. Three 125I-iodoproteins were found with the molecular weights of 580,000, 100,000, and 22,000. The molecular mass of 15 protein subunits calculated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ranged from 11,000 to 86,000 daltons. Four of the protein subunits were labeled with 125I. Their molecular weights were 63,000 to 69,000, 44,000 to 49,000, 22,000, and 11,000. In addition to iodoproteins, several 125I-labeled peptides and compounds were found by column chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2 and P-10. The 125I-iodoproteins are not secreted from resting or boiled granulocytes, and their production is 92 to 98% inhibited by 1 mM KCN or 1 mM sodium azide. The double-labeling technique with [125I]- and [131I]-iodine suggests that the iodoproteins formed in the phagocytosing granulocytes or secreted into the incubation medium are not identical."
