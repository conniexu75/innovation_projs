https://openalex.org/W2168887286,"Regulatory networks orchestrated by key transcription factors (TFs) have been proposed to play a central role in the determination of stem cell states. However, the master transcriptional regulators of adult stem cells are poorly understood. We have identified two TFs, Slug and Sox9, that act cooperatively to determine the mammary stem cell (MaSC) state. Inhibition of either Slug or Sox9 blocks MaSC activity in primary mammary epithelial cells. Conversely, transient coexpression of exogenous Slug and Sox9 suffices to convert differentiated luminal cells into MaSCs with long-term mammary gland-reconstituting ability. Slug and Sox9 induce MaSCs by activating distinct autoregulatory gene expression programs. We also show that coexpression of Slug and Sox9 promotes the tumorigenic and metastasis-seeding abilities of human breast cancer cells and is associated with poor patient survival, providing direct evidence that human breast cancer stem cells are controlled by key regulators similar to those operating in normal murine MaSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2151322257,"Protective T-cell memory has long been thought to reside in blood and lymph nodes, but recently the concept of immune memory in peripheral tissues mediated by resident memory T (T(RM)) cells has been proposed. Here we show in mice that localized vaccinia virus (VACV) skin infection generates long-lived non-recirculating CD8(+) skin T(RM) cells that reside within the entire skin. These skin T(RM) cells are potent effector cells, and are superior to circulating central memory T (T(CM)) cells at providing rapid long-term protection against cutaneous re-infection. We find that CD8(+) T cells are rapidly recruited to skin after acute VACV infection. CD8(+) T-cell recruitment to skin is independent of CD4(+) T cells and interferon-γ, but requires the expression of E- and P-selectin ligands by CD8(+) T cells. Using parabiotic mice, we further show that circulating CD8(+) T(CM) and CD8(+) skin T(RM) cells are both generated after skin infection; however, CD8(+) T(CM) cells recirculate between blood and lymph nodes whereas T(RM) cells remain in the skin. Cutaneous CD8(+) T(RM) cells produce effector cytokines and persist for at least 6 months after infection. Mice with CD8(+) skin T(RM) cells rapidly cleared a subsequent re-infection with VACV whereas mice with circulating T(CM) but no skin T(RM) cells showed greatly impaired viral clearance, indicating that T(RM) cells provide superior protection. Finally, we show that T(RM) cells generated as a result of localized VACV skin infection reside not only in the site of infection, but also populate the entire skin surface and remain present for many months. Repeated re-infections lead to progressive accumulation of highly protective T(RM) cells in non-involved skin. These findings have important implications for our understanding of protective immune memory at epithelial interfaces with the environment, and suggest novel strategies for vaccines that protect against tissue tropic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2142388403,"Histone deacetylase 2 is shown to suppress genes involved in cognitive function epigenetically, potentially opening the door to treatments for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases by developing HDAC2-selective inhibitors. What causes the cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood. This study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism by which Alzheimer's-disease-related neurotoxicity reduces the expression of genes necessary for neural plasticity. In two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease — and in post-mortem samples from human subjects — expression of the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is elevated. Reversing the upregulation of HDAC2 by short-hairpin-RNA-mediated knockdown in mice restores the expression of HDAC2 target genes and abolishes the neurodegeneration-associated memory impairment. Cognitive decline is a debilitating feature of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s disease1. The causes leading to such impairment are only poorly understood and effective treatments are slow to emerge2. Here we show that cognitive capacities in the neurodegenerating brain are constrained by an epigenetic blockade of gene transcription that is potentially reversible. This blockade is mediated by histone deacetylase 2, which is increased by Alzheimer’s-disease-related neurotoxic insults in vitro, in two mouse models of neurodegeneration and in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Histone deacetylase 2 associates with and reduces the histone acetylation of genes important for learning and memory, which show a concomitant decrease in expression. Importantly, reversing the build-up of histone deacetylase 2 by short-hairpin-RNA-mediated knockdown unlocks the repression of these genes, reinstates structural and synaptic plasticity, and abolishes neurodegeneration-associated memory impairments. These findings advocate for the development of selective inhibitors of histone deacetylase 2 and suggest that cognitive capacities following neurodegeneration are not entirely lost, but merely impaired by this epigenetic blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2102869463,"Hepatic precursor cells (HPCs) are known to be bipotent and to give rise to both new hepatocytes and cholangiocytes upon acute liver injury. Stuart J. Forbes and his colleagues now show that interactions of HPCs with local macrophages and myofibroblasts potentiate Wnt and Notch signaling, respectively, to determine fate specification of the HPCs. Together, these mechanisms help determine proper organ regeneration after liver injury. During chronic injury a population of bipotent hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) become activated to regenerate both cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. Here we show in human diseased liver and mouse models of the ductular reaction that Notch and Wnt signaling direct specification of HPCs via their interactions with activated myofibroblasts or macrophages. In particular, we found that during biliary regeneration, expression of Jagged 1 (a Notch ligand) by myofibroblasts promoted Notch signaling in HPCs and thus their biliary specification to cholangiocytes. Alternatively, during hepatocyte regeneration, macrophage engulfment of hepatocyte debris induced Wnt3a expression. This resulted in canonical Wnt signaling in nearby HPCs, thus maintaining expression of Numb (a cell fate determinant) within these cells and the promotion of their specification to hepatocytes. By these two pathways adult parenchymal regeneration during chronic liver injury is promoted."
https://openalex.org/W2009569945,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common kidney cancer and has very few mutations that are shared between different patients. To better understand the intratumoral genetics underlying mutations of ccRCC, we carried out single-cell exome sequencing on a ccRCC tumor and its adjacent kidney tissue. Our data indicate that this tumor was unlikely to have resulted from mutations in VHL and PBRM1. Quantitative population genetic analysis indicates that the tumor did not contain any significant clonal subpopulations and also showed that mutations that had different allele frequencies within the population also had different mutation spectrums. Analyses of these data allowed us to delineate a detailed intratumoral genetic landscape at a single-cell level. Our pilot study demonstrates that ccRCC may be more genetically complex than previously thought and provides information that can lead to new ways to investigate individual tumors, with the aim of developing more effective cellular targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2147284744,"Inhibition of DOT1L, the H3K79 histone methyltransferase, increases cell reprogramming and substituted for KLF4 and c-Myc, showing that chromatin-modifying enzymes act not only as facilitators but also as barriers to reprogramming. A study of the role of chromatin-modifying enzymes in the reprogramming of human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells suggests that such enzymes can act as facilitators — but also as barriers — to epigenetic remodelling. By knocking down 22 selected genes involved in DNA and histone methylation pathways, George Daley and colleagues identified both positive and negative regulators of iPS-cell generation. In particular, inhibition of DOT1L, the H3K79 histone methyltransferase, increased reprogramming and substituted for KLF4 and c-Myc, two of the factors needed in the reprogramming cocktail. The effect of DOT1L inhibition seems to be associated with increase in the reprogramming factors NANOG and LIN28. This work demonstrates that specific chromatin modifiers can be modulated to generate iPS cells more efficiently and with fewer exogenously introduced transcription factors. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by somatic cell reprogramming involves global epigenetic remodelling1. Whereas several proteins are known to regulate chromatin marks associated with the distinct epigenetic states of cells before and after reprogramming2,3, the role of specific chromatin-modifying enzymes in reprogramming remains to be determined. To address how chromatin-modifying proteins influence reprogramming, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to target genes in DNA and histone methylation pathways, and identified positive and negative modulators of iPSC generation. Whereas inhibition of the core components of the polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2, including the histone 3 lysine 27 methyltransferase EZH2, reduced reprogramming efficiency, suppression of SUV39H1, YY1 and DOT1L enhanced reprogramming. Specifically, inhibition of the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L by shRNA or a small molecule accelerated reprogramming, significantly increased the yield of iPSC colonies, and substituted for KLF4 and c-Myc (also known as MYC). Inhibition of DOT1L early in the reprogramming process is associated with a marked increase in two alternative factors, NANOG and LIN28, which play essential functional roles in the enhancement of reprogramming. Genome-wide analysis of H3K79me2 distribution revealed that fibroblast-specific genes associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition lose H3K79me2 in the initial phases of reprogramming. DOT1L inhibition facilitates the loss of this mark from genes that are fated to be repressed in the pluripotent state. These findings implicate specific chromatin-modifying enzymes as barriers to or facilitators of reprogramming, and demonstrate how modulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes can be exploited to more efficiently generate iPSCs with fewer exogenous transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2013702641,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) commonly defined by in vitro functions have entered clinical application despite little definition of their function in residence. Here, we report genetic pulse-chase experiments that define osteoblastic cells as short-lived and nonreplicative, requiring replenishment from bone-marrow-derived, Mx1(+) stromal cells with ""MSC"" features. These cells respond to tissue stress and migrate to sites of injury, supplying new osteoblasts during fracture healing. Single cell transplantation yielded progeny that both preserve progenitor function and differentiate into osteoblasts, producing new bone. They are capable of local and systemic translocation and serial transplantation. While these cells meet current definitions of MSCs in vitro, they are osteolineage restricted in vivo in growing and adult animals. Therefore, bone-marrow-derived MSCs may be a heterogeneous population with the Mx1(+) population, representing a highly dynamic and stress responsive stem/progenitor cell population of fate-restricted potential that feeds the high cell replacement demands of the adult skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2034629821,"Tumor heterogeneity presents a challenge for inferring clonal evolution and driver gene identification. Here, we describe a method for analyzing the cancer genome at a single-cell nucleotide level. To perform our analyses, we first devised and validated a high-throughput whole-genome single-cell sequencing method using two lymphoblastoid cell line single cells. We then carried out whole-exome single-cell sequencing of 90 cells from a JAK2-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm patient. The sequencing data from 58 cells passed our quality control criteria, and these data indicated that this neoplasm represented a monoclonal evolution. We further identified essential thrombocythemia (ET)-related candidate mutations such as SESN2 and NTRK1, which may be involved in neoplasm progression. This pilot study allowed the initial characterization of the disease-related genetic architecture at the single-cell nucleotide level. Further, we established a single-cell sequencing method that opens the way for detailed analyses of a variety of tumor types, including those with high genetic complex between patients."
https://openalex.org/W1997230083,"Lamellipodia are sheet-like, leading edge protrusions in firmly adherent cells that contain Arp2/3-generated dendritic actin networks. Although lamellipodia are widely believed to be critical for directional cell motility, this notion has not been rigorously tested. Using fibroblasts derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mice, we generated a stable line depleted of Arp2/3 complex that lacks lamellipodia. This line shows defective random cell motility and relies on a filopodia-based protrusion system. Utilizing a microfluidic gradient generation system, we tested the role of Arp2/3 complex and lamellipodia in directional cell migration. Surprisingly, Arp2/3-depleted cells respond normally to shallow gradients of PDGF, indicating that lamellipodia are not required for fibroblast chemotaxis. Conversely, these cells cannot respond to a surface-bound gradient of extracellular matrix (haptotaxis). Consistent with this finding, cells depleted of Arp2/3 fail to globally align focal adhesions, suggesting that one principle function of lamellipodia is to organize cell-matrix adhesions in a spatially coherent manner. Lamellipodia are sheet-like, leading edge protrusions in firmly adherent cells that contain Arp2/3-generated dendritic actin networks.

Depletion of Arp2/3 complex leads to the disappearance of lamellipodia Chemotaxis of fibroblasts toward PDGF is unaffected by loss of Arp2/3 Arp2/3 complex and lamellipodia are essential for fibroblast haptotaxis Global focal adhesion alignment is dependent on lamellipodia Cell motility is essential for many biological processes such as embryonic morphogenesis, immune surveillance, and tissue repair. Dysregulation of cell motility is associated with a number of disease states including metastatic cancer and autoimmune disorders (Condeelis et al., 2005Condeelis J. Singer R.H. Segall J.E. The great escape: when cancer cells hijack the genes for chemotaxis and motility.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 695-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Wickramarachchi et al., 2010Wickramarachchi D.C. Theofilopoulos A.N. Kono D.H. Immune pathology associated with altered actin cytoskeleton regulation.Autoimmunity. 2010; 43: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Random motility is thought to allow cells to effectively sample their environment such as in the case of affinity maturation of B cells in the germinal center (Allen et al., 2007Allen C.D. Okada T. Tang H.L. Cyster J.G. Imaging of germinal center selection events during affinity maturation.Science. 2007; 315: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). However, cell migration is frequently governed by various directional cues such as soluble factors (chemotaxis), substrate-attached factors (haptotaxis), or mechanical cues (durotaxis). Understanding how eukaryotic cells sense these directional cues and respond with directed movement remains one of the central problems of modern biology. Chemotaxis is perhaps the most well understood form of directional motility and involves a variety of signaling pathways connecting cell surface receptors to the motility machinery inside of cells (Swaney et al., 2010Swaney K.F. Huang C.H. Devreotes P.N. Eukaryotic chemotaxis: a network of signaling pathways controls motility, directional sensing, and polarity.Annu Rev Biophys. 2010; 39: 265-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Based mainly on studies of rapidly migrating amoeboid cells such as neutrophils and Dictyostelium cells, these signaling cascades are thought to trigger directional protrusions at the leading edge by controlling actin assembly pathways (Parent, 2004Parent C.A. Making all the right moves: chemotaxis in neutrophils and Dictyostelium.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Haptotaxis and durotaxis are much more poorly understood, but likely involve signaling events triggered by adhesive receptors such as integrins (Thiery, 1984Thiery J.P. Mechanisms of cell migration in the vertebrate embryo.Cell Differ. 1984; 15: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that perform a variety of tissue repair functions and respond to directional cues such as gradients of PDGF (Wynn, 2008Wynn T.A. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis.J. Pathol. 2008; 214: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar). In addition, the in vitro motility of these cells has been extensively studied. The sheet-like, protruding leading edge of fibroblasts known as the lamellipodium contains a dense array of actin filaments arranged in a dendritic meshwork (Svitkina and Borisy, 1999Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Arp2/3 complex and actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin in dendritic organization and treadmilling of actin filament array in lamellipodia.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1009-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Extensive experimental evidence and theoretical models of lamellipodial protrusion indicate that the polymerization of actin filaments within this meshwork drives protrusion (Pollard and Borisy, 2003Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filaments.Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar). In addition to its function in protrusion, the lamellipodium is the site of formation for most cell-matrix adhesions (Webb et al., 2002Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Adhesion assembly, disassembly and turnover in migrating cells — over and over and over again.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E97-E100Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Integrin binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and subsequent clustering lead to the formation of nascent focal complexes appearing continuously at the distal margin of the lamellipodium. A subset of the focal complexes mature into focal adhesions that are connected to bundled actin stress fibers. The central pillar of the actin network found in lamellipodia is the seven-subunit Arp2/3 complex. The structure, regulation, and biochemical properties of this complex have been extensively studied in vitro (reviewed in Goley and Welch, 2006Goley E.D. Welch M.D. The ARP2/3 complex: an actin nucleator comes of age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Once activated by nucleation promoting factors (such as SCAR/WAVE), Arp2/3 nucleates actin daughter filaments as branches off of existing mother filaments. The localization of Arp2/3 to actin filament branches in vivo (Cai et al., 2008Cai L. Makhov A.M. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E.

Cell. 2006; 17: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but not all studies (Di Nardo et al., 2005Di Nardo A. Cicchetti G. Falet H. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Arp2/3 complex-deficient mouse fibroblasts are viable and have normal leading-edge actin structure and function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 16263-16268Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, the existence of actin branches in lamellipodia has been called into question by experiments using alternate electron microscopy techniques (Urban et al., 2010Urban E. Jacob S. Nemethova M. Resch G.P. Small J.V. Electron tomography reveals unbranched networks of actin filaments in lamellipodia.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Functional studies of Arp2/3 in vivo have been severely hampered by effects on viability observed upon loss of this complex in a variety of organisms. Genetic deletion of Arp2/3 subunits is lethal in yeast and Dictyostelium, and mouse knockouts produce preimplantation lethality (Schwob and Martin, 1992Schwob E. Martin R.P. New yeast actin-like gene required late in the cell cycle.Nature. 1992; 355: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Yae et al., 2006Yae K. Keng V.W. Koike M. Yusa K. Kouno M. Uno Y.

Replacement of the essential Dictyostelium Arp2 gene by its Entamoeba homologue using parasexual genetics.BMC Genet. 2007; 8: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data led to the prevailing notion that Arp2/3 complex is essential for viability in eukaryotes (Pollard and Cooper, 2009Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Actin, a central player in cell shape and movement.Science. 2009; 326: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a cell line derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mice that can support near complete and stable depletion of Arp2/3 subunits without compromising viability. This cell line has allowed us to directly test the role of Arp2/3 and lamellipodia in fibroblast chemotaxis and haptotaxis. We previously reported a clonal, mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line (IA32) derived from an Ink4a/Arf−/− animal with unusually prominent lamellipodia (Cai et al., 2008Cai L. Makhov A.M. Schafer D.A. Bear J.E. Coronin 1B antagonizes cortactin and remodels Arp2/3-containing actin branches in lamellipodia.Cell. 2008; 134: 828-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To develop a stable cell line with fluorescently tagged Arp2/3 complex in this background, we utilized an established lentiviral shRNA knockdown-rescue (KDR) system to deplete the endogenous p34Arc subunit of the Arp2/3 complex and simultaneously express a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged, RNAi-resistant subunit (Vitriol et al., 2007Vitriol E.A. Uetrecht A.C. Shen F. Jacobson K. Bear J.E. Enhanced EGFP-chromophore-assisted laser inactivation using deficient cells rescued with functional EGFP-fusion proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6702-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We separated clonal derivatives of fibroblasts infected with this construct and blotted for p34Arc (Figure S1A available online). As expected, we recovered some clones with appropriate depletion and physiological levels of re-expression of the p34Arc-GFP (line 3G6). To our surprise, we also recovered clones that had no re-expression of p34Arc-GFP, but had near complete depletion of the endogenous protein (line 1B3). This result suggested that this cell line, which was derived from an Ink4a/Arf−/− mouse (lacking both p16INK4a and Arf), might be able to proliferate in the absence of Arp2/3 complex because of its genetic background. Since Arf is known to play the dominant role in the growth of MEFs (Kamijo et al., 1997Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Tumor suppression at the mouse INK4a locus mediated by the alternative reading frame product p19ARF.Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), we repeated the depletion of Arp2/3 complex in early passage wild-type (WT) and Arf−/− MEFs (lacking Arf only, but retaining p16INK4a) and monitored the growth rate. Expression of a nontargeting shRNA (NS) in either background showed no effect on cell proliferation, whereas depletion of p34Arc (data not shown) or the Arp2 subunit strongly reduced the proliferation of WT MEFs, but not Arf−/− MEFs (Figure 1A ). These results indicate that in the context of Ink4a/Arf−/− or Arf−/− MEFs, the Arp2/3 complex is not strictly required for cell viability and that its loss may activate specific growth arrest pathways requiring the Arf tumor suppressor.Figure 1Establishment of a Stable Arp2/3 Complex-Depleted Cell LineShow full caption(A) Growth curve of wild-type (WT) and Arf −/− early passage MEFs infected with lentivirus expressing a nonspecific sequence (NS) shRNA or Arp2 shRNA (Arp2-KD).

Single depletion of either p34Arc or Arp2 in the Ink4a/Arf−/− IA32 cell line was not stable over time, and revertant cell lines showing re-expression of the endogenous gene product overwhelmed the culture after 3-5 passages. To produce a more stable Arp2/3 knockdown, we simultaneously depleted both subunits, resulting in a cell line we designated 2xKD (Figures S1B and S1C). This cell line showed near complete depletion of both subunits by blotting and concomitant loss of other subunits of the complex as observed by others (Figure 1B; Steffen et al., 2006Steffen A. Faix J. Resch G.P. Linkner J. Wehland J. Small J.V. Rottner K. Stradal T.E. Filopodia formation in the absence of functional WAVE- and Arp2/3-complexes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Quantitative western blotting indicated that depletion levels exceeded 98% (data not shown). This depletion was also observed at the single-cell level by immunofluorescence (Figure 1C). Consistent with the growth experiments in early passage MEFs, loss of Arp2/3 complex had no effect on cell proliferation in the IA32 cells (Figure 1D). Unlike single knockdown cells, these 2xKD cells showed stable depletion of Arp2/3 complex for at least 12 passages. Thus, we employed this system to study the role of Arp2/3 complex in cell motility. Strikingly, despite their normal proliferation rate, the 2xKD cells lost lamellipodia and formed excessive filopodial protrusions (Figure 1E), consistent with the role of Arp2/3 complex in generating branched actin networks within lamellipodia. To ensure that the lack of lamellipodia was solely due to the absence of Arp2/3 activity, we microinjected bovine Arp2/3 complex into the 2xKD cells, and observed the reappearance of lamellipodia within 20 min after injection (Figure 1F; Movie S1). This result confirmed the specificity of Arp2/3 depletion and indicated that the upstream activators of Arp2/3 complex were still present and functional in 2xKD cells. These striking changes in cell morphology prompted us to examine the actin cytoskeleton in the absence of Arp2/3 complex. We first compared F-actin organization in NS and 2xKD cells by phalloidin staining (Figure 1C). As expected from the lack of morphological lamellipodia, 2xKD cells have a different pattern of phalloidin staining with no areas of enrichment in peripheral regions. We also utilized electron microscopy (EM) to investigate leading edge actin networks in detail. A recently described method involving rapid freezing, freeze-drying and high-resolution metal shadowcasting developed for visualizing purified protein complexes (Ozgur et al., 2011Ozgur S. Damania B.

The spreading and formation of protrusions was confirmed by live-cell imaging of the grids in pilot experiments (data not shown). This method allowed us to prepare the cells without critical point drying and replica formation. We observed drastically different actin filament architectures at the margins of 2xKD cells compared to the NS control cells (Figure 1G). The NS cells had a network of short, interconnected filaments with many examples of branching. This architecture is similar to the networks observed with platinum replica EM previously (Svitkina and Borisy, 1999Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Arp2/3 complex and actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin in dendritic organization and treadmilling of actin filament array in lamellipodia.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1009-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The 2xKD cells had a much more sparse network of longer filaments that were highly bundled, which frequently converged into higher order bundles in filopodia. Actin filament crosslinks and some end-to-side junctions could be observed in the 2xKD cells, suggesting multiple forms of crosslinking and bundling still occur in the absence of the Arp2/3 complex. Overall, our results are consistent with the obligate role of Arp2/3 complex in generating densely branched actin networks. Since lamellipodia are thought to play important roles in cell migration, we examined the effect of Arp2/3 depletion and loss of lamellipodia on cell motility using single-cell tracking. 2xKD cells and cells singly depleted of either p34Arc or Arp2 showed a marked reduction in migration speed compared to NS cells. The reduced speed was fully rescued in both p34-KDR and Arp2-KDR cells re-expressing RNAi resistant p34Arc or Arp2 subunits, respectively, as well as doubly depleted and doubly rescued (2KDR) cells (Figure 2A ), confirming that neither of the effects of the respective shRNAs was due to off-target effects. A similar reduction of cell migration speed was observed when NS cells were treated with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666 (100 μM), but not with the inactive compound CK-689 (Nolen et al., 2009Nolen B.J. Tomasevic N. Russell A. Pierce D.W. Jia Z. McCormick C.D. Hartman J. Sakowicz R. Pollard T.D. Characterization of two classes of small molecule inhibitors of Arp2/3 complex.Nature. 2009; 460: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This same concentration of the Arp2/3 inhibitor did not affect cell speed or morphology of 2xKD cells (Figure 2B, data not shown), confirming the near complete depletion of Arp2/3 complex and suggesting that the residual motility in 2xKD cells was not dependent on any remaining Arp2/3 complex activity. To test whether the residual motility in 2xKD cells was still dependent on actin assembly, we treated cells with latrunculin B (LatB) to inhibit F-actin polymerization. Both NS and 2xKD cells showed significant reduction in cell speed when F-actin polymerization was impaired (Figure 2C), suggesting that the Arp2/3-depleted cells still rely on actin assembly to migrate. One possible mechanism by which the 2xKD cells could continue to migrate, albeit slowly, is by relying on myosin contractility. To address this, we treated cells with blebbistatin (BLB), a myosin II inhibitor. This treatment decreased focal adhesion and stress fiber staining, but increased phosphorylation of the myosin light chain at Ser19 (Figures S2A–S2C ), consistent with previous studies (Goeckeler et al., 2008Goeckeler Z.M. Bridgman P.C. Wysolmerski R.B. Nonmuscle myosin II is responsible for maintaining endothelial cell basal tone and stress fiber integrity.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C994-C1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on this previous work, increased phospho-myosin light chain does not reflect an increase in cellular contractility in this case. In the motility assay, BLB treatment increased 2xKD cell speed significantly without an effect on the speed of NS cells (Figure 2D). This result indicates that the residual motility of the Arp2/3-depleted cells does not depend on myosin contractility. We observed from time-lapse DIC images (data not shown) and F-actin staining (Figure S2A) that BLB treatment increased filopodia number in 2xKD cells. Filopodia were counted in NS and 2xKD cells treated with BLB or DMSO control using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2E). Control 2xKD cells have approximately 3-fold more filopodia than NS cells. Filopodia number in BLB-treated 2xKD cells increased significantly, whereas the number of filopodia remained unchanged in BLB-treated NS cells (Figure 2F). Time-lapse imaging revealed that 2xKD cells create new areas of flat protrusion by “filling the gap” between adjacent filopodia (Movie S2). Occasionally, the tips of two adjacent filopodia fuse and the resulting hole fills in (Movie S2). Due to the larger number of filopodia on the BLB-treated 2xKD cells, more of these “filling the gap” events were observed (Figure 2G), correlating with higher whole-cell motility. Together, these observations suggest that cells have an alternate, filopodia-driven form of protrusion in the absence of Arp2/3 activity that leads to relatively inefficient whole-cell translocation. Loss of Arp2/3 complex causes changes in leading edge actin organization and disappearance of lamellipodia, leading to reduced random cell motility. However, cell migration speed and the ability to respond to directional cues are independent properties and rigorous experimental approaches are required to separately measure these properties. To address this issue, we utilized a modified version of a previously described microfluidic chemotaxis chamber (Figure 3A ) (Shamloo et al., 2008Shamloo A. Ma N. Poo M.M. Sohn L.L. Heilshorn S.C. Endothelial cell polarization and chemotaxis in a microfluidic device.Lab Chip. 2008; 8: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) which allowed us to directly image the migration of cells exposed to a defined gradient of chemoattractant for >12 hr. The establishment and maintenance of a linear soluble gradient in this device was confirmed using fluorescent dextran (Figure 3B) Based on the fluorescence intensity profile, this equates to a slope of 43.6%/mm across the cell culture chamber. The average cell in our experiments was ∼150 μm across in the dimension of the gradient which yields a chemoattractant slope of ∼6.5% across an individual cell. In every experiment, NS expressing GFP and 2xKD cells were seeded in the same cell culture chamber and serum starved prior to establishment of the PDGF gradient. DIC live-cell imaging was used to monitor cell movement, and gradient stability was monitored at each time point by imaging the gradient of Cy5-dextran for up to 16 hr (Movie S3). Single-cell tracking was used to follow individual cells over time and calculate the velocity and directionality of migration. We utilized two methods to calculate the directional bias of the resulting tracks. First, we transposed the tracks so that each had its start point at the origin and then computed the forward migration index (FMI) using the final position of the cell at the end of the track (Figure 3C). Second, we calculated the angle of each turn in the track relative to the gradient and plotted these as a histogram (Figure 3D). Using this distribution of turn angles, we used a nonlinear curve fit to compute the compass parameter (CP) as described previously (Arrieumerlou and Meyer, 2005Arrieumerlou C. Meyer T. A local coupling model and compass parameter for eukaryotic chemotaxis.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 215-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no statistically significant difference in either FMI or CP was observed between NS and 2xKD cells at all source concentrations of PDGF tested (Figures 3E and S3A). In experiments with early passage single knockdown cells (p34-KD) and knockdown-rescue cells (p34-KDR), we used serum as a more generic chemoattractant and observed the same result (Figure S3B ). This result was further confirmed using Rat2 fibroblasts treated with the Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK-666. As with the Arp2/3-depleted IA32 cells, inhibition of Arp2/3 activity had no effect on the ability to respond to the PDGF gradient (Figures 3F and S3C). These results indicate that although Arp2/3 and lamellipodia play important roles in increasing the efficiency of cell migration, they are not essential for directional sensing of chemotactic gradients in fibroblasts. To confirm that proximal signaling events in the PDGF pathway were also unaffected by Arp2/3 depletion, levels of total and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in response to PDGF stimulation were examined by blotting. Similar changes in Akt signaling were observed in 2xKD and NS cells upon PDGF stimulation (Figure 3G). Since 2xKD cells can respond to gradients of PDGF, we examined the morphological response of these cells to acute, uniform stimulation with PDGF. Although NS cells produced lamellipodia and ruffles (Figure S3D), 2xKD cell increased the number of filopodia (Figure 3H; Movie S4). We also examined 2xKD cells during chemotaxis up a PDGF gradient and observed that these cells had more filopodia on the up-gradient side of the cell (Figure 3I). Together, these results indicate that PDGF signaling is intact in the absence of Arp2/3 complex, but that cells produce filopodia in response to this stimulus rather than lamellipodia without Arp2/3. When cells encounter surfaces coated with extracellular matrix proteins, they initiate a spreading process that involves the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. To examine spreading in the absence of Arp2/3 complex, we plated NS and 2xKD cells expressing GFP-Paxillin (GFP-Pax) on fibronectin (FN)-coated surfaces and stained cells at different time-points for F-actin and phospho-tyrosine (pTyr). The 2xKD cells showed a marked delay in spreading kinetics and the expected absence of peripheral lamellipodia (Figures 4A and 4B ). Both pTyr and GFP-Pax showed focal adhesions had formed in the 2xKD cells by 90 min, but most of these adhesions remained associated with the periphery compared with the NS controls. To quantify the cell-spreading defect, we used an impedance-based system that measures electrical changes caused by cells interacting with a microelectrode within the surface of a dish. Arp2/3-depleted cells showed statistically significant decrease in cell spreading compared to control cells (Figure 4C). Consistent with the delay in"

Here, we demonstrate that the impairment of spatial working memory (SWM) and in vivo long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, induced by an acute exposure of exogenous cannabinoids, is fully abolished in conditional mutant mice lacking type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB(1)R) in brain astroglial cells but is conserved in mice lacking CB(1)R in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Blockade of neuronal glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and of synaptic trafficking of glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAR) also abolishes cannabinoid effects on SWM and LTD induction and expression. We conclude that the impairment of working memory by marijuana and cannabinoids is due to the activation of astroglial CB(1)R and is associated with astroglia-dependent hippocampal LTD in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2068723977,"Olivier Delattre and colleagues report the discovery of a new subset of sarcoma defined by fusion of the BCOR and CCNB3 genes. By gene expression profiling, they show that BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases are biologically distinct from other sarcomas, particularly Ewing sarcoma. The identification of subtype-specific translocations has revolutionized the diagnostics of sarcoma and has provided new insight into oncogenesis. We used RNA-seq to investigate samples from individuals diagnosed with small round cell tumors of bone, possibly Ewing sarcoma, but which lacked the canonical EWSR1-ETS translocation. A new fusion was observed between BCOR (encoding the BCL6 co-repressor) and CCNB3 (encoding the testis-specific cyclin B3) on the X chromosome. RNA-seq results were confirmed by RT-PCR and through cloning of the tumor-specific genomic translocation breakpoints. In total, 24 BCOR-CCNB3–positive tumors were identified among a series of 594 sarcoma cases. Gene profiling experiments indicated that BCOR-CCNB3–positive cases are biologically distinct from other sarcomas, particularly Ewing sarcoma. Finally, we show that CCNB3 immunohistochemistry is a powerful diagnostic marker for this subgroup of sarcoma and that overexpression of BCOR-CCNB3 or of truncated CCNB3 activates S phase in NIH3T3 cells. Thus, the intrachromosomal X-chromosome fusion described here represents a new subtype of bone sarcoma caused by a newly identified gene fusion mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2160977408,"IL-17 is associated with asthma, and THH17 cells are found in the airways of individuals with asthma. Dean Sheppard and his colleagues now report that IL-17A (but not IL-17F) directly enhances contractile responses in airway smooth muscle cells. Mice lacking TH17 cells in the lungs exhibit reduced airway hyper-responsiveness in response to allergen challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that the T helper 17 (TH17) subset of αβ T cells contributes to the development of allergic asthma. In this study, we found that mice lacking the αvβ8 integrin on dendritic cells did not generate TH17 cells in the lung and were protected from airway hyper-responsiveness in response to house dust mite and ovalbumin sensitization and challenge. Because loss of TH17 cells inhibited airway narrowing without any obvious effects on airway inflammation or epithelial morphology, we examined the direct effects of TH17 cytokines on mouse and human airway smooth muscle function. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), but not IL-17F or IL-22, enhanced contractile force generation of airway smooth muscle through an IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA)–IL-17RC, nuclear factor κ light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)–ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA)–Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) signaling cascade. Mice lacking integrin αvβ8 on dendritic cells showed impaired activation of this pathway after ovalbumin sensitization and challenge, and the diminished contraction of the tracheal rings in these mice was reversed by IL-17A. These data indicate that the IL-17A produced by TH17 cells contributes to allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness through direct effects on airway smooth muscle."

We observed that dissociation of heterotypic membranes from mitochondria inhibited BAK/BAX-dependent cytochrome c (cyto c) release. Biochemical purification of neutral sphingomyelinases that correlated with MOMP sensitization suggested that sphingolipid metabolism coordinates BAK/BAX activation. Using purified lipids and enzymes, sensitivity to MOMP was achieved by in vitro reconstitution of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Sphingolipid metabolism inhibitors blocked MOMP from heavy membrane preparations but failed to influence MOMP in the presence of sphingolipid-reconstituted, purified mitochondria. Furthermore, the sphingolipid products, sphingosine-1-PO(4) and hexadecenal, cooperated specifically with BAK and BAX, respectively. Sphingolipid metabolism was also required for cellular responses to apoptosis. Our studies suggest that BAK/BAX activation and apoptosis are coordinated through BH3-only proteins and a specific lipid milieu that is maintained by heterotypic membrane-mitochondrial interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2061644007,"Maintenance of adult tissues is carried out by stem cells and is sustained throughout life in a highly ordered manner. Homeostasis within the stem-cell compartment is governed by positive- and negative-feedback regulation of instructive extrinsic and intrinsic signals. ErbB signalling is a prerequisite for maintenance of the intestinal epithelium following injury and tumour formation. As ErbB-family ligands and receptors are highly expressed within the stem-cell niche, we hypothesize that strong endogenous regulators must control the pathway in the stem-cell compartment. Here we show that Lrig1, a negative-feedback regulator of the ErbB receptor family, is highly expressed by intestinal stem cells and controls the size of the intestinal stem-cell niche by regulating the amplitude of growth-factor signalling. Intestinal stem-cell maintenance has so far been attributed to a combination of Wnt and Notch activation and Bmpr inhibition. Our findings reveal ErbB activation as a strong inductive signal for stem-cell proliferation. This has implications for our understanding of ErbB signalling in tissue development and maintenance and the progression of malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W1968824665,"The ability to learn new skills and perfect them with practice applies not only to physical skills but also to abstract skills, like motor planning or neuroprosthetic actions. Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills, it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W2002973634,"A general mechanism for how intracellular signaling pathways in human pluripotent cells are coordinated and how they maintain self-renewal remain to be elucidated. In this report, we describe a signaling mechanism where PI3K/Akt activity maintains self-renewal by restraining prodifferentiation signaling through suppression of the Raf/Mek/Erk and canonical Wnt signaling pathways. When active, PI3K/Akt establishes conditions where Activin A/Smad2,3 performs a pro-self-renewal function by activating target genes, including Nanog. When PI3K/Akt signaling is low, Wnt effectors are activated and function in conjunction with Smad2,3 to promote differentiation. The switch in Smad2,3 activity after inactivation of PI3K/Akt requires the activation of canonical Wnt signaling by Erk, which targets Gsk3β. In sum, we define a signaling framework that converges on Smad2,3 and determines its ability to regulate the balance between alternative cell states. This signaling paradigm has far-reaching implications for cell fate decisions during early embryonic development."

Entry into the ciliary compartment is proposed to be regulated at the base of the cilium. Recent work demonstrated that components of the nuclear import machinery, including the Ran GTPase and importins, regulate ciliary entry. We hypothesized that the ciliary base contains a ciliary pore complex whose molecular nature and selective mechanism are similar to those of the nuclear pore complex. By microinjecting fluorescently labelled dextrans and recombinant proteins of various sizes, we characterize a size-dependent diffusion barrier for the entry of cytoplasmic molecules into primary cilia in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that nucleoporins localize to the base of primary and motile cilia and that microinjection of nucleoporin-function-blocking reagents blocks the ciliary entry of kinesin-2 KIF17 motors. Together, this work demonstrates that the physical and molecular nature of the ciliary pore complex is similar to that of the nuclear pore complex, and further extends functional parallels between nuclear and ciliary import."

One shows a balanced output of mature lymphoid and myeloid cells; the other appears selectively lymphoid deficient. We now show that both of these HSC subtypes are present in the fetal liver (at a 1:10 ratio) with the rarer, lymphoid-deficient HSCs immediately gaining an increased representation in the fetal bone marrow, suggesting that the marrow niche plays a key role in regulating their ensuing preferential amplification. Clonal analysis of HSC expansion posttransplant showed that both subtypes display an extensive but variable self-renewal activity with occasional interconversion. Clonal analysis of their differentiation programs demonstrated functional and molecular as well as quantitative HSC subtype-specific differences in the lymphoid progenitors they generate but an indistinguishable production of multipotent and myeloid-restricted progenitors. These findings establish a level of heterogeneity in HSC differentiation and expansion control that may have relevance to stem cell populations in other hierarchically organized tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2108764934,"Konrad Hochedlinger and colleagues show that ascorbic acid enhances cellular reprogramming by preventing hypermethylation of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus. They use this approach to generate adult mice derived entirely from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained through reprogramming of terminally differentiated B cells. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) often results in aberrant epigenetic silencing of the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, compromising the ability to generate entirely iPSC-derived adult mice ('all-iPSC mice'). Here, we show that reprogramming in the presence of ascorbic acid attenuates hypermethylation of Dlk1-Dio3 by enabling a chromatin configuration that interferes with binding of the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a. This approach allowed us to generate all-iPSC mice from mature B cells, which have until now failed to support the development of exclusively iPSC-derived postnatal animals. Our data show that transcription factor–mediated reprogramming can endow a defined, terminally differentiated cell type with a developmental potential equivalent to that of embryonic stem cells. More generally, these findings indicate that culture conditions during cellular reprogramming can strongly influence the epigenetic and biological properties of the resultant iPSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2055280361,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia most often arises from loss of the dynein motors that power ciliary beating. Here we show that DNAAF3 (also known as PF22), a previously uncharacterized protein, is essential for the preassembly of dyneins into complexes before their transport into cilia. We identified loss-of-function mutations in the human DNAAF3 gene in individuals from families with situs inversus and defects in the assembly of inner and outer dynein arms. Knockdown of dnaaf3 in zebrafish likewise disrupts dynein arm assembly and ciliary motility, causing primary ciliary dyskinesia phenotypes that include hydrocephalus and laterality malformations. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PF22 is exclusively cytoplasmic, and a PF22-null mutant cannot assemble any outer and some inner dynein arms. Altered abundance of dynein subunits in mutant cytoplasm suggests that DNAAF3 (PF22) acts at a similar stage as other preassembly proteins, for example, DNAAF2 (also known as PF13 or KTU) and DNAAF1 (also known as ODA7 or LRRC50), in the dynein preassembly pathway. These results support the existence of a conserved, multistep pathway for the cytoplasmic formation of assembly competent ciliary dynein complexes."

The vector sequence was undetectable in the deeply sequenced iPSC lines. We identified 1,058-1,808 heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), but no copy-number variants, in each iPSC line. Six to twelve of these SNVs were within coding regions in each iPSC line, but ~50% of them are synonymous changes and the remaining are not selectively enriched for known genes associated with cancers.

They find predominant roles for complex reorganization and non-homologous repair in such 'chromothripsis' processes, suggesting a mechanism of template switching and blunt-end ligation. We defined the genetic landscape of balanced chromosomal rearrangements at nucleotide resolution by sequencing 141 breakpoints from cytogenetically interpreted translocations and inversions. We confirm that the recently described phenomenon of 'chromothripsis' (massive chromosomal shattering and reorganization) is not unique to cancer cells but also occurs in the germline, where it can resolve to a relatively balanced state with frequent inversions. We detected a high incidence of complex rearrangements (19.2%) and substantially less reliance on microhomology (31%) than previously observed in benign copy-number variants (CNVs). We compared these results to experimentally generated DNA breakage-repair by sequencing seven transgenic animals, revealing extensive rearrangement of the transgene and host genome with similar complexity to human germline alterations. Inversion was the most common rearrangement, suggesting that a combined mechanism involving template switching and non-homologous repair mediates the formation of balanced complex rearrangements that are viable, stably replicated and transmitted unaltered to subsequent generations."
https://openalex.org/W1972809713,"Meiotic recombination involves the generation of double-strand breaks, that needs to be carefully controlled to avoid fetal aneuploidy. In worms and yeast, crossover numbers are constant regardless of the amount of double-strand breaks. Jasin and colleagues now show that such crossover homeostasis mechanisms exist at two stages in mammalian meiosis. Humans suffer from high rates of fetal aneuploidy, often arising from the absence of meiotic crossover recombination between homologous chromosomes1. Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the SPO11 transesterase2. In yeast and worms, at least one buffering mechanism, crossover homeostasis, maintains crossover numbers despite variation in DSB numbers3,4,5,6,7,8. We show here that mammals exhibit progressive homeostatic control of recombination. In wild-type mouse spermatocytes, focus numbers for early recombination proteins (RAD51, DMC1) were highly variable from cell to cell, whereas foci of the crossover marker MLH1 showed little variability. Furthermore, mice with greater or fewer copies of the Spo11 gene—with correspondingly greater or fewer numbers of early recombination foci—exhibited relatively invariant crossover numbers. Homeostatic control is enforced during at least two stages, after the formation of early recombination intermediates and later while these intermediates mature towards crossovers. Thus, variability within the mammalian meiotic program is robustly managed by homeostatic mechanisms to control crossover formation, probably to suppress aneuploidy. Meiotic recombination exemplifies how order can be progressively implemented in a self-organizing system despite natural cell-to-cell disparities in the underlying biochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2044652422,"How extrinsic stimuli and intrinsic factors interact to regulate continuous neurogenesis in the postnatal mammalian brain is unknown. Here we show that regulation of dendritic development of newborn neurons by Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) during adult hippocampal neurogenesis requires neurotransmitter GABA-induced, NKCC1-dependent depolarization through a convergence onto the AKT-mTOR pathway. In contrast, DISC1 fails to modulate early-postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis when conversion of GABA-induced depolarization to hyperpolarization is accelerated. Extending the period of GABA-induced depolarization or maternal deprivation stress restores DISC1-dependent dendritic regulation through mTOR pathway during early-postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore, DISC1 and NKCC1 interact epistatically to affect risk for schizophrenia in two independent case control studies. Our study uncovers an interplay between intrinsic DISC1 and extrinsic GABA signaling, two schizophrenia susceptibility pathways, in controlling neurogenesis and suggests critical roles of developmental tempo and experience in manifesting the impact of susceptibility genes on neuronal development and risk for mental disorders."

Planarians are triploblastic (possessing derivatives of all three germ layers) and contain a population of adult proliferative somatic cells (neoblasts). Neoblasts have similar morphology (Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004Reddien P.W. Sánchez Alvarado A. Fundamentals of planarian regeneration.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 725-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), can be identified by common expression of PIWI-encoding genes (Reddien et al., 2005bReddien P.W. Oviedo N.J. Jennings J.R.

Growth Differ. 2007; 49: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, the neoblast population was demonstrated to contain clonogenic cells (cNeoblasts) that give rise to descendants spanning multiple germ layers, can restore tissue turnover and regenerative ability to irradiated animals, and can even generate entire adult bodies in single-cell transplantation experiments (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E. Wang I.E. Reddien P.W. Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Genetic investigation of planarian stem cell biology, therefore, provides an opportunity to discover gene networks promoting pluripotency, maintenance of pluripotency within adult tissues, and deployment of stem cells for the regeneration of missing cell types. Here, we took a genome-level approach to profile and functionally characterize a large set of intrinsic regulators of planarian stem cell biology. Motivated by the clonal repopulation of proliferative cells observed in planarians after treatment with low irradiation doses (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E. Wang I.E. Reddien P.W. Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we developed quantitative functional assays for stem cell-initiated clonal expansion and differentiation that permit rapid identification of RNAi phenotypes. Numerous candidate regulatory genes identified by expression profiling were thus assessed and functionally classified by RNAi and clonal analysis. Together, these studies establish a simple yet powerful framework for investigating planarian stem cell regulation and reveal a large panel of genetic factors utilized by this highly regenerative stem cell system. To identify candidate genetic regulators of planarian stem cells, we performed genome-level microarray studies comparing the expression profiles of untreated animals to animals exposed to a lethal dose (6,000 rads) of γ irradiation. In planarians, proliferative cells (Dubois, 1949Dubois F. Contribution á l ’ètude de la migration des cellules de règènèration chez les Planaires dulcicoles.Bull. Biol. Fr.

To specifically profile proliferating cells (neoblasts), rather than their postmitotic progeny, we identified the first transcripts depleted within 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr after exposure to lethal (6,000 rad) irradiation.

Transcripts marking postmitotic cell types, NB.21.11E, NB.32.1G, AGAT-1, MCP-1, and ODC-1 (Eisenhoffer et al., 2008Eisenhoffer G.T. Kang H. Sánchez Alvarado A.

We confirmed these trends by whole-mount triple fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with animals fixed 24 hr after irradiation (Figure 1B). The vast majority of transcripts examined (98.7%) did not show differential expression between untreated and 24 hr irradiated animals. Of the 578 transcripts that showed differential expression, 90% were downregulated and 67% displayed sequence similarity (BLASTx, E value < 1 × 10−10) to human genes (Figure 1C and Table S1). Gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P.

USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26579) Google Scholar) revealed that gene ontology (GO) terms associated with cell proliferation, e.g., DNA_Replication (GO:0006260) and Cell_Cycle_Process (GO:022402), were enriched within the 24 hr data set (Figure 1D; adj. p value < 0.001, and p = 0.0107, respectively). Chromatin_Binding (GO:0003682), RNA-Binding (GO:0003723), and DNA-Binding (GO:0003677) terms were also enriched (Figure 1D and Table S2), suggesting that genes regulating pluripotency and stem cell maintenance might also be contained within this data set. We determined the patterns and irradiation sensitivity of expression for identified candidate regulatory genes by whole-mount in situ hybridization. We prioritized for analysis genes predicted to encode DNA-, RNA-, or protein-binding domains (see Table S3). Proliferative cells (e.g., smedwi-1+ cells) are irradiation sensitive, absent from head tips, and distributed throughout the body mesenchyme (Reddien et al., 2005bReddien P.W. Oviedo N.J. Jennings J.R. Jenkin J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. SMEDWI-2 is a PIWI-like protein that regulates planarian stem cells.Science. 2005; 310: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We identified 28 genes expressed in irradiation-sensitive patterns similar to the distribution of smedwi-1+ cells (Figure 2A ). Several of these genes are predicted to encode chromatin-modifying protein domains, including Smed-mrg-1 (MORF-related), Smed-nsd-1 (NSD1-like SET domain), Smed-rbbp4-1 (Retinoblastoma binding protein 4), and Smed-setd8-1 (SET domain containing 8) (Table S3). In addition, three genes encoding members of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) were also identified: Smed-ezh (Enhancer of Zeste), Smed-sz12-1 (Suppressor of Zeste), and Smed-eed-1 (Embryonic Ectoderm Development). PRC2 is a well-established regulator of cell fate and stem cell activity (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A.

Salvetti A. Marincola F.M. Lena A. Deri P. Mannini L. Batistoni R. Wang E. Gremigni V. Deciphering the molecular machinery of stem cells: a look at the neoblast gene expression profile.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R62Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To date, the potential role of transcription factors and signaling proteins in planarian stem cell regulation has received only minor attention. We identified seven genes encoding predicted transcription factors expressed in proliferative cells: Smed-prox-1 (Prospero Homeobox 1), Smed-tcf15 (Transcription Factor 15), Smed-soxP-1, Smed-soxP-2, and Smed-soxP-3 (three genes encoding SRY [sex-determining region Y] box-containing proteins), Smed-junl-1 (c-jun-like), and Smed-egr-1 (Early Growth Response protein). We also identified four genes predicted to encode zinc finger domain-containing proteins, Smed-zfmym-1, Smed-zf207-1, Smed-fhl-1 (a Four and a Half LIM Domain protein), and Smed-zfp-1. Finally, four neoblast-expressed genes encode proteins with similarity to signal transduction proteins: Smed-nlk-1 (Nemo-like kinase), Smed-armc1 (Armadillo repeat-containing 1), as well as Smed-fgfr-1 and Smed-fgfr-4 (Fibroblast growth factor receptors). Expression of FGFR-like genes in proliferative cells has been reported in Dugesia japonica (Ogawa et al., 2002Ogawa K. Kobayashi C. Hayashi T. Orii H. Watanabe K. Agata K. Planarian fibroblast growth factor receptor homologs expressed in stem cells and cephalic ganglions.Dev. Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but no functional roles for these genes in planarian stem cells are described. Several genes identified by the microarray studies described above were expressed in smedwi-1-like, irradiation-sensitive patterns, but appeared enriched in specific subpopulations of cells. Some genes (e.g., prox-1, tcf15, armc1, fgfr-1) were expressed at high levels in irradiation-sensitive cells near the midline of the animal, whereas others (e.g., egr-1, soxP-3) were found in patterns that extended to the periphery of the body and/or regions slightly anterior to the photoreceptors, similar to previously described postmitotic cell populations (Figure 2A; Eisenhoffer et al., 2008Eisenhoffer G.T. Kang H. Sánchez Alvarado A. Molecular analysis of stem cells and their descendants during cell turnover and regeneration in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 327-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of many genes was also detected in the pharynx and/or in the central nervous system (Figure 2A). Of the 22 transcripts detectable by FISH, all displayed overlapping expression with smedwi-1 (Figures 2B and S2), confirming expression within dividing cells. Together, these data significantly extend the list of genes with identified expression in the neoblasts of planarians. To investigate the functions of identified candidate regulatory genes, we first developed a sensitized assay capable of screening for weak (or strong) phenotypic defects in stem cell activity. Animals exposed to a high irradiation dose (6,000 rads) experience complete failure of tissue turnover (Bardeen and Baetjer, 1904Bardeen C. Baetjer F. The inhibitive action of the Roentgen rays on regeneration in planarians.J. Exp. Zool. 1904; 1: 191-195Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Dubois, 1949Dubois F. Contribution á l ’ètude de la migration des cellules de règènèration chez les Planaires dulcicoles.Bull. Biol. Fr. Belg. 1949; 83: 213-283Google Scholar) and display stereotypical signs of stem cell loss, including tissue regression, ventral curling, and ultimate lysis (Reddien et al., 2005bReddien P.W. Oviedo N.J. Jennings J.R. Jenkin J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A. SMEDWI-2 is a PIWI-like protein that regulates planarian stem cells.Science. 2005; 310: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). By contrast, delivery of sublethal irradiation doses (e.g., 1,000–1,250 rads) initially reduces dividing cell numbers, but such animals can ultimately restore normal proliferative cell levels (Salvetti et al., 2009Salvetti A. Rossi L. Bonuccelli L. Lena A. Pugliesi C. Rainaldi G. Evangelista M. Gremigni V. Adult stem cell plasticity: neoblast repopulation in non-lethally irradiated planarians.Dev. Biol. 2009; 328: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and regenerative ability (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E. Wang I.E. Reddien P.W. Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For example, smedwi-1+ cell numbers were dramatically reduced 7 days after exposure to 1,250 rads, but were restored to approximately normal levels over the next 14 days (Figure 3A ). Accordingly, under mock RNAi conditions, most animals exposed to 1,250 rads survived and remained healthy for more than 2 months of observation (Figures 3B–3D). We reasoned that 1,250 rad-irradiated animals would be highly sensitized to defects in stem cell function. In such a background, even subtle RNAi phenotypes might render animals unable to restore tissue turnover and manifest as a lethal (easily scored) phenotype. Animals were fed dsRNA for the 28 identified genes, exposed to 1,250 rads irradiation, and assessed for the ability to survive. RNAi of 16 genes yielded robust RNAi phenotypes, similar to the effects of lethal irradiation (i.e., head regression, curling, and lysis; Figures 3E and S3, Table S4). fgfr-1(RNAi) animals exhibited head regression and curling, then recovered (head regeneration) (Figure 3E and Table S4), possibly explained if RNAi effects declined. With three phenotypes (khd-1, zfp-1, vasa-1), lesions developed on the dorsal epidermis, suggesting a mode of tissue failure at least in part distinct from that of lethal irradiation (Figures 3E and S3A). Sublethal irradiation, therefore, provides a sensitive, readily scalable screening strategy for planarians that can facilitate identification of novel stem cell RNAi phenotypes. Failed recovery RNAi phenotypes observed after 1,250 rads irradiation (described above) could occur because of defects in a wide range of processes including stem cell self-renewal, lineage commitment, cell proliferation, DNA repair, migration, and/or differentiation. In order to investigate identified RNAi phenotypes in greater cellular detail and to distinguish among these possibilities, we developed methods for quantitative analysis of individual planarian stem cell clones. High doses of irradiation (e.g., 6,000 rads) completely eliminate proliferating cells from planarian tissues. Much lower doses (e.g., 1,500–1,750 rads) similarly deplete the vast majority (>99%) of proliferating cells, but permit the survival of rare, isolated neoblasts. These remaining clonogenic neoblasts (“cNeoblasts”) divide to produce, from a single-cell starting point, clonally derived clusters of cellular descendants (i.e., “colonies”) (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E. Wang I.E. Reddien P.W. Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Between days 7 and 14 postirradiation, colonies exhibited robust (approximately 10-fold) and significant (p < 0.01, Student's t test) increase of smedwi-1+ cell numbers (Figures 4A–4C ). In addition to smedwi-1+ neoblasts, expanding colonies also produce postmitotic differentiating cell types that can be labeled with RNA probes to the NB.21.11E and AGAT-1 genes (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E. Wang I.E. Reddien P.W. Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). NB.21.11E+ and AGAT-1+ cells are mesenchymal cell types that are located subepidermally, adjacent to the body-wall musculature (Eisenhoffer et al., 2008Eisenhoffer G.T. Kang H. Sánchez Alvarado A.

Because these cells have a short (2–4 day) lifespan, they are initially depleted in irradiated animals and are only later produced within expanding smedwi-1+ cell colonies. Notably, colonies exhibited a linear relationship between numbers of dividing and differentiating cells (Figures 4B and 4C). Single-colony analysis can therefore be used to simultaneously and quantitatively assess multiple aspects of stem cell function. First, colony cell number can be readily quantified as a readout of neoblast “expansion” (i.e., self-renewal). Second, the ratio of proliferating to postmitotic cell types can be used to assess the rate of differentiation with"

Using differential purifications and mass spectrometry, we identified p100, an inhibitor of NF-κB signalling, as an interactor of Fbxw7α. p100 is constitutively targeted in the nucleus for proteasomal degradation by Fbxw7α, which recognizes a conserved motif phosphorylated by GSK3. Efficient activation of non-canonical NF-κB signalling is dependent on the elimination of nuclear p100 through either degradation by Fbxw7α or exclusion by a newly identified nuclear export signal in the carboxy terminus of p100. Expression of a stable p100 mutant, expression of a constitutively nuclear p100 mutant, Fbxw7α silencing or inhibition of GSK3 in multiple myeloma cells with constitutive non-canonical NF-κB activity results in apoptosis both in cell systems and xenotransplant models. Thus, in multiple myeloma, Fbxw7α and GSK3 function as pro-survival factors through the control of p100 degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2057322816,"Transcription factors required for formation of embryonic tissues often maintain their expression in adult stem cell populations, but whether their function remains equivalent is not clear. Here we demonstrate critical and distinct roles for Sall4 in development of embryonic germ cells and differentiation of postnatal spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs). In differentiating SPCs, Sall4 levels transiently increase and Sall4 physically interacts with Plzf, a transcription factor exclusively required for adult stem cell maintenance. Mechanistically, Sall4 sequesters Plzf to noncognate chromatin domains to induce expression of Kit, a target of Plzf-mediated repression required for differentiation. Plzf in turn antagonizes Sall4 function by displacing Sall4 from cognate chromatin to induce Sall1 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that transcription factors required for embryonic tissue development postnatally take on distinct roles through interaction with opposing factors, which hence define properties of the adult stem cell compartment."

A new imaging method (SPAIM) tracks synaptic delivery of neuropeptide vesicles Vesicles circulate between the proximal axon and the ends of nerve terminals En route sporadic bidirectional capture uniformly supplies release sites Neurotransmission relies on axonal transport of neuropeptides and active zone components packaged in dense core vesicles (DCVs) to the nerve terminal (Zupanc, 1996Zupanc G.K.

Smith S.J. Assembly of presynaptic active zones from cytoplasmic transport packets.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Many terminals feature sequential varicose sites called en passant boutons, which release neuropeptides to regulate neuronal circuits or large postsynaptic targets, such as muscle cells. In en passant boutons, neuropeptide stores are typically uniform reflecting equivalent accumulation of DCVs that reside in each bouton for many hours (Shakiryanova et al., 2006Shakiryanova D. Tully A. Levitan E.S. Activity-dependent synaptic capture of transiting peptidergic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The kinesin responsible for anterograde axonal transport of DCVs has been identified (Jacob and Kaplan, 2003Jacob T.C. Kaplan J.M.

Cell. 2008; 19: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how anterograde transport equivalently supplies DCVs to en passant boutons to ensure that neurotransmission is robust. The difficulty in distributing DCVs generated in the soma among en passant boutons is evident when possible models based on one-way anterograde transport are considered. For example, if boutons were filled in order, then the most proximal bouton would be supplied first and distal boutons might be starved for resources. Even with stochastic delivery, this problem persists: with a fixed probability of delivering anterograde DCVs to each bouton, delivery would still be highest for the most proximal bouton and decrement for each subsequent bouton. In principle, this issue could be overcome by routing cargoes specifically to each en passant bouton, but there is no known address system for directing delivery of DCVs from the soma to a potentially large and dynamically changing number of boutons. Therefore, although en passant boutons are common throughout the nervous system, the mechanism for uniformly maintaining their DCV pools by anterograde transport is unknown. Here the “rules of the road” for neuronal DCVs are determined by combining Drosophila genetic methods with a technique that enables tracking of neuropeptide-containing DCVs in native nerve terminals for minutes. Anterograde axonal transport, which had been thought to fully account for delivery to the terminal, is shown to be just the first step in a surprising, but elegant, routing strategy that produces uniform presynaptic neuropeptide stores. To determine how the uniform neuropeptide stores in Drosophila motoneuron type Ib boutons (Anderson et al., 1988Anderson M.S. Halpern M.E. Keshishian H. Identification of the neuropeptide transmitter proctolin in Drosophila larvae: characterization of muscle fiber-specific neuromuscular endings.J.

The essential role of bursicon during Drosophila development.BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10: 92Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Independent of Anf-GFP labeling, boutons were detected with a TRITC-conjugated anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody (TRITC-HRP) and numbered from distal to proximal (Figure 1A ). Surprisingly, neuropeptide accumulated initially in the most distal bouton (#1) and only later was distributed uniformly among en passant boutons #1-4 (Figures 1A and 1B). Similar results were obtained with heat shock induction of GFP-tagged Drosophila proinsulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2-GFP, Figures 1C and 1D). Therefore, the initial distal accumulation cannot be attributed to a particular neuropeptide or induction mechanism. Finally, when neuropeptide release was inhibited by removing extracellular Ca2+, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of constitutively expressed Anf-GFP (i.e., driven by elav-GAL4) also revealed preferential neuropeptide accumulation in the most distal bouton (Figures 1E and 1F, and Movie S1 available online). This finding independently verifies the polarized neuropeptide accumulation detected with pulse labeling and furthermore proves that this pattern cannot be explained by differential release by en passant boutons. The above experiments exclude many potential models for maintaining neuropeptide stores in en passant boutons including delivery in order, stochastic delivery and parallel address-based delivery. Instead, there must be a routing mechanism that preferentially produces DCV accumulation in the most distal bouton at first, but eventually results in evenly distributed DCVs. To gain insight into this mechanism, DCVs were tracked as they populated the nerve terminal with a new approach called simultaneous photobleaching and imaging (SPAIM). In initial SPAIM experiments the distal region of the nerve terminal was photobleached. Then after a punctum likely corresponding to a single DCV (Shakiryanova et al., 2006Shakiryanova D. Tully A. Levitan E.S. Activity-dependent synaptic capture of transiting peptidergic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) entered the photobleached region, a laser beam was positioned to photobleach subsequent newcomers. Finally, while continually photobleaching newcomers, a second independent scanning beam was used to simultaneously image the unbleached DCV for minutes (Figure 2A ). This allowed the initial unbleached bright DCV to be distinguished from the nearly completely photobleached newcomers (Movie S2). SPAIM revealed complex anterograde DCV routing within the nerve terminal. For example, an individual trajectory from a proximal bouton to the most distal bouton contained multiple pauses, a transient change in direction and looping exploration of boutons before coming to rest (Figure 2B, Movie S2). Bouton visits fell into 3 kinetic classes: (1) DCVs moving 0.75 ± 0.03 μm/s (n = 62) bypassed a bouton within 5 s in 45% of cases, (2) visited boutons transiently (5–120 s), or (3) stayed longer than 5-10 min time-lapse experiments (Figure 2C,D), which were classified as capture. Because proximal capture was infrequent (Figure 2D, open bars), anterograde flux dropped at each proximal bouton by ∼10% (Figure 2E). This result has two implications: first, there is nearly uniform accumulation of anterograde DCVs in each proximal bouton because there is modest depletion of DCV flux at each bouton, and second, capture in proximal boutons is inefficient so that excess DCVs remain to accumulate in the most distal bouton (Figure 2D, filled bars, E). These experiments show that DCVs do not move directly to their ultimate destinations, but instead can pause and make detours along the way. Furthermore, the initially polarized accumulation of neuropeptide is caused by the sporadic proximal capture of anterograde DCVs as they make their complex journey through the terminal. Given that anterograde transport is biased to the most distal bouton, how is uniform neuropeptide storage eventually accomplished? The above SPAIM experiments showed that changes in transport direction were rare and transient in proximal boutons. However, in 10 of 62 initially anterograde trajectories acquired, DCVs converted to retrograde transport in the most distal bouton. Analysis of these events showed that their number was limited because conversion to retrograde transport was slow (i.e., comparable to the time scale of these experiments). Thus, retrograde flux had not yet reached values found at steady state. Nevertheless, this result raised two new questions. First, if newcomer anterograde DCVs can leave the distal bouton, might retrograde transport dissipate the initial distal gradient in neuropeptide accumulation? Second, what is the fate of DCVs that leave the distal bouton by retrograde transport? To address these questions, SPAIM experiments were designed to detect retrograde traffic of DCVs that had already accumulated in the most distal bouton. In this case, proximal boutons were photobleached, but the most distal bouton was spared. Then anterograde newcomers were continually photobleached by a laser beam located upstream of the region of interest while simultaneously imaging DCVs leaving the most distal bouton with the second scanner (Figure 3A , top). For comparison, SPAIM was also used to detect traffic out of a proximal bouton (Figure 3A bottom). These experiments showed that retrograde DCV flux from the distal bouton was far greater than DCV flux from a proximal bouton (Figure 3B, Movie S3 and Movie S4), suggesting that retrograde DCV transport out of the most distal bouton removes excess DCVs supplied by anterograde transport. Consistent with this conclusion, inhibition of retrograde transport resulted in excess neuropeptide accumulation in the most distal bouton. Because retrograde transport depends on activation of the motor dynein by the dynactin multisubunit complex, it can be inhibited by genetically affecting dynactin subunits (e.g., by driving expression of dominant negative p150 Glued (GlΔ96) (Allen et al., 1999Allen M.J. Shan X. Caruccio P. Froggett S.J. Moffat K.G. Murphey R.K. Targeted expression of truncated glued disrupts giant fiber synapse formation in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9374-9384PubMed Google Scholar) or dynamitin (Dmn) overexpression (Burkhardt et al., 1997Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. Overexpression of the dynamitin (p50) subunit of the dynactin complex disrupts dynein-dependent maintenance of membrane organelle distribution.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar)). Transgenic expression of GlΔ96 or Dmn resulted in excess Anf-GFP accumulation in the most distal bouton (Figures 3C and 3D). The effect of inhibiting retrograde transport was not limited to Anf-GFP because, in the absence of any GFP construct expression, GlΔ96 also promoted distal accumulation of the native neuropeptide proproctolin (Figure S1). Therefore, dynactin-dependent retrograde DCV transport is required to dissipate the neuropeptide gradient produced by anterograde transport. Interestingly, SPAIM showed that retrograde transport in the terminal shares many features found with anterograde transport. First, retrograde DCVs moving 0.73 ± 0.03 μm/s (n = 63) often (i.e., 56% of events) bypassed proximal boutons (Figure 4A ). Second, trajectories featured both transient visits and capture in proximal boutons, as well as rare transient reversals in direction (Figures 4A and 4B). Third, capture was inefficient and uniform among proximal boutons so that flux dropped by ∼10% per bouton (Figure 4C). This similarity to anterograde capture ensures that any subtle proximal-distal gradient produced on the way toward the distal bouton is counterbalanced by a symmetric gradient in capture on way back from the distal bouton. Most importantly, inefficient sporadic capture of retrograde DCVs contributes to neuropeptide accumulation in proximal boutons. Another consequence of inefficient capture was that some retrograde DCVs were not captured in any of the proximal boutons. Because Drosophila motoneuron terminals are branched structures (Figure 5A ), retrograde DCVs must therefore either change direction to re-enter the same or a neighboring terminal branch or continue on into the axon (Figure 5B). SPAIM was used to distinguish between these possibilities: after photobleaching a branch point, retrograde traffic was imaged while simultaneously photobleaching anterograde newcomers (Figure 5C). Time-lapse imaging showed that retrograde DCVs never turned to enter another terminal branch, only rarely reversed direction to return to the same branch and usually continued on into the axon (Figure 5D, Movie S5). Therefore, uncaptured retrograde DCVs are not typically retained in the terminal, but instead proceed toward the soma. There is extensive retrograde transport of neuropeptidergic DCVs in the axon (Alonso and Assenmacher, 1983Alonso G. Assenmacher I. Retrograde axoplasmic transport of neurosecretory material. An immunocytochemical and electron-microscopic study of transected axons in normal and colchicine-treated rats.Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A conventional hypothesis would be that retrograde DCVs return to the soma to be degraded. However, SPAIM demonstrated that many DCVs contribute to retrograde transport simply because they were not captured on the way to and from the most distal bouton. Therefore, transport back through the proximal axon into the soma was imaged to determine the fate of retrograde DCVs. Unfortunately, resolving this traffic in motoneurons was not feasible for three reasons. First, the soma and axon are often not in a single plane of focus, which is needed for continual imaging of transport. Second, available motoneuron drivers label multiple clustered somata, which makes it difficult to discriminate individual axon-soma pairs. Finally, because motoneuron somata are located in the central nervous system (i.e., the ventral ganglion), light scattering by the surrounding tissue degrades the confocal signal from individual DCVs and interferes with photobleaching. Because of these limitations, retrograde DCV traffic was studied in an optically accessible neuron that is amenable to imaging traffic back through the proximal axon to the soma. Specifically, we focused on the lateral td neuron, which has its soma located on the surface of the body wall near muscle 8 and produces an anterior projecting dendrite and a posterior projecting axon (Bodmer and Jan, 1987Bodmer R. Jan Y.N. Morphological differentiation of the embryonic peripheral neurons in Drosophila.Rouxs Arch. Dev. Biol. 1987; 196: 69-77Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the larva, the lateral td neuron expresses Anf-GFP in response to the peptidergic cell driver 386Y-GAL4 (Figure 6A ). Importantly, the soma, proximal processes and the first axonal branch of lateral td neurons can be imaged in a single plane of focus (Figure 6A). Little DCV traffic entered the proximal dendrite, as expected for a presynaptic cargo (Rolls, 2011Rolls M.M. Neuronal polarity in Drosophila: Sorting out axons and dendrites.Dev. Neurobiol. 2011; 71: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the fate of retrograde DCVs moving from the segmental nerve and peripheral axons toward the td neuron soma, which is distinguished from the proximal axon by morphology and the reciprocal distributions of the microtubule associated protein futsch and the Golgi marker mannosidase II-egfp (ManII-GFP; Ye et al., 2007Ye B. Zhang Y. Song W. Younger S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Growing dendrites and axons differ in their reliance on the secretory pathway.Cell. 2007; 130: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) (Figure 6B). Surprisingly, in 5 min FRAP experiments, retrograde DCVs accumulated in the proximal axon (i.e., the region between the soma and the first axonal branch) far more than in the soma (Figure 6C, Movie S6). Time-lapse experiments showed that this occurred because flux into the soma was ∼7.5-fold less than into the proximal axon (Figure 6D). Thus, only a small fraction of retrograde DCVs traverse the proximal axon to enter the soma. Three independent lines of experimentation demonstrated that DCVs switch from retrograde to anterograde transport in the proximal axon. First, the soma and proximal axon were photobleached. SPAIM was then used to detect nascent anterograde DCVs in the absence of retrograde newcomers. As expected, the flux of nascent DCVs, which originated only from the soma, was very low in the 5 min after photobleaching (Figure 7A , Soma, B). Yet, anterograde flux out of the proximal axon measured in this time period was easily detected when retrograde DCVs were not photobleached (Figure 7A, proximal axon open bar, Movie S6). Therefore, anterograde DCVs exiting the proximal axon must have been former retrograde newcomers. Second, the effect of photobleaching retrograde newcomers from the axon on anterograde flux out of the proximal axon was determined. When the supply of retrograde DCVs from the axon was cut off, anterograde exit of DCVs from the proximal axon was nearly eliminated (Figure 7A, proximal axon open and filled bars). Again, this result is consistent with reversal of retrograde DCVs in the proximal axon. Finally, in 5 min trajectories detected by SPAIM (Figure 7C), ∼30% of retrograde DCVs reversed and left the proximal axon by anterograde transport (Figure 7D, Movie S7). In contrast, reversals in the soma only occurred in ∼2% of trajectories, showing that the proximal axon is the major turnaround site for retrograde DCVs. Interestingly, after converting to anterograde transport, DCVs left either by the branch they used to approach the soma or the other possible axonal branch. Therefore, retrograde axonal transport provides DCVs that circulate back from the proximal axon to generate anterograde transport toward all release sites, where DCVs can be captured while traveling to and from the most distal boutons. One-way anterograde transport of DCVs was believed to fully explain neuropeptide delivery to nerve terminals. However, SPAIM in different neuronal compartments (i.e., en passant boutons, axonal branches, the proximal axon, and the soma) showed that neuropeptide accumulation in nerve terminal release sites is mediated by sporadic anterograde and retrograde capture of DCVs circulating between the proximal axon and distal boutons (Figure 7E). These findings cannot be attributed to phototoxicity as they are supported by SPAIM-independent induction and mutant experiments, the match between flux measured without photobleaching (Shakiryanova et al., 2006Shakiryanova D. Tully A. Levitan E.S. Activity-dependent synaptic capture of transiting peptidergic vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the consistency of DCV behavior after multiple bouts of photobleaching, and the detection of release from single DCVs (M.Y.W. and E.S.L., unpublished data), which demonstrates viability and function. It was surprising that DCVs travel such far distances and that their presynaptic capture is inefficient, but this elegantly overcomes the limitations of relying solely on one-way transport (see Introduction) to produce the uniform neuropeptide accumulation that characterizes en passant boutons. Indeed, the conundrum of how to ensure that all potential release sites can function effectively regardless of distance from the soma or presence on different branches, which is critical for neurons, is resolved by vesicle circulation. Vesicle circulation also accounts for the long known, but mysterious, abundance of retrograde DCVs in axons (Alonso and Assenmacher, 1983Alonso G. Assenmacher I. Retrograde axoplasmic transport of neurosecretory material. An immunocytochemical and electron-microscopic study of transected axons in normal and colchicine-treated rats.Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and ensures that DCVs do not readily return to the soma to be degraded. Furthermore, vesicle circulation provides a novel explanation for the finding that perturbing retrograde DCV transport in neurons affects anterograde transport (Kwinter et al., 2009Kwinter D.M. Lo K. Mafi P. Silverman M.A. Dynactin regulates bidirectional transport of dense-core vesicles in the axon and dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuroscience. 2009; 162: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar): interrupting retrograde transport prevents circulating retrograde DCVs from contributing to anterograde flux and so would reduce total anterograde transport. Finally, because the same kinesin motor transports neuropeptides and many other presynaptic proteins (Hall and Hedgecock, 1991Hall D.H. Hedgecock E.M.

Cell. 2008; 19: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), vesicle circulation could be a general strategy for maintaining the synaptic function of en passant boutons. In this light, it is interesting that retrograde transport is compromised in neurodegenerative diseases (Ström et al., 2008Ström A.L. Gal J. Shi P. Kasarskis E.J. Hayward L.J. Zhu H. Retrograde axonal transport and motor neuron disease.J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Perlson et al., 2010Perlson E. Maday S. Fu M.M. Moughamian A.J. Holzbaur E.L. Retrograde axonal transport: pathways to cell death?.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A previously unconsidered contributing factor to the early onset loss of synaptic function could be that diseases that affect dynactin-dependent retrograde transport perturb vesicle circulation that normally maintains the terminal. Therefore, vesicle circulation may be significant under physiological and pathological conditions. SPAIM detects DCVs in a native synapse for many minutes. In contrast, we found that photoactivation-based approaches using PA-GFP, tdEosFP and mOrange did not work well with Drosophila DCVs. This may be due to suboptimal targeting, difficulty in inducing photoactivation in the mildly acidic (Sturman et al., 2006Sturman D.A. Shakiryanova D. Hewes R.S. Deitcher D.L. Levitan E.S. Nearly neutral secretory vesicles in Drosophila nerve terminals.Biophys. J. 2006; 90: L45-L47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and oxidizing lumen of Drosophila DCVs, and the lower brightness and poorer folding of many photoactivatable proteins compared to emerald GFP. Given the availability of bright, well characterized GFP constructs, SPAIM represents a tenable method for tracking DCVs in native Drosophila neurons. In addition to detecting vesicle circulation, SPAIM could be used to study how presynaptic DCV mobilization is induced by activity in a native synapse and how DCV traffic changes with synaptic development and plasticity. Furthermore, as noted above, SPAIM can detect release from single DCVs induced by nerve stimulation, which opens the possibility of studying peptidergic transmission at the level of individual vesicles in a native synapse. Therefore, SPAIM could answer many questions concerning neuronal DCVs. In principle, SPAIM could be applied to any fluorescent organelle. However, a dual scanner confocal microscope, which was used here, might not be ideal for detecting very dim signals. When optical sectioning is not required, this limitation could be overcome by using a single scanner system for initially photobleaching a region of interest and then for continually photobleaching newcomers while simultaneously imaging individual organelles with a sensitive camera. In fact, performing SPAIM experiments by coupling a camera with a common single scanner confocal microscope may be an attractive option to overcome both the insensitivity and the expense of dual scanner systems. With the appropriate setup, SPAIM could be used to study traffic in terminals, dendrites, cilia, and filopodia. Emerald GFP was inserted at the EcoRV cut site in the preproDilp2 C-peptide sequence (kindly provided by E. Rulifson) and the resultant Dilp2-GFP fragment was cloned into the pUAST vector at the EcoRI and NotI sites for generation of transgenic w; UAS-Dilp2-GFP/CyO flies. The following lines were maintained as double homozygotes for both transgenes, with female larvae selected for imaging experiments: elav > Anf-GFP (yw, elav-Gal4 UAS-preproAnf-EMD), 386Y > Anf-GFP (w, UAS-preproAnf-EMD;386Y-Gal4), HS > Dilp2-GFP (w; UAS-Dilp2-GFP/CyO; Hsp70-Gal4) and GS > Anf-GFP (GS 3550-2, UAS-preproAnf-EMD).

All animals were raised at 25°C, except in heat shock induction experiments in which larvae grown at 18°C were incubated at 37°C for 2 hr and then maintained at 29°C. For RU486 induction, GS > Anf-GFP larvae were transferred to food containing 100 μg/ml RU486, which was made from a stock ethanol solution containing 100 mg/ml RU486 (Mifepristone; Sigma) mixed into freshly cooked Jazzmix food (Fisher Scientific) that had been cooled down to 60°C. In induction experiments, 3rd instar larvae, selected at specific time points after heat shock or RU486 exposure, were filleted and incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-HRP (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 20–30 min on ice to stain neuronal membranes prior to GFP imaging. Filleted larvae were fixed in 4% parfomaldehyde with 7% picric acid for 1 hr followed by permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100.

Transport was quantified in muscle 6/7 type Ib boutons, muscle 4 motoneuron branches (although consistent results were obtained in muscle 6/7 branches) and lateral td neurons. In all cases, wandering 3rd instar larvae were filleted and imaged (Levitan et al., 2007Levitan E.S. Lanni F. Shakiryanova D.

GFP and TRITC were imaged using 488 nm and 559 nm excitation lasers, respectively. All prebleached images and images taken for quantification purpose were acquired at a minimum resolution 17 pixels/μm at laser power and detection settings that did not generate saturated signals or produce significant photobleaching. When time-lapse was not required, fluorescence intensity for each en passant bouton was measured in Z stacks (29 images at 0.35 μm steps) taken of type Ib terminals on muscle 6/7. For td neurons, single images were acquired, with the trachea left intact. Photobleaching was performed using 100% 488 nm laser power from the SIM scanner in the line scanning mode. Time-lapse images were taken at 1 frame/s at a single plane of focus. To enable detection of single DCVs in flux and tracking experiments, time-lapse images were taken with a 5-fold increase in 488 nm main scanning laser power compared to prebleach images. In SPAIM experiments, initial photobleaching was performed using 488 nm SIM scanning at speed of 40-100 μm/pixel and 100% SIM laser power. Then the SIM scanner setting was reduced to 20%–30% power (i.e., 110 μW below the objective) for simultaneous photobleaching while acquiring images with the main scanner using ∼4 μW of power below the objective scanning at 4 μm/pixel. All SPAIM experiments lasted at least 5 min or until the DCV reversed direction and left the region of interest in tracking experiments. Images were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH) software. For intensity measurements, stacks were first transformed into averaged Z projections. A region of interest was drawn around each bouton and background subtracted GFP fluorescence was measured as the mean gray value unless otherwise specified. In pulse-labeling experiments, boutons were identified with HRP labeling. FRAP (Δ%Fo) of each bouton was calculated as relative fluorescence to the corresponding prebleached bouton subtracted by the residual fluorescence immediately after photobleaching. In dynactin perturbation experiments, fluorescence was measured as total gray value from the averaged Z projection. Flux was determined by manually counting DCVs moving through a ROI over a period of minutes. Single DCVs were tracked and trajectories were plotted using the Manual Tracking plugin in ImageJ.

https://openalex.org/W2025909136,"Pax3, a key myogenic regulator, is transiently expressed during activation of adult muscle stem cells, or satellite cells (SCs), and is also expressed in a subset of quiescent SCs (QSCs), but only in specific muscles. The mechanisms regulating these variations in expression are not well understood. Here we show that Pax3 levels are regulated by miR-206, a miRNA with a previously demonstrated role in myogenic differentiation. In most QSCs and activated SCs, miR-206 expression suppresses Pax3 expression. Paradoxically, QSCs that express high levels of Pax3 also express high levels of miR-206. In these QSCs, Pax3 transcripts are subject to alternative polyadenylation, resulting in transcripts with shorter 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) that render them resistant to regulation by miR-206. Similar alternate polyadenylation of the Pax3 transcript also occurs in myogenic progenitors during development. Our findings may reflect a general role of alternative polyadenylation in circumventing miRNA-mediated regulation of stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2063072545,"The redox-regulated chaperone Hsp33 protects organisms against oxidative stress that leads to protein unfolding. Activation of Hsp33 is triggered by the oxidative unfolding of its own redox-sensor domain, making Hsp33 a member of a recently discovered class of chaperones that require partial unfolding for full chaperone activity. Here we address the long-standing question of how chaperones recognize client proteins. We show that Hsp33 uses its own intrinsically disordered regions to discriminate between unfolded and partially structured folding intermediates. Binding to secondary structure elements in client proteins stabilizes Hsp33's intrinsically disordered regions, and this stabilization appears to mediate Hsp33's high affinity for structured folding intermediates. Return to nonstress conditions reduces Hsp33's disulfide bonds, which then significantly destabilizes the bound client proteins and in doing so converts them into less-structured, folding-competent client proteins of ATP-dependent foldases. We propose a model in which energy-independent chaperones use internal order-to-disorder transitions to control substrate binding and release."
https://openalex.org/W1993959309,"Control of translation is a fundamental source of regulation in gene expression. The induction of protein synthesis by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) critically contributes to enduring modifications of synaptic function, but how BDNF selectively affects only a minority of expressed mRNAs is poorly understood. We report that BDNF rapidly elevates Dicer, increasing mature miRNA levels and inducing RNA processing bodies in neurons. BDNF also rapidly induces Lin28, causing selective loss of Lin28-regulated miRNAs and a corresponding upregulation in translation of their target mRNAs. Binding sites for Lin28-regulated miRNAs are necessary and sufficient to confer BDNF responsiveness to a transcript. Lin28 deficiency, or expression of a Lin28-resistant Let-7 precursor miRNA, inhibits BDNF translation specificity and BDNF-dependent dendrite arborization. Our data establish that specificity in BDNF-regulated translation depends upon a two-part posttranscriptional control of miRNA biogenesis that generally enhances mRNA repression in association with GW182 while selectively derepressing and increasing translation of specific mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2149993002,"Polycyclic polyether natural products have fascinated chemists and biologists alike owing to their useful biological activity, highly complex structure and intriguing biosynthetic mechanisms. Following the original proposal for the polyepoxide origin of lasalocid and isolasalocid and the experimental determination of the origins of the oxygen and carbon atoms of both lasalocid and monensin, a unified stereochemical model for the biosynthesis of polyether ionophore antibiotics was proposed. The model was based on a cascade of nucleophilic ring closures of postulated polyepoxide substrates generated by stereospecific oxidation of all-trans polyene polyketide intermediates. Shortly thereafter, a related model was proposed for the biogenesis of marine ladder toxins, involving a series of nominally disfavoured anti-Baldwin, endo-tet epoxide-ring-opening reactions. Recently, we identified Lsd19 from the Streptomyces lasaliensis gene cluster as the epoxide hydrolase responsible for the epoxide-opening cyclization of bisepoxyprelasalocid A to form lasalocid A. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of Lsd19 in complex with its substrate and product analogue to provide the first atomic structure-to our knowledge-of a natural enzyme capable of catalysing the disfavoured epoxide-opening cyclic ether formation. On the basis of our structural and computational studies, we propose a general mechanism for the enzymatic catalysis of polyether natural product biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2132040328,"Posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms superimpose ""fine-tuning"" control upon ""on-off"" switches characteristic of gene transcription. We have exploited computational modeling with experimental validation to resolve an anomalous relationship between mRNA expression and protein synthesis. The GAIT (gamma-interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex repressed VEGF-A synthesis to a low, constant rate independent of VEGF-A mRNA expression levels. Dynamic model simulations predicted an inhibitory GAIT-element-interacting factor to account for this relationship and led to the identification of a truncated form of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), a GAIT constituent that mediates binding to target transcripts. The truncated protein, EPRS(N1), shields GAIT-element-bearing transcripts from the inhibitory GAIT complex, thereby dictating a ""translational trickle"" of GAIT target proteins. EPRS(N1) mRNA is generated by polyadenylation-directed conversion of a Tyr codon in the EPRS-coding sequence to a stop codon (PAY(∗)). Genome-wide analysis revealed multiple candidate PAY(∗) targets, including the authenticated target RRM1, suggesting a general mechanism for production of C terminus-truncated regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1979821493,"ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can ultimately result in apoptosis. Using a Drosophila model of ER stress, Ryoo and colleagues find that apoptosis is induced independently of the known UPR branches. They show that ER stress induces CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of MEKK1, which activates JNK and induces apoptosis. Chronic stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) underlies many degenerative and metabolic diseases involving apoptosis of vital cells. A well-established example is autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), an age-related retinal degenerative disease caused by mutant rhodopsins1,2. Similar mutant alleles of Drosophila Rhodopsin-1 also impose stress on the ER and cause age-related retinal degeneration in that organism3. Well-characterized signalling responses to ER stress, referred to as the unfolded protein response4 (UPR), induce various ER quality control genes that can suppress such retinal degeneration5. However, how cells activate cell death programs after chronic ER stress remains poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of a signalling pathway mediated by cdk5 and mekk1 required for ER-stress-induced apoptosis. Inactivation of these genes specifically suppressed apoptosis, without affecting other protective branches of the UPR. CDK5 phosphorylates MEKK1, and together, they activate the JNK pathway for apoptosis. Moreover, disruption of this pathway can delay the course of age-related retinal degeneration in a Drosophila model of ADRP. These findings establish a previously unrecognized branch of ER-stress response signalling involved in degenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2130594083,"Identifying genomics regions that are affected by selection is important to understand the domestication and selection history of the domesticated chicken, as well as understanding molecular pathways underlying phenotypic traits and breeding goals. While whole-genome approaches, either high-density SNP chips or massively parallel sequencing, have been successfully applied to identify evidence for selective sweeps in chicken, it has been difficult to distinguish patterns of selection and stochastic and breed specific effects. Here we present a study to identify selective sweeps in a large number of chicken breeds (67 in total) using a high-density (58 K) SNP chip. We analyzed commercial chickens representing all major breeding goals. In addition, we analyzed non-commercial chicken diversity for almost all recognized traditional Dutch breeds and a selection of representative breeds from China. Based on their shared history or breeding goal we in silico grouped the breeds into 14 breed groups. We identified 396 chromosomal regions that show suggestive evidence of selection in at least one breed group with 26 of these regions showing strong evidence of selection. Of these 26 regions, 13 were previously described and 13 yield new candidate genes for performance traits in chicken. Our approach demonstrates the strength of including many different populations with similar, and breed groups with different selection histories to reduce stochastic effects based on single populations."

https://openalex.org/W2111956730,"Like many asymmetrically dividing cells, budding yeast segregates mitotic spindle poles nonrandomly between mother and daughter cells. During metaphase, the spindle positioning protein Kar9 accumulates asymmetrically, localizing specifically to astral microtubules emanating from the old spindle pole body (SPB) and driving its segregation to the bud. Here, we show that the SPB component Nud1/centriolin acts through the mitotic exit network (MEN) to specify asymmetric SPB inheritance. In the absence of MEN signaling, Kar9 asymmetry is unstable and its preference for the old SPB is disrupted. Consistent with this, phosphorylation of Kar9 by the MEN kinases Dbf2 and Dbf20 is not required to break Kar9 symmetry but is instead required to maintain stable association of Kar9 with the old SPB throughout metaphase. We propose that MEN signaling links Kar9 regulation to SPB identity through biasing and stabilizing the age-insensitive, cyclin-B-dependent mechanism of symmetry breaking."

https://openalex.org/W2071309387,"Most users of prosthetic hands must rely on visual feedback alone, which requires visual attention and cognitive resources. Providing haptic feedback of variables relevant to manipulation, such as contact force, may thus improve the usability of prosthetic hands for tasks of daily living. Vibrotactile stimulation was explored as a feedback modality in ten unimpaired participants across eight sessions in a two-week period. Participants used their right index finger to perform a virtual object manipulation task with both visual and augmentative vibrotactile feedback related to force. Through repeated training, participants were able to learn to use the vibrotactile feedback to significantly improve object manipulation. Removal of vibrotactile feedback in session 8 significantly reduced task performance. These results suggest that vibrotactile feedback paired with training may enhance the manipulation ability of prosthetic hand users without the need for more invasive strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1983960129,"Post-translational modification through protein acetylation is emerging as an important mode of cellular regulation. We have previously demonstrated the role that glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) acetylation and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) play in the antitumor activity of class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which primarily target class I HDACs. In this study, we explored the contributory role these class I HDACs may play in UPR regulation. Binding studies were performed using immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting following dual-transfection with HA-tagged GRP78 and FLAG-tagged HDACs. Subcellular localization was performed using Western blot of fractionated cell lysates and confocal microscopy. Individual HDACs were inhibited using RNA interference. We identified the potential of HDACs 1, 2, and 3 to bind to GRP78. These HDACs colocalized with GRP78 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inhibition of individual HDACs resulted in GRP78 acetylation and selective activation of the UPR. Although traditionally viewed as nuclear enzymes, we demonstrate that Class I HDACs localize to the ER, bind to GRP78, and selectively activate the UPR, representing a novel mode of UPR regulation and mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors."

However, little attention has been paid to the effects of the choice of sequencing platform and library preparation protocol on the results obtained. We present a thorough comparison of small-RNA sequencing libraries generated from the same embryonic stem cell lines, using different sequencing platforms, which represent the three major second-generation sequencing technologies, and protocols. We have analysed and compared the expression of microRNAs, as well as populations of small RNAs derived from repetitive elements. Despite the fact that different libraries display a good correlation between sequencing platforms, qualitative and quantitative variations in the results were found, depending on the protocol used. Thus, when comparing libraries from different biological samples, it is strongly recommended to use the same sequencing platform and protocol in order to ensure the biological relevance of the comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W2052209587,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition with a prevalence of 1–2% in the general population that is characterized by severe episodic shifts in mood ranging from depressive to manic episodes. One of the most common treatments is lithium (Li), with successful response in 30–60% of patients. Synapsin II (SYN2) is a neuronal phosphoprotein that we have previously identified as a possible candidate gene for the etiology of BD and/or response to Li treatment in a genome-wide linkage study focusing on BD patients characterized for excellent response to Li prophylaxis. In the present study we investigated the role of this gene in BD, particularly as it pertains to Li treatment. We investigated the effect of lithium treatment on the expression of SYN2 in lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients characterized as excellent Li-responders, non-responders, as well as non-psychiatric controls. Finally, we sought to determine if Li has a cell-type-specific effect on gene expression in neuronal-derived cell lines. In both in vitro models, we found SYN2 to be modulated by the presence of Li. By focusing on Li-responsive BD we have identified a potential mechanism for Li response in some patients."

https://openalex.org/W2158623140,"The contribution of adaptive mechanisms in maintaining genetic polymorphisms is still debated in many systems. To understand the contribution of selective factors in maintaining polymorphism, we investigated large-scale (>1000 km) geographic variation in morph frequencies and fitness-related physiological traits in the damselfly Nehalennia irene. As fitness-related physiological traits, we investigated investment in immune function (phenoloxidase activity), energy storage and fecundity (abdomen protein and lipid content), and flight muscles (thorax protein content). In the first part of the study, our aim was to identify selective agents maintaining the large-scale spatial variation in morph frequencies. Morph frequencies varied considerably among populations, but, in contrast to expectation, in a geographically unstructured way. Furthermore, frequencies co-varied only weakly with the numerous investigated ecological parameters. This suggests that spatial frequency patterns are driven by stochastic processes, or alternatively, are consequence of highly variable and currently unidentified ecological conditions. In line with this, the investigated ecological parameters did not affect the fitness-related physiological traits differently in both morphs. In the second part of the study, we aimed at identifying trade-offs between fitness-related physiological traits that may contribute to the local maintenance of both colour morphs by defining alternative phenotypic optima, and test the spatial consistency of such trade-off patterns. The female morph with higher levels of phenoloxidase activity had a lower thorax protein content, and vice versa, suggesting a trade-off between investments in immune function and in flight muscles. This physiological trade-off was consistent across the geographical scale studied and supports widespread correlational selection, possibly driven by male harassment, favouring alternative trait combinations in both female morphs."
https://openalex.org/W2138704992,"Increased residual platelet reactivity remains a burden for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who received a coronary stent and do not respond sufficiently to treatment with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. We hypothesized that serotonin antagonism reduces high on-treatment platelet reactivity. Whole blood impedance aggregometry was performed with arachidonic acid (AA, 0.5 mM) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 6.5 µM) in addition to different concentrations of serotonin (1-100 µM) in whole blood from 42 CAD patients after coronary stent placement and 10 healthy subjects. Serotonin increased aggregation dose-dependently in CAD patients who responded to clopidogrel treatment: After activation with ADP, aggregation increased from 33.7 ± 1.3% to 40.9 ± 2.0% in the presence of 50 µM serotonin (p<0.05) and to 48.2 ± 2.0% with 100 µM serotonin (p<0.001). The platelet serotonin receptor antagonist ketanserin decreased ADP-induced aggregation significantly in clopidogrel low-responders (from 59.9 ± 3.1% to 37.4 ± 3.5, p<0.01), but not in clopidogrel responders. These results were confirmed with light transmission aggregometry in platelet-rich plasma in a subset of patients. Serotonin hence increased residual platelet reactivity in patients who respond to clopidogrel after coronary stent placement. In clopidogrel low-responders, serotonin receptor antagonism improved platelet inhibition, almost reaching responder levels. This may justify further investigation of triple antiplatelet therapy with anti-serotonergic agents."
