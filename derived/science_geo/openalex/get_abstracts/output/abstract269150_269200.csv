https://openalex.org/W2115106476,"Diatremes in the Missouri River Breaks demonstrate systematic subsidence-ring structure, contain inclusions derived from far above and far below, and have been produced by gas-rich eruptions of alkalic ultramafic magmas. Similar magmas have produced diatremes in many localities in the world and are known to be closely associated with and probably parental to kimberlites."

Dimensional analysis suggests a geometric relation between order, amplitude, and number. The processes responsible for these features also may be continuous in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1993923395,Tracking data fromt the lunar orbiters have been analyzed for information regarding Moon's gravity field. These preliminary results include values of a set of harmonic coefficients throlugh degree 4 in the tesserals and degree 8 in the zonals. Implications regarding Moon's mass distribution are discltssed: one implicationt is that Moon is nearly homogeneous.

https://openalex.org/W1981817722,"Recurrent somatic reduction is a normal ontogenetic process in apogeotropic roots of cycads, which develop into dichotomously branching coralloid masses. The reduced cells make up part of a ring of differentiated cortical tissue lying midway between the pericycle and the epidermis; they serve as fillers among the large cells and become charged with slime. The differentiated tissue is colonized by a species of blue-green algae."
https://openalex.org/W1964831889,We have measured permeabilities of deposited monolayers of stearic acid varying in thickness from 8 to 48 deposited layers. These results are compared with permeabilities of polymeric films and insoluble monolayers. The technique may have applicability in the fabrication of synthetic membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2095534285,"The shear strength of solid carbon tetrachloride was measured from 187 degrees to 247 degrees K. A 25-percent discontinuity was observed at the solid- solid transition, at about 225 degrees K. This transition exhibited a distinct hysteresis. The shear strength of both the high- and low-temperature forms increased very rapidly as the temperature was lowered. There was no evidence of a rhombohedral high-temperature phase."
