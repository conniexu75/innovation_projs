https://openalex.org/W2774173062,"Ixodes ricinus is a species of hard tick that transmits several important diseases in Europe and North Africa, including Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change is affecting the geographic distributions and abundances of arthropod vectors, which in turn influence the geographic distribution and epidemiology of associated vector-borne diseases. To date, few studies have investigated effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of I. ricinus at continental extents. Here, we assessed the potential distribution of I. ricinus under current and future climate conditions to understand how climate change will influence the geographic distribution of this important tick vector in coming decades.We used ecological niche modeling to estimate the geographic distribution of I. ricinus with respect to current climate, and then assessed its future potential distribution under different climate change scenarios. This approach integrates occurrence records of I. ricinus with six relevant environmental variables over a continental extent that includes Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Future projections were based on climate data from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) under 2 representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios (RCPs), for the years 2050 and 2070.The present and future potential distributions of I. ricinus showed broad overlap across most of western and central Europe, and in more narrow zones in eastern and northern Europe, and North Africa. Potential expansions were observed in northern and eastern Europe. These results indicate that I. ricinus populations could emerge in areas in which they are currently lacking, posing increased risks to human health in those areas. However, the future of I. ricinus ticks in some important regions such the Mediterranean was unclear owing to high uncertainty in model predictions."

WASH practices may change as women transition through socially-defined life stage experiences, like marriage and pregnancy. Thus, the relationship between WASH practices and RTIs might vary across female reproductive life stages. This cross-sectional study assessed the relationship between WASH exposures and self-reported RTI symptoms in 3,952 girls and women from two rural districts in India, and tested whether social exposures represented by reproductive life stage was an effect modifier of associations. In fully adjusted models, RTI symptoms were less common in women using a latrine without water for defecation versus open defecation (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.69; Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.48, 0.98) and those walking shorter distances to a bathing location (OR = 0.79, CI = 0.63, 0.99), but there was no association between using a latrine with a water source and RTIs versus open defecation (OR = 1.09; CI = 0.69, 1.72). Unexpectedly, RTI symptoms were more common for women bathing daily with soap (OR = 6.55, CI = 3.60, 11.94) and for women washing their hands after defecation with soap (OR = 10.27; CI = 5.53, 19.08) or ash/soil/mud (OR = 6.02; CI = 3.07, 11.77) versus water only or no hand washing. WASH practices of girls and women varied across reproductive life stages, but the associations between WASH practices and RTI symptoms were not moderated by or confounded by life stage status. This study provides new evidence that WASH access and practices are associated with self-reported reproductive tract infection symptoms in rural Indian girls and women from different reproductive life stages. However, the counterintuitive directions of effect for soap use highlights that causality and mechanisms of effect cannot be inferred from this study design. Future research is needed to understand whether improvements in water and sanitation access could improve the practice of safe hygiene behaviors and reduce the global burden of RTIs in women."
https://openalex.org/W2772321910,"The incidence of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO) has increased over the past two decades. One possible cause of this increase is the aging of the population, which results in more comorbidities in high income countries.To better characterize the clinical presentation and outcome of PVO in the elderly.We conducted a post-hoc analysis of a previously published trial that studied treatment duration in PVO and compared the presentation and outcomes according to age.Our analysis included 351 patients among whom 85 (24%) were 75-years-old or more.There were no significant differences in the socio-demographics of the patients. Neoplasia and chronic inflammatory diseases were more common in the older group: 34% vs. 19% (p = 0.021) and 9% versus 1% (p = 0.004), respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical and radiological presentations between the groups in terms of back pain (337/351, 97%), fever (182/351, 52%), PVO localization, neurological signs and epidural abscess. Associated infective endocarditis (IE) was more frequent in the older group (37% vs. 14%, p<0.001). Streptococci were more frequently involved in infections of older patients (29% vs. 14%, p = 0.003) in contrast to Staphylococcus aureus (31% vs. 45%, p = 0.03). Older patients displayed higher mortality rates at 1 year (21% vs. 3%, p<0.001) and more adverse events related to cardiorespiratory failure (10.6% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.025), but had similar quality of life among the survivors.During PVO, the clinical and radiological findings are similar in older patients. Global mortality rates are higher in older patients compared to younger patients, which could be explained by the increased frequency of neoplasia at diagnosis and higher prevalence of associated IE in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2773235152,"The mechanism behind the glucose lowering effect occurring after specific activation of GPR120 is not completely understood. In this study, a potent and selective GPR120 agonist was developed and its pharmacological properties were compared with the previously described GPR120 agonist Metabolex-36. Effects of both compounds on signaling pathways and GLP-1 secretion were investigated in vitro. The acute glucose lowering effect was studied in lean wild-type and GPR120 null mice following oral or intravenous glucose tolerance tests. In vitro, in GPR120 overexpressing cells, both agonists signaled through Gαq, Gαs and the β-arrestin pathway. However, in mouse islets the signaling pathway was different since the agonists reduced cAMP production. The GPR120 agonists stimulated GLP-1 secretion both in vitro in STC-1 cells and in vivo following oral administration. In vivo GPR120 activation induced significant glucose lowering and increased insulin secretion after intravenous glucose administration in lean mice, while the agonists had no effect in GPR120 null mice. Exendin 9-39, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, abolished the GPR120 induced effects on glucose and insulin following an intravenous glucose challenge. In conclusion, GLP-1 secretion is an important mechanism behind the acute glucose lowering effect following specific GPR120 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2771743668,"Concerns are growing over the impact of livestock farming on environment and public health. The livestock industry is faced with the double constraint of limiting its use of natural resources and antimicrobials while ensuring its economic sustainability. In this context, reliable methods are needed to evaluate the effect of the prevention of endemic animal diseases on the productivity of livestock production systems. In this study, an epidemiological and productivity model was used to link changes in Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) incidence with the productivity of the beef and dairy cattle sectors in France. Cattle production parameters significantly affected by BRD were selected through literature review. Previous field study results and national cattle performance estimates were used to infer growth performances, mortality rates and carcass quality in the cattle affected and not affected by BRD. A steady-state deterministic herd production model was used to predict the productivity of the dairy and beef sector and their defined compartments (breeding-fattening, feedlot young bulls, and feedlot veal) in case of BRD incidence reduction by 20%, 50% or 100%. Results suggested that BRD should be controlled at a priority in beef breeding farms as eradication of BRD in beef calves would increase the whole beef sector’s productivity by 4.7–5.5% while eradication in other production stages would result in lower productivity gain in their respective sectors. However, the analysis performed at compartment level showed that, in both the beef and dairy sector, young bull and veal feedlot enterprises derive more economic benefits from BRD eradication for their own compartment (increase in productivity of 8.7–12.8% for beef young bulls) than the breeding farms (increase in productivity of 5.1–6% for beef calves), which may limit the investments in BRD control."
https://openalex.org/W2775344422,"Aneura pinguis is a thalloid liverwort species with broad geographical distribution. It is composed of cryptic species, however, the number of cryptic species within A. pinguis is not known. Five cpDNA regions (matK, rbcL, rpoC1, trnH-psbA and trnL-trnF) and the entire nuclear ITS region were studied in 130 samples of A. pinguis from different geographical regions. The relationships between the cryptic species of A. pinguis, A. maxima and A. mirabilis were analyzed. All of the examined samples were clustered into 10 clades corresponding to 10 cryptic species of A. pinguis (marked A to J). Aneura mirabilis and A. maxima were nested among different cryptic species of A. pinguis, which indicates that A. pinguis is a paraphyletic taxon. Subgroups were found in cryptic species A, B, C and E. As single barcodes, all tested DNA regions had 100% discriminant power and fulfilled DNA barcode criteria for species identification; however, the only combination detected in all subgroups was trnL-trnF with trnH-psbA or ITS2. The distances between cryptic species were 11- to 35-fold higher than intraspecific distances. In all analyzed DNA regions, the distances between most pairs of cryptic A. pinguis species were higher than between A. maxima and A. mirabilis. All cryptic species of A. pinguis clearly differed in their habitat preferences, which suggests that habitat adaptation could be the main driving force behind cryptic speciation within this taxon."
https://openalex.org/W2775721274,"Background Viral respiratory infections, especially acute bronchiolitis, play a key role in the development of asthma in childhood. However, most studies have focused on respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus infections and none of them have compared the long-term evolution of single versus double or multiple viral infections. Objective Our aim was to compare the frequency of asthma development at 6–8 years in children with previous admission for bronchiolitis associated with single versus double or multiple viral infection. Patients & methods A cross-sectional study was performed in 244 children currently aged 6–8 years, previously admitted due to bronchiolitis between September 2008 and December 2011. A structured clinical interview and the ISAAC questionnaire for asthma symptoms for 6-7-year-old children, were answered by parents by telephone. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate for virological study (polymerase chain reaction) and clinical data were prospectively taken during admission for bronchiolitis. Results Median current age at follow-up was 7.3 years (IQR: 6.7–8.1). The rate of recurrent wheezing was 82.7% in the coinfection group and 69.7% in the single-infection group, p = 0.06. The number of wheezing-related admissions was twice as high in coinfections than in single infections, p = 0.004. Regarding the ISAAC questionnaire, 30.8% of coinfections versus 15% of single infections, p = 0.01, presented “wheezing in the last 12 months”, data that strongly correlate with current prevalence of asthma. “Dry cough at night” was also reported more frequently in coinfections than in single infections, p = 0.02. The strongest independent risk factors for asthma at 6–8 years of age were: age > 9 months at admission for bronchiolitis (OR: 3.484; CI95%: 1.459–8.317, p:0.005), allergic rhinitis (OR: 5.910; 95%CI: 2.622–13.318, p<0.001), and viral coinfection-bronchiolitis (OR: 3.374; CI95%: 1.542–7.386, p:0.01). Conclusions Asthma at 6–8 years is more frequent and severe in those children previously hospitalized with viral coinfection-bronchiolitis compared with those with single infection. Allergic rhinitis and older age at admission seem also to be strong independent risk factors for asthma development in children previously hospitalised because of bronchiolitis."
https://openalex.org/W2775325223,"The periparturient period of dairy cows is characterized by intense lipolysis in adipose tissues (AT), which induces the release of free fatty acids (FFA) into circulation. Among FFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to oxidation and can modulate inflammatory responses during lipolysis within AT. Linoleic and arachidonic acid oxidized products (oxylipids) such as hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODE) and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETE), were recently identified as products of lipolysis that could modulate AT inflammation during lipolysis. However, the effect of lipolysis intensity during the transition from gestation to lactation on fatty acid substrate availability and subsequent AT oxylipid biosynthesis is currently unknown. We hypothesized that in periparturient dairy cows, alterations in AT and plasma fatty acids and oxylipid profiles coincide with changes in lipolysis intensity and stage of lactation. Blood and subcutaneous AT samples were collected from periparturient cows at -27±7 (G1) and -10±5 (G2) d prepartum and at 8±3 d postpartum (PP). Targeted lipidomic analysis was performed on plasma and AT using HPLC-MS/MS. We report that FFA concentrations increased as parturition approached and were highest at PP. Cows exhibiting high lipolysis rate at PP (FFA>1.0 mEq/L) had higher body condition scores at G1 compared to cows with low lipolysis rate (FFA<1.0 mEq/L). Concentrations of plasma linoleic and arachidonic acids were increased at PP. In AT, 13-HODE, and 5-, 11- and 15-HETE were increased at PP compared to G1 and G2. Concentrations of beta hydroxybutyrate were positively correlated with those of 13-HODE and 15-HETE in AT. Plasma concentrations of 5- and 20-HETE were increased at PP. These data demonstrate that prepartum adiposity predisposes cows to intense lipolysis post-partum and may exacerbate AT inflammation because of increased production of pro-inflammatory oxylipids including 5- and 15-HETE and 13-HODE. These results support a role for certain linoleic and arachidonic acid-derived oxylipids as positive and negative modulators of AT inflammation during periparturient lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2771140897,"The toxic trace elements mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and antimony (Sb) are transferred over the placenta to the fetus and secreted into the breastmilk. All four elements bioaccumulate in the body and as maternal age at delivery is increasing in industrialized countries, the burden of toxic trace elements in never-pregnant women of fertile age is of concern.Healthy, never-pregnant women aged 18 to 40 years (n = 158) were recruited between June 2012 and March 2015 in Bergen, Norway. Clinical data were collected and non-fasting venous blood samples were analyzed for whole blood Hg, Pb and Cd and serum Sb by ICP-MS and related to diet and life style factors.In a multiple linear regression model, increasing age was associated with higher levels of Hg and Sb, but diet and life style factors were more important predictors. Median whole blood Hg was increased by a factor of 70 in women who had fish for dinner ≥1/week, compared to women who rarely or never ate fish (p<0.001). Alcohol intake was the strongest predictor for whole blood Pb, while use of tobacco was the strongest predictor for whole blood Cd. Being a vegetarian was associated with lower levels of both Hg and Sb.As toxic trace elements tend to bioaccumulate in the body, increasing maternal age at delivery may represent a threat to the next generation. In a group of healthy Norwegian never-pregnant women, age contributed to Hg and Sb levels, but diet and life style factors were stronger determinants of whole blood Hg, Pb, Cd and serum Sb levels. Continuous public actions are needed to reduce modifiable and preventable sources of potentially deleterious toxins to minimize the exposure in children and fertile women."
https://openalex.org/W2774818812,"Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine derivative with antiplatelet activity, is widely prescribed for patients with cardiovascular diseases. In addition to antiplatelet activity, antiplatelet agents possess anticancer and antimetastatic properties. Contrary to this, results of some studies have suggested that the use of clopidogrel and other thienopyridines accelerates the progression of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel and various anticancer agents as a combined treatment using mouse models of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Metastatic dissemination, selected parameters of platelet morphology and biochemistry, as well as angiogenesis were assessed. In addition, body weight, blood morphology, and biochemistry were evaluated to test toxicity of the studied compounds. According to the results, clopidogrel increased antitumor and/or antimetastatic activity of chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone, whereas it decreased the anticancer activity of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and tamoxifen. The mechanisms of such divergent activities may be based on the modulation of tumor vasculature via factors, such as transforming growth factor β1 released from platelets. Moreover, clopidogrel increased the toxicity of docetaxel and protected against mitoxantrone-induced toxicity, which may be due to the modulation of hepatic enzymes and protection of the vasculature, respectively. These results demonstrate that antiplatelet agents can be useful but also dangerous in anticancer treatment and therefore use of thienopyridines in patients undergoing chemotherapy should be carefully evaluated."

The analysis results are applied to the leader selection strategy, and make algorithm avoid trapping in local optimum. Moreover, a clustering solution-improved method is proposed, which can increase the efficiency in searching clustering solution greatly.

https://openalex.org/W2771169669,"Cell adhesion and apicobasal polarity together maintain epithelial tissue organization and homeostasis. Loss of adhesion has been described as a prerequisite for the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. However, what role misregulation of apicobasal polarity promotes tumor initiation and/or early progression remains unclear. We find that human low-grade endometrial cancers are associated with disrupted localization of the apical polarity protein Par3 and Ezrin while, the adhesion molecule E-cadherin remains unchanged, accompanied by decreased Notch signaling, and altered Notch receptor localization. Depletion of Par3 or Ezrin, in a cell-based model, results in loss of epithelial architecture, differentiation, increased proliferation, migration and decreased Notch signaling. Re-expression of Par3 in endometrial cancer cell lines with disrupted Par3 protein levels blocks proliferation and reduces migration in a Notch dependent manner. These data uncover a function for apicobasal polarity independent of cell adhesion in regulating Notch-mediated differentiation signals in endometrial epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2773388475,"The association between the 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) level and clinical remission in Crohn’s disease (CD) remains controversial. Thiopurine-induced leukopenia is a life-threatening complication of CD in Asians that was recently shown to strongly correlate with NUDT15 genetic variants. This study aimed to determine the relationship between thiopurine metabolite levels and therapeutic response, and to investigate the association of NUDT15, TPMT, and thiopurine metabolites with leukopenia in patients with CD. We enrolled 165 adult patients with CD undergoing thiopurine treatment. Clinical evaluation and laboratory examinations were carried out every 2–3 months. We measured thiopurine metabolites levels and genotyped NUDT15 and TPMT. During the median 12-month observational period, 95 (67.9%) patients exhibited clinical response and 45 (32.1%) did not respond to the treatment. The median 6-TGN level was significantly higher in responders than in non-responders (P < 0.001). The odds ratio of patients with a 6-TGN level ≥230 pmol/8 × 108 red blood cells for showing a clinical response was 4.63 (95% CI 1.62–11.9). NUDT15 variant types were strongly associated with developing leukopenia. Patients with NUDT15 homozygous variant genotype developed severe early leukopenia with an average reduction of 88.2% (range, 84–94%) from the baseline white blood cell count at 4 weeks. Our findings support the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in thiopurine maintenance treatment to optimize thiopurine therapy, especially, for non-responding CD patients. Thiopurine treatment should not be recommended to patients with NUDT15 homozygous variant genotype due to severe early leukopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2773789320,"Background The correlation between low socioeconomic status (SES) and poor health outcome or higher risk of disease has been consistently reported by many epidemiological studies across various race/ancestry groups. However, the biological mechanisms linking low SES to disease and/or disease risk factors are not well understood and remain relatively under-studied. The analysis of the blood transcriptome is a promising window for elucidating how social and environmental factors influence the molecular networks governing health and disease. To further define the mechanistic pathways between social determinants and health, this study examined the impact of SES on the blood transcriptome in a sample of African-Americans. Methods An integrative approach leveraging three complementary methods (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis, Random Forest and Differential Expression) was adopted to identify the most predictive and robust transcriptome pathways associated with SES. We analyzed the expression of 15079 genes (RNA-seq) from whole blood across 36 samples. Results The results revealed a cluster of 141 co-expressed genes over-expressed in the low SES group. Three pro-inflammatory pathways (IL-8 Signaling, NF-κB Signaling and Dendritic Cell Maturation) are activated in this module and over-expressed in low SES. Random Forest analysis revealed 55 of the 141 genes that, collectively, predict SES with an area under the curve of 0.85. One third of the 141 genes are significantly over-expressed in the low SES group. Conclusion Lower SES has consistently been linked to many social and environmental conditions acting as stressors and known to be correlated with vulnerability to chronic illnesses (e.g. asthma, diabetes) associated with a chronic inflammatory state. Our unbiased analysis of the blood transcriptome in African-Americans revealed evidence of a robust molecular signature of increased inflammation associated with low SES. The results provide a plausible link between the social factors and chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2950002025,"Mounting evidence indicates that early-life exposure to particulate air pollutants pose threats to children’s cognitive development, but studies about the neurotoxic effects associated with exposures during adolescence remain unclear. We examined whether exposure to ambient fine particles (PM2.5) at residential locations affects intelligence quotient (IQ) during pre-/early- adolescence (ages 9–11) and emerging adulthood (ages 18–20) in a demographically-diverse population (N = 1,360) residing in Southern California. Increased ambient PM2.5 levels were associated with decreased IQ scores. This association was more evident for Performance IQ (PIQ), but less for Verbal IQ, assessed by the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. For each inter-quartile (7.73 μg/m3) increase in one-year PM2.5 preceding each assessment, the average PIQ score decreased by 3.08 points (95% confidence interval = [-6.04, -0.12]) accounting for within-family/within-individual correlations, demographic characteristics, family socioeconomic status (SES), parents’ cognitive abilities, neighborhood characteristics, and other spatial confounders. The adverse effect was 150% greater in low SES families and 89% stronger in males, compared to their counterparts. Better understanding of the social disparities and sexual dimorphism in the adverse PM2.5–IQ effects may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms and shed light on prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2771425880,"Watching TV has been consistently associated with higher risk of adverse health outcomes, but the effect of other sedentary behaviors (SB) is uncertain. Potential explanations are that watching TV is not a marker of a broader sedentary pattern and that each SB reflects different sociodemographic and health characteristics. Data were taken form a survey on 10,199 individuals, representative of the Spanish population aged ≥18 years. SB and other health behaviors were ascertained using validated questionnaires. Watching TV was the predominant SB (45.4% of the total sitting time), followed by sitting at the computer (22.7%). TV watching time showed no correlation with total time on other SB (r: -0.02, p = 0.07). By contrast, time spent at the computer was directly correlated with time spent on commuting (r: 0.07, p<0.01), listening to music (r: 0.10, p<0.01) and reading (r: 0.08, p<0.01). TV watching time was greater in those with older age, lower education, unhealthier lifestyle, and with diabetes or osteomuscular disease. More time spent at the computer or in commuting was linked to younger age, male gender, higher education and having a sedentary job. In conclusion, watching TV is not correlated with other SB and shows a distinct demographic and lifestyle profile."
https://openalex.org/W2774684863,"Recently, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing that a 6-month 130g/day low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) reduced HbA1c and BMI more than a calorie restricted diet (CRD). [1] To assess whether the benefits of the LCD persisted after the intensive intervention, we compared HbA1c and BMI between the LCD and CRD groups at 1 year after the end of the 6-month RCT.Following the end of the 6-month RCT, patients were allowed to manage their own diets with periodic outpatient visits. One year later, we analyzed clinical and nutrition data.Of the 66 participants in the original study, 27 in the CRD group and 22 in the LCD group completed this trial. One year after the end of the original RCT, the carbohydrate intake was comparable between the groups (215 [189-243]/day in the CRD group and 214 (176-262) g/day in the LCD group). Compared with the baseline data, HbA1c and BMI were decreased in both groups (CRD: HbA1c -0.4 [-0.9 to 0.3] % and BMI -0.63 [-1.20 to 0.18] kg/m2; LCD: HbA1c -0.35 [-1.0 to 0.35] % and BMI -0.77 [-1.15 to -0.12] kg/m2). There were no significant differences in HbA1c and BMI between the groups.One year after the diet therapy intervention, the beneficial effect of the LCD on reduction of HbA1c and BMI did not persist in comparison with CRD. However, combining the data of both groups, significant improvements in HbA1c and BMI from baseline were observed. Although the superiority of the LCD disappeared 1 year after the intensive intervention, these data suggest that well-constructed nutrition therapy programs, both CRD and LCD, were equally effective in improving HbA1c for at least 1 year.University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) ID000010663."

We aimed to implement and validate a composite intervention of a stroke team algorithm and simulation-based stroke team training as an effective quality initiative in our regional interdisciplinary neurovascular network consisting of 7 stroke units.We recorded door-to-needle times of all consecutive stroke patients receiving thrombolysis at seven stroke units for 3 months before and after a 2 month intervention which included setting up a team-based stroke workflow at each stroke unit, a train-the-trainer seminar for stroke team simulation training and a stroke team simulation training session at each hospital as well as a recommendation to take up regular stroke team trainings.The intervention reduced the network-wide median door-to-needle time by 12 minutes from 43,0 (IQR 29,8-60,0, n = 122) to 31,0 (IQR 24,0-42,0, n = 112) minutes (p < 0.001) and substantially increased the share of patients receiving thrombolysis within 30 minutes of hospital arrival from 41.5% to 59.6% (p < 0.001). Stroke team training participants stated a significant increase in knowledge on the topic of acute stroke care and in the perception of patient safety. The overall course concept was regarded as highly useful by most participants from different professional backgrounds.The composite intervention of a binding team-based algorithm and stroke team simulation training showed to be well-transferable in our regional stroke network.

https://openalex.org/W2775590454,"Metallothioneins (MT) constitute a superfamily of small cytosolic proteins that are able to bind metal cations through numerous cysteine (Cys) residues. Like other organisms the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila presents several MT isoforms, which have been classified into two subfamilies (Cd- and Cu-metallothioneins). The main aim of this study was to examine the specific functions and transcriptional regulation of the five MT isoforms present in T. thermophila, by using several strains of this ciliate. After a laboratory evolution experiment over more than two years, three different T. thermophila strains adapted to extreme metal stress (Cd2+, Cu2+ or Pb2+) were obtained. In addition, three knockout and/or knockdown strains for different metallothionein (MT) genes were generated. These strains were then analyzed for expression of the individual MT isoforms. Our results provide a strong basis for assigning differential roles to the set of MT isoforms. MTT1 appears to have a key role in adaptation to Cd. In contrast, MTT2/4 are crucial for Cu-adaptation and MTT5 appears to be important for Pb-adaptation and might be considered as an “alarm” MT gene for responding to metal stress. Moreover, results indicate that likely a coordinated transcriptional regulation exists between the MT genes, particularly among MTT1, MTT5 and MTT2/4. MTT5 appears to be an essential gene, a first such report in any organism of an essential MT gene."
https://openalex.org/W2773480243,"Objectives To estimate the prevalence and risk factors for abnormal liver enzymes in a large age- and gender stratified population-based sample of apparently healthy individuals with or without alcohol consumption and other health-related risk factors (adiposity, physical inactivity, smoking). Methods Data on alcohol use, smoking, diet and physical activity were recorded using structured questionnaires from 13,976 subjects (6513 men, 7463 women, aged 25–74 years) in the national FINRISK studies. Alcohol data was used to categorize the participants into abstainers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers. Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities were measured using standard kinetic methods. Results Male light drinkers, moderate drinkers and heavy drinkers showed significantly higher relative risks of abnormal GGT than abstainers: 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.71, p < 0.01), 2.72 (2.08 to 3.56, p < 0.0005), and 6.10 (4.55 to 7.17, p < 0.0005), respectively. Corresponding values for women were 1.22 (0.99 to 1.51, p = 0.065), 1.90 (1.44 to 2.51, p < 0.0005), and 5.91 (3.80 to 9.17, p < 0.0005). Estimated threshold doses for a significant GGT elevation was 14 standard weekly alcohol doses for men and 7 for women. Excess body weight and age over 40 years modulated the thresholds towards smaller quantities of alcohol. The risk of abnormal GGT was also significantly influenced by physical inactivity and smoking. The relative risks of abnormal ALT activities were increased in male heavy drinkers, especially in those presenting with adiposity and sedentary lifestyle. Conclusions Alcohol use markedly increases the risk for abnormal liver enzyme activities in those presenting with age over 40 years, obesity, smoking or sedentary lifestyle. The data should be considered in public health recommendations and in the definitions of safe limits of alcohol use."
https://openalex.org/W2772687904,"A variety of bacteria have been used as agents and vectors for antineoplastic therapy. A series of mechanisms, including native bacterial toxicity, sensitization of the immune system and competition for nutrients, may contribute to antitumor effects. However, the antitumor effects of Proteus species have been minimally studied, and it is not clear if bacteria can alter tumor hypoxia as a component of their antineoplastic effect. In the present study, Proteus mirabilis bacteria were evaluated for the ability to proliferate and accumulate in murine tumors after intravenous injection. To further investigate the efficacy and safety of bacterial injection, mice bearing 4T1 tumors were treated with an intravenous dose of 5×107 CFU Proteus mirabilis bacteria via the tail vein weekly for three treatments. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western analysis were then performed on excised tumors. The results suggested Proteus mirabilis localized preferentially to tumor tissues and remarkably suppressed the growth of primary breast cancer and pulmonary metastasis in murine 4T1 models. Results showed that the expression of NKp46 and CD11c was significantly increased after bacteria treatment. Furthermore, tumor expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), surrogates for hypoxia, was significantly lower in the treated group than the control group mice as assessed by IHC and western analysis. These findings demonstrated that Proteus mirabilis may a promising bacterial strain for used against primary tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, and the immune system and reduction of tumor hypoxia may contribute to the antineoplastic and antimetastatic effects observed."
https://openalex.org/W2774048336,"Using 15 years of data from a stable population of wild Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber), we examine how annual and lifetime access to food resources affect individual age-related changes in reproduction and somatic condition. We found an age-related decline in annual maternal reproductive output, after a peak at age 5–6. Rainfall, an established negative proxy of annual resource availability for beavers, was consistently associated with lower reproductive output for females of all ages. In contrast, breeding territory quality, as a measure of local resource history over reproductive lifetimes, caused differences in individual patterns of reproductive senescence; animals from lower quality territories senesced when younger. Litter size was unrelated to maternal age, although adult body weight increased with age. In terms of resource effects, in poorer years but not in better years, older mothers produced larger offspring than did younger mothers, giving support to the constraint theory. Overall, our findings exemplify state-dependent life-history strategies, supporting an effect of resources on reproductive senescence, where cumulative differences in resource access, and not just reproductive strategy, mediate long-term reproductive trade-offs, consistent with the disposable soma and reproductive restraint theories. We propose that flexible life-history schedules could play a role in the dynamics of populations exhibiting reproductive skew, with earlier breeding opportunities leading to an earlier senescence schedule through resource dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2774924282,"The composition of the bacterial communities in the hindgut contents of Lampetrs japonica was surveyed by Illumina MiSeq of the 16S rRNA gene. An average of 32385 optimized reads was obtained from three samples. The rarefaction curve based on the operational taxonomic units tended to approach the asymptote. The rank abundance curve representing the species richness and evenness was calculated. The composition of microbe in six classification levels was also analyzed. Top 20 members in genera level were displayed as the classification tree. The abundance of microorganisms in different individuals was displayed as the pie charts at the branch nodes in the classification tree. The differences of top 50 genera in abundance between individuals of lamprey are displayed as a heatmap. The pairwise comparison of bacterial taxa abundance revealed that there are no significant differences of gut microbiota between three individuals of lamprey at a given rarefied depth. Also, the gut microbiota derived from L. japonica displays little similarity with other aquatic organism of Vertebrata after UPGMA analysis. The metabolic function of the bacterial communities was predicted through KEGG analysis. This study represents the first analysis of the bacterial community composition in the gut content of L. japonica. The investigation of the gut microbiota associated with L. japonica will broaden our understanding of this unique organism."
https://openalex.org/W2774956633,"Caveolin-3 (CAV3) protein is known to be expressed specifically in various myocytes, but its physiological function remains unclear. CAV3, located at the cell membrane, may promote the sensitivity of the Akt signaling pathway, which is closely related to glucose metabolism and to cell growth and proliferation.The CAV3 gene was stably transfected into C2C12 muscle cells, and the effects were evaluated by biochemical assays, WB and confocal microscopy for the observation of cellular glucose metabolism, growth and proliferation, and the effect of CAV3 on the Akt signaling pathway with no insulin stimulation.After C2C12 cells were transfected with the mouse CAV3 gene, which increased CAV3 expression, the abundance of the CAV3 and GLUT4 proteins on the cell membrane increased, but the total GLUT4 protein content of the cell was unchanged. Glucose uptake was increased, and this did not affect the glycogen synthesis, but the cell surface area and cell proliferation increased. While there were significant increases in p-Akt and p-p70s6K, which is a downstream component of Akt signaling, the level of GSK3β protein, another component of Akt signaling did not change.The muscle, CAV3 protein can activate Akt signaling, increase GLUT4 protein localization in the cell membrane, increase glucose uptake, and promote myocyte growth and proliferation. CAV3 protein has a physiological role in glycometabolism, growth and proliferation, independent of insulin stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2771959605,"Introduction King’s College Hospital criteria are currently used to select liver transplant candidates in acetaminophen-related acute liver failure (ALF). Although widely accepted, they show a poor sensitivity in predicting pre-transplant mortality and cannot predict the outcome after surgery. In this study we aimed to develop a new prognostic score that can allow patient selection for liver transplantation more appropriately and identify patients at high risk of futile transplantation. Methods We analysed consecutive patients admitted to the Royal Free and Beaujon Hospitals between 1990 and 2015. Clinical and laboratory data at admission were collected. Predictors of 3-month mortality in the non-transplanted patients admitted to the Royal Free Hospital were used to develop the new score, which was then validated against the Beaujon cohort. The Beaujon-transplanted group was also used to assess the ability of the new score in identifying patients at high risk of transplant futility. Results 152 patients were included of who 44 were transplanted. SOFA, CLIF-C OF and CLIF-ACLF scores were the best predictors of 3-month mortality among non-transplanted patients. CLIF-C OF score and high dosages of norepinephrine requirement were the only significant predictors of 3-month mortality in the non-transplanted patients, and therefore were included in the ALF-OFs score. In non-transplanted patients, ALF-OFs showed good performance in both exploratory (AUC = 0.89; sensitivity = 82.6%; specificity = 89.5%) and the validation cohort (AUC = 0.988; sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 92.3%). ALF-OFs score was also able to identify patients at high risk of transplant futility (AUC = 0.917; sensitivity = 100%; specificity = 79.2%). Conclusion ALF-OFs is a new prognostic score in acetaminophen-related ALF that can predict both the need for liver transplant and high risk of transplant futility, improving candidate selection for liver transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2772216643,"The α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit is an attractive drug target for treating nicotine addiction because it is present at limited sites in the brain including the reward pathway. Lynx1 modulates several nAChR subtypes; lynx1-nAChR interaction sites could possibly provide drug targets. We found that dopaminergic cells from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) express lynx1 mRNA transcripts and, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, α6 receptors form stable complexes with lynx1 protein, although co-transfection with lynx1 did not affect nicotine-induced currents from cell lines transfected with α6 and β2. To test whether lynx1 is important for the function of α6 nAChRs in vivo, we bred transgenic mice carrying a hypersensitive mutation in the α6 nAChR subunit (α6L9′S) with lynx1 knockout mice, providing a selective probe of the effects of lynx1 on α6* nAChRs. Lynx1 removal reduced the α6 component of nicotine-mediated rubidium efflux and dopamine (DA) release from synaptosomal preparations with no effect on numbers of α6β2 binding sites, indicating that lynx1 is functionally important for α6* nAChR activity. No effects of lynx1 removal were detected on nicotine-induced currents in slices from SNc, suggesting that lynx1 affects presynaptic α6* nAChR function more than somatic function. In the absence of agonist, lynx1 removal did not alter DA release in dorsal striatum as measured by fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Lynx1 removal affected some behaviors, including a novel-environment assay and nicotine-stimulated locomotion. Trends in 24-hour home-cage behavior were also suggestive of an effect of lynx1 removal. Conditioned place preference for nicotine was not affected by lynx1 removal. The results show that some functional and behavioral aspects of α6-nAChRs are modulated by lynx1."
https://openalex.org/W2772535855,"The Z-disc is a crucial structure of the sarcomere and is implicated in mechanosensation/transduction. Dysregulation of Z-disc proteins often result in cardiomyopathy. We have previously shown that the Z-disc protein Cytoskeletal Heart-enriched Actin-associated Protein (CHAP) is essential for cardiac and skeletal muscle development. Furthermore, the CHAP gene has been associated with atrial fibrillation in humans. Here, we studied the misregulated expression of CHAP isoforms in heart disease.Mice that underwent transverse aortic constriction and calcineurin transgenic (Tg) mice, both models of experimental heart failure, displayed a significant increase in cardiac expression of fetal isoform CHAPb. To investigate whether increased expression of CHAPb postnatally is sufficient to induce cardiomyopathy, we generated CHAPb Tg mice under the control of the cardiac-specific αMHC promoter. CHAPb Tg mice displayed cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and enlargement of the left atrium at three months, which was more pronounced at the age of six months. Hypertrophy and fibrosis were confirmed by evidence of activation of the hypertrophic gene program (Nppa, Nppb, Myh7) and increased collagen expression, respectively. Connexin40 and 43 were downregulated in the left atrium, which was associated with delayed atrioventricular conduction. Tg hearts displayed both systolic and diastolic dysfunction partly caused by impaired sarcomere function evident from a reduced force generating capacity of single cardiomyocytes. This co-incided with activation of the actin signalling pathway leading to the formation of stress fibers.This study demonstrated that the fetal isoform CHAPb initiates progression towards cardiac hypertrophy, which is accompanied by delayed atrioventricular conduction and diastolic dysfunction. Moreover, CHAP may be a novel therapeutic target or candidate gene for screening in cardiomyopathies and atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2773621706,"An improved hierarchical fuzzy inference method based on C-measure map-matching algorithm is proposed in this paper, in which the C-measure represents the certainty or probability of the vehicle traveling on the actual road. A strategy is firstly introduced to use historical positioning information to employ curve-curve matching between vehicle trajectories and shapes of candidate roads. It improves matching performance by overcoming the disadvantage of traditional map-matching algorithm only considering current information. An average historical distance is used to measure similarity between vehicle trajectories and road shape. The input of system includes three variables: distance between position point and candidate roads, angle between driving heading and road direction, and average distance. As the number of fuzzy rules will increase exponentially when adding average distance as a variable, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system is then applied to reduce fuzzy rules and improve the calculation efficiency. Additionally, a learning process is updated to support the algorithm. Finally, a case study contains four different routes in Beijing city is used to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2775451099,"Background The study aims to analyse the action of zingerone in diabetes-related cardiac arrhythmias. Methods Diabetes was induced by streptozocin while treatment groups received 20 mg/kg zingerone daily. Following extra seven weeks, electrocardiography, extraction of blood, urine and heart for biochemical analysis, histopathology and immunofluorescence were undertaken. Results The suppression of QT and QTc prolongation in diabetic rats was indicative of prolonged cardiac repolarisation that was greatly reduced by zingerone treatment. In addition, the reduction in PR interval attested that zingerone improved AV delay in diabetic rats. The fibrogenic transforming growth factor β1 upregulation in diabetic hearts was suppressed by zingerone. The marked glycogen deposition and muscle degeneration seen in diabetic heart sections were also alleviated by zingerone. Furthermore, zingerone prevented the decrease in of the serum anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin in diabetics. The heightened levels of oxidative stress markers 8-isoprostane and uric acid in diabetic rats were suppressed. In the diabetic heart, the reduced catalase activity was improved and the excessive expression of angiotensin receptor 1 was inhibited by zingerone. Conclusion Cardiac delayed repolarisation and AV conduction in rats with diabetes were halted by zingerone. It appears that inhibition of cardiac fibrosis and associated inflammation-oxidative stress signalling underpins the zingerone effect."
https://openalex.org/W2773106145,"Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is a common cause of vasculopathy due to direct endothelial damage (such as post-coronary revascularization) or indirect injury (such as chronic kidney disease, or CKD). Although the attenuation of coronary revascularization-induced IH (direct-vascular-injury-induced IH) by cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has been demonstrated, our understanding of the effect on CKD-induced IH (indirect-vascular-injury-induced IH) is limited. Herein, we tested if cilostazol attenuated CKD-induced IH in a mouse model of ischemic-reperfusion injury with unilateral nephrectomy (Chr I/R), a normotensive non-proteinuria CKD model. Cilostazol (50 mg/kg/day) or placebo was orally administered once daily from 1-week post-nephrectomy. At 20 weeks, cilostazol significantly attenuated aortic IH as demonstrated by a 34% reduction in the total intima area with 50% and 47% decreases in the ratios of tunica intima area/tunica media area and tunica intima area/(tunica intima + tunica media area), respectively. The diameters of aorta and renal function were unchanged by cilostazol. Interestingly, cilostazol decreased miR-221, but enhanced miR-143 and miR-145 in either in vitro or aortic tissue, as well as attenuated several pro-inflammatory mediators, including asymmetrical dimethylarginine, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, vascular endothelial growth factor in aorta and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). We demonstrated a proof of concept of the effectiveness of cilostazol in attenuating IH in a Chr I/R mouse model, a CKD model with predominantly indirect-vascular-injury-induced IH. These considerations warrant further investigation to develop a new primary prevention strategy for CKD-related IH."
https://openalex.org/W2772696358,"Introduction People with complex wounds are more likely to be elderly, living with multimorbidity and wound related symptoms. A variety of products are available for managing complex wounds and a range of healthcare professionals are involved in wound care, yet there is a lack of good evidence to guide practice and services. These factors create uncertainty for those who deliver and those who manage wound care. Formal priority setting for research and implementation topics is needed to more accurately target the gaps in treatment and services. We solicited practitioner and manager uncertainties in wound care and held a priority setting workshop to facilitate a collaborative approach to prioritising wound care-related uncertainties. Methods We recruited healthcare professionals who regularly cared for patients with complex wounds, were wound care specialists or managed wound care services. Participants submitted up to five wound care uncertainties in consultation with their colleagues, via an on-line survey and attended a priority setting workshop. Submitted uncertainties were collated, sorted and categorised according professional group. On the day of the workshop, participants were divided into four groups depending on their profession. Uncertainties submitted by their professional group were viewed, discussed and amended, prior to the first of three individual voting rounds. Participants cast up to ten votes for the uncertainties they judged as being high priority. Continuing in the professional groups, the top 10 uncertainties from each group were displayed, and the process was repeated. Groups were then brought together for a plenary session in which the final priorities were individually scored on a scale of 0–10 by participants. Priorities were ranked and results presented. Nominal group technique was used for generating the final uncertainties, voting and discussions. Results Thirty-three participants attended the workshop comprising; 10 specialist nurses, 10 district nurses, seven podiatrists and six managers. Participants had been qualified for a mean of 20.7 years with a mean of 16.8 years of wound care experience. One hundred and thirty-nine uncertainties were submitted electronically and a further 20 were identified on the day of the workshop following lively, interactive group discussions. Twenty-five uncertainties from the total of 159 generated made it to the final prioritised list. These included six of the 20 new uncertainties. The uncertainties varied in focus, but could be broadly categorised into three themes: service delivery and organisation, patient centred care and treatment options. Specialist nurses were more likely to vote for service delivery and organisation topics, podiatrists for patient centred topics, district nurses for treatment options and operational leads for a broad range. Conclusions This collaborative priority setting project is the first to engage front-line clinicians in prioritising research and implementation topics in wound care. We have shown that it is feasible to conduct topic prioritisation in a short time frame. This project has demonstrated that with careful planning and rigor, important questions that are raised in the course of clinicians’ daily decision making can be translated into meaningful research and implementation initiatives that could make a difference to service delivery and patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2773748668,"Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a powerful non-invasive technique for imaging applications. The goal is to estimate the electrical properties of living tissues by measuring the potential at the boundary of the domain. Being safe with respect to patient health, non-invasive, and having no known hazards, EIT is an attractive and promising technology. However, it suffers from a particular technical difficulty, which consists of solving a nonlinear inverse problem in real time. Several nonlinear approaches have been proposed as a replacement for the linear solver, but in practice very few are capable of stable, high-quality, and real-time EIT imaging because of their very low robustness to errors and inaccurate modeling, or because they require considerable computational effort.In this paper, a post-processing technique based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to obtain a nonlinear solution to the inverse problem, starting from a linear solution. While common reconstruction methods based on ANNs estimate the solution directly from the measured data, the method proposed here enhances the solution obtained from a linear solver.Applying a linear reconstruction algorithm before applying an ANN reduces the effects of noise and modeling errors. Hence, this approach significantly reduces the error associated with solving 2D inverse problems using machine-learning-based algorithms.This work presents radical enhancements in the stability of nonlinear methods for biomedical EIT applications."
https://openalex.org/W2771236827,"Interleukin (IL)-26 is released in response to bacterial endotoxin (LPS) in the bronchoalveolar space of humans in vivo and it may potentiate neutrophil chemotaxis by enhanced IL-26 receptor stimulation. However, the effects of extracellular IL-26 protein on the innate immune response in the lungs in vivo remain unknown. Here, we characterized these effects of IL-26 on a wide range of aspects of the innate immune response to LPS in different compartments of the lungs in vivo over time. We administrated recombinant human (rh) IL-26 protein in the bronchoalveolar space using intranasal instillation in a mouse in vivo model, with and without prior instillation of LPS. We verified gene expression of the IL-26 receptor complex in mouse lungs and observed that, after instillation of LPS, rhIL-26 increases the phosphorylation of STAT3, a signaling molecule of the IL-26 receptor complex. We also observed that rhIL-26 exerted additional stimulatory and inhibitory actions that are compartment- and time-dependent, resulting in alterations of cytokines, proteinases, tissue inflammation and the accumulation of innate effector cells. Without the prior instillation of LPS, rhIL-26 exerted time-dependent effects on total gelatinase activity but few other effects. Most important, after instillation of LPS, rhIL-26 cleared inflammatory cells from local tissue and increased the accumulation of innate effector cells in the bronchoalveolar space. Tentatively, rhIL-26 may facilitate the innate immune response towards the bronchoalveolar space in vivo and represents a potential target for therapy in lung disorders involving the innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2401425312,"The G-protein beta subunit 3 (GNB3) gene has been implicated in obesity risk; however, the molecular mechanism of GNB3-related disease is unknown. GNB3 duplication is responsible for a syndromic form of childhood obesity, and an activating DNA sequence variant (C825T) in GNB3 is also associated with obesity. To test the hypothesis that GNB3 overexpression causes obesity, we created bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice that carry an extra copy of the human GNB3 risk allele. Here we show that GNB3-T/+ mice have increased adiposity, but not greater food intake or a defect in satiety. GNB3-T/+ mice have elevated fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide, as well as glucose intolerance, indicating type 2 diabetes. Fasting plasma leptin, triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids are elevated, suggesting metabolic syndrome. Based on a battery of behavioral tests, GNB3-T/+ mice did not exhibit anxiety- or depressive-like phenotypes. GNB3-T/+ and wild-type animals have similar activity levels and heat production; however, GNB3-T/+ mice exhibit dysregulation of acute thermogenesis. Finally, Ucp1 expression is significantly lower in white adipose tissue (WAT) in GNB3-T/+ mice, suggestive of WAT remodeling that could lead to impaired cellular thermogenesis. Taken together, our study provides the first functional link between GNB3 and obesity, and presents insight into novel pathways that could be applied to combat obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2771497457,"Triggers of the autoimmune response that leads to type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain poorly understood. A possibility is that parallel changes in both T cells and target cells provoke autoimmune attack. We previously documented greater Ca2+ transients in fibroblasts from T1D subjects than non-T1D after exposure to fatty acids (FA) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). These data indicate that metabolic and signal transduction defects present in T1D can be elicited ex vivo in isolated cells. Changes that precede T1D, including inflammation, may activate atypical responses in people that are genetically predisposed to T1D. To identify such cellular differences in T1D, we quantified a panel of metabolic responses in fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) from age-matched T1D and non-T1D subjects, as models for non-immune and immune cells, respectively. Fibroblasts from T1D subjects accumulated more lipid, had higher LC-CoA levels and converted more FA to CO2, with less mitochondrial proton leak in response to oleate alone or with TNFα, using the latter as a model of inflammation. T1D-PBMCs contained and also accumulated more lipid following FA exposure. In addition, they formed more peroxidized lipid than controls following FA exposure. We conclude that both immune and non-immune cells in T1D subjects differ from controls in terms of responses to FA and TNFα. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity to inflammatory insults and FA that may precede and contribute to T1D by priming both immune cells and their targets for autoimmune reactions."

These broad interests warrant careful descriptions of the senses of dogs. Still there is little known about dog vision, especially what dogs can discriminate in different light conditions. We trained and tested whippets, pugs, and a Shetland sheepdog in a two-choice discrimination set-up and show that dogs can discriminate patterns with spatial frequencies between 5.5 and 19.5 cycle per degree (cpd) in the bright light condition (43 cd m-2). This is a higher spatial resolution than has been previously reported although the individual variation in our tests was large. Humans tested in the same set-up reached acuities corresponding to earlier studies, ranging between 32.1 and 44.2 cpd. In the dim light condition (0.0087 cd m-2) the acuity of dogs ranged between 1.8 and 3.5 cpd while in humans, between 5.9 and 9.9 cpd. Thus, humans make visual discrimination of objects from roughly a threefold distance compared to dogs in both bright and dim light."
https://openalex.org/W2771572701,"Objectives Liquid biopsy technologies allow non-invasive tumor profiling for patients with solid tumor malignancies by sequencing circulating tumor DNA. These studies may be useful in risk-stratification, monitoring for relapse, and understanding tumor evolution. The quality of DNA obtained for these studies is improved when blood samples are collected in tubes that stabilizing white blood cells (WBC). However, ongoing germline research in pediatric oncology generally requires obtaining blood samples in EDTA tubes, which do not contain a WBC-stabilizing preservative. In this study, we explored whether blood samples collected in WBC-stabilizing tubes could be used for both liquid biopsy and germline studies simultaneously, minimizing blood collection volumes for pediatric patients. Methods Blood was simultaneously collected from three patients in both EDTA and Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT® tubes. Germline DNA was extracted from all blood samples and subjected to whole-exome sequencing and microarray profiling. Results Quality control metrics of DNA quality, sequencing library preperation and whole-exome sequencing alignment were virtually identical regardless of the sample collection method. There was no discernable difference in patterns of variant calling for paired samples by either whole-exome sequencing or microarray analysis. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that high-quality genomic studies may be performed from germline DNA obtained in Streck tubes. Therefore, these tubes may be used to simultaneously obtain samples for both liquid biopsy and germline studies in pediatric patients when the volume of blood available for research studies may be limited."

Here, with the aim of better understanding the substrate specificity determinants in this subfamily, we have characterised the enzymatic activity and the crystal structure of NucT, a nuclease implicated in Helicobacter pylori purine salvage and natural transformation and compared them to those of its bacterial and mammalian homologues. NucT exhibits an endonuclease activity with a strong preference for single stranded nucleic acids substrates. We identified histidine124 as essential for the catalytic activity of the protein. Comparison of the NucT crystal structure at 1.58 Å resolution reported here with those of other members of the sub-family suggests that the specificity of NucT for single-stranded nucleic acids is provided by the width of a positively charged groove giving access to the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2772207619,"We recently demonstrated that the adult human kidney cortex contains a perivascular stromal cell (kPSC) that shows organotypic properties and is important for repair and stabilisation of kidney function. Not only the kidney cortex but also the kidney capsule contains stromal cells that are important for the three dimensional organisation of the kidney during nephrogenesis. They provide the barrier function of the capsule which is critical for homeostatic processes such as pressure natriuresis. We postulated that stromal cells derived from the kidney capsule may therefore also have specific properties and functions. To this end, we isolated these capsule mesenchymal stromal cells (cMSC) from human cadaveric kidneys that were not suitable for transplantation. There were several similarities between cMSCs and kPSCs including support of vascular plexus formation, phenotypic marker expression and resistance against myofibroblast transformation. However, compared to kPSCs, cMSCs showed distinct mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, showed increased immunosuppressive capacity, and displayed strongly reduced HGF production, contributing to the inability to enhance kidney epithelial repair. Therefore cMSCs are a distinct, novel human kidney-derived MSC-population and these data underpin the large functional diversity of phenotypic similar stromal cells in relation to their anatomic site, even within one organ."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of ALDH2 polymorphism as a prognostic factor for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) among Japanese population. Methods We analyzed 82 Japanese patients with OPC treated between 2006 and 2011. The median observation period was 50 months. P16-staining and ALDH2 polymorphisms were investigated. To examine the frequencies of second primary pharyngeal and esophageal cancers (SPPEC),37 Japanese patients with OPC treated at Tokyo University Hospital were included for statistical analysis. Results Statistically significant differences were noted in OS among sex, age, N classification, and p16 (p = 0.045, 0.024, 0.020, 0.007, respectively). In addition, OS and DSS rates of the patients with heterozygous ALDH2 tended to be worse than those of the patients with homozygous ALDH2 (p = 0.21, 0.086, respectively). Of note, OS and DSS of the patients with p16-negative OPC and heterozygous ALDH2 was significant poorer than those of the patients with p16-positive OPC (p = 0.002, 0.006, respectively), while there was no significant difference in OS and DSS between patients with p16-positive OPC and patients with p16-negative OPC and homozygous ALDH2. Conclusions ALDH2 polymorphism might be a promising prognostic factor for Japanese patients with p16-negative OPC."

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), characterized as a circulating endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, may have been implicated as an important contributing factor for the development of endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we aim to assess the predictive power of ADMA for long-term prognosis in patients with cardiac syndrome X. Methods and results We enrolled 239 consecutive patients with cardiac syndrome X diagnosed by coronary angiography. The mean age was 58.7±10.1 years. The patients were grouped into tertiles according to the plasma ADMA levels: <0.38 μmol/l (tertile I), 0.38–0.44 μmol/l (tertile II), and >0.44 μmol/l (tertile III). All patients were followed up for a mean period of 6.5±1.5 years (median: 6.3 years, inter-quartile range: 5.7–8.0 years). During the follow-up period, major adverse events (MAE) were observed in 15 patients (6.3%), including 13 deaths. The plasma ADMA levels in patients who developed MAE were significantly higher than those who did not (0.48±0.06 μmol/l vs. 0.42±0.08 μmol/l, p = 0.005). In multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, eGFR and LVEF, ADMA tertile I and II were identify to be associated with a significantly lower risk of MAE compared to ADMA tertile III (p = 0.017). By considering the plasma ADMA level as a continuous variable, the plasma ADMA level remained a significant independent predictor for outcomes of MAE, and the relative risk of MACE increased by 50% when plasma ADMA level increased by 1 SD of value (p = 0.018). Conclusions In patients with cardiac syndrome X, elevated plasma ADMA levels appeared to be an independent predictor of long-term adverse clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2775037153,"The genome of D. radiodurans harbors genes for structural and regulatory proteins of Kdp ATPase, in an operon pattern, on Mega plasmid 1. Organization of its two-component regulatory genes is unique. Here we demonstrate that both, the structural as well as regulatory components of the kdp operon of D. radiodurans are expressed quickly as the cells experience potassium limitation but are not expressed upon increase in osmolarity. The cognate DNA binding response regulator (RR) effects the expression of kdp operon during potassium deficiency through specific interaction with the kdp promoter. Deletion of the gene encoding RR protein renders the mutant D. radiodurans (ΔRR) unable to express kdp operon under potassium limitation. The ΔRR D. radiodurans displays no growth defect when grown on rich media or when exposed to oxidative or heat stress but shows reduced growth following gamma irradiation. The study elucidates the functional and regulatory aspects of the novel kdp operon of this extremophile, for the first time."

https://openalex.org/W2772350269,"Rationale and objectives Economic theory classifies an intervention as socially beneficial if the total Willingness to Pay (WTP) of those who gain exceeds the total Willingness to accept (WTA) of those who are harmed. This paper examines the differences in health system users’ valuation of a health care service in primary care setting based on the WTP and WTA perspectives, discussing the impact of personal and service variables, including risk attitudes, on these disparities. Method Six hundred and sixty two subjects who asked for care in health centres in the Region of Madrid (Spain) were interviewed, using the contingent valuation method to estimate WTP and WTA. Patient sociodemographic characteristics, health needs, satisfaction with the service and risk attitude and behaviour under risk (measured by self-reported scales and lottery games respectively) were collected. Generalised Linear Models were used to estimate the association between the explanatory variables and the WTA/WTP ratio. Results We obtained the WTA/WTP ratio for 570 subjects (mean 1.66 CI 95%: 1.53–1.79; median 1, interquartile range 1–2). People with higher education or in high social groups expressed WTA values closest to WTP. The opposite occurred in patients with the greatest health needs or who were born abroad. Self-reported expression of risk aversion appeared also related to increases in the WTA/WTP ratio. Satisfaction with the service evaluated was the most influential factor in the WTA/WTP ratio. Conclusion Health need, difficulty in obtaining substitutes and satisfaction with the service could serve for profiling people averse to loss for health care services in primary care setting. Self-reported expression of risk aversion could also be related to increases in the WTA/WTP ratio. This would mean that these characteristics should be taken into account both in the design and implementation of new healthcare interventions, as in the making decision for disinvestment."
https://openalex.org/W2773656851,"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is envisioned to offer a considerable improvement in capacity, but it has a high cost and the radio frequency (RF) chain components have a high power consumption at high frequency. To address this problem, a hybrid analog and digital precoding scheme has been studied recently, which restricts the number of RF chains to far less than the number of antenna elements. In this paper, we consider the downlink communication of a massive multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system and propose an iterative hybrid precoding algorithm to approach the capacity performance of the traditional full digital precoding scheme. We aim to attain a large baseband gain by zero-forcing (ZF) digital precoding on the equivalent channel and then minimize the total power to obtain the optimal RF precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed method can approach the performance of the conventional fully digital precoding with a low computational complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2774525475,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease of malignant plasma B-cells that infiltrate the bone marrow (BM), resulting in bone destruction, anemia, renal impairment and infections. Physiologically, the BM microenvironment is hypoxic and this promotes MM progression and contributes to resistance to chemotherapy. Since aberrant hypoxic responses may result in the selection of more aggressive tumor phenotypes, we hypothesized that targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways will be an effective anti-MM therapeutic strategy. We demonstrated that MM cells are resistant to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, and that constitutive expression of HIF2α contributed to this resistance. Since epigenetic silencing of the prolyl-hydroxylase-domain-3 (PHD3) enzyme responsible for the O2-dependent regulation of HIF2α is frequently observed in MM tumors, we asked if PHD3 plays a role in regulating sensitivity to hypoxia. We found that restoring PHD3 expression using a lentivirus vector or overcoming PHD3 epigenetic silencing using a demethyltransferase inhibitor, 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), rescued O2-dependent regulation of HIF2α and restored sensitivity of MM cells to hypoxia-mediated apoptosis. This provides a rationale for targeting the PHD3-mediated regulation of the adaptive cellular hypoxic response in MM and suggests that targeting the O2-sensing pathway, alone or in combination with other anti-myeloma chemotherapeutics, may have clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2775414458,"H1 linker histones are small basic proteins that have a key role in the formation and maintenance of higher-order chromatin structures. Additionally, many examples have shown that linker histones play an important role in gene regulation, modulated by their various subtypes and posttranslational modifications. Obtaining high amounts of very pure linker histones, especially for efficient antibody production, remains a demanding and challenging procedure. Here we present an easy and fast method to purify human linker histone H1.0 overexpressed in Escherichia coli, as well as its domains: N-terminal/globular domain and C-terminal intrinsically disordered domain. This purification protocol relies on a simple affinity chromatography step followed by cation exchange due to the highly basic properties of histone proteins. Therefore, this protocol can also be applied to other linker histones. Highly pure proteins in amounts sufficient for most biochemical experiments can be obtained. The functional quality of purified H1.0 histone and its domains has been confirmed by pull-down, gel-mobility shift assays and the nuclear import assay."
https://openalex.org/W2775503455,"The objective of this study was to describe the anatomic and histologic features of the Sapajus sp. eye, comparing similarities and differences of humans and other species of non-human primates for biomedical research purposes. Computed tomography (CT) of adnexa, eye and orbit live animal, as well as formolized pieces of the same structures of Sapajus sp. for anatomical and histological study were also performed. The anatomical description of the eye and adnexa was performed using the techniques of topographic dissection and exenteration. Histological fragments were fixated in buffered formalin 10%, processed by the routine paraffin inclusion technique, stained with hematoxylin-eosin and special stains. CT scan evaluation showed no differences between the live animal and the formolized head on identification of visual apparatus structures. Anatomic and histologic evaluation revealed rounded orbit, absence of the supraorbital foramen and frontal notch, little exposure of the sclera, with slight pigmentation of the exposed area and marked pigmentation at the sclerocorneal junction. Masson's Trichrome revealed the Meibomian glands, the corneal epithelium and Bowman's membrane; in the choroid, melanocytes and Bruch's membrane were observed; and in the retina, cones and rods as well as, optic nerve, the lamina cribrosa of the nerve fibers bundles. Toluidine blue highlighted the membranes: Bowman, Descemet and the endothelium; in the choroid: melanocytes; and in the retina: nuclear layers and retinal pigment epithelium. In view of the observed results Sapajus sp. is an important experimental model for research in the ophthalmology field, which has been shown due to the high similarity of its anatomical and histological structures with the human species."
https://openalex.org/W2773197131,"Recently, when studying folding of a SH3 domain, we discovered that the flows of transitions between protein states can be surprisingly similar to turbulent fluid flows. This similarity was not restricted by a vortex pattern of the flow fields but extended to a spatial correlation of flow fluctuations, resulting, in particular, in the structure functions such as in the Kolmogorov theory of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. Here, we undertake a detailed analysis of spatial distribution of folding flows and their similarity to turbulent fluid flows. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study folding of another benchmark system-Trp-cage miniprotein, which has different content of secondary structure elements and mechanism of folding. Calculating the probability fluxes of transitions in a three-dimensional space of collective variables, we have found that similar to the SH3 domain, the structure functions of the second and third orders correspond to the Kolmogorov functions. The spatial distributions of the probability fluxes are self-similar with a fractal dimension, and the fractal index decreases toward the native state, indicating that the flow becomes more turbulent as the native state is approached. We also show that the process of folding can be viewed as Brownian diffusion in the space of probability fluxes. The diffusion coefficient plays a role of the key parameter that defines the structures functions, similar to the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy in hydrodynamic turbulence. The obtained results, first, show that the very complex dynamics of protein folding allows a simple characterization in terms of scaling and diffusion of probability fluxes, and, secondly, they suggest that the turbulence phenomena similar to hydrodynamic turbulence are not specific of folding of a particular protein but are common to protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2772652729,"Word recognition includes the activation of a range of syntactic and semantic knowledge that is relevant to language interpretation and reference. Here we explored whether or not the number of arguments a verb takes impinges negatively on verb processing time. In this study, three experiments compared the dynamics of spoken word recognition for verbs with different preferred argument structure. Listeners' eye movements were recorded as they searched an array of pictures in response to hearing a verb. Results were similar in all the experiments. The time to identify the referent increased as a function of the number of arguments, above and beyond any effects of label appropriateness (and other controlled variables, such as letter, phoneme and syllable length, phonological neighborhood, oral and written lexical frequencies, imageability and rated age of acquisition). The findings indicate that the number of arguments a verb takes, influences referent identification during spoken word recognition. Representational complexity and amount of information generated by the lexical item that aids target identification are discussed as possible sources of this finding."
