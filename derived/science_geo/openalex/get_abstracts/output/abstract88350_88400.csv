https://openalex.org/W1519587642,"Protein S enhances the rate of Factor Va inactivation by activated Protein C (Walker, F. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5521-5524). The activity of protein S is saturable, appearing to interact stoichiometrically with activated Protein C. Diisopropylphosphate-modified activated Protein C reversed the effect of Protein S, further indicating that a Protein S-activated Protein C interaction is required for expression of the activity of Protein S. In the absence of phospholipid, Protein S had no effect on the rate of activated Protein C-catalyzed inactivation of Factor Va. The activity of Protein S was only expressed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, where it appeared to increase the affinity of the inactivation system for phospholipid. Protein S had no effect upon the rate of Factor Va inactivation in the presence of saturating levels of phospholipid vesicles. The effects of Protein S on the kinetics of Factor Va inactivation corresponded with its effect on the interaction between activated Protein C and phospholipid vesicles, measured by light scattering. In the presence of Protein S, the binding of activated Protein C to phospholipid vesicles was enhanced. Protein S had no effect upon the binding on the zymogen (Protein C to phospholipid vesicles). In conclusion, the stimulatory effect of Protein S on the inactivation of Factor Va by activated Protein C can be attributed, in part, to the enhancement of the binding of activated Protein C to phospholipid vesicles."

Chem. 256, 395-401) can be stimulated, in the absence of calmodulin, by other treatments. 1. A variety of acidic phospholipids (phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid) stimulate the Vmax and decrease the Km (Ca2+) of the isolated enzyme to the same extent as calmodulin. Unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acid) have the same effect as phospholipids but at lower concentrations. Neutral phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylethanolamine) have no effect on the enzyme. The minimal proportion of acidic phospholipids in the environment of the enzyme necessary for full stimulation is about 40%. 2. The isolated enzyme, after reconstitution in phosphatidylcholine liposomes in the absence of calmodulin, can be activated by limited proteolysis. The trypsinized enzyme has the same high Vmax and high affinity for Ca2+ of the enzyme in the presence of calmodulin."

https://openalex.org/W1608932373,"A new method for isolating transverse tubule membranes from rabbit skeletal muscle has been developed. This procedure has the advantage of being mild, fast, and producing with good yields a purified membrane fraction. The transverse tubule membranes are purified by a discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation after loading contaminating light sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with calcium phosphate in the presence of ATP. Immunofluorescence staining of cryostat sections of rabbit psoas muscle with purified goat antibodies directed against the purified membranes shows that the reacting antigens are distributed at the boundary of the A and I bands of the myofibrils where transverse tubules are localized in mammalian muscle. The purified antibodies showed no cross-reactivity with sarcoplasmic reticulum, nor did they show any fluorescence staining of the muscle plasma membrane, indicating that the isolated membranes indeed originate from the transverse tubules. The transverse tubule fraction has a characteristic protein composition distinguishable from that of sarcoplasmic reticulum, a much higher cholesterol content than that of the crude microsomes, plasma membrane, and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and a phospholipid content about twice as high as that of sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. The purified transverse tubule membrane has a distinct phospholipid composition with high contents of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. A Mg2+-activated ATPase characteristic of the transverse tubule fraction undergoes a 20-30-fold increase in specific activity during purification. The levels of Ca2+-ATPase activity present in the purified transverse tubule fraction remain comparable to those of sarcoplasmic reticulum even after extensive removal of the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1485631406,"The effect of natural activation factor and synthetic fructose-2,6-P2 on the allosteric kinetic properties of liver and muscle phosphofructokinases was investigated. Both synthetic and natural fructose-2,6-P2 show identical effects on the allosteric kinetic properties of both enzymes. Fructose-2,6-P2 counteracts inhibition by ATP and citrate and decreases the Km for fructose-6-P. This fructose ester also acts synergistically with AMP in releasing ATP inhibition. The Km values of liver and muscle phosphofructokinase for fructose-2,6-P2 in the presence of 1.25 mM ATP are 12 milliunits/ml (or 24 nM) and 5 milliunits/ml (or 10 nM), respectively. At near physiological concentrations of ATP (3 mM) and fructose-6-P (0.2 mM), however, the Km values for fructose-2,6-P2 are increased to 12 microM and 0.8 microM for liver and muscle enzymes, respectively. Thus, fructose-2,6-P2 is the most potent activator of the enzyme compared to other known activators such as fructose-1,6-P2. The rates of the reaction catalyzed by the enzymes under the above conditions are nonlinear: the rates decelerate in the absence or in the presence of lower concentrations of fructose-2,6-P2, but the rates become linear in the presence of higher concentrations of fructose-2,6-P2. Fructose-2,6-P2 also protects phosphofructokinase against inactivation by heat. Fructose-2,6-P2, therefore, may be the most important allosteric effector in regulation of phosphofructokinase in liver as well as in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2094739247,The relationship between the actin-activated adenosinetriphosphatase activity of smooth muscle myosin and the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation is nonlinear. It is suggested that the phosphorylation of the two heads of smooth muscle myosin is an ordered process and that the two heads are influenced by cooperative interactions.
https://openalex.org/W1499640159,"The kinetic parameters of D-glucose transport in liposomes reconstituted with the purified glucose transporter were determined. Net uptake and efflux both had Km values of 0.7 to 1.2 mM and Vmax values of 1.6 mumol/mg of protein/min. Equilibrium exchange had a Km of 35 mM and a Vmax of 50 mumol/mg of protein/min. By separating the liposomes from unreconstituted protein using density centrifugation, the Vmax of exchange was increased to 86 mumol/mg of protein/min, about 3 times that of the erythrocyte membrane. Trypsin, which inhibits erythrocyte glucose transport only from the cytoplasmic side, inhibited reconstituted transport activity about 40% when added externally. With internal treatment as well, the inhibition was about 80%. This suggests that the reconstituted transporter is oriented about equally in both directions. Antibody prepared against the purified transporter inhibits transport to a maximum of about 50%, also indicating a scrambled orientation. External trypsin treatment decreased the Km for uptake and increased the Km for efflux, consistent with asymmetric kinetic parameters for the two faces of the transporter. However, the calculated Km values are lower than those reported for erythrocytes. Phloretin and diethylstilbestrol inhibit the reconstituted transporter. However, they bind to liposomes, producing anomalous results under some experimental conditions. When this binding is taken into account, phloretin inhibits completely and symmetrically. The binding accounts for the apparent asymmetric effects of phloretin reported by others. The inhibitory effects of mercuric ions are consistent with action at two classes of binding sites. Treatment with trypsin increases the sensitivity to Hg2+, indicating that the more sensitive site is on the external face of the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1560936920,"Proton-ATPase complexes from yeast and rat liver mitochondria were isolated by a simple method previously employed for the purification of the proton-ATPase complex from chloroplasts. After reconstitution into liposomes, the purified complexes were active in the ATP-Pi exchange reaction, the rate of which was 120 and at least 200 nmol/mg of protein/min for the rat liver and yeast mitochondria ATPases, respectively. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, each complex exhibited 11 to 12 different polypeptides. The isolated ATPase complexes from rat liver and yeast mitochondria, from Swiss chard chloroplasts, and Escherichia coli membranes were reacted with antibodies prepared against the various subunits of ATPase complexes. From all the combinations of antigen-antibody examined, only the antibodies against beta subunit cross-reacted with the corresponding subunit of all the ATPase complexes tested. These results indicate that certain amino acid sequences in the beta subunit have been preserved in all of the proton-ATPase complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1492618849,"The DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the recA protein of Escherichia coli shows a complex dependence on ATP concentration. With a single-stranded (SS) DNA cofactor, the Hill coefficient for ATP is 3.3 at pH 8.1 and 1.4 at pH 6.2. With a double-stranded (DS) DNA cofactor, the Hill coefficient is 3.3 at pH 6.2 (no reaction is detectable at pH 8.1). In the presence of SS DNA, the Km for ATP is 20 microM, independent of pH, while with DS DNA at pH 6.2, KmATP is 100 microM. These and other observations indicate that the interaction of recA protein with ATP is influenced by both pH and DNA cofactor. ADP, UTP, dTTP, and GTP are competitive inhibitors of the ATPase activity of recA protein, indicating that there is a single binding site for nucleoside triphosphates. Nucleoside triphosphates, but not ADP, reduce the Hill coefficient for ATP hydrolysis and thus can contribute to the cooperative effect of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1510420297,"The contribution of proofreading to the fidelity by which Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I copies natural DNA has been analyzed by two independent criteria. With phi X174 am 3 DNA as a template, there is approximately a 25-fold increase in noncomplementary base substitutions at position 587 when the concentration of the next correct nucleotide, dATP, is increased. Sequence analysis indicates that the mistakes represent misincorporation of C in place of T at position 587. This mutagenic response is presumed to result from a decrease in the probability of excision by the 3' leads to 5' exonuclease of Pol I and is considered within the context of current theories on proofreading. No enhanced mutagenicity is observed with avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase, which lacks a 3' leads to 5' exonuclease. Using a second approach, an enhancement in mutagenesis as large as 30-fold is observed to result from the addition of deoxynucleoside monophosphates to the Pol I reaction. This mutagenicity occurs with any of the four deoxynucleoside monophosphates and is independent of a significant inhibition of DNA synthesis, thus supporting proofreading models in which sites of excision and incorporation are independent. The results of both approaches suggest that the exonucleolytic activity of Pol I can increase fidelity by approximately 30-fold on natural DNA, a value much higher than previous estimates with polynucleotide templates. The effect of the next correct nucleotide in decreasing accuracy provides an in vitro probe for screening eukaryotic cells for putative proofreading functions."
https://openalex.org/W1522544054,We have employed cesium sulfate density gradient centrifugation to separate RNA and DNA of L1210 cells labeled with [3H]fluorodeoxyuridine. We have analyzed nucleotide and nucleoside digests of purified DNA from the [3H]fluorodeoxyuridine-labeled cells and demonstrate by reverse phase and anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography the presence of tritium radioactivity co-migrating with fluorodeoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate or fluorodeoxyuridine. These observations demonstrate the internucleotide incorporation of fluorodeoxyuridine in DNA and suggest a new mechanism of action for this cytotoxic and mutagenic agent.

https://openalex.org/W1591824003,"The chemical nature of the phosphoryl enzyme linkage of the electrogenic proton-translocating ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) in the plasma membrane of Neurospora has been identified as a mixed anhydride between phosphate and the beta-carboxyl group of an aspartic acid residue in the polypeptide chain. Incubation of isolated Neurospora plasma membrane vesicles containing 32P-labeled ATPase in buffers of increasing pH followed by analysis of the hydrolysis products yielded a pH versus hydrolysis profile characteristic of an acyl phosphate linkage. Reaction of labeled membranes with hydroxylamine at pH 5.3 also released [32P]i from the ATPase. Amino acid analyses of the Na[3H]BH4 reduction products obtained from membranes containing phosphorylated and dephosphorylated ATPase identified [3H]homoserine, the expected reduction product of beta-aspartyl phosphate, as the only additional tritiated reduction product in the samples from phosphorylated membranes. Tritium was not found in alpha-amino-delta-hydroxyvaleric acid, the reduction product of gamma-glutamyl phosphate, nor in proline, the degradation product of alpha-amino-delta-hydroxyvaleric acid. These results indicate that the phosphorylated intermediate of the Neurospora plasma membrane ATPase is a beta-aspartyl phosphate identical with that already known to exist in the Na+:K+- and Ca2+-translocating ATPases of animal cell origin. A common model for the mechanisms of all 3 ion-translocating ATPases is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1607770542,"The effect of the transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH) and potential gradient (delta psi) upon the rate and extent of amine accumulation was investigated in intact 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) containing dense granules. The granules were isolated and purified from other subcellular organelles under isotonic conditions utilizing a newly developed continuous density gradient of Percoll. As measured by [14C]methylamine distribution, isolated granules suspended in a highly buffered medium at pH 7.0 had an intragranular pH of 5.40, independent of the pH of the external medium. This pH gradient could be collapsed by the addition of 60 mM ammonia. In the presence of Mg-ATP, a transmembrane potential (delta psi) of 30-40 mV, inside positive, was generated and sustained for over 30 min, as measured by [14C]thiocyanate distribution. The addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a proton translocator, resulted in the reversal of the potential to negative values. The Mg-ATP-dependent generation of the delta psi was prevented by addition of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and trimethyltin, inhibitors of proton-translocating ATPases in this and other subcellular organelles. Ammonia (1-50 mM) addition to highly buffered suspensions of serotonin granules caused a dose-dependent decrease in the delta pH, while thiocyanate added at varying concentrations produced a dose-related collapse of the delta psi and had no effect upon the delta pH. Both the delta pH and delta psi were found to independently drive accumulation of [14C]serotonin into the granules; stepwise collapse of each gradient resulted in a corresponding diminution of [14C]serotonin accumulation. The maximum rate and extent of [14C]serotonin uptake, however, were observed in the presence of both the delta pH and delta psi. The conclusions provide support for the existence of a proton-translocating ATPase in the serotonin granule membrane responsible for the generation of the delta pH and delta psi. Moreover, the results demonstrate a primary role for the electrochemical proton gradient (delta mu H+) in the carrier-mediated active transport of 5-hydroxytryptamine into the platelet granule."
https://openalex.org/W45032137,"Abstract The activation factor for phosphofructokinase was shown by chemical analysis, by synthesis, and by 13C NMR spectroscopy to be beta-D-fructose-2,6-P2. This compound was prepared from D-fructose-1,2-cyclic 6-P2 by alkaline hydrolysis. D-Fructose-1,2-cyclic 6-P2 is ineffective in activating phosphofructokinase while synthetic D-fructose-2,6-P2 has the same specific activity toward phosphofructokinase as the activation factor isolated from rat liver, and it exhibits the same characteristics on paper and ion exchange chromatography. Acid treatment of both the synthetic and the natural product destroys the biological activity and yields 1 mol each of fructose-6-P and Pi; alkaline phosphatase treatment of the compound followed with acid hydrolysis yields fructose. The natural abundance 13C NMR spectra of the synthetically prepared and purified D-fructose-1,2-cyclic 6-P2 and D-fructose-2,6-P2 have been obtained and all resonances have been assigned. The spectra also show that both samples contain predominantly one anomer and the 13C chemical shifts and 31P-13C coupling constants are consistent only with the beta-anomer."

https://openalex.org/W1551406852,"Duck erythrocytes were incubated with [3H]acetate both in the presence and absence of sodium butyrate. Subsequent perchloric acid extraction of the nuclei, followed by selective acetone precipitation, CM-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration yielded radioactively labeled high mobility group (HMG) proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 in pure form. Extensive enzymatic degradation of the proteins followed by amino acid analysis of the digests yielded a significant amount of material eluting in the position of epsilon-N-acetyllysine. Furthermore, automated Edman degradation of intact 3H-labeled HMG-14 and HMG-17 identified the specific sites of acetylation of these proteins. In both erythrocyte HMGs isolated from cells not exposed to butyrate, the lysine residue at position 2 was the only one found to be labeled. However, one additional site in HMG-14 and two additional sites in HMG-17 were found in the proteins from cells incubated in butyrate. Finally, studies of the enzymatic deacetylation of HMG-14 and HMG-17 confirmed that both nuclear proteins serve as deacetylase substrates and that butyrate inhibits their deacetylation, just as in the case of other HMG proteins and nucleosomal core histones."
https://openalex.org/W1542224671,"Elongation factor 3 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified over 230-fold from a high speed supernatant fraction. The homogeneity of the protein was shown by gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the native protein and by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the denatured protein. The molecular weight of the protein was estimated to be 125,000 by the above-mentioned methods. The protein consists of a single polypeptide chain. Amino acid analysis revealed no unusual features. Antibody raised against the purified factor showed a single cross-reacting band with the characteristic hexagonal pattern in an Ouchterlony double diffusion plate. The immune serum had no reactivity against the other two elongation factors (EF). The polymerization reaction was inhibited by the anti-EF3. Addition of excess EF3 could overcome this effect. Factor 3 is absolutely required by the yeast ribosomes for polyphenylalanine synthesis. Ribosomes from other eukaryotes do not require this protein. The function of the third factor in polyphenylalanine synthesis cannot be defined at this time. The protein showed ribosome-dependent GTPase and ATPase activities. Studies of partial reactions showed that EF3 was not required for Phe-tRNA binding to ribosomes, peptide bond formation, or translocation. Nucleotide exchange by EF1 was not stimulated by EF3."

https://openalex.org/W1546027199,"Incubation of the recA protein of Escherichia coli with the ATP analog adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP(gamma S)) in the presence of DNA produces an irreversible inhibition of ATPase activity, although in the presence of ATP, ATP(gamma S) shows an initial competitive inhibition. ATP(gamma S) is not appreciably hydrolyzed by recA protein and the inhibition of ATPase activity is due to the formation of stable complexes which contain equimolar amounts of ATP(gamma S) and recA protein. Formation of stable complexes requires DNA, which is also stably bound to recA protein in the presence of ATP(gammaS), at a ratio of 5 to 10 nucleotides/recA protein monomer. The DNA requirement is satisfied by either single-or double-stranded DNA, and in the latter case, the pH dependence is comparable to that observed for ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ATP(gamma S) is inhibited by other nucleoside di- and triphosphates with efficiencies corresponding to their inhibitory effects on the ATPase activity of recA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1604652009,"A particulate enzyme fraction that catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-[14C]glucose and of xylose from UDP-[14C]xylose into a xyloglucan has been isolated from suspension-cultured soybean cells. The incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]xylose into the polysaccharide was dependent on the presence of UDP-glucose in the incubation mixture, and that from [14C]glucose was dependent on the concentration of UDP-xylose in the mixture. Mn2+ was required for the incorporation of xylose and the optimum concentration of Mn2+ was about 10 mM. This reaction showed a pH optimum at 6.5 to 7.0 in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer and was inhibited by phosphate buffer and Tris buffer. On hydrolysis with Trichoderma endoglucanase, the polysaccharide synthesized in vitro gave a pentasaccharide, a hepatasaccharide, and a small amount of non-asaccharide. Based on the results from fragmentation and methylation analyses, the following structures were proposed for the penta- and the heptasaccharides from the xyloglucan synthesized in vitro: (formula, see text)."

https://openalex.org/W1539917239,"After illumination in the presence of dithiothreitol, chloroplast thylakoids catalyze ATP hydrolysis and an exchange between ATP and Pi in the dark. ATP hydrolysis is linked to inward proton translocation. The relationships between ATP hydrolysis, ATP-Pi exchange, and proton translocation during the steady state were examined. The internal proton concentration was found to be proportional to the rate of ATP hydrolysis when these parameters were varied by procedures that do not alter the proton permeability of the thylakoid membranes. A linear relationship between the internal proton concentration and the rate of nonphosphorylating electron flow was previously verified. By determining the constant relating internal proton concentration to both ATP hydrolysis and electron flow, the proton/ATP ratio for the chloroplast ATPase complex was calculated to be 3.4 +/- 0.3. The presence of Pi, which allows ATP-Pi exchange to occur, lowers the internal proton concentration, but does not alter the relationship between the net rate of ATP hydrolysis and internal proton concentration. ATP-Pi exchange shows a dependence on the proton activity gradient very similar to that of ATP synthesis in the light. These results suggest that ATP-Pi exchange resembles photophosphorylation. In agreement with this idea, it is nucleoside diphosphate from the medium that is phosphorylated during exchange. Moreover, the energy-linked incorporation of Pi and ADP into ATP during exchange occurs at a similar rate. Thus, ATP synthesis from medium ADP and Pi takes place at the expense of the pH gradient generated by ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1627177585,"The proteins coded by bacteriophate T4 replication genes 32, 41, 43, 44, 45, 61, and 62 together can replicate phi X174 DNA templates very efficiently. The fidelity of this in vitro replication reaction has been measured using an infectivity assay. The product molecules have the same specific infectivity as the template DNA. When an amber mutant DNA template is used, no increase in the frequency of revertants is seen even after more than 60 duplications in vitro. By using imbalances in the concentrations of deoxynucleotide substrates, the error rate during DNA replication in vitro can be greatly increased. Control experiments indicate that the increased mutagenesis is not due to the presence of dITP or dUTP as contaminants in the deoxynucleotide substrates used. The increase in the frequency of revertants is linearly related to the ratio of the correct and the incorrect deoxynucleotides. Determination of the DNA sequence of the revertants induced shows that a change in DNA sequence of the amber site predicted from the nucleotide bias occurs. DNA synthesis in vitro resembles in vivo replication in that the error rate depends not only upon the base change required for reversion but also upon the neighboring DNA sequences. The error rate is estimated to be 5 X 10(-6) at am3 site, 6.4 X 10(-7) at am86 site, and less than 2.9 X 10(-7) at am9 site. Comparison of the frequency of G-T and A-C mispairs reveals that most AT leads to GC transition mutations occur through G-T mispairs. Measurement of the frequency of the mispairs required to induce transversion mutations reveals that these occur primarily through purine-purine mispairs. Transition mutations are more frequent than transversion mutations at both the am3 and the am86 sites. These observations support the models for base pairing errors proposed by Watson and Crick ((1953) Nature 171, 964-967) and Topal and Fresco ((1976) Nature 263, 285-289)."
https://openalex.org/W1591289066,"When Triton X-100/EDTA extracts of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli K12 were passed through a column containing maltose-binding protein covalently linked to Sepharose 6MB beads, the phage lambda receptor protein or LamB protein was quantitatively and specifically adsorbed to the column and was eluted with a solution containing 1 M NaCl, but not with that containing 0.5 M maltose. The binding did not take place when columns containing inactivated Sepharose beads alone, or Sepharose bound to histidine-binding protein of Salmonella typhimurium, were used. This interaction is consistent with the hypothesis that the periplasmic maltose-binding protein interacts with the part of the LamB protein exposed on the inner surface of the outer membrane, thereby increasing the specificity of the solute penetration process through the LamB channel."
https://openalex.org/W1511982093,"The steady state kinetics of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis catalyzed by the chloroplast dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATPase reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles were studied as a function of the transmembrane proton gradient. Bacteriorhodopsin also was incorporated into the vesicles so that a constant pH gradient could be maintained by continuous illumination of the liposomes. The dependence of the initial rates of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis on substrate concentrations is consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with enzyme, ADP, and Pi forming a ternary complex. The Michaelis constants for both synthesis and hydrolysis are essentially independent of the pH gradient, while the maximum velocities depend strongly on it. The equilibrium constant for hydrolysis was calculated from the steady state kinetic parameters, and the dependence of the equilibrium constant on the pH gradient indicates that 3 protons are transported per ATP synthesized or hydrolyzed. The dependence of the steady state kinetic parameters on the pH gradient can be described by a mechanism in which the binding of substrates occurs before the transport of protons and the transport of the 3 protons is sequential rather than concerted."
https://openalex.org/W2133515446,"Previous experiments have shown that the himA gene of E. coli specifies a protein that is required for bacteriophage lambda integration. lambda Forms clear plaques on himA mutants indicating a possible additional defect in the establishment of repression. We have tested the effects of a himA mutation on the establishment and maintenance of lambda repressor (cl) synthesis and on the synthesis of Int protein. The rate of synthesis of cl and Int after infection by lambda is severely reduced in a strain carrying a himA gene deletion. Synthesis of Int or repressor can occur in the himA- strain if the phage carry constitutive promoters for either the int gene or the cl gene. Maintenance of repression is unaffected by himA mutations as judged by repressor-stimulated transcription of PM fused to the lacZ gene. These results indicate that the himA gene participates in the regulation of the promoter sites specific of the establishment of lysogeny: PE for cl synthesis and PI, for Int production. Since the himA gene product is required also for lambda site-specific recombination, it appears that the himA gene regulates lambda lysogeny at several levels. I discuss the significance of this multilevel regulation to lambda development."

Cultured human diploid skin fibroblasts were grown in medium containing H235SO4 to label endogenous mucopolysaccharide. Lysosome containing preparations at various stages of purity were isolated from disrupted cells. These preparations degraded mucopolysaccharide as indicated by the release of radioactive sulfate. Degradation was temperature-dependent, required intact lysosomes, and was optimal when incubation was carried out at neutral pH in a buffer of low ionic strength. Lysosomes from Hurler fibroblasts were unable to carry out the degradative process. ATP at 0.5 mM was found to stimulate both the rate and the extent of mucopolysaccharide degradation; GTP, UTP, and CTP had similar effects, whereas the noncleavable ATP analog adenosine 5'-(beta gamma-imido)triphosphate gave no stimulation. The ATP stimulation was inhibited by nigericin. ATP also stimulated chloroquine accumulation in lysosomes, the magnitude of which was used to measure the change in intralysosomal pH. The presence of ATP was associated with acidification of lysosome pH by 0.23 units. Acetyl coenzyme A was also found to stimulate lysosome function. This reagent, however, had no effect on chloroquine accumulation and thus appears to stimulate mucopolysaccharide degradation by a mechanism different than that caused by ATP."

Native immunoglobulin E receptor appeared as a very broad band in the 45,000 to 62,000 Mr region in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. However, from cells cultured in the presence of tunicamycin, a relatively narrow band with an apparent Mr of 38,000 was isolated. The 38,000 Mr band rebound to immunoglobulin E-Sepharose, was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to immunoglobulin E receptor, shared tryptic peptides with native receptor, and was labeled with L-[35S]methionine but not D-[3H]mannose, and thus appears to be immunoglobulin E receptor lacking N-linked oligosaccharides. It is demonstrated that N-linked oligosaccharides account for much of the apparent heterogeneity of native receptor in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A receptor-associated protein with apparent Mr = 30,000, prominently labeled with L-[35S]methionine but not with D-[3H]mannose, did not have altered molecular properties when isolated from tunicamycin-cultured cells, and did not share tryptic peptides with receptor."

On the other hand, heparitin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate B as well as beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase remain without significant changes during the whole period. The fetal chondroitin sulfate C is tissue specific with different molecular weights depending on the tissue of origin. Some properties of fetal muscle and brain hyaluronidase are also described.

https://openalex.org/W1500261531,"Illumination of chloroplast thylakoid membranes results in both the release of adenine nucleotides from the tight nucleotide binding site(s) on chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) and the activation of a light-triggered ATPase activity of CF1. Because inorganic phosphate stabilizes the light-triggered ATPase activity of CF1 in the dark, the effects of Pi on the rebinding of ADP to CF1 and on the light-triggered ATPase activity have been studied. Pi appears to be a partial noncompetitive inhibitor, with respect to ADP, of adenine nucleotide binding to the tight nucleotide binding site(s) on CF1 and induces negative cooperativity. The latter result suggests the existence of heterogeneous ADP binding sites in the presence of Pi. However, even under conditions where Pi causes a 50% reduction of tightly bound ADP, the ADP-induced dark decay of the ATPase activity is still complete. It was found that Pi inhibition of the light-induced dark binding of ADP can be reversed by the removal of the Pi. Removal of Pi also induces a small but significant ATPase activity. A model for the roles of the adenine nucleotide tight binding site(s) and Pi in the modulation of the spinach CF1 ATPase activity is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1585749763,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase has been found to cleave the ATP analog adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate in a calcium-dependent reaction. The reaction products were determined by 31P NMR to be inorganic phosphate and adenyl-5'-yl phosphoramidate (AMP-PN). AMP-PNP hydrolysis, like ATP hydrolysis, drives active Ca2+ accumulation by sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W127662241,"The structure of both the mono- and the divalent metal nucleotide complexes active in the myosin subfragment 1 ATPase has been determined using the phosphorothioate analogs of ATP in the presence of various cations. Both the Sp and the Rp diastereomers of adenosine 5‘-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) (ATP alpha S) were substrates in the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ as well as with NH4+ and T1+. The Sp/Rp activity ratios obtained were largely independent of the cation. The simplest explanation of these results is that both mono- and divalent cations do not coordinate to the alpha-phosphate group. With adenosine 5‘-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATP beta S), essentially only the Sp diastereomer was active with Mg2+ with Sp/Rp ratio of greater 3000. As the divalent metal ion was varied in the series given above, this ratio was progressively lowered to the value of 0.2 found with Cd2+. Similar changes in stereoselectivity were seen with monovalent cations. Thus, with NH4+, an Sp/Rp ratio of 8 was observed, whereas with T1+, this figure was reduced to 0.04. These data indicate that both mono- and divalent cations coordinate to the beta-phosphate group of the nucleoside triphosphate substrate. These results obtained with ATP alpha S and ATP beta S suggest that myosin uses the mono- or divalent cation delta, beta, gamma-bidentate nucleotide chelate as substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1572264402,"The quaternary structure of an active form of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase was studied by sedimentation and electron microscopy. Active enzyme centrifugation studies at pH 7.0 and 23 +/- 1 degrees C showed that phosphofructokinase sediments as a single component with a sedimentation coefficient of 12.2 +/- 0.5 S. Identical results were obtained in two assay and three solvent systems. Boundary sedimentation studies of phosphofructokinase in the presence of 1.0 mM fructose 6-phosphate, 0.1 mM adenylyl imidodiphosphate at pH 7.0 and 23 +/- 1 degrees C were performed. The results showed that the sedimentation coefficient of phosphofructokinase remains constant within the range of protein concentration studied and assumes a value of 12.4 S. The molecular weights of the subunit and the 12.4 S component were measured by sedimentation equilibrium yielding values of 83,000 and 330,000 for the monomeric and polymeric species, respectively. It is, therefore, concluded that the active form of phosphofructokinase is indeed the tetrameric species. The structure of the phosphofructokinase tetramer was also studied by electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens. Particles identified as tetramers measured approximately 9 nm in diameter by 14 nm in length. The observed size and shape are consistent with the hydrodynamic measurements. Structural features within the tetramer were interpreted as due to the four individual subunits, each one approximately 4 X 6 X 6 nm in size, arranged with D2 symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W1595622567,"Neurospora crassa nitrite reductase (Mr = 290,000) catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent 6-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia via flavin and siroheme prosthetic groups. Homogeneous N. crassa nitrite reductase has been prepared employing conventional purification methods followed by affinity chromatography on blue dextran-Sepharose 4B. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of homogeneous nitrite reductase reveals a single subunit band of Mr = 140,000. Isoelectric focusing of dissociated enzyme followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis in the second dimension yields a single subunit spot with an isoelectric point at pH 6.8-6.9. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatography of acid-hydrolyzed nitrite reductase treated with 5-dimethylaminoaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride yields a single reactive NH2-terminal corresponding to glycine. An investigation of the prosthetic groups of nitrite reductase reveals little or no flavin associated with the purified protein, although exogenously added FAD is required for activity in vitro. An iron content of 9-10 Fe eq/mol suggests the presence of nonheme iron in addition to the siroheme moieties. Amino acid analysis yields 43 cysteinyl residues and sulfhydryl reagents react with 50 thiol eq/mol of nitrite reductase. The non-cysteinyl sulfur content, determined as 8.1 acid-labile sulfide eq/mol, is presumably associated with nonheme iron to form iron-sulfur centers. We conclude that N. crassa nitrite reductase is a homodimer of large molecular weight subunits housing an electron transfer complex of FAD, iron-sulfur centers, and siroheme to mediate the reduced pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of nitrite to ammonia."
https://openalex.org/W1524092524,"The fluorescent thiol reagent N-(1-anilinonaphthyl-4)maleimide (ANM) reacts covalently with the Ca2+ ATPase moiety of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum in two phases as determined by the increase of fluorescence intensity and optical density at 350 nm. In the rapid phase, 5.5 nmol of ANM reacts with 1 mg of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum protein. Assuming that 55% of the total membrane protein is the Ca2+ ATPase, this is equivalent to 1 mol of SH/10(5) g of ATPase, designated as SH1-ANM. ANM reacts with the second SH (SH2-ANM) at a much slower rate. Reaction of ANM with both SH1-ANM and SH2-ANM produces no inhibition of phosphoenzyme (EP) formation. Upon addition of Mg . ATP in the micromolar range, at [Ca2+] = 1 microM there is an increase in the fluorescence intensity of ANM attached to SH2-ANM, while the ANM attached to SH1-ANM does not respond to Mg . ATP. Under conditions in which there is no EP formation, there is no fluorescence change. Furthermore, the enhancement of ANM fluorescence produced by Mg . ATP is reversed by ADP as it reacts with EP to form ATP. Thus, it appears that the Mg . ATP-induced fluorescence increase reflects changes of enzyme conformation produced by EP formation."
https://openalex.org/W1528144894,"On the basis of immunofluorescence and biochemical studies, it has been suggested that the concentration of nonhistone chromosomal protein high mobility group 1 may be higher in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus of mammalian cells (Bustin, M., and Neihart, N. K. (1979) Cell 16, 181-189). In view of the possible implications of this finding, we have examined the in situ location of trout proteins HMG-T1 and HMG-T2, which are analogous to the mammalian proteins HMG-1 and HMG-2. Antibodies prepared against purified HMG-T2 were shown to react only with HMG-T1 and HMG-T2, but not with any other chromosomal proteins from trout. This has been established using a modified immunoautoradiographic techique involving CNBr-activated paper transfers of proteins separated on regular sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Using the indirect immunofluorescence technique to examine the subcellular location of HMG-T (T1 and T2) proteins in a cultured cell line of rainbow trout, we find that these proteins are located primarily in the nucleus of these cells. The fluorescence in the nucleolar regions is even more intense than in the nonnucleolar regions. The cytoplasmic regions show only a weak fluorescence which may be due to low levels of HMG-T proteins in the cytoplasm, since preincubation of anti-HMG-T2 with purified HMG-T2 abolishes the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1542405827,"The yeast nuclear mutant, pet 936, has previously been shown to be defective in the assembly of a functional mitochondrial ATPase (Todd, R. D., McAda, P. C., and Douglas, M. G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11134-11141). In the present report, trypsin degradation and subunit-specific antibody binding have been used to localize subunits 1, 2, and 3 external to or associated with the outer aspect of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the mutant strain. A similar population of unassembled subunits was found in the parental strain as well. Isotope dilution experiments are compatible with those unassembled subunits being normal intermediates in the assembly pathway of the ATPase complex which are blocked from transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane in the mutant, pet 936."
https://openalex.org/W1517017821,"Evidence is presented that, under conditions of 4.7 M NH4Cl and 10 mM Mg-ATP where no subunit dissociation can be detected by transport methods, a dynamic equilibrium exists in subfragment 1 between the associated and dissociated subunits. This is readily discerned by the formation of hybrid subfragment 1 species when a subfragment 1 isozyme is incubated with excess free light chains of the alternate isozyme. A similar process occurs with p-N,N'-phenylenedimaleimide (pPDM)-modified subfragment 1 containing [14C]Mg-ADP, but in this case, although extensive amounts of hybrid are formed, no loss of the trapped nucleotide is observed. Subunit scrambling without loss of the trapped nucleotide is apparent from incubating pPDM-SF1(A2)-[14C]Mg-ADP with unmodified SF1(A1) under similar conditions since the mixture subsequently contains SF1(A1), SF1(A2)h, pPDM-SF1(A1)h-[14C]Mg-ADP and pPDM-SF1(A2)-[14C]Mg-ADP. These data show that the nucleotide trapped in the presumptive active site does not escape during the dissociation-reassociation cycle, and suggest that the ATPase site resides solely on the heavy chain."

https://openalex.org/W1542131517,"The mechanism of interaction between ADP and the myosin active center has been studied using a transient kinetic technique. The results show that the interaction of ADP with the myosin active center is a homogeneous process independent of the association state of the active centers; namely, whether ADP interacts with the monomeric myosin subfragment-1, or with the dimeric forms heavy meromyosin and myosin. The kinetics of the interaction conforms to a simple two-step reaction mechanism for ADP binding. The kinetic and thermodynamic constants for this mechanism have been determined. In addition, analysis of the binding isotherm indicates that the two active sites in heavy meromyosin and myosin function as identical and independent sites."
https://openalex.org/W1538411583,"The kinetics of the fluorescence enhancement and the transient release of H+ caused by the binding of ADP to the active center of myosin has been compared to that caused by myosin-ATP interaction. The results show that both the time courses of the fluorescence enhancement and the transient H+ release caused by ADP binding, like that caused by ATP hydrolysis in the initial burst, are monophasic exponential processes. The fact that the rates of these two processes are also equal suggests that they both reflect the same mechanistic event in the mechanism of ADP binding. The kinetics of ADP binding as measured by the fluorescence enhancement and the H+ release is different from that of ATP. This is in agreement with our previous finding that the enhancement of fluorescence and the transient release of H+, in the case of ATP, reflect the initial burst of ATP hydrolysis, whereas in the case of ADP, they represent a conformational change in the myosin-ADP complex. The magnitude of the H+ transient caused by the initial burst is approximately equal to that caused by ADP binding. The amplitude of the fluorescence enhancement caused by ADP binding is equal to one-third of that caused by the initial burst."
