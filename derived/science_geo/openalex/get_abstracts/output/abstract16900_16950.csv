https://openalex.org/W1990938412,"We have cloned a cDNA encoding a novel polypeptide capable of inducing dorsal development in Xenopus embryos. RNA transcripts from this clone rescue normal development when injected into ventralized embryos and result in excessive head development at high doses. Therefore, we have named the cDNA noggin, noggin cDNA contains a single reading frame encoding a 26 kd protein with a hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence, suggesting that it is secreted. In Northern blot analysis this cDNA hybridizes to two mRNAs that are expressed both maternally and zygotically. Although noggin transcript is not localized in the oocyte and cleavage stage embryo, zygotic transcripts are initially restricted to the presumptive dorsal mesoderm and reach their highest levels at the gastrula stage in the dorsal lip of the blastopore (Spemann organizer). In the neurula, noggin is transcribed in the notochord and prechordal mesoderm. The activity of exogenous noggin RNA in embryonic axis induction and the localized expression of endogenous noggin transcripts suggest that noggin plays a role in normal dorsal development."
https://openalex.org/W1978416272,"Interaction of the B7 molecule on antigen-presenting cells with its receptors CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells provides costimulatory signals for T cell activation. We have studied the effects of B7 on antitumor immunity to a murine melanoma that expresses a rejection antigen associated with the E7 gene product of human papillomavirus 16. While this E7+ tumor grows progressively in immunocompetent hosts, cotransfection of its cells with B7 led to tumor regression by a B7-dependent immune response mediated by CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes. The immune response induced by E7+B7+ tumor cells also caused regression of E7+B7- tumors at distant sites and was curative for established E7+B7- micrometastases. Our findings suggest that increasing T cell costimulation through the CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors may have therapeutic usefulness for generating immunity against tumors expressing viral antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2017708875,"Cowpox virus effectively inhibits inflammatory responses against viral infection in the chick embryo. This study demonstrates that one of the viral genes necessary for this inhibition, the crmA gene (a cytokine response modifier gene), encodes a serpin that is a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme. This serpin can prevent the proteolytic activation of interleukin-1 beta, thereby suppressing an interleukin-1 beta response to infection. However, the modification of this single cytokine response is not sufficient to inhibit inflammatory responses. This suggests that cowpox virus encodes several cytokine response modifiers that act together to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection. These viral countermeasures to host defenses against infection may contribute significantly to the pathology associated with poxvirus infections."

https://openalex.org/W2106695633,"Cells from patients with the UV-sensitive nucleotide excision repair disorder Cockayne's syndrome (CS) have a specific defect in preferential repair of lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. This system permits quick resumption of transcription after UV exposure. Here we report the characterization of ERCC6, a gene involved in preferential repair in eukaryotes. ERCC6 corrects the repair defect of CS complementation group B (CS-B). It encodes a protein of 1493 amino acids, containing seven consecutive domains conserved between DNA and RNA helicases. The entire helicase region bears striking homology to segments in recently discovered proteins involved in transcription regulation, chromosome stability, and DNA repair. Mutation analysis of a CS-B patient indicates that the gene is not essential for cell viability and is specific for preferential repair of transcribed sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2072679497,"The crystal structure of a 1:1 complex between yeast cytochrome c peroxidase and yeast iso-1-cytochrome c was determined at 2.3 A resolution. This structure reveals a possible electron transfer pathway unlike any previously proposed for this extensively studied redox pair. The shortest straight line between the two hemes closely follows the peroxidase backbone chain of residues Ala194, Ala193, Gly192, and finally Trp191, the indole ring of which is perpendicular to, and in van der Waals contact with, the peroxidase heme. The crystal structure at 2.8 A of a complex between yeast cytochrome c peroxidase and horse heart cytochrome c was also determined. Although crystals of the two complexes (one with cytochrome c from yeast and the other with cytochrome c from horse) grew under very different conditions and belong to different space groups, the two complex structures are closely similar, suggesting that cytochrome c interacts with its redox partners in a highly specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2029836146,"The yeast SWI1, SWI2 (SNF2), and SWI3 genes are required for transcription of HO and INO1 genes. We show that they are also required for transcription of ADH1, ADH2, SUC2, GAL1, and GAL10 and for function of simple UAS elements with binding sites for yeast GAL4 or Drosophila ftz proteins. SWI3 encodes a 99 kd nuclear protein containing a large, highly acidic N-terminal domain. SWI1 is identical to ADR6, which encodes a positive regulator of ADH1 and ADH2. Transcription of HO also requires SNF5 and SNF6. These and other observations suggest that SWI1, SWI2, SWI3, SNF5, and SNF6 may be components of a large multi-subunit complex. We propose that these products perform a general role in transcription by assisting gene-specific regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2062933575,"A site-directed anti-peptide antibody, CNB-1, that recognizes the alpha 1 subunit of rat brain class B calcium channels (rbB) immunoprecipitated 43% of the N-type calcium channels labeled by [125I]omega-conotoxin. CNB-1 recognized proteins of 240 and 210 kd, suggesting the presence of two size forms of this alpha 1 subunit. Calcium channels recognized by CNB-1 were localized predominantly in dendrites; both dendritic shafts and punctate synaptic structures upon the dendrites were labeled. The large terminals of the mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus granule neurons were heavily labeled, suggesting that the punctate labeling pattern represents calcium channels in nerve terminals. The pattern of immunostaining was cell specific. The cell bodies of some pyramidal cells in layers II, III, and V of the dorsal cortex, Purkinje cells, and scattered cell bodies elsewhere in the brain were also labeled at a low level. The results define complementary distributions of N- and L-type calcium channels in dendrites, nerve terminals, and cell bodies of most central neurons and support distinct functional roles in calcium-dependent electrical activity, intracellular calcium regulation, and neurotransmitter release for these two channel types."
https://openalex.org/W1970944716,"The mouse short ear gene is required for normal growth and patterning of skeletal structures, and for repair of bone fractures in adults. We have carried out an extensive chromosome walk in the chromosome region that surrounds this locus. Here we show that the short ear region contains the gene for a TGF beta-related protein called bone morphogenetic protein 5 (Bmp-5). This gene is deleted or rearranged in several independent mutations at the short ear locus. Mice homozygous for large deletions of the Bmp-5 coding region are viable and fertile. Mutations at the short ear locus provide an important new tool for defining the normal functions of BMPs in mammals. The specific skeletal defects seen in short-eared animals, which occur against a background of otherwise normal skeletal structures, suggest that particular aspects of skeletal morphology may be determined by individual members of a family of signaling factors that can induce the formation of cartilage and bone in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2027304196,"Intrasegmental patterning in the Drosophila embryo is regulated by cell-cell communication. One of the signaling pathways that operates to specify positional information throughout the segment is mediated by the wingless (wg) protein, which is the homology of the proto-oncogene Wnt-1. The early role of wg is to stabilize engrailed (en) expression by initiating a phase of en autoregulation in the adjacent more posterior cells. Here, we report that the segment polarity gene zeste-white 3 (zw3; also known as shaggy) acts as a repressor of en autoregulation. Genetic epistasis experiments indicate that wg signaling operates by inactivating the zw3 repression of en autoactivation. In addition, we demonstrate that zw3 encodes the Drosophila homolog of mammalian glycogen synthase kinase-3."
https://openalex.org/W2133084943,"We have discovered a protein termed Dr1 that interacts with the TATA-binding protein, TBP. The association of Dr1 with TBP results in repression of both basal and activated levels of transcription. The interaction of Dr1 with TBP precludes the formation of a transcription-competent complex by inhibiting the association of TFIIA and/or TFIIB with TBP. Dr1 activity is associated with a 19 kd protein. A cDNA clone encoding Dr1 was isolated. Dr1 is phosphorylated in vivo and phosphorylation of Dr1 affected its interaction with TBP. Our results suggest a regulatory role for Dr1 in repression of transcription mediated via phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1984981442,"The entire cytoplasmic contents of 15 highly polyploid nurse cells are transported rapidly to the oocyte near the end of Drosophila oogenesis. chickadee is one of a small group of genes whose mutant phenotype includes a disruption of this nurse cell cytoplasm transport. We have cloned the chickadee gene and found that cDNA clones encode a protein 40% identical to yeast and Acanthamoeba profilin. The nurse cells from chickadee egg chambers that lack ovary-specific profilin fail to synthesize cytoplasmic actin networks correctly. In addition, the nurse cell nuclei in chickadee egg chambers become displaced and often partially stretched through the channels leading into the oocyte, blocking the flow of cytoplasm. We suggest that the newly synthesized cytoplasmic actin networks are responsible for maintaining nuclear position in the nurse cells."
https://openalex.org/W2145921551,"We have isolated and characterized a set of overlapping cDNA clones that encode the human centromere autoantigen centromere protein C (CENP-C). The identity of these clones has been established using several criteria. First, they were shown to encode a polypeptide that migrates at the expected position for CENP-C on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Second, we have demonstrated that this polypeptide shares at least two epitopes with human CENP-C. Polyclonal antibodies were raised to fusion proteins encoded by nonoverlapping regions of the cDNA clones. These antibodies were shown to recognize a protein at a position appropriate for CENP-C on immunoblots of human chromosomal proteins. In addition, we used indirect immunofluorescence to demonstrate that these antibodies recognize centromeres of HeLa chromosomes in the expected pattern for CENP-C. Localization of CENP-C by immunoelectron microscopy reveals that this protein is a component of the inner kinetochore plate."
https://openalex.org/W2076875187,"Myogenin belongs to a family of myogenic helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins that activate muscle transcription through binding to a conserved DNA sequence associated with numerous muscle-specific genes. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) inhibits myogenesis by inactivating myogenic HLH proteins. We show that activated protein kinase C (PKC) can substitute for FGF and inhibit transcriptional activity of myogenic HLH proteins. In transfected cells, FGF induces phosphorylation of a conserved site in the DNA-binding domain of myogenin. This site is phosphorylated by PKC in vivo and in vitro and mediates repression of the myogenic program through a loss in DNA binding activity. A myogenin mutant lacking the PKC phosphorylation site is not repressed by FGF, confirming this site as a molecular target for FGF-dependent repression of muscle transcription. These results establish a direct link between the signal transduction pathways that inhibit myogenesis and the transcription factors directly activating muscle-specific genes."

https://openalex.org/W2002060368,Supernatants from vaccinia virus (VV)-infected CV-1 cells were examined and found to contain a 33 kd protein capable of binding murine interleukin-1β (mIL-1β). A VV open reading frame (ORF) that exhibits 30% amino acid identity to the type II IL-1 receptor was expressed in CV-1-EBNA cells and shown specifically to bind mIL-1β. A similar ORF from cowpox virus was expressed and also specifically bound mIL-1β. A recombinant VV was constructed in which this ORF was disrupted (vB15RKO). Supernatants from vB15RKO-infected cells did not contain an IL-1-binding protein. Supernatants from VV-infected CV-1 cells were capable of inhibiting IL-1-induced murine lymphocyte proliferation in vitro while supernatants from vB15RKO infected cells did not. Intracranial inoculation of mice with vB15RKO suggests that this ORF is involved in VV virulence. The possible role of a virus-encoded IL-1-binding protein in the pathology of a poxvirus infection and its relationship to other poxvirus-encoded immune modulators is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2051914105,"A cDNA corresponding to the 2.6 kb NF-kappa B mRNA species present in a variety of lymphoid cell lines has been molecularly cloned. The deduced 607 amino acid sequence is identical to the sequence of the C-terminal region of 110 kd NF-kappa B protein. A 70 kd protein can be identified in lymphoid cells using antibodies raised against the C-terminal region of p110 NF-kappa B. Comparison of the two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of the 70 kd protein expressed in cells and the in vitro translated product encoded by the cDNA display extensive homology. The 70 kd protein expressed in bacteria prevents sequence-specific DNA binding of p50-p65 NF-kappa B heterodimer, p50 homodimer, and c-rel. p70 also interferes with transactivation by c-rel and prevents its nuclear translocation. The 70 kd protein, predominantly found in lymphoid cells, is a new member of the I kappa B family of proteins and is referred to as I kappa B gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1493688737,"High efficiency transient transfection of Cos-7 cells was previously used to establish the functional coupling between G alpha q/G alpha 11 and phospholipase C beta 1 (Wu, D., Lee, C-H., Rhee, S. G., and Simon, M. I. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1811-1817). Here the same system was used to study the functional coupling between other guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G-protein) alpha subunits and phospholipases and to study which G alpha subunits mediate the activation of phospholipase C by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes, alpha 1 A, alpha 1 B, and alpha 1 C. We found that G alpha 14 and G alpha 16 behaved like G alpha 11 or G alpha q, i.e. they could activate endogenous phospholipases in Cos-7 cells in the presence of AIFn. The synergistic increase in inositol phosphate release in Cos-7 cells after they were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding G alpha subunits and phospholipase C beta 1 indicates that both G alpha 16 and G alpha 14 can activate phospholipase C beta 1. The activation of phospholipase C beta 1 was restricted to members of the Gq subfamily of alpha subunits. They activated phospholipase C beta 1 but not phospholipase C gamma 1, gamma 2, or phospholipase C delta 3. The cotransfection of Cos-7 cells with cDNAs encoding three different alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and G alpha q or G alpha 11 leads to an increase in norepinephrine-dependent inositol phosphate release. This indicates that G alpha q or G alpha 11 can mediate the activation of phospholipase C by all three subtypes of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. With the same assay system, G alpha 16 and G alpha 14 appear to be differentially involved in the activation of phospholipase C by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The alpha 1 B subtype receptor gave a ligand-mediated synergistic response in the cells cotransfected with either G alpha 14 or G alpha 16. However, the alpha 1 C receptor responded in cells cotransfected with G alpha 14 but not G alpha 16, and the alpha 1 A receptor showed little synergistic response in cells transfected with either G alpha 14 or G alpha 16. The ability of the alpha 1 A and alpha 1 C receptors to activate phospholipase C through G alpha q and G alpha 11 was also demonstrated in a cell-free system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1552509407,"We determined the relationship between the activation state and phosphorylation state of the Na-K-Cl cotransport protein in tubules isolated from the shark rectal gland, a prototypic chloride-secreting epithelium. In response to cAMP-dependent secretagogues (e.g. vasoactive intestinal peptide, adenosine, and forskolin) or osmotically induced changes in cell volume, the activation state of the cotransport protein (assessed from measurements of loop diuretic binding) increased 5-10 fold. The response was temporally associated with a comparable increase (3-9 fold) in cotransport protein phosphorylation. Graded changes in cotransporter activation evoked proportional changes in cotransporter phosphorylation. Under the conditions of our experiments, the 195-kDa cotransporter was the only membrane protein whose phosphorylation state increased conspicuously in response to both cAMP and cell shrinkage. Both stimuli promoted phosphorylation of the cotransport protein at serine and threonine residues. One of the cAMP-sensitive phosphoacceptors was found within a segment of the cotransport protein comprised of a sequence (Phe-Gly-His-Asn-Thr*-Ile-Asp-Ala-Val-Pro) that corresponds to a segment of the Na-K-Cl cotransport protein predicted by cDNA analysis, where the phosphoacceptor (Thr*) is threonine 189. Incubation of rectal gland tubules with K-252a or H-8, structurally different protein kinase inhibitors, rendered the cotransporter insensitive to both cAMP and cell shrinkage. We conclude that the rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransport protein is regulated by direct reversible phosphorylation at serine and threonine sites."
https://openalex.org/W2046634424,"The modification responsible for the long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) that follows a brief conditioning period is not known. To elucidate this change, we have resolved quantal levels of transmission before and after induction of LTP. We find an increase both in the number of quanta released and in quantal amplitude, consistent with combined pre- and postsynaptic modifications. On average, about 60% of LTP can be accounted for by presynaptic enhancement. The increase in either quantal amplitude or quantal content varies significantly among different experiments, but is inversely correlated with its initial value. These results may help to reconcile the different views concerning the site of LTP expression."
https://openalex.org/W2024986501,"Messenger RNA translation initiation and cytoplasmic poly(A) tail shortening require the poly(A)-binding protein (PAB) in yeast. The PAB-dependent poly(A) ribonuclease (PAN) has been purified to near homogeneity from S. cerevisiae based upon its PAB requirement, and its gene has been cloned. The essential PAN1 gene encodes a 161 kd protein organized into distinct domains containing repeated sequence elements. Deletion analysis of the gene revealed that only one-third of the protein is needed to maintain cell viability. Conditional mutations in PAN1 lead to an arrest of translation initiation and alterations in mRNA poly(A) tail lengths. These data suggest that PAN could mediate each of the PAB-dependent reactions within the cell, and they provide evidence for a direct relationship between translation initiation and mRNA metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2049317842,"The biologically active lipid platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine; PAF) is a mediator of inflammatory and immune responses, and it accumulates in the brain during convulsions or ischemia. We have examined whether PAF may play a second messenger role in the central nervous system by studying effects on synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons. Carbamyl-PAF, a nonhydrolyzable PAF analog with a similar pharmacologic profile, augmented glutamate-mediated, evoked excitatory synaptic transmission and increased the frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory synaptic events without increasing their amplitude or altering their time course. This compound had no significant effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibitory synaptic responses. Lyso-PAF, the biologically inactive metabolic intermediate, had no effect on synaptic transmission. Moreover, the enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission by carbamyl-PAF was blocked by a PAF receptor antagonist. These results indicate a specific presynaptic effect of PAF in enhancing excitatory synaptic transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1585921788,"The subunits of topoisomerase IV (topo IV), the ParC and ParE proteins in Escherichia coli, were purified to near homogeneity from the respective overproducers. They revealed type II topoisomerase activity only when they were combined with each other. In the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, topo IV was capable of relaxing a negatively or positively supercoiled plasmid DNA or converting the knotted P4 phage DNA, whether nicked or ligated, to a simple ring. However, supercoiling activity was not detected. The topoisomerase activity was not detectable when the purified ParC and ParE proteins were combined with the purified GyrB and GyrA proteins, respectively. This is consistent with the result that neither a parC nor a parE mutation was compensated by transformation with a plasmid carrying either the gyrA or the gyrB gene. Simultaneous introduction of both the gyrA and gyrB plasmids corrected the phenotypic defect of parC and parE mutants. The results suggest that DNA gyrase can substitute for topo IV at least in some part of the function for chromosome partitioning. Antisera were prepared against the purified ParC, ParE, GyrA, and GyrB proteins and used to investigate cellular localization of these gene products. ParC protein was found to be specifically associated with inner membranes only in the presence of DNA. This result suggests that one of the functions of topo IV might be to anchor chromosomes on membranes as previously proposed for eukaryotic topoisomerase II."

https://openalex.org/W1607645391,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) results in down-modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. In this study, the recombinant subunit combination alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The resulting channel was shown to be modulated by 2 microM oleoylacetylglycerol or, stereo-specifically, by low concentrations (10 nM) of the phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. By site-specific mutagenesis, we altered the serine or threonine residues of consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC in the large, intracellular domain of alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2S. Mutant subunits were co-expressed with wild type subunits to yield alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S combinations. All of the tested 14 mutations did not affect the level of expression of GABA current. Two of these mutations, Ser-410 in beta 2 and Ser-327 in gamma 2S, resulted in a significant reduction of the effect of the activator of PKC, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, on the GABA current amplitude. Thus, we have identified two single serine residues, Ser-410 in the subunit beta 2 and Ser-327 in gamma 2S, as phosphorylation sites of a PKC endogenous to Xenopus oocytes. Co-expression of the mutant subunits suggests that phosphorylation of both sites is required for a full, PKC-mediated down-regulation of GABA currents."
https://openalex.org/W2052830287,"Two types of ryanodine receptors, channels for Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, are known. We detected the skeletal muscle type only in cerebellum by immunoblot analysis of microsomes and partially purified proteins. The cardiac muscle type was found in all parts of the mouse brain. Immunohistochemical study showed that the cardiac muscle type was localized mainly at the somata of most neurons. Analysis of mutant cerebella suggested that the skeletal muscle type was present exclusively in Purkinje cells. These results suggest that Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, probably mediated by the cardiac muscle receptor, functions generally in various neurons, whereas depolarization-induced Ca2+ release, probably mediated by the skeletal muscle receptor, functions specifically in Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605991890,"To elaborate the catalytic activity of Cu2+ of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the generation of hydroxyl radical (.OH) from H2O2, we investigated the mechanism of inactivation of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI), mediated by H2O2 and Cu,Zn-SOD. When alpha 1-PI was incubated with 500 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD and 1.0 mM H2O2, 60% of anti-elastase activity of alpha 1-PI was lost within 90 min. ESR spin trapping using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide showed that free .OH was indeed generated in the reaction of Cu,Zn-SOD/H2O2; this was substantiated by the almost complete eradication of .OH by either ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide accompanied by the generation of carbon-centered radicals. .OH production and alpha 1-PI inactivation in the H2O2/SOD system became apparent at 30 min or later. Dimethyl sulfoxide and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide protected inactivation of alpha 1-PI significantly in this system, indicating that alpha 1-PI inactivation was mediated by .OH. SOD activity decreased rapidly during the reaction with H2O2 for the initial 30 min. Time-dependent changes in the ESR signal of SOD showed the destruction of ligands for Cu2+ in SOD by H2O2 within this initial period. Thus we conclude that inactivation of alpha 1-PI is mediated in the H2O2/Cu,Zn-SOD system via the generation of .OH by free Cu2+ released from oxidatively damaged SOD."
https://openalex.org/W1927626441,"Monoclonal antibodies raised against the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of bovine phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase were found to recognize uncomplexed p85 or p85 in the active PI 3-kinase. Immunoprecipitation studies of Chinese hamster ovary cells, which overexpress the human insulin receptor when treated with insulin, showed increased amounts of p85 and PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitable with monoclonal anti-p85 antibody and no increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85. Insulin also induced an association of p85 with the tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and other phosphorylated proteins ranging in size from 100 to 170 kDa but not with the activated insulin receptor. In vitro reconstitution studies were used to show p85 in the active PI 3-kinase associated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 but not with the activated insulin receptor. Competition studies using synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 revealed that phosphopeptides containing YMXM motifs inhibited this association with different potencies, whereas nonphosphorylated analogues and a phosphopeptide containing the EYYE motif had no effect. Src homology region 2 domains of p85 expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins also bound to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. These results suggest that insulin causes the association of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1 via phosphorylated YMXM motifs of IRS-1 and Src homology region 2 domains of p85."
https://openalex.org/W1537406409,"The mutant murine lymphoma cell line RMA-S is unable to present endogenous antigens due to its inability to efficiently assemble class I major histocompatibility complex molecules and antigenic peptides. Therefore, it has been suggested that RMA-S cells are defective either in peptide generation or in peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, where class I major histocompatibility complex molecule assembly is believed to occur. As proteasomes and the putative peptide transporters HAM1 and HAM2 have been implicated in class I antigen processing, we have investigated their expression in RMA-S and its wild-type counterpart RMA. Both proteasomes and HAM1 proteins are expressed at similar levels and show identical subcellular distributions in the two cell lines. However, only one copy of the HAM2 gene is present in RMA-S cells, and it contains a point mutation that leads to a premature stop codon. Thus, the HAM2 protein is absent from RMA-S cells. These data demonstrate that HAM2 is essential for peptide loading onto class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1603982316,"Treating the liposome-intercalatable heparan sulfate proteoglycans from human lung fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC revealed different core protein patterns in the two cell types. Lung fibroblasts expressed heparan sulfate proteoglycans with core proteins of approximately 35, 48/90 (fibroglycan), 64 (glypican), and 125 kDa and traces of a hybrid proteoglycan which carried both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. The mammary epithelial cells, in contrast, expressed large amounts of a hybrid proteoglycan and heparan sulfate proteoglycans with core proteins of approximately 35 and 64 kDa, but the fibroglycan and 125-kDa cores were not detectable in these cells. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and monoclonal antibody (mAb) S1 identified the 64-kDa core proteins as glypican, whereas mAb 2E9, which also reacted with proteoglycan from mouse mammary epithelial cells, tentatively identified the hybrid proteoglycans as syndecan. The expression of syndecan in lung fibroblasts was confirmed by amplifying syndecan cDNA sequences from fibroblastic mRNA extracts and demonstrating the cross-reactivity of the encoded recombinant core protein with mAb 2E9. Northern blots failed to detect a message for fibroglycan in the mammary epithelial cells and in several other epithelial cell lines tested, while confirming the expression of both glypican and syndecan in these cells. Confluent fibroblasts expressed higher levels of syndecan mRNA than exponentially growing fibroblasts, but these levels remained lower than observed in epithelial cells. These data formally identify one of the cell surface proteoglycans of human lung fibroblasts as syndecan and indicate that the expression of the cell surface proteoglycans varies in different cell types and under different culture conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1480565731,"A 5417-base pair (bp) region of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO chromosomal DNA containing the mmsAB operon and an upstream regulatory gene (mmsR) has been cloned and characterized. The operon contains two structural genes involved in valine metabolism: mmsA, which encodes methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase; and mmsB, which encodes 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. mmsA and mmsB share the same orientation and are separated by a 16-bp noncoding region. The transcriptional start site for the operon has been pinpointed to a cytidine residue located 77 bp from the translational start site of the operon. mmsR is located on the opposite strand and begins 134 bp from the translational start site of mmsA. MmsR has been identified as a member of the XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators and appears to act as a positive regulator of the mmsAB operon. Sequence comparison of MmsA to other proteins in the data bases revealed that MmsA belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) superfamily. MmsB shares a 44% amino acid identity with 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase from rat liver. Mutants with insertionally inactivated mmsR, mmsA, and mmsB grow slowly on valine/isoleucine medium and exhibit reduced enzyme activity in cell-free extracts compared to P. aeruginosa PAO."
https://openalex.org/W1664447505,"The receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the product of the c-met proto-oncogene, a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase receptor. To facilitate analysis of HGF and its receptor (HGFr), we expressed and purified a chimeric protein containing the extracellular domain (ECD) of the HGFr fused to the constant region of IgG heavy chain. This soluble form of the HGFr (sHGFr) bound HGF with an affinity similar to that of the authentic, membrane-associated receptor. The sHGFr also neutralized the binding of HGF to the HGFr expressed on A549 cells. Like the mature form of the HGFr, sHGFr is a heterodimer which arises by proteolytic processing within the ECD. In order to characterize the requirements for proteolytic processing of the ECD and the effects of cleavage on ligand binding, we expressed sHGFr variants containing amino acid substitutions in the putative processing site. Replacement of the P1 or P4 arginine, but not the P3 lysine, with alanine inhibited conversion to the alpha/beta heterodimer. This suggests that maturation is mediated by furin or a furin-like protease. Finally, we showed that processing of the sHGFr into the alpha/beta form is not required for high affinity binding to either pro- or mature HGF."

https://openalex.org/W2003459389,"Intracellular loading of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs into innervated muscle cells in Xenopus cultures led to a marked increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs), while extracellular application of the drugs at the same concentration was without effect. The increase in SSC frequency appeared to be unrelated to changes in the muscle membrane sensitivity toward acetylcholine (ACh), but resulted from an elevated spontaneous ACh secretion from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Postsynaptic loading of arachidonic acid (AA) produced a similar effect as the GTP analogs, and the potentiation effect of both GTP analogs and AA was reversed by an inhibitor of AA metabolism, AA861. Further studies indicate that a lipoxygenase metabolite, 5-HPETE, appears to be a likely candidate for the retrograde factor involved in modulating ACh secretion. These results suggest that G protein activation of the AA cascade in the postsynaptic cell could produce a retrograde signal to modulate transmitter secretion from the presynaptic nerve terminal at developing synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1561878609,"There are at least three isozymes (C alpha, C beta, and C gamma) of the mammalian catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Beebe, S., Oyen, O., Sandberg, M., Froysa, A., Hansson, V., and Jahnsen, T. (1990) Mol. Endocrinol. 4, 465-475). To compare the C gamma and C alpha isozymes, the respective cDNAs were expressed in permanently transformed Kin-8 PKA-deficient Y1 adrenal cells using the mouse metallothionein promoter. The recombinant C subunits were characterized as immunoreactive, zinc-inducible, cAMP-dependent kinase activities. In contrast to C alpha, histone was a better substrate than Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) for C gamma. Furthermore, C gamma histone kinase activity was not inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor peptide (5-24 amide), which has been widely used as a PKA-specific inhibitor. The major C gamma peak (type I) eluted from DEAE-Sepharose at a higher NaCl concentration (120 mM) than the C alpha type I eluted (70 mM). C gamma and C alpha type II eluted between 220 and 240 mM NaCl. C gamma required higher concentrations of cAMP than C alpha did for dissociation from the mutant type I holoenzyme. These differences provided a basis for the separation of the mutant RI-associated isozymes on DEAE-Sepharose. Both C alpha (41-42 kDa) and C gamma (39-40 kDa) were identified by a C subunit antibody after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Zinc induced the PKA-mediated rounding phenotype in C gamma and C alpha clones, thereby restoring the cells to the parent Y1 adrenal cell phenotype. Collectively, these data indicate that C gamma is an active PKA C subunit but suggest that C gamma and C alpha have different protein and peptide recognition determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1580476552,"Guanylate kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the acceptor molecule GMP. Detailed analysis of the in vivo function of this enzyme has been limited by the lack of any genetic data. Using oligonucleotides based on amino acid sequence information of the yeast enzyme, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, GUK1, was isolated and characterized. The gene is present in single copy and maps to chromosome IV. Insertional mutagenesis of the GUK1 locus caused recessive lethality, indicating that this enzyme is necessary for vegetative cell growth. Using inducible expression systems, guanylate kinase was produced in large amounts both in S. cerevisiae and in Escherichia coli."

https://openalex.org/W1930274849,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an amphiphilic cAMP-binding glycoprotein at the outer face of the plasma membrane (M(r) = 54,000). It is converted to a hydrophilic form by treatment with glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C and D (GPI-PLC/D), suggesting membrane anchorage by a covalently bound glycolipid. Determination of the constituents of the purified anchor by gas-liquid chromatography and amino acid analysis reveals the presence of glycerol, myo-inositol, glucosamine, galactose, mannose, ethanolamine, and asparagine (as the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the Pronase-digested protein to which the anchor is attached). Complementary results are obtained by metabolic labeling, indicating that fatty acids and phosphorus are additional anchor constituents. The phosphorus is resistant to alkaline phosphatase, whereas approximately half is lost from the protein after treatment with GPI-PLD or nitrous acid, and all is removed by aqueous HF indicating the presence of two phosphodiester bonds. Inhibition of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin or removal of protein-bound glycan chains by N-glycanase or Pronase does not abolish radiolabeling of the anchor structure by any of the above compounds. Analysis of the products obtained after sequential enzymic and chemical degradation of the anchor agrees with the arrangement of constituents in GPIs from higher eucaryotes. Evidence for anchorage of the yeast cAMP-binding protein by a GPI anchor is strengthened additionally by the reactivity of the GPI-PLC-cleaved anchor with antibodies directed against the cross-reacting determinant of trypanosomal variant surface glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1632575500,"Abstract Using site-directed mutagenesis, a double mutant in yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) has been constructed where the proximal ligand, His175, has been converted to glutamine and the neighboring Trp191 has been converted to phenylalanine. The refined 2.4-A crystal structure of the double mutant shows that the Gln175 side chain is within coordination distance of the heme iron atom and that Phe191 occupies the same position as Trp191 in the native enzyme with very little rearrangement outside the immediate vicinity of the mutations. Consistent with earlier work, we find that the single mutant, His175-->Gln, is fully active under steady state assay conditions and that as reported earlier (Mauro et al., 1988), the Trp191-->Phe mutant exhibits only Gln/Phe191-->Phe, exhibits 20% wild type activity. Since it is known that the Trp191-->Phe mutant is inactive because it can no longer transfer electrons from ferrocytochrome c, changing the nature of the proximal ligand is able to restore this activity. These results raise interesting questions regarding the mechanism of interprotein electron transfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1605770912,"Previous studies (Bulant, M., Delfour, A., Vaudry, H., and Nicolas, P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17189-17196; Bulant, M., Roussel, J. P., Astier, H., Nicolas, P., and Vaudry, H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 4439-4443) have shown that post-translational processing of rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone prohormone (pro-TRH) generates, besides thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a connecting decapeptide corresponding to prepro-TRH-(160-169), i.e. Ser-Phe-Pro-Trp-Met-Glu-Ser-Asp-Val-Thr. This peptide, which is named TRH-potentiating peptide (Ps4), is co-localized with TRH in the median eminence nerve endings and is involved in potentiation of the action of TRH on thyrotropin hormone release by pituitary in vitro and in vivo. To characterize the receptor(s) for TRH-potentiating peptide in the pituitary, a highly potent and metabolically stable derivative of Ps4, [I-Tyr0]Ps4, was radioiodinated. Binding of [125I-Tyr-0]Ps4 to rat pituitary membrane homogenates was specific, saturable, reversible, and linear with membrane protein concentration. Equilibrium measurements performed over a large range of concentrations revealed a single homogeneous population of high affinity binding sites (Kd = 0.22 nM; Bmax = 517 fmol/mg of membrane proteins). Several naturally occurring neuropeptides and hormones, including TRH, did not compete with [125I-Tyr0]Ps4 in the binding, which suggests the binding sites are specific to Ps4. Using C-terminal deletion analogs of [Tyr0]Ps4, we further showed the critical role the C-terminal residues Thr10, Val9, and Asp8 play in conferring high binding affinity and selectivity. Binding site tissue distribution and cross-reactivity binding studies suggest that the action of TRH-potentiating peptide is mediated through interaction with a specific pituitary cell-surface receptor which differ from those for TRH. [I-Tyr0]Ps4 reported in this paper, through its high binding affinity and specificity, its very low nonspecific binding, its high resistance to enzymatic degradation, and its high potentiating action in vitro should allow further progress in understanding the in vivo physiological function of Ps4."

https://openalex.org/W1538828154,"We have investigated (by use of intact and saponinpermeabilized canine hepatocytes) the roles of Mg2+ and guanyl nucleotides in regulating glucagon-receptor interactions. In contrast to intact cells, saponinpermeabilized hepatocytes bind [[125I]iodo-Tyr10]glucagon according to a single first-order process and exhibit a single apparent dissociation constant for glucagon binding during steady-state incubations. Further analysis of the permeabilized cell system demonstrated (a) the temperature-sensitive action of Mg2+ to enhance the extent and affinity of glucagon-receptor interactions at steady-state, (b) the conversion of Mg(2+)-independent hormone-receptor complexes to Mg(2+)-dependent complexes, (c) the effect of guanyl nucleotides to inhibit specifically the Mg(2+)-dependent component of glucagon-receptor interactions, (d) the more rapid association of glucagon with receptor during cell incubations occurring in the presence of guanyl nucleotides or in the absence of Mg2+, and (e) the ability of guanyl nucleotides to induce both high and low affinity states of glucagon-receptor interactions. Additional experiments identified an effect of cell incubations in the presence of glucagon to limit the subsequent binding of hormone, the ability of GDP, GTP, or guanosine-5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to dissociate previously bound glucagon, and a specific requirement for GDP to re-activate the glucagon receptor for additional cycles of hormone binding. A model is presented in which (a) glucagon binds to receptor in a Mg(2+)-independent fashion, (b) glucagon-receptor complexes are converted to a Mg(2+)-dependent state, (c) guanyl nucleotide exchange initiates both an alteration in glucagon-receptor affinity and the subsequent dissociation of hormone, and (d) in the context of the intact cell, G protein-mediated hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is required to reinitialize the system."
