https://openalex.org/W2113239055,"The tumor suppressor p53, encoded by the TP53 gene, is recognized as the guardian of the human genome because it regulates many downstream genes to exercise its function in cell cycle and cell death. Recent studies have revealed that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of the p53 tumor suppressor network with miR-125b and miR-504 directly targeting TP53. In this study, we use a screening method to identify that two miRNAs (miR-25 and miR-30d) directly target the 3′UTR of TP53 to downregulate p53 protein levels and reduce the expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by p53. Correspondingly, both miR-25 and miR-30d adversely affect apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Inhibition of either miR-25 or miR-30d expression increases endogenous p53 expression and elevates cellular apoptosis in several cell lines, including one from multiple myeloma that has little TP53 mutations. Thus, beyond miR-125b and miR-504, the human TP53 gene is negatively regulated by two more miRNAs: miR-25 and miR-30d."
https://openalex.org/W1987742709,"The Polycomb group (PcG) protein, enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), has an essential role in promoting histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and epigenetic gene silencing. This function of EZH2 is important for cell proliferation and inhibition of cell differentiation, and is implicated in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that under physiological conditions, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylate EZH2 at Thr 350 in an evolutionarily conserved motif. Phosphorylation of Thr 350 is important for recruitment of EZH2 and maintenance of H3K27me3 levels at EZH2-target loci. Blockage of Thr 350 phosphorylation not only diminishes the global effect of EZH2 on gene silencing, it also mitigates EZH2-mediated cell proliferation and migration. These results demonstrate that CDK-mediated phosphorylation is a key mechanism governing EZH2 function and that there is a link between the cell-cycle machinery and epigenetic gene silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2020323703,"The mobilization and extracellular release of nuclear high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) by ischemic cells activates inflammatory pathways following liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In immune cells such as macrophages, post-translational modification by acetylation appears to be critical for active HMGB1 release. Hyperacetylation shifts its equilibrium from a predominant nuclear location toward cytosolic accumulation and subsequent release. However, mechanisms governing its release by parenchymal cells such as hepatocytes are unknown. In this study, we found that serum HMGB1 released following liver I/R in vivo is acetylated, and that hepatocytes exposed to oxidative stress in vitro also released acetylated HMGB1. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that remove acetyl groups and control the acetylation status of histones and various intracellular proteins. Levels of acetylated HMGB1 increased with a concomitant decrease in total nuclear HDAC activity, suggesting that suppression in HDAC activity contributes to the increase in acetylated HMGB1 release after oxidative stress in hepatocytes. We identified the isoforms HDAC1 and HDAC4 as critical in regulating acetylated HMGB1 release. Activation of HDAC1 was decreased in the nucleus of hepatocytes undergoing oxidative stress. In addition, HDAC1 knockdown with siRNA promoted HMGB1 translocation and release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HDAC4 is shuttled from the nucleus to cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress, resulting in decreased HDAC activity in the nucleus. Together, these findings suggest that decreased nuclear HDAC1 and HDAC4 activities in hepatocytes following liver I/R is a mechanism that promotes the hyperacetylation and subsequent release of HMGB1.

High Mobility Group Box Protein 1 (HMGB1) 3The abbreviations used are: HMGB1high mobility group box 1HDAChistone deacetylaseI/Rischemia/reperfusionTSAtrichostatin A. is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear molecule that functions as a structural protein of chromatin (1Bustin M. Hopkins R.B. Isenberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1694-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its nuclear role, HMGB1 also functions as an inflammatory cytokine when released from necrotic cells or actively secreted from stressed cells. Its proinflammatory properties were first highlighted in experiments showing that HMGB1 is actively secreted by activated macrophages, serving as a late mediator of lethality in sepsis (2Wang H. Bloom O. Zhang M. Vishnubhakat J.M. Ombrellino M. Che J. Frazier A. Yang H. Ivanova S. Borovikova L. Manogue K.R. Faist E. Abraham E. Andersson J. Andersson U. Molina P.E. Abumrad N.N. Sama A. Tracey K.J. Science. 1999; 285: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). Whereas HMGB1 is involved in the late systemic inflammatory response to sepsis, our laboratory demonstrated that HMGB1 is a central and necessary mediator of organ damage following acute, sterile organ injury (3Tsung A. Sahai R. Tanaka H. Nakao A. Fink M.P. Lotze M.T. Yang H. Li J. Tracey K.J. Geller D.A. Billiar T.R. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 4Levy R.M.

Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and activates proinflammatory signaling pathways by activating pattern recognition receptors including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) (5Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. J. Biol.

Mounting evidence suggests HMGB1 may also function to facilitate the recognition of other immune co-activators such as LPS, DNA, and IL-1 through avid binding to these molecules (7Sha Y. Zmijewski J.

Thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of liver I/R is vital, as it is commonly encountered clinically during elective liver surgical procedures, solid organ transplantation, trauma, and hypovolemic shock. The liver exhibits both direct cellular damage as the result of the ischemic insult as well as further dysfunction and damage resulting from activation of inflammatory pathways (10Vardanian A.J. Busuttil R.W. Kupiec-Weglinski J.W. Mol. Med. 2008; 14: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that hepatocytes actively release HMGB1 in response to oxidative stress, suggesting that these parenchymal cells can provide danger signals to neighboring immune cells in the liver to promote inflammation and organ damage (11Tsung A. Klune J.R. Zhang X. Jeyabalan G. Cao Z. Peng X. Stolz D.B. Geller D.A. Rosengart M.R. Billiar T.R. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2913-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Although HMGB1 can be passively released following necrosis, our findings demonstrate that oxidative stress in hepatocytes leads to early shuttling from the nucleus to cytoplasm, followed by its subsequent release in the absence of cell death. This suggests that HMGB1 mobilization in these cells is an active, regulated process. The pathways governing HMGB1 release from hepatocytes are unclear, although proximal events are known to involve TLR4 activation and calcium signaling through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) (11Tsung A. Klune J.R. Zhang X. Jeyabalan G. Cao Z. Peng X. Stolz D.B. Geller D.A. Rosengart M.R. Billiar T.R. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2913-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In other cell types, downstream events governing HMGB1 release have been linked to oxidation/reduction (12Hoppe G. Talcott K.E. Bhattacharya S.K. Crabb J.W. Sears J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3526-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and post-translational modifications that include phosphorylation (13Youn J.H. Shin J.S. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7889-7897Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and acetylation (14Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A. Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). However, in liver I/R it is unknown if post-translational modifications of HMGB1 regulate its release from hepatocytes. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes, which remove acetyl groups from lysine residues (15de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). While these enzymes were named according to their ability to modify histone proteins, they also play important roles in regulating the acetylation status of non-histone proteins (16Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 17Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). Recent findings demonstrate that HMGB1 export from the nucleus and subsequent excretion in monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) involved hyperacetylation. Interestingly, HDAC inhibition also promoted HMGB1 hyperacetylation and extracellular release, suggesting a role for HDACs in regulating HMGB1 (14Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A. Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine the role of HDACs in mediating HMGB1 acetylation and release in hepatocytes following liver I/R. We show in an in vivo model that serum HMGB1 is acetylated, and that this process is dependent on a reduction in nuclear HDAC activity in response to oxidative stress. Thus, the fraction of hyperacetylated HMGB1 increases, promoting its translocation and release. We further investigate the role of the HDAC isoforms, HDAC1 and HDAC4, in regulating post-translational modifications of HMGB1 to influence its translocation and release from oxidative stressed hepatocytes. All animals were maintained in a laminar-flow, pathogen-free atmosphere at the University of Pittsburgh. Animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh, and the experiments were conducted in adherence to the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Use of Laboratory Animals. Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and were used at the age of 8–12 weeks and the weight of 25–35 g. A previously described I/R protocol involving a nonlethal model of segmental (70%) hepatic warm ischemia was used (18Tsung A. Stang M.T. Ikeda A. Critchlow N.D. Izuishi K. Nakao A. Chan M.H. Jeyabalan G. Yim J.H. Geller D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 290: G1261-G1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Sham animals underwent anesthesia, laparotomy, and exposure of the portal triad without hepatic ischemia. Baseline or untreated animals were given anesthesia and sacrificed without exposure of the portal triad. Hepatocytes were isolated from mice by an in situ collagenase (type IV, Sigma) perfusion technique as described previously (19West M.A. Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. Hyland B.J. Simmons R.L. Gastroenterology. 1989; 96: 1572-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte purity exceeded 98% as assessed by light microscopy, and viability was typically greater than 95% as determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Hepatocytes (3 × 106) were plated onto 6-cm gelatin-coated plastic tissue culture dishes. The initial culture medium was William's medium E containing 10% calf serum, 15 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Hepatocytes were allowed to attach to the plates overnight. The medium was then changed before addition of chemical inhibitors. For hypoxia experiments, the medium was replaced with hypoxic medium (equilibrated with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2), and placed into a hypoxia chamber (Coy). Frozen liver tissues were suspended in a buffer that contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and lysed by homogenization. The samples were gently vortexed every 5 min for 30 min and then centrifuged at 7,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant that contained cytoplasmic and membrane protein was collected and stored at −80 °C. Nuclear proteins were extracted at 4 °C by gently resuspending the nuclei pellet in buffer that contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After 1 h with occasional vortexing, resuspended nuclear proteins were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant that contained nuclear proteins was collected. Protein concentration was determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). 20 μg of protein was diluted in SDS buffer and run on SDS-PAGE gels (8, 10, 12%). Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose overnight, and blocked with 5% BSA for 8 h. They were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies, which included anti-HMGB1 (1:1000; Abcam); anti-acetyl-lysine (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-HDAC1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-pHDAC1 (1:1000; Abcam); anti-HDAC4 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-pHDAC4 (1:1000; Abcam), anti-histone H3, Ac-H3 Lys9, Ac-H3 Lys18 (1:1000; Cell Signaling). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000 to 1:10,000) in 5% milk for 1 h and developed with the Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). HDAC Activity Colorimetric Assay kit (Abcam, ab1432) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 μg of nuclear protein was diluted in a final volume of 85 μl of ddH2O and placed in a round bottom 96-well plate. 10 μl of the 10× assay buffer was added to each well followed by 5 μl of the HDAC colorimetric substrate. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. 10 μl of Lysine Developer was then added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The sample was read in an ELISA plate reader at 405 nm. Cells were cultured on coverslips and washed twice with cold PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked for 1 h with 5% BSA in PBS. Then cells were incubated with the specific primary antibody for HMGB1 (Abcam, ab18256) in 1% BSA for 1 h, washed, and incubated with secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, Invitrogen). F-actin was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen). Cells were mounted with Vecta-Shield Mounting media with DAPI nuclear stain. Slides were viewed with Olympus Provis and Leica TSL-SL immunofluorescent microscopes. Murine hepatocytes at a concentration of 2.0 × 106 were seeded in 6-cm dishes. Hepatocytes were allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed and transfected for 6 h in Opti-Mem serum-free medium with siRNA for HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-29344) or a scrambled, control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-37007) using Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Total levels of HDAC1 mRNA and protein were analyzed at 24 h and 40 h, respectively. For HDAC1 mRNA expression, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the Titanium One-Step PCR kit (Clontech) with primers for HDAC1-HDAC9. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 μg of antibodies against acetyl-lysine or HMGB1 in 200 μg whole lysate protein or 40 μl of serum diluted in IP buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA). Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. Samples were first precleared with a nonspecific IgG antibody. Precleared lysates were then incubated with antibody either to anti-acetyl-lysine or HMGB1 overnight, and then incubated for 2 h with protein A/G-agarose. Samples were washed four times with PBS and subjected to Western blot analysis. Hepatocytes were analyzed using a high content analysis platform on an Arrayscan VTi (Cellomics). Hepatocytes in 96-well plates were fixed and stained for HMGB1, and subsequently analyzed for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining intensities using Spotfire Decisionsite software. Hepatocytes that accumulated HMGB1 in the cytoplasm in each treatment group were quantified using a staining intensity threshold for cytoplasmic HMGB1. Acetylation is a post-translational modification that can influence protein localization and function. In monocytes stimulated with LPS, hyperacetylation of HMGB1 allows nuclear shuttling of the protein into the cytoplasm and subsequent release (14Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A. Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). To determine the acetylation status of HMGB1 after liver I/R injury, mice were subjected to hepatic I/R and levels of acetylated HMGB1 assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from liver whole cell lysates (Fig. 1A). One hour of ischemia without reperfusion induced a detectable difference in the amount of acetylated HMGB1, and it was also detectable at 1 h of reperfusion. These results were followed by the appearance of acetylated HMGB1 in the serum after reperfusion (Fig. 1, B and C). First we immunoblotted serum samples with anti-acetyl-lysine and observed a strong band appearing at 29 kDa, the molecular mass of HMGB1. Furthermore, the band intensity increased at 1 h and 6 h reperfusion. To identify acetylated HMGB1 in the serum, we co-immunoprecipitated with anti-HMGB1 and immunoblotted with anti-acetyl-lysine. Again, the strongest signals were observed at 1 h and 6 h of reperfusion. We should note, however, that we observed a low but detectable signal in both the control Rabbit IgG pull-down sample and sham-operated animals co-immunoprecipitated with anti-HMGB1. We believe this is due to HMGB1's nonspecific interaction IgG (20Urbonaviciute V. Fürnrohr B.G. Weber C. Haslbeck M. Wilhelm S. Herrmann M. Voll R.E. J Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), as we observed this phenomenon only in serum samples. The blots were stripped and re-probed for HMGB1 to confirm pull-down, and we observed an identical pattern, suggesting that serum HMGB1 is acetylated after hepatic I/R injury. To further investigate the role of acetylation in regulating HMGB1 release in vitro, we used primary cultured hepatocytes, which we have shown to be the main source of actively secreted HMGB1 in liver I/R injury. Hypoxia is believed to be the initiating event during I/R; thus, we assessed acetylated HMGB1 in cultured hepatocytes exposed to hypoxia. We found that 1% hypoxia also induced acetylation of HMGB1 in hepatocytes (Fig. 1, D and E). Using co-immunoprecipitation from hepatocyte whole cell lysates, we found a time-dependent increase in acetylated HMGB1 beginning as early as 3 h of hypoxia. A parallel pattern was observed in the cell culture supernatants (Fig. 1E). Combined, these findings demonstrate that liver I/R and hypoxic stress in hepatocytes result in the acetylation and release of HMGB1. Because the level of acetylated HMGB1 increased with liver I/R and hypoxia, we used colorimetric assays to asses nuclear HDAC activity during I/R. We found that nuclear HDAC activity was significantly decreased in liver tissue from animals subjected to I/R compared with baseline animals during ischemia and early reperfusion (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, levels of acetylated histone H3 were also increased after I/R at Lys-9 and Lys-18 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that a reduction in nuclear HDAC activity leads a net increase in the nuclear acetylation/deacetylation balance, which promotes HMGB1 hyperacetylation. In vitro, nuclear HDAC activity was also suppressed in hepatocytes by 1% hypoxia at 8 h and 24 h (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that HDAC activity is suppressed in vivo during I/R and in vitro during hypoxia. This, in turn, contributes to hyperacetylation of HDAC substrates, including histones and HMGB1. To further investigate the relationship between HDACs and HMGB1, mouse hepatocytes were treated with an HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). TSA has previously been examined in cultured rat hepatocytes (21Henkens T. Papeleu P. Elaut G. Vinken M. Rogiers V. Vanhaecke T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2007; 218: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Vanhaecke T. Henkens T. Kass G.E. Rogiers V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), with doses of up to 50 μm being well tolerated. We found a dose of 1 μm to be non-toxic to hepatocytes in normoxic or hypoxic culture conditions up to 24 h following treatment (Fig. 3A). Hepatocytes were treated with TSA for 24 h, and Western blot analysis of the cell culture supernatants for HMGB1 was performed. In contrast to the low amount of HMGB1 in the supernatant seen at baseline, TSA induced levels of HMGB1 release into the supernatant similar to that seen with H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition, we found a dose-dependent relationship between TSA treatment and the amount of acetylated HMGB1 in cell culture supernatants, suggesting a relationship between HMGB1 acetylation and its extracellular release (Fig. 3C). Next, we treated hepatocytes with TSA for 8 h and performed immunofluorescent staining for HMGB1. Untreated hepatocytes exhibited strong nuclear localization of HMGB1, while both HDAC inhibition and stimulation with H2O2 induced nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 at 8 h (Fig. 3D). We also used high content analysis to quantify the effect of HDAC inhibition on HMGB1 translocation in hepatocytes (Fig. 3E). As expected, treatment with 8 h hypoxia resulted in a dramatic increase in the fraction of viable hepatocytes in which HMGB1 translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, TSA treatment in normoxia induced a dose-dependent, statistically significant increase in the fraction of HMGB1 translocation-positive cells. We also used another HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid, and its inactive analog, Nullscript, to investigate the effect of HDAC inhibition on HMGB1 translocation. Crystal violet staining revealed a dose of 10 mm to be non-toxic to hepatocytes (data not shown). By Western blot analysis, the majority of HMGB1 was found in the nucleus at baseline. Addition of Scriptaid induced HMGB1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol at 8 h (Fig. 3F). In contrast, the Nullscript-treated hepatocytes maintained a constant nuclear-to-cytosolic ratio of HMGB1. These results show that HDAC inhibition promotes nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and release of acetylated HMGB1 from hepatocytes, and they support a role for HDAC regulation of HMGB1. The above inhibitors of HDACs are not specific for a particular HDAC isoform, and the HDAC activity assays measure the activity of all HDACs. To first determine HDAC subtype(s) expressed most strongly in mouse hepatocytes, RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from hepatocyte cultures. The mostly highly expressed HDAC mRNAs were HDAC1 and 4 (Fig. 4A). Next, to assess whether HDAC1 and HDAC4 were altered in response to I/R injury, mice were subjected to liver I/R, and Western blots analysis was performed on protein from sham and 1 h I/R animals. Consistent with the in vitro results, HDAC1 and HDAC4 proteins were expressed in the mouse liver (Fig. 4B). In addition, protein levels of HDAC1 and HDAC4 were unchanged following I/R. Thus, we hypothesized that that the reduction in overall nuclear HDAC activity following I/R or oxidative stress was due to regulation of HDAC1 and HDAC4 rather than changes in their overall total protein levels. Next, we focused on deacetylase activity of HDAC1, as its activity is determined, in part, by its phosphorylation status (23Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 24Sengupta N. Seto E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We examined if liver I/R altered HDAC1 phosphorylation status. Compared with baseline, 1 h of ischemia resulted in a decrease in phosporylated HDAC1 (Fig. 4C). Upon reperfusion, levels of phosphorylated HDAC1 remained low but increased compared with ischemia. We then exposed hepatocytes to 1% hypoxia and Western blot analysis for phosphorylated HDAC1 in nuclear extracts was performed. By 2 h, levels of phosporylated HDAC1 decreased significantly. Thus, hypoxia appears to be a strong stimulus for the dephosphorylation of HDAC1 in hepatocytes. To more specifically investigate the role of HDAC1 in HMGB1 release, hepatocytes were transfected with HDAC1 siRNA and subjected to 8 h of hypoxia. Addition of HDAC1 siRNA, but not scrambled siRNA, decreased the levels of HDAC1 mRNA and protein in both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 5, A and B). We then assessed HMGB1 localization under baseline and hypoxia conditions in the HDAC1 siRNA treated cells. Addition of HDAC1 siRNA to normoxic cells mobilized HMGB1 out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and after hypoxia, even more HMGB1 translocated into the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis of supernatants from these hepatocytes supported these findings. Hypoxia alone caused an increase in HMGB1 release. This effect was augmented by HDAC1 knockdown, while the addition of scrambled siRNA had no effect (Fig. 5D). Our findings show HDAC1 has a potential role in altering HMGB1 localization and release. The nuclear activities of class II HDACs (e.g. HDAC4) are regulated in part by shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of HDAC4 promotes its translocation to the cytoplasm, resulting in decreased HDAC activity in the nucleus (25Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5992-6005Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Nishino T.G. Miyazaki M. Hoshino H. Miwa Y. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 377: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that liver I/R is also a stimulus for HDAC4 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic shuttling. We performed Western blot analysis for phospho-HDAC4 on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of liver tissue from mice subjected to I/R (Fig. 6A). In sham-treated animals, a low basal level of phospho-HDAC4 was detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Nuclear phospho-HDAC4 levels increased as early as 30 min reperfusion and peaked at 1 h. By 2 h reperfusion, the amount of nuclear phospho-HDAC4 began to decrease. This pattern was consistent with results observed in the cytoplasmic fraction. We observed a time-dependent increase in cytoplasmic phospho-HDAC4 from baseline sham levels. We also measured total cytoplasmic HDAC activity in these samples by colorimetric HDAC assay. Compared with sham-operated mice, total cytoplasmic HDAC activity increased following I/R (Fig. 6B). We interpret these results to indicate that the overall cytoplasmic HDAC activity increase is due, at least in part, to shuttling of active, phosphorylated HDAC4 into the cytoplasm. We also investigated HDAC4 shuttling in vitro in hepatocytes. In response to oxidative stress by H2O2 and hypoxia, increased levels of phospho-HDAC4 were observed in the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis for HDAC4 and phosopho-HDAC4 were performed on hepatocyte cytoplasmic fractions following H2O2 stimulation, where we observed a time-dependent increase in this compartment (Fig. 6C). Immunofluorescent staining for phospho-HDAC4 was also performed on hepatocytes stimulated with hypoxia for 1 h (Fig. 6D). In normoxic controls, phospho-HDAC4 staining was positive in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, while in hypoxic cells the nuclear phospho-HDAC4 signal was not observed. Collectively, these data demonstrate that nuclear HDAC4 is phosphorylated in vivo by I/R and in vitro by oxidative stress, where it is rapidly shuttled into the cytoplasm. This shuttling contributes to a decrease in total nuclear HDAC activity observed after liver I/R, which favors hyperacetylation and release of HMGB1. Damaged cells activate innate immunity and recruit inflammatory cells by releasing danger signals collectively known as DAMPs. One such molecule is HMGB1, which has been implicated as an early mediator of organ damage in I/R injury and hemorrhagic shock, as well as a late mediator of lethality in endotoxic shock (2Wang H.

Glutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins is a major consequence of oxidative stress, and respiratory substrates are key regulators of mitochondrial redox status (as reflected by thiol/disulfide exchange) by maintaining mitochondrial NADPH levels. IntroductionGSH is the major nonprotein thiol and redox regulator in mitochondria as well as cells (1Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G1-G7Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mitochondria contain a distinct GSH pool important in maintaining a reduced matrix environment and detoxifying H2O2 produced in the matrix (3Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Reed D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Han D. Canali R. Rettori D. Kaplowitz N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, mitochondria are devoid of GSH synthesis machinery and rely strictly on GSH import from the cytosol (6Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4668-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 7Fernández-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. García-Ruiz C. Colell A. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Despite this, the redox status of the mitochondrial GSH pool can function independently of the cytoplasmic redox status. Maintenance of the mitochondrial redox status is largely regulated by the concerted actions of NAPDH-dependent enzymes including: GSSG reductase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin III, and glutaredoxin that directly or indirectly utilize NADPH to keep the mitochondrial matrix reduced (4Reed D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consequently, mitochondrial GSH is predominant in the reduced form with the GSH:GSSG ratio being greater then 100:1 and mitochondrial proteins being predominantly in the reduced thiol state (9Schafer F.Q.

Rev. 2009; 61: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In oxidative stress conditions, increased GSSG formation may lead to glutathionylation of redox-sensitive proteins through thiol-disulfide exchange (11Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M.

Pr-S-+GSSG→PrS-SG+GS-(Eq. 1) A number of mitochondrial proteins have been identified as being glutathionylated, including subunits of complex I (12Taylor E.R. Hurrell F. Shannon R.J. Lin T.K.

Invest. 2001; 108: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); glutathionylation of these proteins is usually associated with a decrease of their activities. Because of the disruption in protein function that GSSG can cause, cells generally pump GSSG out of the cytoplasm into the extracellular matrix. Export of GSSG has been shown to occur in liver and other tissues during times of oxidative stress (1Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sies H. Cadenas E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1985; 311: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Mitochondria, however, do not appear to export GSSG (19Olafsdottir K. Reed D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and GSSG transporters have not been observed on the organelle membranes. This suggests that in oxidative stress conditions, GSSG is sequestered in mitochondria, and glutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins may ensue, leading to a decrease in their activity.NADPH is central for the maintenance of the mitochondrial redox status, because of the direct dependence of GSSG reductase and thioredoxin on NADPH as an electron donor for the reduction of GSSG and disulfide bonds, respectively (10Yap L.P. Garcia J.V. Han D. Cadenas E. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2009; 61: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin 2, the major protein in mitochondria involved in deglutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins, requires GSH to deglutathionylate proteins and therefore is indirectly dependent on NADPH (20Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lönn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The majority of NADPH in mitochondria is believed to be mainly generated from nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, which utilizes NADH to generate NADPH from NADP+ (21Rydström J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Mitochondria also contain malic enzymes and NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, which are believed to be important sources of NADPH (10Yap L.P. Garcia J.V. Han D. Cadenas E. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2009; 61: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that mitochondrial GSH redox status is dependent on NADPH production from various respiratory substrates (i.e. pyruvate, glutamate, and malate). However, the direct regulation of mitochondrial GSH levels by respiratory substrates has not been directly demonstrated. Although the key proteins in maintaining mitochondrial redox status have been identified, the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial GSH redox status in the face of an oxidative challenge has not been clearly demonstrated. This study examines the factors that modulate mitochondrial thiol redox status during the isolation procedure and in energized mitochondria as well as the influence of the latter in mitochondrial protein S-glutathionylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsDTT, Percoll, metaphosphoric acid, CHAPS, 2The abbreviation used is: CHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. rotenone, KCN, and antimycin A were from Sigma.Mitochondria IsolationMitochondria from rat brain or liver was isolated by using either differential centrifugation (22Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 23Han D. Antunes F. Daneri F. Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or discontinuous Percoll gradient (24Schroeter H. Boyd C.S. Ahmed R. Spencer J.P. Duncan R.F. Rice-Evans C. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 25Anderson M.F. Sims N.R. Brain Res. Protoc. 2000; 5: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The isolation buffer for both methods consisted of 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1.0% (w/v) BSA, and 25 μl/100 ml protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4.Differential CentrifugationLivers from rats were excised, washed, and homogenized in isolation buffer using a loose Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was removed, and the centrifugation process was repeated. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min to generate the mitochondria pellet, which was washed with isolation buffer, and the high speed centrifugation was repeated. The mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer (without BSA) before Western blot analysis and other assays.Discontinuous Percoll GradientBrain and liver were excised, washed, and homogenized in isolation buffer using a loose Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was removed, and the centrifugation process was repeated. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min to generate the mitochondria pellet. The mitochondria pellet was dissolved in isolation buffer containing 15% (v/v) Percoll and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondria pellet was gently removed from the Percoll solution and layered on top of three discontinuous Percoll gradient tubes (15, 23, and 40% (v/v)). The Percoll gradient was spun at 30,700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The mitochondria layer, which resides in the interface between 40 and 23% (v/v) Percoll, was carefully removed using a pipette and suspended in isolation buffer. To remove the Percoll, mitochondria were spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min and washed, and the process was repeated twice. The mitochondria were suspended in isolation buffer (without BSA) before HPLC and other measurements.Submitochondrial ParticlesMitochondria were sonicated by Branson Sonifier 150 internal sonicator six times with 10–20% power output each time for 10 s with a 1-min interval. Intact mitochondria were spun down at 8250 × g for 10 min. Supernatant containing the submitochondrial particles was transferred and diluted with mitochondrial isolation buffer and spun down at 80,000 × g for 40 min using a Type 60 Ti rotor. Mitochondria were kept on ice throughout the procedure.Broken MitochondriaBroken mitochondria were prepared by three series of freezing and thawing in a 2% (w/v) CHAPS solution. Intact mitochondria were spun down at 8250 × g for 10 min.Western BlottingMitochondrial samples were solubilized in a nonreducing SDS sample buffer, separated by Laemmli SDS/PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Using appropriate antibodies, the immunoreactive bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent.LC/MS/MSIn-gel Tryptic DigestProtein bands from SDS-PAGE were excised from the gels using biopsy punches (Acuderm, Lauderdale, FL). In-gel tryptic digest was carried out using trypsin that was reductively methylated to reduce autolysis (Promega, Madison, WI). The digestion reaction was carried out overnight at 37 °C. Digestion products were extracted from the gel with a 5% formic acid, 50% (v/v) acetonitrile solution (2×), and one acetonitrile extraction followed by evaporation using an APD SpeedVac (ThermoSavant, Milford, MA).Analysis of Tryptic Peptide Sequence Tags by Tandem Mass SpectrometryThe dried tryptic digest samples were cleaned with ZipTip and resuspended in 10 μl of 60% (v/v) formic acid. Chromatographic separation of the tryptic peptides was achieved using a ThermoFinnigan Surveyor MS-Pump in conjunction with a BioBasic-18 100 × 0.18-mm reverse phase capillary column (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Mass analysis was done using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source (ThermoFinnigan) employing a 4.5-cm-long metal needle (Hamilton, 950-00954) using data-dependent acquisition mode. Electrical contact and voltage application to the probe tip took place via the nanoprobe assembly. Spray voltage of the mass spectrometer was set to 2.9 kV and heated capillary temperature at 190 °C. The column was equilibrated for 5 min at 1.5 μl/min with 95% solution A, 5% solution B (A, 0.1% formic acid in water; B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) prior to sample injection. A linear gradient was initiated 5 min after sample injection ramping to 35% A, 65% B after 50 min, and 20% A, 80% B after 60 min. Mass spectra were acquired in the m/z 400–1800 range.Protein IdentificationProtein identification was carried out with the MS/MS search software Mascot 1.9 (Matrix Science) with confirmatory or complementary analyses with TurboSequest as implemented in the Bioworks Browser 3.2, build 41 (ThermoFinnigan). NCBI Rattus norvegicus protein sequences were used as the primary search data base, and searches were complemented with the NCBI nonredundant protein data base.Measurement of Mitochondrial Thiol Content, GSH, GSSG, and Pyridine NucleotidesThiol levels in mitochondria were measured using 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) as described previously (26Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. BIophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21088) Google Scholar). GSH and GSSG concentrations were analyzed using HPLC electrochemical detection as described previously (27Yap L.P. Sancheti H. Ybanez M.D. Garcia J.V. Cadenas E. Han D. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 473: 139-149Google Scholar). NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH levels were measured by HPLC as described previously (28Klaidman L.K. Leung A.C. Adams Jr., J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain homogenate and isolated mitochondria were homogenized in buffer (0.06 m KOH, 0.2 m KCN, and 1 mm bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid) followed by chloroform extraction. Chloroform extraction was carried out by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C; the resulting aqueous supernatant with soluble pyridine nucleotides was collected and extracted thrice to remove lipids and proteins. Finally, it was filtered with a 0.45-μm positively charged filter (Pall Life Sciences) to remove RNA and DNA in microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.2 m ammonium acetate (buffer A) at pH 5.5 and HPLC grade methanol (buffer B). A gradient program with initial conditions as 100% buffer A and 0% buffer B was set. From 0 to 4 min, we used 0 to 3% B, and from 4 to 23 min, we used 3–6.8% B, followed by washing the column with 50% A and 50% B, and re-equilibrated to initial conditions for next run. Quantitation of pyridine nucleotides was performed by integrating the peaks and adding the cyanide adducts as detected by the fluorescence spectrophotometer (λexc = 330 nm; λem = 460 nm).Mitochondrial Redox StatusThe redox potential of the glutathione redox couple was quantified by the Nernst equation (Ehc = E0 + 30 log ([GSSG]/[GSH]2), wherein Eo is taken as −264 mV at pH 7.4 (29Jones D.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The Nernst potential was calculated from the experimentally determined molar concentration of GSH and GSSG in mitochondria at the value of ∼1 μl/mg of protein. The Nernst potential takes into account not only the GSH/GSSG ratio but also the absolute concentration of GSH, where any changes in the latter will change the redox potential even without significant changes in the GSH/GSSG ratio (9Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3586) Google Scholar).Enzyme ActivitySuccinyl-CoA transferase activity was assayed in broken mitochondria as described previously (30Williamson D.H. Bates M.W. Page M.A. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar); activity was expressed in nmol of acetyl-CoA produced per min/mg of protein. ATP synthase activity was assayed in submitochondrial particles by coupling its activity to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and monitoring consumption of NADH (−d[NADH]/dt) at 340 nm (31Lam P.Y. Yin F. Hamilton R.T. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Res. 2009; 43: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data or analysis of variance (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01). The results are expressed as the means ± S.E.DISCUSSIONMitochondrial GSH plays a key role in mitochondria functionality and a more significant role than cytosolic GSH in determining cellular function and viability (1Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G1-G7Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 7Fernández-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. García-Ruiz C. Colell A. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This study shows that mitochondrial GSH levels and redox status are readily modified by the isolation procedure: although a discontinuous Percoll gradient yields mitochondria of higher purity, it promotes GSH oxidation and S-glutathionylation of mitochondrial proteins. The effects of this isolation procedure were more pronounced in brain mitochondria than liver mitochondria (even liver mitochondria isolated by this procedure showed a 60% decrease in GSH levels).Cells generally export GSSG under oxidative stress conditions to prevent protein S-glutathionylation (1Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sies H. Cadenas E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1985; 311: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, mitochondria have never been shown to release GSSG even when treated with oxidants such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (19Olafsdottir K. Reed D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 964: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although mitochondria contain a GSH transport system, GSSG transporters have not been identified in mitochondrial membranes. This study further supports the notion that GSSG does not leave the mitochondrion and that the disulfide is involved in mitochondrial protein S-glutathionylation. This effect was particularly pronounced in brain mitochondria with a large pool of glutathionylated proteins.ATP synthase (α subunit) and succinyl-CoA transferase were the two major proteins that were preferentially glutathionylated in brain mitochondria isolated by a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Interestingly, these two enzymes were also the two major proteins identified to be nitrated with age in brain (31Lam P.Y. Yin F. Hamilton R.T. Boveris A. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Res. 2009; 43: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that ATPase and succinyl-CoA transferase can undergo several types of post-translational modifications under oxidative and nitrosative stress. Glutathionylation of these enzymes resulted in decreased activities, which may impair energy production in mitochondria. However, regulation of mitochondrial protein function/activity by S-glutathionylation has some advantages, for the process is readily reversible and sensitive to the mitochondria redox status: in conditions of severe oxidative stress, protein S-glutathionylation may protect protein thiols from oxidation to sulfinic and sulfonic derivatives, which are more stable irreversible type modifications (2Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G1-G7Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M. Brown S.E. Filipovska A. Murphy M.P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Mitochondria energized with glutamate/malate and ADP showed a dramatic increase in GSH levels, whereas GSSG and S-glutathionylated proteins became nearly undetectable. Regulation of thiol/disulfide redox status by mitochondrial respiratory substrates is likely to involve generation of NADPH, which is utilized by GSSG reductase (catalyzing the conversion of GSSG to GSH) and which also supports the recovery of S-glutathionylated proteins by the glutaredoxin-2 system (20Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lönn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Several pathways have been identified as sources of NADPH in mitochondria: NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (10Yap L.P. Garcia J.V. Han D. Cadenas E. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2009; 61: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The extensive protein glutathionylation and GSSG formation in mitochondria isolated by a discontinuous Percoll gradient suggest that the NADPH-dependent reducing enzymes (i.e. GSSG reductase, glutaredoxin, and thioredoxin) that normally reduce disulfide bonds (i.e. GSSG and glutathionylation) formed in the matrix were not functioning optimally, possibly because of a lack of NADPH. Both glutamate/malate and succinate treatment can generate NADH and malate, which can be used to generate NADPH by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase and malic enzymes, respectively. One interesting observation was that recovery of S-glutathionylated proteins was greater during state 3 respiration (in the presence of ADP): because ATP synthase was a major protein glutathionylated upon H2O2 exposure, it may be that ADP treatment causes a conformational change that allowed easier access to glutaredoxin-2.The regulation of GSH redox status by respiratory substrates was observed to occur following an H2O2 challenge: in the absence of mitochondrial substrates, H2O2 induced significant GSSG formation; however, energized mitochondria can handle high levels of exogenous H2O2 (with little GSSG and S-glutathionylated proteins being formed). The maintenance of GSH in substrate-treated mitochondria following a H2O2 challenge was likely due to a steady rate of NADPH formation, which supported GSSG reductase activity to reduce GSSG back to GSH. In the absence of substrates, the steady-state levels of NAD(P)H are low and cannot support the reduction of GSSG. This is similar to observations made with antimycin and rotenone, mitochondrial inhibitors that greatly increase steady-state levels of H2O2 (5Han D. Canali R. Rettori D. Kaplowitz N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). GSH levels remained elevated in mitochondria treated with antimycin and rotenone when respiratory substrates were present. Taken together, these findings underscore the significance of a steady flux of respiratory substrates to maintain GSH redox status in mitochondria during oxidative stress. IntroductionGSH is the major nonprotein thiol and redox regulator in mitochondria as well as cells (1Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Han D. Hanawa N. Saberi B. Kaplowitz N. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2006; 291: G1-G7Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mitochondria contain a distinct GSH pool important in maintaining a reduced matrix environment and detoxifying H2O2 produced in the matrix (3Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Reed D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Han D. Canali R. Rettori D. Kaplowitz N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, mitochondria are devoid of GSH synthesis machinery and rely strictly on GSH import from the cytosol (6Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4668-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 7Fernández-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. García-Ruiz C. Colell A. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Despite this, the redox status of the mitochondrial GSH pool can function independently of the cytoplasmic redox status. Maintenance of the mitochondrial redox status is largely regulated by the concerted actions of NAPDH-dependent enzymes including: GSSG reductase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin III, and glutaredoxin that directly or indirectly utilize NADPH to keep the mitochondrial matrix reduced (4Reed D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consequently, mitochondrial GSH is predominant in the reduced form with the GSH:GSSG ratio being greater then 100:1 and mitochondrial proteins being predominantly in the reduced thiol state (9Schafer F.Q.

Rev. 2009; 61: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In oxidative stress conditions, increased GSSG formation may lead to glutathionylation of redox-sensitive proteins through thiol-disulfide exchange (11Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M.

The Rho-like GTPase, Rac1, induces cytoskeletal rearrangements required for cell migration. Rac activation is regulated through a number of mechanisms, including control of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis, regulation of subcellular localization or modulation of protein-expression levels1,2,3. Here, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3-ligase, PIAS3, interacts with Rac1 and is required for increased Rac activation and optimal cell migration in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signalling. We demonstrate that Rac1 can be conjugated to SUMO-1 in response to hepatocyte growth factor treatment and that SUMOylation is enhanced by PIAS3. Furthermore, we identify non-consensus sites within the polybasic region of Rac1 as the main location for SUMO conjugation. We demonstrate that PIAS3-mediated SUMOylation of Rac1 controls the levels of Rac1–GTP and the ability of Rac1 to stimulate lamellipodia, cell migration and invasion. The finding that a Ras superfamily member can be SUMOylated provides an insight into the regulation of these critical mediators of cell behaviour. Our data reveal a role for SUMO in the regulation of cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2043145714,"It is prevailingly thought that estrogen signaling is not involved in development of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer. However, there is evidence indicating that ovariectomy prevents the development of both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer, suggesting that estrogen signaling is involved in the development of ER-negative breast cancer. Previously, our laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36 mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling and is highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in 10/12 cases of triple-negative breast cancer. We investigated the role of mitogenic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of ER-α36 and found that these cells strongly responded to mitogenic estrogen signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the small hairpin RNA method diminished their responsiveness to estrogen. ER-α36 physically interacted with the EGFR/Src/Shc complex and mediated estrogen-induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src. EGFR signaling activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter, and ER-α36 expression was able to stabilize EGFR protein. Our results, thus demonstrated that ER-α36 mediates nongenomic estrogen signaling through the EGFR/Src/ERK signaling pathway in ER-negative breast cancer cells and suggested that a subset of ER-negative breast tumors that expresses ER-α36, retains responsiveness to mitogenic estrogen signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2161050830,"How extracellular signals, such as BDNF, regulate axonal branching is unclear. Here, Jeanneteau et al. find that MAP kinase phosphatase 1 expression is induced by BDNF signaling to deactivate JNK. This negatively regulates phosphorylation of JNK substrates that impinge on microtubule destabilization. Neurons from mkp-1 null mice were unable to produce BDNF-induced axon branches. The refinement of neural circuits during development depends on a dynamic process of branching of axons and dendrites that leads to synapse formation and connectivity. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for the outgrowth and activity-dependent remodeling of axonal arbors in vivo. However, the mechanisms that translate extracellular signals into the formation of axonal branches are incompletely understood. We found that MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) controls axon branching. MKP-1 expression induced by BDNF signaling caused spatiotemporal deactivation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which reduced the phosphorylation of JNK substrates that destabilize microtubules. Indeed, neurons from mkp-1 null mice could not produce axon branches in response to BDNF. Our results identify a signaling mechanism that regulates axonal branching and provide a framework for studying the molecular mechanisms of innervation and axonal remodeling under normal and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2151802152,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions in cells at least as two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Intensive studies have focused on the roles of mTOR in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, and survival. Recently we found that rapamycin inhibits type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)-stimulated lamellipodia formation and cell motility, indicating involvement of mTOR in regulating cell motility. This study was set to further elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here we show that rapamycin inhibited protein synthesis and activities of small GTPases (RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1), crucial regulatory proteins for cell migration. Disruption of mTORC1 or mTORC2 by down-regulation of raptor or rictor, respectively, inhibited the activities of these proteins. However, only disruption of mTORC1 mimicked the effect of rapamycin, inhibiting their protein expression. Ectopic expression of rapamycin-resistant and constitutively active S6K1 partially prevented rapamycin inhibition of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 expression, whereas expression of constitutively hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 (4EBP1-5A) or down-regulation of S6K1 by RNA interference suppressed expression of the GTPases, suggesting that both mTORC1-mediated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways are involved in protein synthesis of the GTPases. Expression of constitutively active RhoA, but not Cdc42 and Rac1, conferred resistance to rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1-stimulated lamellipodia formation and cell migration. The results suggest that rapamycin inhibits cell motility at least in part by down-regulation of RhoA protein expression and activity through mTORC1-mediated S6K1 and 4E-BP1-signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2116075954,"Accumulating evidence indicates that endocytosis plays an essential role in the nuclear transport of the ErbB family members, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB-2. Nevertheless, how full-length receptors embedded in the endosomal membrane pass through the nuclear pore complexes and function as non-membrane-bound receptors in the nucleus remains unclear. Here we show that upon EGF treatment, the biotinylated cell surface EGFR is trafficked to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) through the nuclear pore complexes, remaining in a membrane-bound environment. We further find that importin β regulates EGFR nuclear transport to the INM in addition to the nucleus/nucleoplasm. Unexpectedly, the well known endoplasmic reticulum associated translocon Sec61β is found to reside in the INM and associate with EGFR. Knocking down Sec61β expression reduces EGFR level in the nucleoplasm portion and accumulates it in the INM portion. Thus, the Sec61β translocon plays an unrecognized role in the release of the membrane-anchored EGFR from the lipid bilayer of the INM to the nucleus. The newly identified Sec61β function provides an alternative pathway for nuclear transport that can be utilized by membrane-embedded proteins such as full-length EGFR."

Unlike other types of chaperones, Hsp90 is not required for the biogenesis of most polypeptides but instead functions in the maintenance of the active state of several conformationally labile signaling proteins (2Picard D.

Recent studies indicate that extracellular Hsp90α is significantly correlated with tumor invasiveness and metastasis (8Eustace B.K. Sakurai T. Stewart J.K. Yimlamai D. Unger C. Zehetmeier C. Lain B.

Furthermore, Hsp90α can be detected in the blood of cancer patients, and the level of Hsp90α is positively associated with tumor malignancy (9Wang X. Song X. Zhuo W. Fu Y. Shi H. Liang Y. Tong M.

In addition to tumor cells, extracellular Hsp90α has also been identified in neuron cells, dermal fibroblasts, keratinocyte, macrophages, and epithelial cells and participates in neuronal cell migration, wound healing, and viral and bacteria infections (7Tsutsumi S.

Accumulating evidence indicates that extracellular Hsp90α plays important roles in both physiological and pathological processes, especially in tumor progression (7Tsutsumi S. Neckers L. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1536-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of how extracellular Hsp90α functions is still largely unknown (12Stefanidakis M.

In the present study, to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of extracellular Hsp90α function, we have investigated the regulatory mechanism of extracellular Hsp90α on MMP-2 activity. We reveal that extracellullar Hsp90α stabilizes MMP-2 and protects it from processing and subsequent inactivation in tumor cells. The regulatory function of Hsp90α on MMP-2 processing is isoform-specific and ATP-independent. The interaction of Hsp90α and MMP-2 is mediated by the middle domain of Hsp90α and the C-terminal hemopexin domain of MMP-2. Moreover, we further confirm this mechanism in endothelial cells, which can secrete increasing amounts of Hsp90α upon the treatment of VEGF. The effects of recombinant human Hsp90α (rHsp90α) and the Hsp90α antibody on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo were also examined. The result shows that rHsp90α promotes whereas the antibody of Hsp90α suppresses angiogenesis in an MMP-2-dependent manner, suggesting that extracellular Hsp90α is a potential therapeutic target for not only tumor metastasis but also tumor angiogenesis. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 and mouse melanoma cell line B16/F10 were from the American Type Culture Collection. HMEC is a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (Sciencell) transfected with SV40 large T antigen (13Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J.

The stable cell line overexpressing MMP-2 was screened by G418 (200 μg/ml) from MCF-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-MMP-2. Anti-Myc, anti-His, and anti-CD31 antibody (PECAM-1, M-20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MMP-2 antibody (Ab-7) for Western blotting was from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Anti-Hsp90α antibody (9D2) was from Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, Canada). Anti-Hsp90β antibody (H90–10) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against Hsp90α (Hsp90α mAb) and Hsp90β (Hsp90β mAb) for endothelial cell transmigration, tube formation, and tumor growth assay was prepared by our laboratory. The specificity and efficiency were confirmed by ELISA. This assay was performed according to the previous report (15Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purified rMMP-2 was incubated with the indicated proteins with or without ATP (2 mm) at 37 °C for different periods. The incubation buffer contains 40 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate, pH 7.4. The processing was terminated by electrophoresis sample buffer. This assay was performed using 6.5-mm millicell inserts (8-μm pore size; Millipore) coated with Matrigel (50 μg/insert) (Vigorous, Beijing, China) on the upper side of the filter membranes. 2 × 105 HMECs/insert were inoculated. 0.5% FBS was added in the lower chamber. Then the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells at the lower surface of the filter membranes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The images were visualized by microscope (Olympus IX71), and five random fields per insert were captured by CCD camera (Olympus DP71) for counting. 24-well plates were coated with 125 μl/well of Matrigel. HMECs were seeded (1 × 105 cells/well) and cultured for 12 h in DMEM plus 2% FBS with indicated treatment. The tubule images were visualized by microscope (Olympus IX71) and captured by CCD camera. The tubule length was calculated in five random fields of view/well using Image-Pro Plus. 400 μl of Matrigel containing VEGF-A165 (50 ng/ml) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), lentivirus with vector expressing MMP-2 shRNA or empty vector (5 × 106 TU) (GenePharma, Shanghai, China), and recombinant Hsp90α (rHsp90α), recombinant Hsp90β (rHsp90β), nonimmune mouse IgG, Hsp90α mAb, or Hsp90β mAb (50 μg/ml) was injected subcutaneously into the nude mice. After 7 days, the plug was removed, and tube formation was examined by immunofluorescence using anti-CD31 antibody. The target sequence of MMP-2 shRNA is AAGAACCAGATCACATACAGG. B16/F10 cells (1 × 106, 100 μl) were subcutaneously inoculated in the back of nude mice (6–8 weeks old). Nonimmune mouse IgG (10 mg/kg), Hsp90α mAb (5 or 10 mg/kg, according to the previous report (10Stellas D. Karameris A. Patsavoudi E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)), or Hsp90β mAb (5 or 10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally every other day from the day after implantation. The experiment was performed with six mice in each group. After 25 days treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were excised, weighed, fixed, and applied to immunofluorescence. All of the animal studies were performed with the approval of the Scientific Investigation Board of Tsinghua University. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues or Matrigel plugs were processed into 5-μm-thick sections. The sections were rehydrated and blocked with 5% rabbit or goat serum and then incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were detected by TRITC- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. The nucleus was stained with DAPI. The sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Nikon A1). To investigate the regulatory mechanism of Hsp90α on MMP-2 activity, an MCF-7 stable cell line that overexpresses human MMP-2 with C-terminal tandem Myc and His tags was established (Fig. 1A). MMP-2 expression in the conditioned medium (CM) of this cell line treated with rHsp90α or its antibody was analyzed. As expected, activated MMP-2 was increased upon the treatment with increasing amounts of rHsp90α (Fig. 1, B and C), which is consistent with the previous report (8Eustace B.K. Sakurai T. Stewart J.K. Yimlamai D. Unger C. Zehetmeier C. Lain B. Torella C. Henning S.W. Beste G. Scroggins B.T. Neckers L. Ilag L.L. Jay D.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the amount of ProMMP-2 was also increased, whereas some overprocessed fragments of MMP-2 (∼30 kDa), which were detected by Western blotting but not zymography (Fig. 1, B and C), were decreased in this process (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the antibody of Hsp90α exhibited the opposite effect on MMP-2 processing (Fig. 1, D and E), whereas rHsp90β and anti-Hsp90β antibody showed no such effect (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that Hsp90α can modulate the activity of MMP-2 via interfering with the processing or degradation of MMP-2 at a specific cleavage site. In addition, the densitometry reading result of the MMP-2 processing upon the treatment of rHsp90α or anti-Hsp90α antibody also showed that Hsp90α was mainly involved in the inactivation processing but not the activation of MMP-2 (Fig. 1, F and G). We next sequenced the major processed fragment (∼30 kDa) observed above and identified its N terminus as LYGAS (supplemental Fig. S2), beginning from the amino acid residue 444 (Leu444) of MMP-2 (Fig. 1H). Because this fragment can be detected by the anti-Myc antibody, it should end at the Myc-tagged C terminus of MMP-2 (Cys660). Thus this fragment was identified as Leu444–Cys660 comprised of both the hemopexin domain (Pro466–Cys660) and 22 residues of the linker domain. The theoretical molecular mass of this fragment (Leu444–Cys660) is 24.5 kDa. With the additional C-terminal tags, the molecular mass of the fragment is increased to 27.4 kDa, which is consistent with its migratory position on the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, B and D). According to the previous report, this fragment is a stable and inactive product of MMP-2 autocatalytic degradation (15Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K.

The cleavage at Glu443–Leu444 initiates the MMP-2 inactivation, which is completed later by cleavage at the zinc-binding domain (15Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Tryggvason K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on our results and aforementioned literature, we propose that Hsp90α can stabilize MMP-2 and protect it from autocatalytic cleavage at Glu443–Leu444, which subsequently leads to the complete inactivation of MMP-2. To affirm the above hypothesis, we prepared the purified rHsp90α, rHsp90β (supplemental Fig. S3A), and rProMMP-2 (supplemental Fig. S3B) and investigated the influence of these chaperones on MMP-2 autocatalytic processing in an in vitro noncell system. Because Hsp90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone in the cytosol (17Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 18Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the stabilization effect of Hsp90α on MMP-2 is ATP-dependent. Purified rProMMP-2 was mixed with PBS, equal molar of Hsp90α or Hsp90β with or without ATP, and then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The autocatalytic processing products of ProMMP-2 were assayed by Western blotting. It was found that Hsp90α but not Hsp90β can protect MMP-2 from autocatalytic processing and inactivation and that ATP exhibited no effect on the stabilization activity of both Hsp90α and Hsp90β (supplemental Fig. S3C), demonstrating that the stabilization of MMP-2 mediated by Hsp90α is ATP-independent. Next the effect of Hsp90α and Hsp90β on MMP-2 processing was compared at different incubation times. Without the protection of other factors, only 20% of pro- or active MMP-2 remained after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h (Fig. 2, A, top left, and B), whereas with equal molar amounts of rHsp90α, >90% MMP-2 were in their pro- or activated forms after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, and even after 20 h of incubation, more than 30% MMP-2 was still active (Fig. 2, A, top right, and B). This result is indicative that Hsp90α has the ability to remarkably stabilize MMP-2. Similar to the result shown in supplemental Fig. S3C, here Hsp90β also showed no obvious effect on the stabilization of MMP-2 (Fig. 2, A, bottom, and B). To further confirm this result, the effects of Hsp90α and Hsp90β on MMP-2 stabilization were compared in a concentration gradient. The result showed that after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h (without Hsp90α or Hsp90β), 80% of pro-active or active MMP-2 was processed into small inactive fragments, whereas equal molar amounts of Hsp90α can inhibit the inactivation processing of MMP-2 completely (Fig. 2, C, top, and D). As for Hsp90β, even after increasing its concentration to 40 μm, which is 8-fold of the concentration of MMP-2, the inactivation processing of MMP-2 could not be inhibited completely (Fig. 2, C, bottom, and D). Based on the above results, we conclude that Hsp90α can stabilize MMP-2 directly and specifically. Because Hsp90α and Hsp90β are closely related isoforms of Hsp90, which are 86% identical and 93% similar in their amino acid sequences (19Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U.

Biol. 2004; 11: 775-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), it seems contradictory that Hsp90β shows no effect on the stabilization of MMP-2. To investigate this mystery, the status of Hsp90α and Hsp90β during incubation with MMP-2 was explored. Interestingly, Hsp90α was found to be gradually and slowly degraded by equal molar amounts of MMP-2 within 20 h (supplemental Fig. S4A), whereas Hsp90β was rapidly degraded within 1 h and was found to be much more unstable than Hsp90α (supplemental Fig. S4B). This result provides an explanation for the different behaviors of Hsp90α and Hsp90β in the stabilization of MMP-2, which is determined not only by the interaction with MMP-2 but also by the individual stabilities of each chaperone. To investigate the molecular mechanism of the stabilization of MMP-2 by Hsp90α, the binding region of MMP-2 to Hsp90α was mapped. The different functional domains of MMP-2 are shown in the top panel of Fig. 3A. Mutants ΔPEX (full-length MMP-2 lacking the hemopexin domain) and PEX (hemopexin domain with the signal peptide for secretion) were constructed, and their interactions with Hsp90α were examined by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Hsp90α was co-precipitated with both the MMP-2 full length and PEX but not ΔPEX (Fig. 3A, bottom), demonstrating that MMP-2 binds to Hsp90α via the hemopexin domain. The interaction of Hsp90α with the hemopexin domain was further confirmed by a competitive Co-IP assay. Increasing amounts of GST-fused recombinant hemopexin domain (GST-PEX, 0, 1, 10 μg/ml) were added to the concentrated CM of MCF-7 stable cell line overexpressing MMP-2 (Fig. 3B, top left). The Co-IP of Hsp90α and MMP-2 was blocked by GST-PEX in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, top right and bottom left), whereas the Co-IP of Hsp90α and GST-PEX was increased along with the concentration gradient of GST-PEX (Fig. 3B, top right and bottom right). In sum, these results consistently demonstrate that the hemopexin domain is essential for the interaction of Hsp90α and MMP-2. Next the binding site of Hsp90α to MMP-2 was mapped. We constructed FLAG-tagged truncation mutants of Hsp90α according to its functional domains, the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal domains, which are schematically shown in the top panel of Fig. 3C. Then we transfected these truncations to MCF-7 cells and used anti-FLAG antibody to perform Co-IP. The precipitated proteins were detected by anti-MMP-2 antibody. The result showed that MMP-2 was co-precipitated with Hsp90α full length, middle, N-terminal/middle, and middle/C-terminal domains but not the N-terminal or C-terminal domain, demonstrating that Hsp90α interacts with MMP-2 via its middle domain (Fig. 3C, bottom left). Intriguingly, the MMP-2 proteins co-precipitated with Hsp90α were mainly in the activated form (Fig. 3C, bottom left), implicating the specific stabilization effect of Hsp90α on the activated MMP-2. It is reported that the middle domain of Hsp90α is responsible for the binding of several Hsp90α substrate proteins and is considered to discriminate different substrate types and to regulate the chaperone machinery for proper substrate activation (21Hawle P. Siepmann M. Harst A. Siderius M. Reusch H.P. Obermann W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8385-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). According to the reported mutations, which were shown to be important for the binding of these substrates (21Hawle P. Siepmann M. Harst A. Siderius M. Reusch H.P. Obermann W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8385-8395Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), we constructed point mutations of Hsp90α (Fig. 3C, top) and screened the binding sites of Hsp90α to MMP-2. Strikingly, we identified that three clusters of mutations, F349A/L351A/F352A, R400A/E401K, and V368A/F369A can completely abrogate the interaction of Hsp90α to MMP-2 (Fig. 3C, bottom right), whereas another mutation, W320A, which disrupts the binding of PKB/AKT to Hsp90α (23Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), showed no such effect (Fig. 3C, bottom right). Subsequently, we prepared the recombinant proteins of Hsp90α mutants F349A/L351A/F352A and R400A/E401K and then compared their abilities on MMP-2 stabilization with that of the WT Hsp90α. As expected, these two non-MMP2-binding Hsp90α mutants cannot protect MMP-2 from inactivation processing (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that the protection of Hsp90α on MMP-2 requires physical interaction, and this further confirms that Hsp90α can specifically stabilize MMP-2. Because we demonstrated that Hsp90α stabilizes MMP-2 and protects it from inactivation processing via binding to the hemopexin domain, we further explored the biological relevance of this mechanism. In addition to the cancer cells, endothelial cells also express a high level of MMP-2 (24Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar), which is an important positive regulator of angiogenesis (12Stefanidakis M. Koivunen E. Blood. 2006; 108: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); we thus considered whether Hsp90α can be secreted by endothelial cells, which would subsequently be involved in the modulation of angiogenesis. To address this question, the secretion of Hsp90α from two kinds of endothelial cells, HMECs and HUVECs, was examined. Without any stimulation, both HMECs and HUVECs secrete a low level of Hsp90α compared with tumor cells (Fig. 4A), whereas when endothelial cells were treated with increasing amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A165), which can stimulate the proliferation and induce the angiogenic responses of endothelial cells, the secretion of Hsp90α from both HMECs and HUVECs was increased remarkably (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that the secretion of Hsp90α is correlated with the angiogenic status of endothelial cells. Subsequently, we examined the influence of rHsp90α and Hsp90α mAb on MMP-2 processing and angiogenesis using endothelial cells. rHsp90β and Hsp90β mAb were taken as the control proteins. As expected, rHsp90α inhibited whereas Hsp90α mAb promoted the inactivation processing of MMP-2 in HMECs (Fig. 5A). rHsp90β and Hsp90β mAb exhibited no obvious effect on MMP-2 processing (Fig. 5A). Coincidently, the transmigration of HMECs through extracellular matrix (Matrigel) was increased upon the treatment of rHsp90α and decreased with the treatment of Hsp90α mAb (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S5B). Moreover, with the knockdown of MMP-2 in HMECs (supplemental Fig. S5A), the pro-transmigration effect of rHsp90α was almost completely abrogated (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S5B). Similar results were also obtained in the tube formation assay in vitro (Fig. 5C). To further confirm the direct effect of the interaction between Hsp90α and MMP-2 in promoting angiogenesis, a Matrigel plug assay with lentivirus delivered MMP-2 shRNA was employed to examine the role of Hsp90α in angiogenesis in vivo. The knockdown and infectious efficiency of the lentivirus delivered MMP-2 shRNA was examined and shown in supplemental Fig. S6, A and B. The tube formation in Matrigel plug was detected by immunofluorescence staining with anti-CD31 antibody. The result showed that Hsp90α but not Hsp90β promoted angiogenesis in an MMP-2-dependent manner (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S6C), whereas the antibody of Hsp90α suppressed angiogenesis remarkably (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S6C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Hsp90α can promote angiogenesis via stabilizing MMP-2. Because we found that Hsp90α can be secreted by endothelial cells and promotes endothelial cell transmigration and tube formation in vitro and in vivo, we proposed that Hsp90α may also be involved in the angiogenesis of tumors in vivo. We next examined the effect of Hsp90α mAb on tumor growth and angiogenesis using the B16/F10 melanoma mouse model. Hsp90β mAb was taken as the control protein. The results indicate that Hsp90α mAb but not Hsp90β mAb can suppress tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, the blood vessel density of the different groups was assessed using CD31 staining, which showed a significant decrease upon the treatment of Hsp90α mAb but not Hsp90β mAb (Fig. 6C). Collectively, the above results suggest that the antibody of Hsp90α is a potential therapeutic agent for the inhibition of not only tumor metastasis (8Eustace B.K. Sakurai T. Stewart J.K. Yimlamai D. Unger C. Zehetmeier C. Lain B. Torella C. Henning S.W. Beste G. Scroggins B.T. Neckers L. Ilag L.L. Jay D.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 9Wang X.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but also tumor angiogenesis and growth. Because Hsp90α mAb remarkably inhibits tumor angiogenesis, we wondered whether the direct localization of Hsp90α mAb on tumor blood vessels can be observed in vivo. Therefore the localization of the administrated antibodies in tumor tissues was detected using the FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. In the groups treated with control mouse IgG or Hsp90β mAb, no specific staining was observed in the tumor tissues, whereas Hsp90α mAb was specifically localized on the tumor blood vessels and the periphery of the tumor cells (Fig. 6D), reflecting the localization of endogenous Hsp90α on the same sites and its important role in modulating tumor angiogenesis. Next we compared the level of active MMP-2 in tumors treated with Hsp90 monoclonal antibodies by Western blotting. Consistently, the antibody of Hsp90α but not Hsp90β promoted the degradation of MMP-2. The total amounts of pro-activated and activated MMP-2 were decreased in the tumors treated with Hsp90α mAb but not Hsp90β mAb (Fig. 6E). These results further confirm that Hsp90α can actually stabilize and enhance the activity of MMP-2 in vivo, which subsequently promotes tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness. The activity of MMP-2 is regulated at four levels: gene expression, compartmentalization (localization), proenzyme (zymogen) activation, and enzyme inactivation (inhibition or processing) (25Nagase H.

https://openalex.org/W2129429355,"The regulation of glycine receptor (GlyR) number at synapses is necessary for the efficacy of inhibition and the control of neuronal excitability in the spinal cord. GlyR accumulation at synapses depends on the scaffolding molecule gephyrin and is linked to GlyR synaptic dwell time. However, the mechanisms that tune GlyR synaptic exchanges in response to different neuronal environments are unknown. Integrins are cell adhesion molecules and signaling receptors. Using single quantum dot imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we found in rats that β1 and β3 integrins adjust synaptic strength by regulating the synaptic dwell time of both GlyRs and gephyrin. β1 and β3 integrins crosstalked via calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and adapted GlyR lateral diffusion and gephyrin-dependent trapping at synapses. This provides a mechanism for maintaining or adjusting the steady state of postsynaptic molecule exchanges and the level of glycinergic inhibition in response to neuron- and glia-derived signals or extracellular matrix remodeling."

Deregulation of both the actin cytoskeleton and Abl kinases have been implicated in cancers. Abl kinase activity is elevated in a number of metastatic cancers and these kinases are activated downstream of several oncogenic growth factor receptor signaling pathways. However, the role of Abl kinases in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton during tumor progression and invasion remains elusive. Here we identify the Abl kinases as essential regulators of invadopodia assembly and function. We show that Abl kinases are activated downstream of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and are required for cancer cell invasion and matrix degradation induced by SDF1α, serum growth factors, and activated Src kinase. Moreover, Abl kinases are readily detected at invadopodia assembly sites and their inhibition prevents the assembly of actin and cortactin into organized invadopodia structures. We show that active Abl kinases form complexes with membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a critical invadopodia component required for matrix degradation. Further, loss of Abl kinase signaling induces internalization of MT1-MMP from the cell surface, promotes its accumulation in the perinuclear compartment and inhibits MT1-MMP tyrosine phosphorylation.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, accumulating data suggest that activation of the Abl kinases may play a role in the development of solid tumors as Arg is elevated in advanced and high-grade colorectal and pancreatic cancers (24Chen W.S.

Lemoine N.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4587-4594Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, Abl kinase activity is required for the proliferation, survival and invasion of breast cancer cells (22Sirvent A. Boureux A. Simon V. Leroy C. Roche S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7313-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Srinivasan D. Sims J.T. Plattner R. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Srinivasan D.

In this regard, in addition to cortactin, Abl kinases phosphorylate and interact with a number of actin-regulatory proteins including N-WASP (20Boyle S.N. Michaud G.A. Schweitzer B. Predki P.F.

We previously showed that Abl kinases are activated downstream of Src kinases in response to growth factor stimulation and are required for cytoskeletal remodeling downstream of cell surface receptors (12Plattner R.

Here we examine whether the effects of Src and extracellular factors on invadopodia formation and maturation are mediated, in part, by Abl kinases. We show that the Abl kinases are required for Src-induced invadopodia formation and MMP-dependent matrix degradation and function downstream of chemokines in these processes. Anti-Abl (clone 8E9), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10), and anti-CrkL were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-Arg (clone 9H5) and anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-cortactin (4F11) was purchased from Upstate. Anti-phospho-CrkL (Tyr207), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-Akt, and anti-NA, K-ATPase were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-MT1-MMP (clone 3G4.2) used for Western blot analysis and anti-MT1-MMP (clone 113-5B7) used for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Millipore/Chemicon. Recombinant human SDF-1α was from R&D Systems. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). MDA-1833 (bone metastasis) and MDA-4175 cells (lung metastasis) are organ-specific metastases derived from in vivo selection from parental MDA-MB-231 cells and were a generous gift from Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). MDA-MB-231 and their derivative cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The respective non-metastatic and metastatic mouse melanoma cell lines, B16F-0 and B16F-10 (ATCC), were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 4 mm l-glutamine. The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293T (ATCC), was cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. The embryonic mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3 (ATCC), was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% Bovine Calf Serum (Hyclone). The human non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat inactivated horse serum (Sigma), 4 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/liter insulin (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml epithelial growth factor (Sigma), 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma). All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. STI571/Gleevec was a generous gift from Novartis. In brief, cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight and incubated with either the vehicle dimethysulfoxime (DMSO, Sigma) or 10 μm STI571 for a period of 1–16 h as indicated. Various pcDNA3.1 constructs (MT1-MMP, Abl, Arg) and PX1-Arg-YFP fusion constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells using CaCl2 phosphate-mediated transfection. Cells were used for experimental procedures 48 h following transfection. Retroviral transduction of PX1-Arg-YFP fusion and MIGR1 constructs expressing constitutively active SrcY527F, Abl, and/or Arg (WT, wild type; PP, constitutively active; and KR, dominant inactive) were performed by transfecting HEK293T with along CMV-VSVG and gag/pol packaging constructs. Medium containing virus was collected, filtered, incubated on cells with polybrene (8 μg/ml) for a period of 6–24 h. Cells were then sorted for GFP+ expression and cultured and used accordingly. B16F10 and NIH3T3SrcY527F cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Dharmacon). Either a non-targeted control or mouse specific siRNAs targeting Abl (GAAGGAAAUCAGUGACAUAUU) and Arg (GAAAUGGAGCGAACAGAUAUU) were transfected into cell using Oligofectamine as previously described (35Yogalingam G. Pendergast A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35941-35953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Lentiviral microRNAs (miRNAs) were transduced into various cell lines as previously described (35Yogalingam G. Pendergast A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35941-35953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding human-specific Abl miRNA (GGTGTATGAGCTGCTAGAGAA) and Arg miRNA (CCTTATCTCACCCACTCTGAA) were cloned in tandem into the pFc-EmGFPW vector and transfected into HEK293T cells along with pCMV-VSVG, pRSV-Rev and pMDL plasmids as described (36McLaughlin J. Cheng D. Singer O. Lukacs R.U. Radu C.G. Verma I.M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20501-20506Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lentiviral supernatants were collected, filtered, and placed on cells (MDA-MB-231 and derivative cell lines) with 8 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were then sorted by flow cytometry to collect GFP+ populations and either cultured or immediately used under “Experimental Procedures.” Similarly, the mouse cell line, NIH3T3SrcY527F was transduced with mouse-specific miRNAs to individually and simultaneously target Abl (CAGTTTGACATCCACCTTT) and/or Arg (CCGTTTGGGTGATGCTGAA). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 1% Nonidet-P40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Thermo Scientific), 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cell debris was removed by microcentifugation and protein concentrations were quantified using the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were then diluted in sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) containing either 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder or 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h and then incubated with in blocking solution containing primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed several times with TBST and incubated with secondary Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h followed by several washes with TBST. Proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare). Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 Lysis Buffer. Protein concentration was quantified and 0.5–1 mg of protein were incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody or control IgG between 4–16 h at 4 °C. Then lysates containing protein-antibody complexes were incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged and agarose-bound immune complexes were washed several times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Beads were then suspended in sample buffer, boiled, and processed as described for Western blotting. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with either DMSO or 10 μm STI571. Alternatively, cells were transduced with miRNAs for Abl kinases, sorted by flow cytometry for GFP+ expression, and cultured. Medium was aspirated from cells and cells were washed several times with ice-cold PBS containing MgCl2 and CaCl2 (PBS+/+, Invitrogen). Surface proteins were labeled with 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) reconstituted in PBS+/+ and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Unreacted biotin was quenched with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 followed by several washes with ice-cold PBS+/+. Then cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Then 250 μg of protein from cell lysates were incubated with NeutrAvidin-agarose Resin (ThermoScientific) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bead resin was washed several times with PBS+/+ containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease/phosphatase inhibitors. Subsequently, beads were suspended in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting for detection of MT1-MMP and Na, K+ ATPase, as a loading control. Cells were cultured on either bare or gelatin-coated glass coverslips. Exponentially growing cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2–0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. Next, fixed cells were blocked in PBS containing 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h, incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for an additional hour, and followed with incubation with either the appropriate Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alternatively, secondary staining procedures included Alexa Fluor-conjugated anti-phalloidin antibodies (Molecular Probes) to stain F-actin. Lastly, cells were stained with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) to identify the nuclei. Fluorescent images were acquired using the Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). Confocal images were gathered using the Leica SP5 confocal scanning microscope. Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Glass coverslips were coated with 20 μg/ml OregonGreen-conjugated gelatin (Molecular Probes) suspended in 2% sucrose for 1 h. Gelatin solution was removed, and coverslips were incubated with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Plates were washed several times and then quenched with 5 mg/ml of sodium borohydride for 3 min followed with several wash in PBS. NIH3T3SrcY527F cells were plated on gelatin for a period of 3 h; MDA-MB-231 and their derivative cell lines were examined after 6 h. Cells were then fixed and stained according to procedures outlined in the section describing immunofluorescence microscopy. Matrix degradation was quantified by counting the total number of cells producing gelatin-degradation patches/nuclei in five individual fields; results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Invasion was evaluated by plating 25,000 cells in the upper chambers of 8.0 μm pore size matrigel chambers (BD Biosciences) in serum-free medium. Cells were allowed to invade for up to 48 h in the presence of either serum-containing medium or serum-free medium containing 150 ng/ml of SDF1-α. Then the remaining cells, medium, and matrigel were removed from the upper chambers and cells on the undersurface of the membrane were fixed, stained with DiffQuik (Dade Behring), and quantified under the 20× objective. Each experiment analyzed cells in at least four different fields performed in triplicates. Experiments were performed at least three independent times. Unpaired student t-tests were performed to determine statistical significance using the GraphPad software (www.graphpad.com). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Densitometry was performed using the Image J software. Metastatic tumor cells invade their surrounding microenvironment by employing a variety of mechanisms that include protease-mediated degradation of ECM and tissues. Whereas increased invasiveness correlates with enhanced metastatic activity, the ability of cancer cells to spread from the primary site of tumor growth to specific organs may require the activation of distinct signaling pathways. Elevated Abl kinase activity has been detected in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines (26Srinivasan D. Plattner R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether Abl kinases are required for matrix degradation and invasion of breast cancer cells with organ-specific metastatic capacity. To investigate the requirement for Abl kinases in these processes, we employed MDA-MB-231-derived breast cancer cell lines of varying metastatic potential, which were selected in vivo for their ability to metastasize to either the bone (MDA1833) and lung (MDA4175) (37Zhang X.H.

These breast cancer cells were depleted of Abl and Arg following transduction with lentivirus encoding Abl/Arg-specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Abl and Arg protein levels were decreased by greater than 90%. This reduction in Abl and Arg proteins correlated with a reduction (greater than 75%) in phosphorylation of CrkL at an Abl kinase specific phosphorylation site (tyrosine 207) (Fig. 1C). Silencing of Abl and Arg resulted not only in markedly decreased invasion toward serum, but also dramatically impaired protease-mediated matrix degradation in the parental cell line and the MDA-MB-231-derivative cell lines with ability to metastasize to either bone or lung (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, reconstitution of miRNA-resistant mouse Abl partially restored the invasive phenotype and the ability to degrade the matrix (Fig. 1, D and E). Abl kinases are also required for invasion and matrix degradation of melanoma cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Abl kinase activity was elevated in the metastatic melanoma cell line, B16F10 compared with its non-metastatic counterpart, B16F0 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and silencing of Abl kinases in the B16F10 metastatic melanoma cell line significantly decreased invasion and matrix degradation (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Moreover, expression of activated Abl kinases enhanced invasion and matrix degradation in B16F0 melanoma cells with weak metastatic potential (data not shown). Taken together, these findings support a requirement for Abl family kinases in matrix degradation and invasion of metastatic cancer cells. A role for Src in metastasis has been well established and several Src kinase inhibitors are effective in inhibiting proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro and in vivo models (41Finn R.S. Ann. Oncol. 2008; 19: 1379-1386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 42Zou D. Yoon H.S. Anjomshoaa A. Perez D. Fukuzawa R. Guilford P. Humar B.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1580-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because Abl kinases function downstream of Src in growth factor receptor signaling (12Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 33Plattner R. Koleske A.J. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2573-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the invasive properties of Src are mediated, in part, by activation of Abl kinases. Silencing of Abl, Arg, or both Abl and Arg together in NIH3T3 cells expressing constitutively active SrcY527F resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in MMP-dependent gelatinase activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Knockdown of both Abl and Arg was required for maximal inhibition of MMP-dependent gelatinase activity (60% compared with controls) while depletion of Abl or Arg alone resulted in partial inhibition of matrix degradation (Fig. 2A). Similarly, inhibition of Abl kinase activity with the pharmacological inhibitor, STI571/Gleevec or knockdown of Abl/Arg in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells expressing constitutively active Src markedly decreased gelatinase activity by 43 and 58%, respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 2C). Moreover, expression of activated Arg kinase (Arg-PP) further enhanced matrix degradation in breast cancer cells, and pharmacological inhibition of endogenous Src kinases abrogated matrix degradation in these cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Collectively, these data show that endogenous Src and Abl family kinases are required for efficient ECM degradation. SDF1α (CXCL12) is a well-characterized chemokine that plays a critical role in metastasis and invasion in melanoma as well as lung and breast cancer (53Smith M.C. Luker K.E. Garbow J.R. Prior J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2117586443,"Chemical genetics is an emerging approach to investigate the biology of host-pathogen interactions. We screened several inhibitors of ATP-dependent DNA motors and detected the gyrase B inhibitor coumermycin A1 (C-A1) as a potent antiretroviral. C-A1 inhibited HIV-1 integration and gene expression from acutely infected cell, but the two activities mapped to distinct targets. Target discovery identified Hsp90 as the C-A1 target affecting viral gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Hsp90 associates with the viral promoter and may directly regulate gene expression. Molecular docking suggested that C-A1 binds to two novel pockets at the C terminal domain of Hsp90. C-A1 inhibited Hsp90 dimer formation, suggesting that it impairs viral gene expression by preventing Hsp90 dimerization at the C terminus. The inhibition of HIV-1 integration imposed by C-A1 was independent of Hsp90 and mapped to the capsid protein, and a point mutation at residue 105 made the virus resistant to this block. HIV-1 susceptibility to the integration block mediated by C-A1 was influenced by cyclophilin A. Our chemical genetic approach revealed an unexpected function of capsid in HIV-1 integration and provided evidence for a role of Hsp90 in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells. Both activities were amenable to inhibition by small molecules and represent novel antiretroviral drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2038614269,"PCSK9, a target for the treatment of dyslipidemia, enhances the degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in endosomes/lysosomes, up-regulating LDL-cholesterol levels. Whereas the targeting and degradation of the PCSK9-LDLR complex are under scrutiny, the roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of PCSK9 are unknown. Although autocatalytic zymogen processing of PCSK9 occurs at Gln(152)↓, here we show that human PCSK9 can be further cleaved in its N-terminal prosegment at Arg(46)↓ by an endogenous enzyme of insect High Five cells and by a cellular mammalian protease, yielding an ∼4-fold enhanced activity. Removal of the prosegment acidic stretch resulted in ∼3-fold higher binding to LDLR in vitro, in ≥4-fold increased activity on cellular LDLR, and faster cellular internalization in endosome/lysosome-like compartments. Finally, swapping the acidic stretch of PCSK9 with a similar one found in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored heparin-binding protein 1 does not impair PCSK9 autoprocessing, secretion, or activity and confirmed that the acidic stretch acts as an inhibitor of PCSK9 function. We also show that upon short exposure to pH values 6.5 to 5.5, an ∼2.5-fold increase in PCSK9 activity on total and cell surface LDLR occurs, and PCSK9 undergoes a second cleavage at Arg(248), generating a two-chain PCSK9-ΔN(248). At pH values below 5.5, PCSK9 dissociates from its prosegment and loses its activity. This pH-dependent activation of PCSK9 represents a novel pathway to further activate PCSK9 in acidic endosomes. These data enhance our understanding of the functional role of the acidic prosegment and on the effect of pH in the regulation of PCSK9 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1975731136,"Proteasomes degrade most proteins in mammalian cells and are established targets of anti-cancer drugs. The majority of proteasome inhibitors are composed of short peptides with an electrophilic functionality (pharmacophore) at the C terminus. All eukaryotic proteasomes have three types of active sites as follows: chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like. It is widely believed that active site specificity of inhibitors is determined primarily by the peptide sequence and not the pharmacophore. Here, we report that active site specificity of inhibitors can also be tuned by the chemical nature of the pharmacophore. Specifically, replacement of the epoxyketone by vinyl sulfone moieties further improves the selectivity of β5-specific inhibitors NC-005, YU-101, and PR-171 (carfilzomib). This increase in specificity is likely the basis of the decreased cytotoxicity of vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors to HeLa cells as compared with that of epoxyketone-based inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1968238097,"To acquire fertilization competence, spermatozoa should undergo several biochemical changes in the female reproductive tract, known as capacitation. The capacitated spermatozoon can interact with the egg zona pellucida resulting in the occurrence of the acrosome reaction, a process that allowed its penetration into the egg and fertilization. Sperm capacitation requires actin polymerization, whereas F-actin must disperse prior to the acrosome reaction. Here, we suggest that the actin-severing protein, gelsolin, is inactive during capacitation and is activated prior to the acrosome reaction. The release of bound gelsolin from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by PBP10, a peptide containing the PIP2-binding domain of gelsolin, or by activation of phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes PIP2, caused rapid Ca2+-dependent F-actin depolymerization as well as enhanced acrosome reaction. Using immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the tyrosine kinase SRC and gelsolin coimmunoprecipitate, and activating SRC by adding 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) enhanced the amount of gelsolin in this precipitate. Moreover, 8-Br-cAMP enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of gelsolin and its binding to PIP2(4,5), both of which inactivated gelsolin, allowing actin polymerization during capacitation. This actin polymerization was blocked by inhibiting the Src family kinases, suggesting that gelsolin is activated under these conditions. These results are further supported by our finding that PBP10 was unable to cause complete F-actin breakdown in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP or vanadate. In conclusion, inactivation of gelsolin during capacitation occurs by its binding to PIP2 and tyrosine phosphorylation by SRC. The release of gelsolin from PIP2 together with its dephosphorylation enables gelsolin activation, resulting in the acrosome reaction.

Mammalian sperm must undergo a series of biochemical modifications in the female reproductive tract prior to productive sperm-egg interaction and the occurrence of the acrosome reaction (AR). 2The abbreviations used are: ARacrosome reactionPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePLCphospholipase C8-Br-cAMP8-bromo-cAMPEGFREGF receptorBAPTA/AM1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)PSAP. sativum agglutinin. The mechanisms of these modifications, collectively called capacitation, are not well characterized. There is no clear recognizable marker of successful capacitation, although several cellular changes are known to have taken place, including cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane, an increase in membrane permeability to bicarbonate and calcium ions, and an increase in cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 1Breitbart H. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar, 2Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another important process that occurs during sperm capacitation is actin polymerization; however, at the end of the capacitation, the polymers must disperse to achieve the AR (3Brener E. Rubinstein S. Cohen G. Shternall K. Rivlin J. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that an increase in F-actin creates a network between the plasma and the outer acrosomal membranes, and the dispersion of F-actin between the two membranes is needed to enable the AR (3Brener E.

A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for actin remodeling requires a closer look at the actin-binding proteins. The presence of actin-binding proteins such as calicin (7von Bülow M.

Tissue & Cell. 1997; 29: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in mammalian sperm suggests that the assembly, of G-actin to form F-actin, as well as the disassembly of F-actin are well controlled events. In this study, we focused on the actin-binding protein, gelsolin. Gelsolin severs assembled actin filaments and caps the fast growing plus end of free or newly severed filaments in response to Ca2+ ions. Phosphoinositides release gelsolin from actin filament ends, providing sites for actin assembly (14Gremm D. Wegner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4339-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Yin H.L. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yin H.L.

In vitro studies suggested that gelsolin is phosphorylated by pp60(c-SRC) and that this phosphorylation is enhanced by phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2(4,5)) (18De Corte V. Gettemans J. Vandekerckhove J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and can interfere with the binding of gelsolin to the actin filaments (19De Corte V. Demol H. Goethals M. Van Damme J. Gettemans J. Vandekerckhove J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous work identified SRC in human spermatozoa, and it appears to be involved in regulating sperm capacitation, calcium fluxes, tyrosine phosphorylation, and the acrosome reaction (20Varano G. Lombardi A. Cantini G. Forti G. Baldi E. Luconi M. Hum. Reprod. 2008; 23: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we reported that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is partially activated during sperm capacitation by the cAMP/PKA/SRC mechanisms. It was suggested that EGFR is phosphorylated at the SRC-specific site, suggesting that SRC is active during capacitation (21Etkovitz N. Tirosh Y. Chazan R. Jaldety Y. Daniel L. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Dev. Biol. 2009; 334: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Lax Y. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, EGFR-mediated signaling is known to activate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), to hydrolyze PIP2(4,5), and to cause the subsequent release of PIP2(4,5)-bound proteins. In vitro studies have shown that gelsolin modulates the activity of several signaling enzymes, including PLC and phospholipase D through interactions with PIP2(4,5) (23Banno Y. Nakashima T. Kumada T. Ebisawa K. Nonomura Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6488-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cheng J. Weber J.D. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol.

It appears that actin polymerization during sperm capacitation depends on phospholipase D activity, which is regulated by the cross-talk between PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) (1Breitbart H. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cohen G. Rubinstein S. Gur Y. Breitbart H. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed elsewhere that PIP2(4,5), the cofactor for phospholipase D activation and F-actin production during sperm capacitation, is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) but not by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity (29Etkovitz N. Rubinstein S. Daniel L. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Even though the role of gelsolin in somatic cells is well established, the presence and the possible role of this protein in the male gamete are not fully understood. In guinea pig sperm, gelsolin and actin were detected in a mixture of plasma and outer acrosomal membranes, and both proteins were absent from the membranes of capacitated spermatozoa (30Cabello-Agüeros J.F. Hernández-González E.O. Mújica A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We propose that during sperm capacitation, gelsolin is inactive to maintain actin polymerization; at some point prior to the AR, gelsolin is activated, leading to the occurrence of the AR. We further suggest that gelsolin inactivation occurs via two mechanisms as follows: first, the binding of gelsolin to PIP2(4,5), and the second, the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on gelsolin by SRC, which was shown to release gelsolin from the actin filaments (19De Corte V. Demol H. Goethals M. Van Damme J. Gettemans J. Vandekerckhove J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data described here confirm this hypothesis and provide a better understanding of the regulation of gelsolin during sperm capacitation and in the acrosome reaction. PBP10 (polyphosphoinositide-binding peptide, rhodamine B-conjugated), PP1, U73122, and A23187 were obtained from Calbiochem. Capacitation medium, F-10 (Ham's) nutrient mixture with l-glutamine, was purchased from Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, IL). Goat polyclonal anti-gelsolin (C-20), mouse monoclonal anti-SRC, (H-12), anti-β-actin HRP-conjugated antibodies, secondary donkey anti-goat IgG, protein G PLUS-agarose (sc-2002), and anti-PIP2(4,5) (PIP2 2C11, sc-53412) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG was purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Human semen was initially liquefied. The semen was then loaded on a Percoll gradient (80, 40, and 20%) and centrifuged for 30 min at 6750 rpm at room temperature. The lower layer containing the sperm was collected and washed twice in Ham's F-10 and then recentrifuged and allowed to “swim up” after the last wash at 37 °C. The motile cells were collected and resuspended in capacitation medium, and the pellet was discarded. Only sperm preparations that contained at least 70% motile sperm were used in the experiments. Human sperm (1 × 107 cells/ml) were capacitated by incubation in capacitation media (Ham's F-10) supplemented with 3 mg/ml BSA. The cells were incubated in this capacitation medium for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The capacitation state of the sperm was confirmed after the 3-h incubation by examining the ability of the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Washed cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were capacitated for 3 h at 37 °C in capacitation medium. The inhibitors indicated for the various experiments were added after 3 h of incubation for 10–20 min, and the inducers were then added for another 60 min of incubation. The percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm was determined microscopically on air-dried sperm smears using FITC-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA). An aliquot of spermatozoa was smeared on a glass slide and allowed to air-dry. The sperm were then permeabilized by adding methanol for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times at 5-min intervals with TBS, air-dried, and then incubated with FITC-PSA (60 mg/ml) at room temperature in the dark for 60 min, washed twice with H2O at 5-min intervals, and mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade (Bio-Rad). For each experiment, at least 150 cells per slide on duplicate slides were evaluated (a total of 300 cells per experiment). Cells with green staining over the acrosomal cap were considered acrosome-intact; those with equatorial green staining or no staining were considered acrosome-reacted. Sperm lysates were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 6% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture 1:100 (Calbiochem), 50 μm NaF, 50 μm pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.2 mm Na3VO4, to the pellet. The mixture was vortexed for 10 min at room temperature. Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was removed, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Sample buffer (2×) was added to the supernatant and boiled for 5 min. The extracts were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred (200 mA for 1 h) to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was performed using a buffer composed of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% milk (for anti-gelsolin and anti-actin) or 5% BSA (for anti-p-SRC and anti-SRC) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), for 30 min at room temperature. Gelsolin and actin were immunodetected using a polyclonal anti-gelsolin antibody (diluted 1:3000), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-actin (1:3000) and a polyclonal anti-SRC antibody (diluted 1:3000). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies. Next, the membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted at 1:10,000. The membranes were washed three times with TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Sperm cells were spread on microscope slides. After air-drying, the sperm cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in TBS for 10 min, placed in 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS for 30 min, washed three times at 5-min intervals in distilled water, air-dried, and then incubated with phalloidin-FITC (4 μm in TBS) for 60 min, washed four times with distilled water at 10-min intervals, and mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade (Bio-Rad). Sperm suspensions were incubated in Ham's F-10 (3 × 107/ml) for 3 h, and the cells were lysed as described previously (29Etkovitz N. Rubinstein S. Daniel L. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2007; 77: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sperm cells were washed once with TBS. An equal volume of lysis solution that contained 1.5% Triton X-100 was added, and the suspension was vortexed vigorously (10 min at 4 °C). At the end of this incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (Triton-soluble G-actin) was collected. The Triton-insoluble content was determined by the addition of 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 6% SDS. The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 10 min. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant (Triton-insoluble F-actin) was collected. Sample buffer was added, and the extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted, as indicated. For immunocytochemistry, sperm cells were spread on glass slides, air-dried, fixed in formaldehyde (4%) for 10 min, dipped in 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS for 30 min, and washed three times at 5-min intervals with TBS. Nonspecific reactive sites were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with TBS containing 10% donkey serum. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with goat polyclonal anti-gelsolin (C-20) antibody diluted 1:50 in TBS containing 1% donkey serum. Next, the slides were washed once in TBS-T and twice (for 5 min) in TBS. The bound antibody was detected using Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-goat IgG (a 1:200 dilution), incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and followed by one wash with TBS-T and two washes with H2O at 5-min intervals. The slides were then mounted with FluoroGuard Antifade. Nonspecific staining was determined by incubating the sperm without the primary antibody. No staining was detected. All images were captured on an Olympus AX70 microscope at 400× magnification. This microscope was equipped with an Olympus DP50 digital camera and with the Viewfinder Lite version 1 software (Pixera Corp., Los Gatos, CA). All fluorescence determinations were performed under nonsaturated conditions. Both the experiments and staining were performed on the same day, and the sperm were photographed within 24 h to reduce the loss of fluorescence. All cell preparations from a single experiment were photographed in the same session and for the same exposure period. The fluorescence intensity was quantified using the MetaMorph ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), and the background intensity was subtracted. For F-actin, all experiments were carried out in duplicate, and at least 100 cells (5–7 pictures) per slide were quantified for fluorescence intensity. For gelsolin, at least 50 cells were quantified for fluorescence intensity. Human spermatozoa (5 × 107 cells/ml) were isolated and capacitated as described previously. After incubation, the sperm samples were transferred into glass tubes and sonicated on ice for 1 min using the “Vibra Cell” (Sonics & Materials Inc., Danbury, CT) with an intensity setting of 40. The cells were then sonicated for 15 s to facilitate the separation of sperm heads and tails (32Nixon B. MacIntyre D.A. Mitchell L.A. Gibbs G.M. O'Bryan M. Aitken R.J. Biol. Reprod. 2006; 74: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Following sonication, the samples were layered over a 75% Percoll cushion in 2-ml tubes and centrifuged at 700 rpm for 15 min to isolate the heads and tails in separate fractions. The pellet that formed contained the sperm heads, although the top layer contained the sperm membranes. The tails resided at the interface between the two liquid layers. The heads and tails were removed and diluted with F-10 media. The purity of each fraction was assessed by microscopy prior to analysis. The head and tail samples were then centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed, and the remaining pellet was SDS-extracted as described previously. Sperm cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and washed with cold TBS. Equal amounts of protein (100 mg for spermatozoa) were sonicated three times in homogenization buffer containing the following: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.25 m sucrose; 2 mm EGTA; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm benzamidine; 1 mm Na3VO4; 10% (w/v) glycerin; 5 mm NaF; 30 mm NaH2PO4; 25 μg/ml leupeptin; 4 μg/ml aprotinin; 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin; 2 μg/ml antipain; and 1 mm PMSF, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, the mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. For immunoprecipitation, 50 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose was added for preclearing the suspension, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were then incubated with 2 μg of anti-SRC/p-Thy/PIP2(4,5) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads was added and further incubated for 2 h with gentle agitation at 4 °C. The beads were then subjected to three washes with 0.1% Triton in TBS buffer and boiled for 5 min with SDS sample buffer. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of at least three experiments for all determinations. Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t test or by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc comparison test using SPSS software (Chicago). In our previous studies, we showed that actin polymerization occurs during sperm capacitation (3Brener E. Rubinstein S. Cohen G. Shternall K. Rivlin J. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Cohen G. Rubinstein S. Gur Y. Breitbart H. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Gelsolin, an actin-severing protein, is expected to be localized with the F-actin fraction in the cell when activated. The data in Fig. 1 reveal that gelsolin levels during capacitation remained constant (Fig. 1A). The Triton X-100 sperm fractions revealed that before capacitation most of the actin was in the form of monomers, i.e. the G-actin form (soluble fraction), although at the end of capacitation most of the actin was in the form of polymers, i.e. the F-actin form (insoluble fraction) (Fig. 1B). Thus, gelsolin is localized in the G-actin fraction before capacitation, although at the end of capacitation, gelsolin is localized in the F-actin fraction (Fig. 1, B and C). We have shown elsewhere in bovine sperm that before capacitation there is almost no F-actin in the sperm head, as most of it is localized to the tail midpiece, whereas after capacitation, there is a significant increase in F-actin in the head (28Cohen G. Rubinstein S. Gur Y. Breitbart H. Dev. Biol. 2004; 267: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that the amount of F-actin in human sperm heads was low before capacitation, increased in capacitated cells, and was reduced again in acrosome-reacted cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, immunocytochemical staining revealed an increase of gelsolin staining in the sperm head during capacitation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the increase of gelsolin in the head could not be seen when intracellular calcium was chelated by BAPTA/AM (Fig. 2B), indicating the importance of calcium ions for this translocation. Further support for the increase of gelsolin in the head is seen by Western blot analysis of separated tail and heads, showing that most of the gelsolin was localized in the tail before capacitation, whereas after capacitation there was a significant decrease in its amount in the tail and a significant increase in the head (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that gelsolin translocates from the sperm tail to the head during capacitation. Gelsolin is an actin-severing protein that causes F-actin depolymerization, and its activation is regulated by calcium ions and phosphoinositides (14Gremm D. Wegner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4339-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Yin H.L. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yin H.L. BioEssays. 1987; 7: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Relatively low calcium concentrations cause conformational changes in the C terminus of gelsolin, which expose its binding site to F-actin, whereas higher calcium concentrations cause a second conformational change exposing the catalytic site (33Kinosian H.J. Newman J. Lincoln B. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3101-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test gelsolin activity, the cells were incubated under capacitation conditions to increase the intracellular levels of F-actin. At this point, gelsolin was activated by increasing the intracellular calcium using the calcium ionophore A23187 or by activating the EGFR by EGF. The data in Fig. 3 reveal a rapid decrease in F-actin levels when intracellular calcium concentrations increased. This effect was blocked when intracellular calcium was chelated using BAPTA/AM. Moreover, a rapid decrease in F-actin was also induced by adding the peptide PBP10 (Fig. 3), which is a peptide derived from the PIP2(4,5)-binding domain of gelsolin. This peptide competes with gelsolin binding to PIP2(4,5) causing the release of gelsolin from PIP2(4,5) and enabling its activity on F-actin (34Cunningham C.C. Vegners R. Bucki R. Funaki M. Korde N. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43390-43399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). F-actin depolymerization by PBP10 was also prevented by chelating intracellular calcium using BAPTA/AM (Fig. 3), suggesting the dependence of gelsolin activation on calcium ions. In our previous study, we showed that F-actin depolymerization must occur in capacitated sperm prior to the acrosome reaction (3Brener E. Rubinstein S. Cohen G. Shternall K. Rivlin J. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, the acrosome reaction cannot occur if F-actin is polymerized. Similarly, the F-actin depolymerization shown in Fig. 3 occurs before the acrosome reaction (Fig. 4). Increasing the intracellular calcium concentration or adding PBP10 to capacitated sperm induced a significant increase in the acrosome reaction rate in sperm that was pretreated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (Fig. 4). The data in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 suggest that gelsolin is activated by an increase in the intracellular calcium levels of capacitated cells, enabling the acrosome reaction. PIP2(4,5) can bind to gelsolin, and the hydrolysis of PIP2(4,5) by PLC releases the bound gelsolin, resulting in gelsolin activation in Sertoli cells (35Guttman J.A. Janmey P. Vogl A.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 499-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that F-actin depolymerization and acrosome reaction induced by the calcium ionophore, A23187, or EGF in capacitated sperm were significantly reduced when PLC is blocked by U73122 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). However, when actin depolymerization or the acrosome reaction was induced by the peptide PBP10, there was no effect on F-actin depolymerization by the PLC inhibitor U73122 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). These data suggest that PLC mediates actin depolymerization prior to the acrosome reaction. In addition, sperm PLC requires micromolar levels of calcium for half-maximal activation similar to the calcium concentration found after the sperm-zona interaction (6Arnoult C. Kazam I.G. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Villaz M. Florman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6757-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible activation of PLC at this time. Stimulation of capacitated spermatozoa with progesterone or with isolated zona pellucida leads to activation of calcium-dependent phospholipase C (36Baldi E. Luconi M. Bonaccorsi L. Forti G. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results show that PLCγ was phosphorylated on Tyr-782 at the end of the capacitation period, an indication of its activation. This phosphorylation could also be seen when AR was induced by the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, and was reduced after 1 h (Fig. 5B). The induction of F-actin depolymerization by EGF, the physiological ligand of EGFR, a known activator of PLCγ, and the phosphorylation/activation of PLCγ indicate that the PLCγ isoform mediates F-actin depolymerization. The induction of F-actin breakdown by PBP10 suggests that this reaction is mediated by gelsolin.FIGURE 6PLCγ activity is requ"
https://openalex.org/W2031070203,"The photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum assimilates CO2 and organic carbon sources (acetate or pyruvate) during mixotrophic growth conditions through a unique carbon and energy metabolism. Using a 13C-labeling approach, this study examined biosynthetic pathways and flux distributions in the central metabolism of C. tepidum. The isotopomer patterns of proteinogenic amino acids revealed an alternate pathway for isoleucine synthesis (via citramalate synthase, CimA, CT0612). A 13C-assisted flux analysis indicated that carbons in biomass were mostly derived from CO2 fixation via three key routes: the reductive tricarboxylic acid (RTCA) cycle, the pyruvate synthesis pathway via pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and the CO2-anaplerotic pathway via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. During mixotrophic growth with acetate or pyruvate as carbon sources, acetyl-CoA was mainly produced from acetate (via acetyl-CoA synthetase) or citrate (via ATP citrate lyase). Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase converted acetyl-CoA and CO2 to pyruvate, and this growth-rate control reaction is driven by reduced ferredoxin generated during phototrophic growth. Most reactions in the RTCA cycle were reversible. The relative fluxes through the RTCA cycle were 80∼100 units for mixotrophic cultures grown on acetate and 200∼230 units for cultures grown on pyruvate. Under the same light conditions, the flux results suggested a trade-off between energy-demanding CO2 fixation and biomass growth rate; C. tepidum fixed more CO2 and had a higher biomass yield (YX/S, mole carbon in biomass/mole substrate) in pyruvate culture (YX/S = 9.2) than in acetate culture (YX/S = 6.4), but the biomass growth rate was slower in pyruvate culture than in acetate culture. The photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum assimilates CO2 and organic carbon sources (acetate or pyruvate) during mixotrophic growth conditions through a unique carbon and energy metabolism. Using a 13C-labeling approach, this study examined biosynthetic pathways and flux distributions in the central metabolism of C. tepidum.

Members of the WASP/WAVE protein family are central nucleation-promoting factors. They are embedded within regulatory networks of macromolecular complexes controlling Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation in time and space. WAVE (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein) proteins are found in a conserved pentameric heterocomplex that contains Abi, Kette/Nap1, Sra-1/CYFIP, and HSPC300. Formation of the WAVE complex contributes to the localization, activity, and stability of the various WAVE proteins.

Purification of these multiprotein complexes and studies of the underlying protein interactions in vitro have led to significant advances in our understanding of how these molecular machines control actin nucleation. WAVE proteins are found in a pentameric heterocomplex that contains Abi, Kette/Nap1, Sra-1/CYFIP, and HSPC300 (2Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W.

The central subunit of the WAVE complex represents the Abelson interactor Abi, which directly binds WAVE, HSPC300, and Kette/Nap1 through different domains. Sra-1 is a peripheral subunit recruited by Kette/Nap1 and links the complex to Rac1 signaling. The WAVE complex is essential for the localization, activity, and stability of the various WAVE proteins (5Bogdan S. Grewe O. Strunk M. Mertens A. Klämbt C.

However, purification and reconstitution experiments are based on the removal of the interacting proteins from their endogenous cellular context. To visualize WAVE complex formation in living flies we established the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technique in Drosophila. The BiFC technique is based on the fusion of two non-fluorescent fragments from a split fluorescent protein (e.g. YFP) to two interacting proteins (12Kerppola T.K. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009; 38: 2876-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Kerppola T.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 465-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Once the proteins bind to each other, the interaction brings the two non-fluorescent fragments into close proximity resulting in the reconstitution of a functional fluorescent protein (Fig. 1A). We engineered Drosophila BiFC vectors utilizing the advantages of the GATEWAY technique (14Walhout A.J. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Hartley J.L. Lorson M.A. van den Heuvel S. Vidal M.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). We visualize WAVE-Abi complexes in the wing epithelium and in the visual system. We show that the N-terminal WAVE homology domain (WHD) of the WAVE protein mediates not only WAVE-Abi but also WAVE-WAVE interactions in vivo. In contrast to free WAVE and Abi, WAVE complexes specifically co-localize with Integrin and Talin to the basal wing epithelium surface, where stable connections between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the actin cytoskeleton are made to hold the dorsal and ventral wing epithelia together (19Bükel C. Brown N.H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Formation of BiFC-stabilized WAVE complexes specifically promotes F-actin formation at the basal surface of the wing epithelium suggesting a possible function of WAVE in Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization in integrin-mediated cell adhesion in the wing. Expression of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) directed against Arp2/3 and WAVE complex components causes a mild cell adhesion phenotype. Thus, our data suggest that WAVE dependent Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation is important for the maintenance of stable integrin junctions. The HA-CYFP fragment (YFP aa 156–239) for C-terminal fusions was amplified per PCR from pSPYCE(M) (29Fristrom D. Wilcox M. Fristrom J.

All PCR products were cloned into the MCS of the pUAST vector via EcoRI and XbaI. pUAST-BiFC vectors were converted into Gateway cloning vectors by introducing the Gateway cassette frame B (RfB, Invitrogen) into the XbaI site for N-terminal fusion constructs or the EcoRI site for C-terminal fusion constructs. The recognition site for the ΦC31-Integrase attB was amplified per PCR from pUASTattB (14Walhout A.J. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Hartley J.L. Lorson M.A. van den Heuvel S. Vidal M.

F-actin was labeled with Phalloidin-Alexa568 (Molecular Probes). Alexa568- or Alexa647-conjugated anti-guinea pig, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000 (Molecular Probes). The epitope-tagged proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Olink; (21Gajadhar A. Guha A. BioTechniques. 2010; 48: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). Images were processed using the Zeiss LSM software and Adobe® Photoshop® CS2. Fly heads were lysed in 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged 2 × 15 min at 16,000 × g to yield the cytoplasmic supernatant. The cytoplasmic supernatant was applied to a Sephadex 200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare). Collected fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and equal volumes of fractions were separated on standard SDS-PAGE. Proteins were analyzed by Western blots using following antibodies: α-WAVE 1:2000 (23Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), mouse α-HA 1:1000 (clone 16B12, Covance). Previous work has identified different combinations of fluorescent protein fragments that can be used for bimolecular fluorescence complementation (22Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 23Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The combination of the N-terminal 173 amino acids of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with a C-terminal fragment containing amino acids 156–239 enhances the reconstitution of YFP (Fig. 1B and Ref. 23Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Similar results were recently obtained by in planta BiFC analysis (24Waadt R. Schmidt L.K. Lohse M. Hashimoto K. Bock R. Kudla J. Plant J. 2008; 56: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We constructed the analogous Drosophila expression plasmids for targeted expression in the fly. We amplified the N-terminal 1–173 aa (NYFP) and the C-terminal 156–239 aa (CYFP) split-YFP fragments containing a Myc- and a HA tag, respectively by PCR and cloned them into the pUAST vector (Fig. 1C and Ref. 18Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For fast and efficient recombinational Gateway cloning of cDNAs we inserted a Gateway cassette up- or downstream of the NYFP and CYFP fragments enabling the construction of both N-terminal and C-terminal NYFP and CYFP fusions. Finally, we introduced an attB site for ΦC31-mediated transgenesis into all vectors (16Groth A.C. Fish M. Nusse R. Calos M.P. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The site-specific recombination mediates the integration of genes at a high frequency into defined genomic sites, thereby eliminating position effects that can cause strong differences in the expression level. Consequently, this BiFC vector system efficiently allows not only to validate interactions between candidate proteins in vivo but also facilitates large-scale approaches to identify new protein-protein interactions. We next used these BiFC vectors to visualize the interaction between WAVE and the Abelson interactor Abi, a member of the highly conserved pentameric WAVE complex. We designed different Abi and WAVE vector combinations fused with C-terminal NYFP and CYFP fragments and generated transgenic flies by ΦC31 integrase-mediated integration into the same genomic landing site. To ensure that all split-YFP fusion proteins were functional we first performed rescue experiments. Loss of abi as well as wave function results in early pupal lethality (20Zallen J.A. Cohen Y. Hudson A.M. Cooley L. Wieschaus E. Schejter E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25Lin T.Y. Huang C.H. Kao H.H. Liou G.G. Yeh S.R. Cheng C.M. Chen M.H. Pan R.L. Juang J.L. Development. 2009; 136: 3099-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 3R. Stephan, C. Gohl, C. Klämbt, and S. Bogdan, unpublished data. Ubiquitous re-expression of split-YFP fusion proteins in abi and wave mutants completely rescued lethality. Thus, the split YFP moiety does not interfere with Abi or WAVE function. Because abi and wave functions are required to control axonal targeting in the visual system through the Arp2/3 complex, 3R. Stephan, C. Gohl, C. Klämbt, and S. Bogdan, unpublished data. we first visualized the interaction between WAVE and Abi in photoreceptor neurons. Each ommatidium of the fly compound eye harbors eight photoreceptor neurons (R-cells) that exhibit a highly polarized morphology (Fig. 2A). The region of the photoreceptor cell bodies lies in the apical region of the developing eye (eye imaginal disc) whereas the axons extend basally into two distinct neuropile areas of the brain (the lamina and the medulla; for review, see Ref. 26Tayler T.D. Garrity P.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Co-expression of WAVE-NYFP and Abi-CYFP in photoreceptor cells using the GMR-Gal4 driver (Fig. 2B, R-cells in red; stained with 24B10) results in strong YFP signals in the lamina plexus, along the axons and in the central part of the growth cones in the medulla. Thus, the formation of WAVE-Abi BiFC complexes preferentially takes place at the most basal compartment of the neuron, the growth cone where axon navigation in response to extracellular signals is regulated by actin dynamics. To further validate the BiFC approach in Drosophila we next visualized WAVE-Abi interaction in wing imaginal discs. We used the en-Gal4 driver, which induces expression in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs, whereas the anterior compartment serves as a negative control. All Abi/WAVE fusion proteins were expressed at comparable levels as determined by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies (data not shown). To rule out unspecific fluorescence complementation in Drosophila, we first tested fluorescence complementation between Abi/WAVE split-YFP fusion proteins and the corresponding YFP fragments alone. The expression of split-YFP constructs was verified by antibody staining. In all these control combinations no or only weak background fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3A). In contrast, strong fluorescence was observed in the posterior compartment of wing discs co-expressing either WAVE-NYFP and Abi-CYFP or Abi-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP combinations (Fig. 3A). We next validated the specificity of Abi-WAVE-mediated fluorescence complementation. Because previous studies had shown that Abi directly binds to the N-terminal WHD domain of WAVE (8Bogdan S. Stephan R. Löbke C. Mertens A. Klämbt C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we co-expressed the Abi-CYFP fusion with a truncated WAVE protein lacking the first 118 amino acids (ΔN) fused to NYFP. Co-expression of WAVEΔN-NYFP and Abi-CYFP fusion proteins did not produce a fluorescent signal under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3B). Thus, the formation of BiFC complexes depends on the direct protein interaction between Abi and WAVE. Previous in vitro studies revealed that oligomerization can increase the affinity of active WASP proteins for the Arp2/3 complex by up to 180-fold (27Padrick S.B. Cheng H.C. Ismail A.M. Panchal S.C. Doolittle L.K. Kim S. Skehan B.M. Umetani J. Brautigam C.A. Leong J.M. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 426-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, whether WAVE is able to dimerize in vivo is not known yet. To test this hypothesis we co-expressed WAVE-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP. Upon co-expression of WAVE-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP, strong YFP fluorescence was observed. Thus, WAVE is capable of forming dimers in vivo (Fig. 3B). WAVE homodimerization also depends on the WHD domain. Deletion of the WHD domain abolished the BiFC signal (Fig. 3B). To exclude that the WAVE-WAVE interaction is indirect and mediated by endogenous Abi protein, we co-expressed WAVE-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP in abi mutant background. However, loss of endogenous Abi did not affect the formation of WAVE-WAVE BiFC complexes (supplemental Fig. S1). To finally exclude that BiFC complex formation artificially triggers WAVE dimerization we co-expressed HA- and Myc-tagged WAVE proteins without any YFP fragments in Drosophila S2R+ cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Myc-tagged WAVE clearly co-precipitates full-length HA-WAVE but not HA-WAVEΔN lacking the WHD domain (Fig. 3C) confirming that WAVE is capable to form dimers. To further analyze whether WAVE forms free dimers, we performed gel filtration chromatography analysis from lysates of wild-type adult heads versus adult heads co-expressing WAVE-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP fusions and analyzed the distribution of tagged as well as of endogenous WAVE protein (Fig. 3D). In wild type, endogenous WAVE protein was mainly found in 400–500 kDa complexes as previously shown (28Fricke R. Gohl C. Dharmalingam E. Grevelhorster A. Zahedi B. Harden N. Kessels M. Qualmann B. Bogdan S. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1429-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). WAVE-WAVE BiFC complexes were exclusively co-fractionated with high molecular mass complexes at 500–700 kDa sizes (Fig. 3D). Importantly, co-expression of WAVE-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP resulted in a shift of endogenous WAVE protein from complexes at 400–500 kDa to 500–700 kDa sizes (Fig. 3D). Thus, WAVE does not exist as a free dimer but it rather becomes incorporated into the endogenous Abi-WAVE complex. We next analyzed the subcellular localization of Abi-WAVE and WAVE-WAVE in wing imaginal discs at high resolution by confocal laser microscopy. The Drosophila wing disc is a bilayered epithelial tissue consisting of a columnar monolayer epithelium covered by a squamous peripodial epithelium (Fig. 4A). The columnar epithelial cells are polarized along the apico-basal axis and represent the proper disc that differentiates into the wing, the hinge and the notum (Fig. 4A and Ref. 29Fristrom D. Wilcox M. Fristrom J. Development. 1993; 117: 509-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primordium of the wing blade is in the center of the disc, the so-called wing pouch surrounded by the wing hinge and the notum (Fig. 4A). Staining of a wing imaginal disc expressing a waveRNAi transgene in the posterior compartment verified the specificity of the WAVE antibody in tissues (Fig. 4B). Confocal cross-sections through the wing pouch showed that endogenous WAVE is most abundant at the apical side of a late third instar wing pouch where it co-localizes with F-actin (Fig. 4B). Less WAVE protein was detected at the basal side where F-actin co-localizes with βPS-integrin in focal adhesion-like structures (30Brown N.H. Gregory S.L. Rickoll W.L. Fessler L.I. Prout M. White R.A. Fristrom J.W. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The localization of bimolecular Abi-WAVE complexes is different from endogenous WAVE protein (compare Fig. 4, B with C). Upon co-expression of WAVE-NYFP and Abi-CYFP, the strongest YFP fluorescence was detected in bright loci at the basal side of late third instar wing pouches, whereas weaker YFP signals were found at the apical surface (Fig. 4C). However, the immunological detection of both split-YFP fragments, WAVE-NYFP or Abi-CYFP, revealed a strong localization at both sides, basally as much as apically (Fig. 4C). Thus, the Abi-WAVE complex specifically localizes at the basal side. Interestingly, a similar subcellular localization was found for WAVE-WAVE split YFP complexes (Fig. 4C). To further confirm that the basal localization of WAVE complexes is no artifact of the BiFC system we examined the subcellular localization of WAVE-Abi complexes by using the in situ proximity ligation method (31Fredriksson S. Gullberg M. Jarvius J. Olsson C. Pietras K. Gústafsdóttir S.M. Ostman A. Landegren U. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 32Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). We used an adapted epitope-tagged proximity ligation assay (PLA), which depends on the dual binding of primary antibodies followed by species selected PLA probe binding (21Gajadhar A. Guha A. BioTechniques. 2010; 48: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For visualization of WAVE/Abi complexes by PLA we co-expressed a Myc-tagged WAVE and HA-tagged Abi protein only in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs (Fig. 4D). Similar to the BiFC system we observed a strong PLA signal in bright puncta at the basal side of late third instar wing pouches (Fig. 4D). As development proceeds Abi-WAVE and WAVE-WAVE complexes persist at the basal side in pupal wings where integrin forms stable connections between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 5, A and B and Ref. 19Bükel C. Brown N.H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that the dynamics of BiFC complexes differ from those of endogenous protein complexes by stable association of the split fluorescent fragments (22Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 33Robida A.M. Kerppola T.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This stabilization can result in the irreversible formation of complexes that potentially alters the function or activity of the complexes. Clustering of BiFC-stabilized WAVE complexes might also promote WAVE activity in Drosophila. Supporting this notion, we found that not only the formation of the Abi-WAVE split-YFP complex, but also oligomerization of WAVE-WAVE BiFC complexes promotes actin polymerization (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). The induction of basal actin polymerization by WAVE-WAVE BiFC complexes is not simply due to an increased level of WAVE protein by the expression of two copies of WAVE split YFP fragments. Co-expression of either two copies of WAVE-NYFP or two copies of WAVE-CYFP only results in a weak induction of F-actin (supplemental Fig. S2, D and E). Similar to endogenous WAVE, WAVE-NYFP, and WAVE-CYFP split YFP fusions are enriched apically (supplemental Fig. S2, D and E). Despite this strong apical concentration of WAVE-NYFP and WAVE-CYFP proteins we only found slightly increased F-actin formation at the apical surface suggesting that WAVE proteins are less active at apical sides. Increased actin polymerization was particularly detected at the basal surface of wing imaginal disc and pupal wings where BiFC complexes are mainly formed (Fig. 5, B and C and supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental Movie M1). Interestingly, we found slightly increased levels of Talin at the posterior wing compartment (Fig. 5C). Because Talin directly links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton the increased actin polymerization induced by BiFC-stabilized WAVE complexes might either recruit additional Talin protein or might affect the dynamic turnover of Talin at integrin junctions. Thus, clustering of stabilized BiFC complexes might cause a prolonged activation of WAVE resulting in an increased actin polymerization. Purified integrin complexes contain actin-nucleating factors such as Arp2/3 and formins and exhibit actin polymerization activity (34Butler B. Gao C. Mersich A.T. Blystone S.D. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 242-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that adhesion complexes actively participate in the linkage of ECM and the cytoskeleton. The observed co-localization of hetero-oligomeric WAVE-complexes with Integrin and Talin in the wing epithelium further suggests a role of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization in regulating integrin-mediated cell adhesion in vivo. To test this, we induced wing clones mutant for the regulatory subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, arpc1 (sopQ25st) and asked if arpc1 mutant wings show wing blisters, a characteristic loss of integrin function phenotype caused by a detachment of both wing epithelia. And indeed, arpc1 mutant wings show frequently wing blisters (Fig. 6B). However, the morphology of these mutant wings was grossly affected suggesting that Arp2/3 function is not only important for cell adhesion but also required for proliferation and differentiation of the wing epithelium. Therefore, we only partially suppressed single components of the Arp2/3 complex and WAVE complex by RNA interference (RNAi). In contrast to silencing β-integrin myospheroid (mys) expression knockdown of the Arp2/3 subunit p20, wave, kette, and sra-1 did not cause penetrant wing blisters (Fig. 6, <3%, n = 30 flies). However, suppression of p20, wave and single components of the WAVE-complex showed fully penetrant wrinkled wings (80–90%, n = 30 flies, a mild cell adhesion phenotype observed in αPS1 integrin mutant wing clones (35Brower D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or after overexpression of dominant-negative Tensin (36Torgler C.N. Narasimha M. Knox A.L. Zervas C.G. Vernon M.C. Brown N.H. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the WAVE complex and the Arp2/3 complex are important for maintenance of stable integrin junctions in the wing epithelium. The BiFC method has emerged as a powerful tool to visualize and characterize protein interactions and protein complexes in living cells (12Kerppola T.K. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009; 38: 2876-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Kerppola T.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2008; 37: 465-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Because of its technical simplicity the BiFC technique has been adapted to different model systems, including mammalian cells (22Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), yeast (37Sung M.K. Huh W.K.

Methods. 2008; 45: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), plants (40Bracha-Drori K. Shichrur K. Katz A. Oliva M. Angelovici R. Yalovsky S. Ohad N. Plant J. 2004; 40: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 41Walter M. Chaban C. Schütze K. Batistic O. Weckermann K. Näke C. Blazevic D. Grefen C. Schumacher K. Oecking C. Harter K.

Methods. 2008; 45: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this work, we established for the first time the BiFC system in Drosophila to validate and identify protein interactions within the WAVE complex in living flies. We used a pUAST-derived vector, which allows the targeted expression of the tagged split-YFP fusion proteins in a temporally and spatially controlled fashion (18Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We combined this unique expression tool with the Gateway cloning technique and the ΦC31-mediated transgenesis strategy. These features allow not only fast and efficient cloning of cDNAs but also a highly efficient site-specific integration of large expression vectors into the genome. Site-specific transgenesis also ensures a comparable expression rate of both split-YFP fusion proteins, an important prerequisite for efficient reconstitution of split-YFP. The availability of a large collection of different landing sites offers great flexibility regarding the choice of integration sites and the expression levels of transgenes (17Bischof J. Maeda R.K. Hediger M. Karch F. Basler K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). To avoid high background fluorescence we used a genomic landing site ensuring a low expression of the split-YFP fragments as determined by Western blot analysis. The integration into distinct landing sites also allows to perform a detailed comparative analysis between mutant proteins, different interaction partners of the same protein or the influence of post-translational modifications like phosphorylation on complex formation. Previous reconstitution studies have shown that WAVE proteins are part of a pentameric 440-kDa complex with a 1:1:1:1:1 stochiometry of the complex members WAVE, Abi, Kette/Nap1, Sra-1/CYFIP, and HSPC300 (2Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 3Gautreau A. Ho H.Y. Li J. Steen H. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl.

Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The existence of the WAVE complex has also been demonstrated in Drosophila by fractionation of the crude extracts by gel filtration (28Fricke R. Gohl C. Dharmalingam E. Grevelhorster A. Zahedi B. Harden N. Kessels M. Qualmann B. Bogdan S. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1429-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 3R. Stephan, C. Gohl, C. Klämbt, and S. Bogdan, unpublished data. Drosophila WAVE protein mainly co-fractionates with Abi in complexes ranging from 400 to 500 kDa. However, depending on the cell type or tissue even larger complexes have been observed suggesting either additional components or different stochiometries by dimerization (28Fricke R. Gohl C.

Stephan, C. Gohl, C. Klämbt, and S. Bogdan, unpublished data. Whether WAVE can dimerize or whether dimerization of WAVE plays a role in vivo has not been determined so far. In this BiFC study, we validated not only the central interaction between WAVE and Abi but also identified a dimeric interaction of WAVE in vivo. However, WAVE does not exist as a free dimer but rather forms higher-order clusters with endogenous WAVE complex components. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that forcing the dimerization of WASP proteins increases their affinity for the Arp2/3 complex and enhances its nucleation activity (27Padrick S.B. Cheng H.C. Ismail A.M. Panchal S.C. Doolittle L.K. Kim S. Skehan B.M. Umetani J. Brautigam C.A. Leong J.M. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 426-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In line with this notion, we observed a strong induction of F-actin at sites of WAVE-Abi and WAVE-WAVE BiFC complex formation. However, the stabilization of protein complexes by BiFC can potentially interfere with the function or activity of complexes (4Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E. Di Fiore P.P. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36Torgler C.N. Narasimha M. Knox A.L. Zervas C.G. Vernon M.C. Brown N.H. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The irreversible formation of such WAVE BiFC complexes might also contribute to the increased formation of F-actin in the developing wing. Both interactions, WAVE-Abi and WAVE-WAVE require the N-terminal WHD domain of WAVE and both BiFC complexes are enriched at the basal surface of the wing epithelium. The high sensitivity of BiFC analysis allows the visualization of transient protein interactions. The formation of basal WAVE complexes might be such a transient event, which is normally subject to a rapid turnover. Remarkably, the endogenous WAVE protein or free WAVE split-YFP proteins accumulate apically. This striking difference in the subcellular localization indicates that complex formation preferentially takes place at the basal side of the wing epithelium suggesting a possible function of WAVE in formation of stable connections between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of cell adhesion in the wing leads to a detachment of both epithelia causing the formation of liquid-filled blisters (19Bükel C. Brown N.H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Similar wing blistering was also observed in sop2/arpc1 (encoding a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex) mutant clones. Partial suppression of arp2/3 as well as wave function by RNAi results in mild cell adhesion defects. In summary, our data revealed not only a localization of WAVE complexes at integrin junction but also suggest a functional requirement of WAVE-dependent Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization in the formation or maintenance of integrin-mediated cell adhesion in the wing.

To investigate the role of BRMS1 in human melanoma progression and prognosis, we established tissue microarray and BRMS1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 41 dysplastic nevi, 90 primary melanomas and 47 melanoma metastases. We found that BRMS1 expression was significantly decreased in metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma or dysplastic nevi (P=0.021 and 0.001, respectively, χ2 test). In addition, reduced BRMS1 staining was significantly correlated with American Joint Committee on Cancer stages (P=0.011, χ2 test), but not associated with tumor thickness, tumor ulceration and other clinicopathological parameters. Furthermore, BRMS1 expression was significantly correlated with disease-specific 5-year survival of melanoma patients (P=0.007, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that BRMS1 staining was an independent prognostic factor for melanoma patients (relative risk=0.51; confidence interval=0.29–0.91; P=0.022). Moreover, we demonstrated that BRMS1 overexpression inhibited endothelial cell growth and tube formation ability by suppressing NF-κB activity and IL-6 expression in vitro. We also showed that knockdown of BRMS1 increased IL-6 expression and promoted endothelial cell growth and tube formation. In addition, our data revealed that the BRMS1-mediated IL-6 expression is dependent on NF-κB. Strikingly, our in vivo studies using nude mice confirmed that BRMS1 inhibited blood vessel formation and the recruitment of CD31-positive cells in matrigel plugs. Taken together, BRMS1 expression was decreased in metastatic melanomas, which resulted in deficient suppression of angiogenesis and contributed to melanoma progression. BRMS1 may serve an important prognostic marker and therapeutic target for melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2022324445,"Gene targeting in ES cells was used to substitute control of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) expression from the endogenous promoter to the mouse c-fms promoter. The result is an animal model called ACE 10/10 in which ACE is overexpressed by monocytes, macrophages, and other myelomonocytic lineage cells. To study the immune response of these mice to bacterial infection, we challenged them with Listeria monocytogenes or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). ACE 10/10 mice have a significantly enhanced immune response to both bacteria in vivo and in vitro. For example, 5 days after Listeria infection, the spleen and liver of ACE 10/10 mice had 8.0- and 5.2-fold less bacteria than wild type mice (WT). In a model of MRSA skin infection, ACE 10/10 mice had 50-fold less bacteria than WT mice. Histologic examination showed a prominent infiltrate of ACE-positive mononuclear cells in the skin lesions from ACE 10/10. Increased bacterial resistance in ACE 10/10 is directly due to overexpression of ACE, as it is eliminated by an ACE inhibitor. Critical to increased immunity in ACE 10/10 is the overexpression of iNOS and reactive nitrogen intermediates, as inhibition of iNOS by the inhibitor 1400W eliminated all in vitro and in vivo differences in innate bacterial resistance between ACE 10/10 and WT mice.

The classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) 2The abbreviations used are: RASrenin angiotensin systemACEangiotensin-converting enzymeTPMthioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophageMRSAmethicillin resistant S. aureusiNOSinducible NO synthaseAcacetyl. is a complex cascade of enzymes and peptides associated with the regulation of blood pressure (1Corvol P. Williams T.A. Soubrier F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 283-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). RAS regulates production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II from angiotensinogen via sequential catalysis by renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Although renin is precise in substrate specificity, ACE is a somewhat promiscuous peptidase that cleaves angiotensin I, substance P, AcSDKP, β-endorphins, and several other physiologic peptides. Because ACE has a variety of substrates, it may affect several physiologic and pathologic processes such as hematopoiesis, fertility, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammation (2Bernstein K.E.

Studies have also found a role for RAS in the recruitment of inflammatory cells into tissues through the regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines by resident inflammatory cells (7Ruiz-Ortega M. Bustos C. Hernández-Presa M.A. Lorenzo O. Plaza J.J. Egido J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 430-439PubMed Google Scholar). ACE regulates bradykinin, which is critical for dendritic cell maturation and TH1 cell development during Trypanosoma cruzi infection (10Scharfstein J. Monteiro A.C. Schmitz V. Svensjö E. Biol.

Mediators Inflamm. 2009; 2009: 752406Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our group has recently described a mouse model called ACE 10/10 in which gene targeting in ES cells was used to substitute control of ACE expression from the endogenous promoter to the mouse c-fms promoter (12Shen X.Z. Li P. Weiss D. Fuchs S. Xiao H.D. Adams J.A. Williams I.R. Capecchi M.R. Taylor W.R. Bernstein K.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 2122-2134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The result is an animal model in which ACE is overexpressed by monocytes, macrophages, and other myelomonocytic lineage cells. These mice demonstrated a robust immunological response when challenged with mouse models of melanoma and lymphoma. Specifically, ACE 10/10 mice resisted tumor growth far better than WT mice. This was correlated with increased numbers of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, when compared with WT cells, ACE 10/10 macrophages showed an increased proinflammatory phenotype, characterized by increased infiltration of the tumors, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, and superior processing of tumor antigens (13Shen X.Z. Lukacher A.E. Billet S. Williams I.R. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9957-9965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although this phenotype was eliminated by ACE inhibitors, the production of angiotensin II was probably not crucial in tumor resistance. Rather, ACE overexpression in myelomonocytic cells seemed to trigger a more profound immune response in which the animals responded more vigorously than WT mice to immunologic challenge. Although the finding that ACE 10/10 mice resist the growth of tumors better than WT mice is exciting, tumor growth models in mice are somewhat artificial. This led us to ask whether the enhanced immune response observed in ACE 10/10 mice would also be present when these animals were exposed to two models of bacterial infection: Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria), a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium that is a much studied intracellular pathogen, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), an aggressive extracellular micro-organism that is increasing in prevalence and incidence (14Chambers H.F. Deleo F.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 15Zenewicz L.A. Shen H. Microbes Infect. 2007; 9: 1208-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The spread of community-associated MRSA is an important public health concern because these bacteria can be particularly virulent. Here, we report that ACE 10/10 mice have a substantially enhanced innate immune response to both these organisms in vivo and in vitro, and this is associated with overexpression of iNOS. Our data show that the manipulation of ACE in myelomonocytic cells markedly increases the immune response, not only to mouse models of tumor, but to aggressive forms of bacterial infection.

These mice were back-crossed at least 10 generations to C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were maintained in microisolator cages. L. monocytogenes strain EGD was a gift from Dr. Rafi Ahmed (Emory University). Bacteria were propagated overnight on brain heart infusions. This was then diluted 1:100 in fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until an A540 of ∼2.5. The bacteria were then washed in PBS and stored in PBS with 30% glycerol at −80 °C at a concentration of 1 × 108/ml. For each experiment, a fresh vial was thawed, and bacteria were washed in PBS and diluted appropriately. Mice were injected intravenously with 100 μl of bacteria in PBS. Livers and spleens from infected mice were harvested at different time points after infection, and cfus were calculated by plating serial dilutions of tissue homogenates on brain heart infusion plates (Hardy Diagnostics, CA). S. aureus USA 300, strain SF8300, was obtained from Dr. Binh Diep (University of California, San Diego). Bacteria were routinely cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. An overnight bacterial culture was diluted 1:1000 in pre-warmed media and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until an A540 of ∼2.5. Bacteria were immediately pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with equal volume of PBS, and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 1010 cfu/ml. This was mixed with an equal volume of PBS containing dextran microbead (Cytodex) suspension at 50 mg/100 ml. 100 μl of this suspension was injected subcutaneously into each flank of mice. Skin lesions were defined by darkened areas of necrosis, and lesion size was quantified over the course of 4 days by a protocol described previously (17Tseng C.W. Kyme P. Low J. Rocha M.A. Alsabeh R. Miller L.G. Otto M. Arditi M. Diep B.A. Nizet V. Doherty T.M. Beenhouwer D.O. Liu G.Y. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the length and width of the lesion was multiplied, and irregularly shaped lesions were broken down into smaller symmetrical pieces and measured. On day four, mice were euthanized; skin lesion was measured, excised, weighed and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS for cfu determination by serial dilutions. ALZET osmotic minipumps (Cupertino, CA) were placed subcutaneously, following the manufacturer's instructions. ACE inhibitors ramipril (Roxane Laboratories) or lisinopril (Merck) were dosed at 16 mg/kg/day, losartan (LKT Laboratories) was dosed at 30 mg/kg/day, and hydralazine (Sigma) was administered at 40 mg/kg/day for 1 week in drinking water. Tail cuff blood pressure measurements were performed as described previously to verify effectiveness of the drugs in reducing blood pressure (16Cole J. Quach D.L. Sundaram K. Corvol P. Capecchi M.R. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The iNOS-specific inhibitor 1400W (Cayman Chemical) was administered at 50 μg/ml in drinking water. Treatment was initiated on the day of infection and maintained until the termination of the experiment. Enhanced green fluorescent protein transgenic mice (TgN(β-act-EGFP)04Obs) (18Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y.

Homozygous ACE 10/10 mice expressing GFP (ACE 10/10-GFP) were obtained by a classical breeding scheme. For bone marrow transplantation, donor mice were 8-week-old ACE 10/10-GFP or littermate WT/WT-GFP; recipients were 8-week-old WT C57BL/6 that did not express GFP. Bone marrow was obtained from donor mice by flushing femurs and tibias with RPMI 1640 medium. Nucleated cells were counted, and the bone marrow was resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 107/ml. Recipient mice were irradiated with 1100 radians and immediately reconstituted with either 2 × 106 ACE 10/10-GFP or WT/WT-GFP bone marrow cells, as described previously (12Shen X.Z. Li P. Weiss D. Fuchs S. Xiao H.D. Adams J.A. Williams I.R. Capecchi M.R. Taylor W.R. Bernstein K.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 2122-2134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After 8 weeks, the recipient mice were analyzed by FACS for blood leukocyte expression of GFP, ACE, and CD45. To collect thioglycollate elicited peritoneal macrophages (TPMs), 6–8-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of aged thioglycollate broth. Four days later, macrophages were harvested from the peritoneal cavity by lavaging with sterile Hank's phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in complete media: RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech). 105 macrophages were distributed into wells of 96-well plates. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were washed away, leaving wells with confluent adherent macrophages. After 18 h of culture in complete media with or without 10 ng/ml IFN-γ, cells were infected with 106 bacteria (multiplicity of infection of 10) in 100 μl of antibiotic-free media. After 1 h of phagocytosis, nonincorporated bacteria were removed by washing, and complete media was supplemented with 5 μg/ml gentamicin to kill any residual extracellular bacteria. In some experiments, macrophages were treated with 10 μm of the specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W at the time of the priming with IFN-γ. At different time points, cells were washed and then lysed with 0.01% Triton in PBS, and viable bacteria ascertained by dilution and plating on brain heart infusion plates. Nitrite anion production by macrophages was determined with Griess assay using the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, macrophage monolayers were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 18 h, and supernatants were harvested. In some experiments, the macrophage monolayers were stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ and then infected with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of 10 or 50 bacteria per cell. A total of 50 μl of culture supernatant was combined with an equal volume of Griess reagent, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before quantifying the absorbance at 540 nm. The nitrite production was determined using a standard curve and normalized to total cell number in each sample. 107 thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS overnight. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. After protein quantification using the Pierce protein assay, 40 mg of protein were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then washed in Tris-Tween-buffered saline (TTBS, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), and blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk solution in TTBS. Subsequently, the membrane was probed with a 1:600 dilution of polyclonal iNOS antibody (a kind gift of Dr David Harrison, Emory University) or a 1:1000 dilution of anti-arginase 1 antibody (BD Transduction) in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TTBS. The blot was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). The membranes were probed with β-actin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) to verify loading. Tissue was embedded in paraffin using standard techniques. 5-μm sections were cut and steamed for 30 min in buffer, pH 6.1 (Dako, catalog no. S1699). They were then stained in a Dako automated stainer with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-ACE antibody (19Langford K.G. Shai S.Y. Howard T.E. Kovac M.J. Overbeek P.A. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15559-15562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibody (Dako, catalog no. K4003) and DAB chromogen (Dako, catalog no. 3468) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All data are expressed as the arithmetic means ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups of animals or treatments were made by one-way ANOVA or Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We tested the response of ACE 10/10 mice to Listeria infection in vivo and in vitro. To test in vivo bacterial burden, WT and ACE 10/10 mice were injected i.v. with 4 × 103 cfu of Listeria, strain EGD. The mice were sacrificed 3 or 5 days after infection, and bacterial counts were determined in spleen and liver. In both spleen and liver, the ACE 10/10 mice consistently had substantially fewer bacteria (Fig. 1A). At day 3 after infection, the bacteria burden in the spleen and liver of WT mice was 6.5- and 5.5-fold more than that of the equivalent ACE 10/10 tissues (n = at least 9, p < 0.01). At day 5, the spleen and liver of WT mice had an 8.0- and 5.2-fold greater bacterial load than those of the ACE 10/10 mice (n = at least 9; liver, p < 0.002; spleen, p < 0.003). To understand the increased resistance to infection in ACE 10/10, we also tested additional groups of WT and ACE 10/10 mice that were treated with either the specific ACE inhibitor ramipril or the angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist losartan delivered via osmotic minipump. Three days after infection, mice were sacrificed, and bacterial burden was determined in the spleen and liver (Fig. 1B). These data showed that the treatment of ACE 10/10 mice with ramipril consistently eliminated significant differences between ACE 10/10 and WT, indicating that the catalytic activity of ACE is directly responsible for the reduced bacterial burden in ACE 10/10 mice. In contrast, treatment of mice with the AT1 antagonist did not alter the bacterial resistance noted in ACE 10/10 mice. For example, in spleen, ACE 10/10 and WT mice treated with losartan averaged 4.3 × 104 and 3.0 × 105 cfu, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.0005), which was essentially identical to the results in the absence of losartan. Using a higher inoculum of Listeria (3 × 104), similar differences were observed between ACE 10/10 and WT mice. Following a 5-day i.v. challenge, we recovered just less than a log lower colony count in both spleen and liver compared with WT (Fig. 1C). For example, in the spleen, ACE 10/10 averaged 9.3 × 104 cfu, whereas WT averaged 7.4 × 105 (n = 7, p < 0.003). Similar to the previous experiment, this effect was negated by addition of an ACE inhibitor, but nonspecific lowering of blood pressure by hydralazine, which works independently of RAS, had no such effect. Macrophages are a well characterized cell host for Listeria replication. To directly assess the ability of ACE 10/10 macrophages to kill Listeria, an in vitro killing assay was performed using TPMs, in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. Listeria was added at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and phagocytosis was allowed to proceed for 1 h. Nonincorporated bacteria were then removed, and the media was supplemented with gentamicin to kill residual extracellular bacteria. After further incubation such that the total time since first exposure to bacteria was 2 to 8 h, cfus were determined by standard methods. In the absence of IFN-γ priming, there was no significant difference between the ability of ACE 10/10 and WT macrophages to kill Listeria (Fig. 2, top two lines). ACE 10/10 macrophages express abundant surface ACE (13Shen X.Z. Lukacher A.E. Billet S. Williams I.R. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9957-9965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and thus, these data demonstrated that ACE has no direct bactericidal effect (Fig. 2). Neither is there a difference in phagocytosis because flow cytometric analysis of engulfed FITC-labeled Listeria by IFN-γ primed TPMs from WT and ACE 10/10 was similar (supplemental Fig. S1). However, once primed with IFN-γ, there was substantially better killing of Listeria by the ACE 10/10 cells. The data are significant by 4 h (p < 0.005); by 8 h, ACE 10/10 macrophages have 11.6-fold less bacteria than WT macrophages (n = 8, p < 0.001). We also performed an identical experiment but now mice were treated with an ACE inhibitor for 1 week prior to isolating TPM. Macrophages were then treated with IFN-γ overnight in media also containing ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibition eliminated all differences in Listeria killing between ACE 10/10 and WT macrophages after 4 or 8 h of incubation (4 h, ACE 10/10 = 1.4 × 105 CFU/105 macrophages; WT = 1.2 × 105 CFU/105 macrophages; 8 h, ACE10/10 = 4.1 × 104 CFU/105 macrophages; WT = 7.2 × 104 CFU/105 macrophages; n = at least 5, p < 0.6). Thus, both in vivo and in vitro data show significantly better killing of Listeria in ACE 10/10 mice as compared with WT. This is dependent on the increased ACE activity in the ACE 10/10 model. Substantial previous work has demonstrated that the killing of Listeria is dependent upon the generation of reactive oxygen species by NADPH oxidase (Nox2) and by the generation of reactive nitrogen intermediaries, predominantly nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (20Shiloh M.U. MacMicking J.D. Nicholson S. Brause J.E. Potter S. Marino M. Fang F. Dinauer M. Nathan C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Our group has investigated each of these systems in ACE 10/10 mice. To study burst reactive oxygen species generation, TPM from ACE 10/10 and WT mice were isolated and cultured overnight with or without 10 ng/ml of IFN-γ. Listeria was then added, and reactive oxygen species were quantified over 80 min using a standard luminescence assay (21Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although more than 10 mice per group were examined, there was no consistent difference between ACE 10/10 and WT mice. Representative data are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. To investigate the role of nitrites, TPM were isolated and then primed overnight with or without 10 ng/ml IFN-γ. Some groups of cells were also exposed to Listeria at an multiplicity of infection of either 10 or 50 (Fig. 3A). In the absence of IFN-γ priming, there was no difference in nitrite production between macrophages from ACE 10/10 or WT. In contrast, TPM from ACE 10/10 consistently showed a 2.2- to 2.9-fold increased production of nitrite, as compared with identically treated cells from WT mice. Even in the absence of stimulation with Listeria, IFN-γ primed cells from ACE 10/10 made 2.4-fold more nitrite than WT cells (ACE 10/10, 16.3 μm; WT, 6.8 μm; n = 6, p < 0.005). Macrophages make NO via the up-regulation of iNOS (22MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). To evaluate this, TPMs were cultured for 18 h in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/ml). Culture supernatants were removed, and cell lysates were analyzed for iNOS expression by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Samples were also probed for l-arginase expression, as this competes with iNOS for arginine. To control for loading, samples were probed for β-actin levels, and after band density analysis, iNOS levels were normalized for the levels of the housekeeping gene (Fig. 3C). This study showed a 2-fold increase in iNOS protein expression in macrophages from ACE 10/10 mice as compared with WT (ACE 10/10, 0.95 ± 0.2; WT, 0.47 ± 0.14; n = 5 mice, p < 0.005). In contrast, we saw no difference in l-arginase expression between the two groups. We showed that the increased in vivo resistance of ACE 10/10 mice to Listeria is eliminated by treatment with an ACE inhibitor. If, in fact, increased bacterial killing is also due to increased activity of iNOS, then ACE inhibitor treatment should be associated with reduced nitrite production. To study this, WT and ACE 10/10 mice were treated with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril for 1 week. TPMs were then collected, primed with LPS or IFN-γ, and assessed for nitrite production. Indeed, treatment of the mice with lisinopril resulted in a marked diminution of nitrite levels in the ACE 10/10 cells such that there was no significant difference in nitrite production between IFN-γ- or LPS-stimulated WT and ACE 10/10 cells (Fig. 3D). Given both the increased production of iNOS and nitrites by ACE 10/10 cells, we directly investigated the role of iNOS in the killing of Listeria by performing an in vitro killing assay (Fig. 4A). TPMs were incubated overnight with or without IFN-γ. In this experiment, we also included groups of IFN-γ primed macrophages that were incubated with the compound 1400W, a specific inhibitor of iNOS (23Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although 1400W had virtually no effect on WT cells, there was a marked effect on cells from ACE 10/10 mice; in the presence of 1400W, these cells killed Listeria equivalent to either WT cells with or without 1400W. The combination of data showing enhanced in vitro production of nitrites by ACE 10/10 cells, and the effects of the iNOS inhibitor 1400W in eliminating in vitro differences in killing between ACE 10/10 and WT, implies that a critical part of the enhanced immune response observed in ACE 10/10 mice is IFN-γ-stimulated production of iNOS. To investigate the role of iNOS in vivo, WT and ACE 10/10 mice were inoculated i.v. with 3 × 104 cfu of Listeria, strain EGD. Beginning on the day of infection, a group of mice were treated with water containing 50 μg/ml 1400W and were maintained on the drug throughout the duration of the experiment (Fig. 4B). Five days after infection, mice were sacrificed, and the burden of Listeria in the spleen and liver was determined. In the absence of the iNOS inhibitor, ACE 10/10 mice showed significantly less bacteria in the spleen and liver, similar to data presented in Fig. 1. With the administration of the iNOS inhibitor, all groups of mice showed a significant increase in the burden of Listeria. This is consistent with published data showing an important role for iNOS in the control of Listeria infection (20Shiloh M.U. MacMicking J.D. Nicholson S. Brause J.E. Potter S. Marino M. Fang F. Dinauer M. Nathan C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 24Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In addition, the administration of 1400W to ACE 10/10 mice rendered these mice functionally equivalent to WT in that there was no longer any significant difference in bacterial burden. Although Listeria is a traditional model for understanding the innate immune response to bacteria, we also wanted to study the response of ACE 10/10 mice to the challenging clinical problem of MRSA. Utilizing a necrotizing fasciitis model, ACE 10/10 and WT mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 109 CFU MRSA USA 300, strain SF8300"
https://openalex.org/W2058677153,"In recent years considerable progress has been made in treatment strategies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the disease remains incurable because of the development of chemoresistance. Strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms are therefore highly needed. At least two mechanisms contribute to the development of resistance to drugs; acquired mutations resulting in a dysfunctional p53 response and shifts in the balance between apoptosis-regulating proteins. Platinum-based compounds have been successfully applied in relapsed lymphoma and recently also in high-risk CLL. In this study we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of cisplatinum (CDDP) in chemorefractory CLL. Independent of p53-functional status, CDDP acted synergistically with fludarabine (F-ara-A). The response involved generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which led to specific upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa. Induction of Noxa resulted in cell death by apoptosis as inhibition of caspase activation completely abrogated cell death. Furthermore, drug-resistance upon CD40-ligand stimulation, a model for the protective stimuli provided in lymph nodes, could also be overcome by CDDP/F-ara-A. ROS accumulation resulted in Noxa upregulation mainly at the transcriptional level and this was, at least in part, mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Finally, Noxa RNA-interference markedly decreased sensitivity to CDDP/F-ara-A, supporting a key role for Noxa as mediator between ROS signaling and apoptosis induction. Our data indicate that interference in the cellular redox balance can be exploited to overcome chemoresistance in CLL."
https://openalex.org/W2015566827,"In the absence of store depletion, plasmalemmal Ca(2+) permeability in resting muscle is very low, and its contribution in the maintenance of Ca(2+) homeostasis at rest has not been studied in detail. Junctophilin 1 knock-out myotubes (JP1 KO) have a severe reduction in store-operated Ca(2+) entry, presumably caused by physical alteration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and T-tubule junction, leading to disruption of the SR signal sent by Stim1 to activate Orai1. Using JP1 KO myotubes as a model, we assessed the contribution of the Orai1-mediated Ca(2+) entry pathway on overall Ca(2+) homeostasis at rest with no store depletion. JP1 KO myotubes have decreased Ca(2+) entry, [Ca(2+)](rest), and intracellular Ca(2+) content compared with WT myotubes and unlike WT myotubes, are refractory to BTP2, a Ca(2+) entry blocker. JP1 KO myotubes show down-regulation of Orai1 and Stim1 proteins, suggesting that this pathway may be important in the control of resting Ca(2+) homeostasis. WT myotubes stably transduced with Orai1(E190Q) had similar alterations in their resting Ca(2+) homeostasis as JP1 KO myotubes and were also unresponsive to BTP2. JP1 KO cells show decreased expression of TRPC1 and -3 but overexpress TRPC4 and -6; on the other hand, the TRPC expression profile in Orai1(E190Q) myotubes was comparable with WT. These data suggest that an important fraction of resting plasmalemmal Ca(2+) permeability is mediated by the Orai1 pathway, which contributes to the control of [Ca(2+)](rest) and resting Ca(2+) stores and that this pathway is defective in JP1 KO myotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2084463586,"GRASP65 links cis-Golgi cisternae via a homotypic, N-terminal PDZ interaction, and its mitotic phosphorylation disrupts this activity. Neither the identity of the PDZ ligand involved in the GRASP65 self-interaction nor the mechanism by which phosphorylation inhibits its interaction is known. Phospho-mimetic mutation of known cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B sites, all of which are in the C-terminal ""regulatory domain"" of the molecule, failed to block organelle tethering. However, we identified a site phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in the GRASP65 N-terminal domain for which mutation to aspartic acid blocked tethering and alanine substitution prevented mitotic Golgi unlinking. Further, using interaction assays, we discovered an internal PDZ ligand adjacent to the PLK phosphorylation site that was required for tethering. These results reveal the mechanism of phosphoinhibition as direct inhibition by PLK1 of the PDZ ligand underlying the GRASP65 self-interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2005329318,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a homotrimeric, pleiotropic cytokine, is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-α mediates both apoptosis and inflammation, stimulating an inflammatory cascade through the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, leading to increased nuclear RelB and p52. In contrast, the common food additive carrageenan (CGN) stimulates inflammation through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways of NF-κB activation and utilizes the adaptor molecule BCL10 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10). In a series of experiments, colonic epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with TNF-α and carrageenan in order to simulate the possible effects of exposure to dietary CGN in the setting of a TNF-α-mediated inflammatory disease process. A marked increase in secretion of IL-8 occurred, attributable to synergistic effects on phosphorylated NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in the non-canonical pathway. TNF-α induced the ubiquitination of TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), which interacts with NIK, and CGN induced phosphorylation of BCL10, leading to increased NIK phosphorylation. These results suggest that TNF-α and CGN in combination act to increase NIK phosphorylation, thereby increasing activation of the non-canonical pathway of NF-κB activation. In contrast, the apoptotic effects of TNF-α, including activation of caspase-8 and PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) fragmentation, were markedly reduced in the presence of CGN, and CGN caused reduced expression of Fas.

https://openalex.org/W2014721022,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp41 plays a key role in viral fusion; the N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (N-HR and C-HR) of gp41 form a stable 6-helical conformation for fusion. Therefore, HR-derived peptides, such as enfuvirtide (T-20), inhibit HIV-1 fusion by acting as decoys, and have been used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. However, the efficacy of T-20 is attenuated by resistance mutations in gp41, including V38A and N43D. To suppress the resistant variants, we previously developed electrostatically constrained peptides, SC34 and SC34EK, and showed that both exhibited potent anti-HIV-1 activity against wild-type and T-20-resistant variants. In this study, to clarify the resistance mechanism to this next generation of fusion inhibitors, we selected variants with resistance to SC34 and SC34EK in vitro. The resistant variants had multiple mutations in gp41. All of these mutations individually caused less than 6-fold resistance to SC34 and SC34EK, indicating that there is a significant genetic barrier for high-level resistance. Cross-resistance to SC34 and SC34EK was reduced by a simple difference in the polarity of two intramolecular electrostatic pairs. Furthermore, the selected mutations enhanced the physicochemical interactions with N-HR variants and restored activities of the parental peptide, C34, even to resistant variants. These results demonstrate that our approach of designing gp41-binding inhibitors using electrostatic constraints and information derived from resistance studies produces inhibitors with enhanced activity, high genetic barrier, and distinct resistance profile from T-20 and other inhibitors. Hence, this is a promising approach for the design of future generation peptide fusion inhibitors."

These channels were the first characterized effectors of the βγ subunits of G proteins. Because we currently lack structures of complexes between G proteins and Kir3 channels, their interactions leading to modulation of channel function are not well understood. The recent crystal structure of a chimera between the cytosolic domain of a mammalian Kir3.1 and the transmembrane region of a prokaryotic KirBac1.3 (Kir3.1 chimera) has provided invaluable structural insight. However, it was not known whether this chimera could form functional K+ channels. Here, we achieved the functional reconstitution of purified Kir3.1 chimera in planar lipid bilayers. The chimera behaved like a bona fide Kir channel displaying an absolute requirement for PIP2 and Mg2+-dependent inward rectification. The channel could also be blocked by external tertiapin Q. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the chimera by single particle electron microscopy revealed a structure consistent with the crystal structure. Channel activity could be stimulated by ethanol and activated G proteins. Remarkably, the presence of both activated Gα and Gβγ subunits was required for gating of the channel.

Like all Kir family members, Kir3 channels depend on phosphoinositides to maintain their activity (1Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Kir3 channels are unique among other Kir members in that their activity is stimulated by the βγ subunits of G proteins (Gβγ) (4Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E.

Indeed, a wide variety of G protein-coupled receptors activate Kir3 channels, including the M2-muscarinic, opioid, 5-HT serotonin, A1-adenosine, α2-adrenergic, D2-dopamine, and GABAB receptors (6Yamada M. Innabe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar). Kir3 channels play an important role in human physiology as they can control heart rate and neuronal excitability (7Hibino H. Inanobe A. Furutani K. Murakami S. Findlay I. Kurachi Y. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 291-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar).

A recent crystallographic structure of Kir2.2 (13Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) confirmed a similar architecture for the transmembrane portion of a mammalian Kir channel compared with bacterial channels, such as the KcsA, KirBac1.1, and KirBac3.1 (14Doyle D.A.

High resolution structures of a chimera (hereafter referred to as the Kir3.1 chimera) between the cytosolic region of Kir3.1 and the transmembrane region of a prokaryotic Kir channel (KirBac1.3) have indeed captured one of the putative cytosolic gates (the G-loop gate) in two states, seemingly “open” and “closed” (17Nishida M.

Channels. 2007; 1: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or the Kir3.1 chimera with the Gβγ subunits have not yet been elucidated, presumably because of their low stability. Kir3.1 channels do not form functional homomers and they localize poorly to the cell surface (e.g. Ref. 21Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11890-11897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Yet, they potentiate the activity of other Kir3 channels upon assembly into heteromeric complexes (e.g. Refs.12Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirović B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 22Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Fosset M. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc.

Specific point mutations in a pore helix position of Kir3.1 (F137S or Kir3.1*) and Kir3.4 (S143T) have yielded potentiated homomeric currents with qualitatively similar properties to the wild-type heteromeric Kir3.1/3.4 currents (23Chan K.W.

Kir3 channels are highly expressed in heart (Kir3.1, Kir3.4) and brain (Kir3.1, Kir3.2, Kir3.3). Phosphoinositides regulate the activity of many different ion channels and transporters (e.g. 25–26). Phosphoinositide dependence of Kir channels has been studied extensively (25Logothetis D.E. Petrou V.I. Adney S.K. Mahajan R. Pflugers Arch. 2010; 460: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Logothetis D.E. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. 2007; 455: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Logothetis D.E. Jin T. Lupyan D. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Pflügers Arch. 2007; 455: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A model emerging from such studies proposes that opening of the cytosolic gates occurs as the cytosolic domains of Kir channels get tethered to the plasma membrane by virtue of electrostatic interactions between the acidic phosphoinositides and basic binding pockets on the channel surface near the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (26Logothetis D.E. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. 2007; 455: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Stansfeld P.J. Hopkinson R. Ashcroft F.M. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10926-10933Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). High affinity of channel-PIP2 interactions correlates strongly with high channel activity (29Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that channel-PIP2 interactions affect the cytosolic G-loop gate (19Pegan S. Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and that mutations that cause disease alter channel-PIP2 interactions (25Logothetis D.E. Petrou V.I. Adney S.K. Mahajan R. Pflugers Arch. 2010; 460: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore ethanol has been shown to activate Kir3 channels (6Yamada M. Innabe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-760PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hibino H. Inanobe A. Furutani K. Murakami S. Findlay I. Kurachi Y. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 291-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The structure of the Kir3.1 chimera (17Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) is the first high resolution Kir3 structure that contains both cytosolic and transmembrane channel domains. The chimera contains the Kir3.1 residues Lys41–Trp82 (N terminus) and Phe181–Leu371 (bottom of M2 and C terminus) and the KirBac1.3 residues Phe45–Ala127 (transmembrane domains and extracellular loops). Thus, the chimera is missing the transmembrane domains (Asn83–Met180) and the last 129 C-terminal residues (Ile372–Thr501) of Kir3.1. The lack of functional expression or reconstitution of activity of this chimeric channel casted doubt as to its usefulness in being utilized as a model for Kir3 structure and function studies. Here, we aimed to functionally reconstitute the purified Kir3.1 chimera in planar lipid bilayers and to test its sensitivity to molecules that modulate Kir3 activity, such as phosphoinositides, ethanol and G proteins. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the Kir3.1 chimera by single particle electron microscopy was consistent with the crystal structure. Purified Kir3.1 chimera displayed activity only in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Ethanol stimulated the activity of the Kir3.1 chimera, consistent with its effect on wild-type Kir3 currents. Interestingly, the activity of the Kir3.1 chimera was inhibited rather than stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of Gβγ or Gα-GDP or Gα-GTPγS. Yet, activity of the Kir3.1 chimera was stimulated in the presence of both activated G-protein subunits (i.e. Gα-GTPγS and Gβγ). Such stimulation recovered approximately half of the PIP2-induced activity that had been inhibited by the individual G protein subunits or the heterotrimeric complex. These results pave the way for future electrophysiology and structural studies of the Kir3.1 chimera in complex with the G protein subunits aimed at understanding the molecular basis of Kir3 channel regulation. The expression and purification of the Kir3.1 chimera was carried out following a previously described protocol (17Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1) Following incubation with thrombin to remove the His tag the sample was run over a high-affinity cobalt resin (Clontech) for the second time to eliminate uncleaved material and impurities. 2) Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer (8 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 120 mm KCl, 3 mm DTT, and 5 mm DDM) containing the detergent dodecyl maltoside (DDM). The identity of the Kir3.1 chimera was confirmed by in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry. The yield was ∼0.5 mg of pure Kir3.1 chimera per liter of Escherichia coli culture. The Kir3.1 chimera that eluted in peak B (supplemental Fig. S1A) was diluted (1/20) in gel filtration buffer. A 2-μl aliquot of the dilution was adsorbed onto glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The specimen was imaged in a Jeol 2100F FEG transmission electron microscope at 200 kV under low dose conditions, using a 2k × 2k pixel CCD camera at the equivalent calibrated magnification of 63,450. To avoid biases generated during manual particle selection, we employed a strategy that involves: automated particle selection (30Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar), followed by statistical analysis, alignment and classification (31Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de, la, Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An initial dataset of 51,000 particles was automatically selected from 130 CCD images using EMAN (30Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The software Xmipp (31Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de, la, Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) was employed to extract particles in 64 × 64 images, to normalize them and to perform statistical analysis. Following normalization ∼5% of the initial images were discarded using purely statistical criteria based on the standard deviation of the dataset. The contrast transfer function of the images was estimated using CTFFIND3 (33Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and corrected using Bsoft (34Heymann J.B. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the particles were grouped into 24 different defocus groups to perform classification and heterogeneity analysis. Alignment of images, two-dimensional and three-dimensional maximum likelihood classification, and reconstruction were performed using Xmipp. To obtain representative families of the heterogeneity present in the specimen, we carried out five successive rounds of MLF2D (multireference two-dimensional alignment using maximum-likelihood in Fourier space), a maximum likelihood algorithm included in the Xmipp package (31Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de, la, Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). During this process, particle images with an irregular background, close neighbors, overlapping particles and aggregates were discarded to yield a homogeneous dataset of 19,300 particles. Heterogeneity analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction was carried out using MLF3D (35Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Gómez-Llorente Y. San Martín C. Eggermont P.P. Carazo J.M. Structure. 2007; 15: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To this end, an initial volume was generated by the common lines method using EMAN and without imposing any symmetry. This volume was then filtered to a resolution of 80 Å, and its gray scale corrected according to the protocol recommended by the developers of MLF3D. From this model, 3 initial seeds were generated (using different subsets from the 19,300 particle dataset) to serve as initial volumes for MLF3D. Following 25 iterations, in which no symmetry was imposed, the two most populated volumes (containing 52 and 34% of the particles) were used to generate 4 new initial seeds for a new round of MLF3D. The resulting four volumes were very similar and their back-projections were comparable to reference-free average classes solved by MLF2D. The first volume, containing 35% of the particle images (6,900 out of 19,300) and an estimated resolution of 24 Å, was selected to calculate the final reconstruction by imposing 4-fold symmetry around the z axis. The 0.5 criterion of the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) was employed to estimate the resolution of the final map. Bilayer experiments were performed as described (36Leal-Pinto E. London R.D. Knorr B.A. Abramson R.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 37Leal-Pinto E. Tao W. Rappaport J. Richardson M. Knorr B.A. Abramson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified Kir3.1 chimera was used to form proteoliposomes (PLs) by sonicating the purified protein with a 1:1 mixture of bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine (PE: 10 mg/ml) and phosphatidylserine (PS: 10 mg/ml). The experimental apparatus consisted of two 1-ml buffer chambers separated by a Teflon film that contained a single 50–100-μm hole. A lipid bilayer was formed by “painting” the hole with a 1:1 mixture of PE and PS dissolved in n-decane to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. This resulted in formation of a high-resistance seal between the two cups. For these studies, the Cis side was defined as the chamber connected to the voltage-holding electrode, and all voltages are referenced to the Trans (ground) chamber. Stability of the bilayer was determined by clamping the voltage at various levels. If a resistance was >100 GΩ, the noise <0.2 pA, and the bilayer was stable 5 μl aliquots of PLs containing the Kir3.1 chimera were added to the Trans side of the chamber and stirred for 5 min. When channel activity was observed, PLs were washed from the Trans chamber to limit further channel incorporation. The orientation of the Kir3.1 chimera insertion was with the intracellular surface facing the Cis side of the bilayer. We attribute our high success of channel insertion at the appropriate orientation to the asymmetry of the lipids used (38Rostovtseva T.K. Kazemi N. Weinrich M. Bezrukov S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37496-37506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Records were filtered at 10 kHz, unless otherwise indicated. Channel events with an open time greater than 2.0 ms and a noise level at the open state less than two times the background noise were further filtered at 1 kHz for further analysis (see below). All experiments were performed with either symmetrical buffered solutions or with ionic gradients to examine channel selectivity. Exact composition of solutions used in each experiment is described below. For all of the experiments (Kir3.1 chimera or oocytes membranes) the solutions were similar containing in mm: 150 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1% Chaps, 10 Tris-Hepes, pH 7.4. The solutions were symmetrical in both sides of the chamber unless otherwise indicated. The bilayer channel events were analyzed using the Clampfit module (version 9.2.1.9) of pClamp (Axon Inc.). The software determines the valid channel transitions (i.e. openings and closings), based on 50% threshold crossing methods. If multiple channel events are observed in a single patch/recording, the total number of functional channels (N) in the patch can be estimated from the number of peaks in the all point amplitude histogram. In such cases, the product of number of channels (N) and the open probability (Po) can be used to measure the channel activity in the patch. In the records shown in Fig. 5, C–F, NPo was obtained in 10 s sequential intervals throughout the experiment. For each condition, the reagent indicated was added to either the Cis or Trans side of the bilayer as indicated and the resulting NPo was normalized to the corresponding NPo for PIP2. Percent NPo data were pooled together in the summary graphs shown in 5D, F, which plot mean ± S.E. values. Statistical significance shown for these plots was obtained using one-way ANOVA analysis in MicroCal Origin 7.5. The Kir3.1 chimera was expressed in E. coli and purified (supplemental Fig. S1) in DDM, following a protocol described by Nishida et al. (17Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To ensure that the purified protein to be employed in our electrophysiology experiments retained its tetrameric assembly and structural integrity, we performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of the chimera using single particle electron crystallography. Fig. 1A displays a representative field view showing abundant globular particles with a diameter of ∼100 Å (see “Experimental Procedures”). The remaining subset of particle images (19,300 particles, ∼38% of the initial dataset) displayed a very high correlation in terms of size and background. The reference-free class averages generated for this subset appeared as different projections from the same object (Fig. 1B), and displayed an enrichment of lateral orientations (supplemental Fig. S2A). This subset of 19,300 particle images was employed for three-dimensional reconstruction and refinement, coupled with heterogeneity analysis (35Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Gómez-Llorente Y. San Martín C. Eggermont P.P. Carazo J.M. Structure. 2007; 15: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C illustrates the reconstructed volume after applying a 4-fold symmetry parallel to the z axis. Back-projections of the three-dimensional reconstruction correspond closely with reference-free class averages (supplemental Fig. S2B), indicating consistency between the reconstructed structure and the particle dataset. The final structure (Fig. 1C) was determined to a resolution of 24 Å based on the 0.5 criterion of the FSC (supplemental Fig. S2C). Fig. 1D displays a cut-away view to show the fitting of the crystal structure of the Kir3.1 chimera tetramer (PDB code: 2QKS) solved by Nishida et al. (17Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Overall, our EM map was consistent with the x-ray structure of the tetrameric chimera, indicating that the protein employed in our experiments was indeed tetrameric. Notably, the cytoplasmic region of the x-ray structure fitted very well (manual fitting using CHIMERA (39Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar)) within the envelope of our reconstruction. In the transmembrane region a semispherical additional mass could be observed likely corresponding to DDM molecules arranged concentrically around the transmembrane helices of the chimera. We note that comparable features due to bound detergent have been observed in single particle EM structures of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins both under negative stain (40Rubinstein J.L. Methods. 2007; 41: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in vitreous ice (41Muench S.P. Huss M. Song C.F. Phillips C. Wieczorek H. Trinick J. Harrison M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nishida et al. (17Nishida M. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) concluded their structural study of the Kir3.1 chimera unable to obtain functional reconstitution of this protein. They had attempted functional reconstitution in planar lipid membranes consisting of POPE:POPG lipids in a 3:1 ratio and speculated several potential reasons for the lack of function. 1) There could have been an unmet lipid requirement. 2) The chimera could have been non-functional as a homomultimer, because Kir3.1 is normally functional as a heteromultimer with other members of the Kir3 family. 3) The chimera might have lacked the proper coupling between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane pores; and 4) the prokaryotic transmembrane domain of the chimera could have been problematic for functional reconstitution into the bilayer system, as single channel activity had not been demonstrated for any of the prokaryotic Kir channels. Because Kir3.1 is found as a complex with Kir3.4 in atrial cells giving rise to KAch, we first set out to test whether the Kir3.1 chimera could be functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or HEK-293 cells, either by itself or in complex with Kir3.4 subunits. Injection into Xenopus oocytes of the Kir3.1 chimera mRNA alone (supplemental Fig. S3, B and F) or together with Kir3.4 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S2, D and F) yielded no significantly increased currents compared with the muscarinic type 2 receptor (M2R control) injected alone (supplemental Fig. S3, A and F) or together with twice the amount of Kir3.4 (Kir3.4 control) (supplemental Fig. S3, C and F). In contrast, co-injection of wild-type Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 mRNAs resulted in significantly higher currents than any of the homomeric subunit injections alone, consistent with previous results (supplemental Fig. S3, E and F) (12Krapivinsky G.

Tagging of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the Kir3.1 chimera with EGFP (Kir3.1 Chim-GFP) and transfecting HEK-293 cells, revealed lack of cell surface expression (supplemental Fig. S4A), similar to that previously observed with Kir3.1-GFP alone (e.g. 24). Even co-transfection of Kir3.4 failed to alter cell surface expression of the Kir3.1 Chim-GFP (supplemental Fig. S4B), in sharp contrast with Kir3.1-GFP shown previously (21Mirshahi T.

These results are consistent with the interpretation that the Kir3.1 chimera neither produces functional homomeric channels nor it localizes to the cell surface. In addition, the chimera failed to show potentiated currents when expressed together with Kir3.4 and to be localized to the cell surface, suggesting a possible failure to associate with Kir3.4. Indeed, the Kir3.1 chimera is missing the 40 amino acid residues of N-terminal end of Kir3.1 that have been shown previously to be critical for heteromeric assembly with Kir3.4 and cell surface localization (21Mirshahi T.

Previously identified as an oncogene, its mutation or overexpression is reported in a variety of human cancers. To address its role in skin carcinogenesis, Tpl2−/− or wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a two-stage dimethylbenzanthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) mouse skin carcinogenesis model. Tpl2−/− mice developed a significantly higher incidence of tumors (80%) than WT mice (17%), as well as a reduced tumor latency and a significantly higher number of total tumors (113 vs 6). Moreover, Tpl2−/− mice treated with TPA experienced significantly higher nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) activation, edema, infiltrating neutrophils and production of proinflammatory cytokines than did WT mice. We investigated the role of the p38, JNK, MEK and NF-κB signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo in WT and Tpl2−/− mice by using inhibitors for each of these pathways. We confirmed that the proinflammatory effect in Tpl2−/− mice was due to heightened activity of the NF-κB pathway. These studies indicate that Tpl2 may serve more as a tumor suppressor than as an oncogene in chemically induced skin carcinogenesis, with its absence contributing to both tumorigenesis and inflammation."

In addition, WNK1 was shown to have WNK4-independent effects on ion channels: it stimulates clathrin-dependent endocytosis of ROMK1 by interaction with the scaffold protein intersectin 1 and this does not require WNK1 kinase activity (23Cope G.

Moreover, WNK1 activates the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase (SGK1), which phosphorylates the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Nedd4-2 so that less epithelial sodium channel is endocytosed from the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells (25Xu B.E.

Here we describe a role for WNK1 in regulating glucose transporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1 gene) in HEK293 cells. The constitutive expression of this transmembrane protein at the cell surface ensures glucose uptake in most tissues. We found that WNK1 through interaction with TBC1D4, a Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in regulated exocytosis of glucose transporters, promotes GLUT1 surface expression.DISCUSSIONThe main conclusion from the present work is that protein kinase WNK1 forms a complex with the Rab-GAP TBC1D4 that is involved in regulating the amount of glucose transporter GLUT1 expressed at the cell surface.The complex formation between TBC1D4 and WNK1 was initially identified using an unbiased proteomic approach but then confirmed by immunoprecipitation using various antibodies. In particular, anti-Myc antibodies detected co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged Myc-TBC1D4 together with GFP-WNK1 (Fig. 2) as well as with endogenous WNK1 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, GFP-tagged WNK1 was pulled down when antibodies against endogenous TBC1D4 were used (Fig. 4) and the co-immunoprecipitation of both the endogenous proteins could also be demonstrated in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1C). Together, these experiments provide solid support for the specificity of the observed interaction between WNK1 and TBC1D4.TBC1D4 was previously identified to regulate GLUT4 trafficking to the cell surface following insulin stimulation of 3T3L1 adipocytes or skeletal muscle cells. This pathway involves phosphorylation of TBC1D4 by protein kinase AKT and have led to its alternative designation as AKT substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) (32Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Trends Biochem.

There is considerable evidence that in the absence of insulin the GAP domain of TBC1D4 keeps a critical Rab protein in its inactive GDP-bound state to prevent GLUT4 vesicle release (46Stöckli J.

Barry J.B. Nisbet J.C. Prins J.B. Whitehead J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 302: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results show that protein kinase WNK1 is involved in the regulation of GLUT1, which secures glucose transport in noninsulin target cells. WNK1 forms a complex with TBC1D4 and phosphorylation by WNK1 leads to increased interaction of TBC1D4 with 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a previous proteomic analysis in HEK293 cells used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that associate with FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 proteins and identified both TBC1D4 and WNK1 among a list of 170 unique proteins (34Jin J.

Consistent with this observation, we detected the phosphorylation of TBC1D4 by WNK1 in vitro (Fig. 3). For these experiments WNK1 was precipitated under stringent conditions including SDS-containing RIPA lysis buffer and 300 mm NaCl containing washing steps. Because no phosphorylation was obtained when a kinase-dead WNK1 mutant was prepared under these conditions, our data provide strong evidence that TBC1D4 is a specific WNK1 substrate. The observed phosphorylation activity was comparable with that of the described physiological model substrate OSR1 (31Zagórska A. Pozo-Guisado E. Boudeau J. Vitari A.C. Rafiqi F.H. Thastrup J.

Chen S. Harthill J.E. Ibrahim A.F. Toth R. Morrice N.A. Vandermoere F. Moorhead G.B. Hardie D.G. MacKintosh C. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 44Sano H.

Further in vitro studies have revealed that at least four kinases (AKT, SGK1, RSK1, and AMPK) can phosphorylate TBC1D4 in distinct stimulus-dependent patterns (36Geraghty K.M. Chen S. Harthill J.E. Ibrahim A.F. Toth R. Morrice N.A. Vandermoere F. Moorhead G.B. Hardie D.G. MacKintosh C. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), however, the functional difference between the individual phosphorylation sites is unclear and requires more detailed studies.The WNK1-mediated phosphorylation of TBC1D4 resulted in increased amounts of GLUT1 at the surface of HEK293 cells. Under these experimental conditions we also observed a slight increase in cell number (data not shown), indicative of stimulated metabolic activity and cell growth. In contrast, expression of kinase-dead WNK1 mutants inhibited the level of surface GLUT1 compared with control cells. Moreover, the suppression of endogenous WNK1 by small interfering RNA oligonucleotides also decreased surface amounts of GLUT1. These effects were demonstrated by biotinylation of cell surface proteins (Fig. 5A) and by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5B). Under these experimental conditions no changes in the surface levels of the endogenous transferrin receptor 1 were observed (Fig. 5A), demonstrating the specificity of WNK1/TBC1D4 activity on GLUT1 surface expression.The WNK1 substrate TBC1D4 has been found to exhibit selective GAP activity toward Rab2A, -8A, -8B, -10, and -14 in vitro. In adipocytes, specific depletion of Rab10 was identified to reduce GLUT4 translocation (40Mîinea C.P. Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Fukuda M. Peränen J. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 48Sano H. Eguez L. Teruel M.N. Fukuda M. Chuang T.D. Chavez J.A. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E. Cell.

J. 2008; 411: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas in L6 muscle cell lines Rab8A and Rab14 appeared to be more important for regulating GLUT4 (41Ishikura S. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 353: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 50Ishikura S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 295: C1016-C1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the cell type, TBC1D4 may control distinct Rab GTPases.In HEK293 cells we provide evidence that Rab8A is involved in the WNK1-regulated GLUT1 traffic. Rab8 is known to participate in exocytic events (42Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar, 43Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar) and exists in two isoforms: Rab8A and Rab8B. Our studies show that Rab8A is the predominantly expressed form in the HEK293 cell and that endogenous Rab8A associates with TBC1D4 in a complex, the amount of which depends on the catalytic activity of WNK1 (Fig. 6A). When HEK293 cells were transfected with Rab8A-specific siRNAs, the WNK1-induced surface expression of GLUT1 was significantly reduced (Fig. 6B). Similarly, depletion of Rab8A specifically prevented the increase in GLUT1 surface expression observed following depletion of TBC1D4 by siRNA treatment. Under the same experimental conditions the surface levels of TfR1 did not change (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate the requirement of Rab8A for GLUT1 regulation in HEK293 cells and that it operates downstream of WNK1 and TBC1D4.These data are in agreement with the current view in the literature that TBC1D4 maintains an intracellular storage compartment for glucose transporter proteins under basal conditions (51Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 52Dugani C.B. Klip A.

This compartment can be mobilized upon phosphorylation of TBC1D4, by promoting its binding to 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent inactivation of its Rab-GAP activity. This permits the forward trafficking of the transporters to the apical membrane. Based on this view, the pathway involving WNK1 in the control of GLUT1 levels at the surface of HEK293 cells is schematically depicted in Fig. 7 (see figure legend for details).Taken together, our data describe a pathway regulating surface expression of GLUT1 that is of considerable biomedical interest. First, malignant cells have accelerated metabolism and satisfy their increased requirements for ATP production by aerobic glycolysis (54Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar). Especially during the initiation of tumor formation, cells experience suboptimal supply of oxygen and nutrients due to diffusion limits. One mechanism that tumor cells use to adapt to these conditions is GLUT1 overexpression (55Macheda M.L. Rogers S. Best J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 202: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) and our data suggest that changes in expression or regulation of WNK1 may be an alternative route for adaptation. The WNK catalytic domain represents a unique target site for the development of small molecule kinase inhibitors, because it is characterized by a typical sequence variation in which a lysine from subdomain I substitutes for a usually highly conserved catalytic lysine in subdomain II (hence their name with no [K] = lysine) (5Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 6Min X. Lee B.H. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 1303-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Second, the described pathway may be an interesting drug target in certain diseases linked to epilepsy and mental retardation that are characterized by insufficient GLUT1 activity (56Klepper J. Leiendecker B. Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 2007; 49: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 57Brockmann K. Brain Dev. 2009; 31: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Finally, hypertensive glomerular injury has been linked to pathological overexpression of GLUT1 in renal cells (58Gnudi L. Viberti G. Raij L. Rodriguez V. Burt D. Cortes P. Hartley B. Thomas S. Maestrini S. Gruden G. Hypertension. 2003; 42: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is intriguing because some patients with familial hypertension (Gordon syndrome) carry germline WNK1 mutations that lead to WNK1 overexpression. Our data clearly suggest that increased expression of WNK1 promotes GLUT1 surface expression in a kidney-derived cell line. The clinical features of the WNK1 mutant families have been suggested to reflect a form of hypertension that is not exclusively salt dependent, as opposed to families with mutant WNK4 (59Xie J. Craig L. Cobb M.H. Huang C.L. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2006; 21: 1231-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 60Hadchouel J. Delaloy C. Fauré S. Achard J.M. Jeunemaitre X. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, WNK1 may in part affect renal salt balance by glucose overload causing glomerular insufficiency.In the future it will be important to elucidate upstream mechanisms involved in the WNK1-mediated activation of GLUT1 trafficking. Previous studies reported that hypertonic stress, including glucose can increase WNK1 activity. Treatment of distal collecting duct cells with 0.5 m glucose, for example, promoted a significant increase in WNK1 activity (61Lenertz L.Y. Lee B.H. Min X. Xu B.E. Wedin K. Earnest S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26653-26658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Very recent evidence also revealed that TBC1D4 regulates other transporter proteins. Following aldosterone stimulation of cortical collecting duct cells, TBC1D4 regulated trafficking of the epithelial sodium channel epithelial sodium channel to the apical membrane leading to increased sodium absorption (62Liang X. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Frizzell R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to our results, this involved phosphorylation of TBC1D4 and increased association with 14-3-3 proteins but was mediated by another kinase, SGK1. Intriguingly, WNK1 has been proposed to serve as a scaffold required for efficient SGK1 activation and there is evidence that SGK1 may in turn phosphorylate WNK1 on threonine 60 (12Xu B.E. Stippec S. Lazrak A. Huang C.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34218-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate TBC1D4 as a central player in the surface expression levels of GLUT4, GLUT1, and epithelial sodium channel and it will be interesting to determine whether phosphorylation by WNK1, SGK1, or AKT represent cell type-specific pathways or a common regulatory kinase cascade.

The WNK1 protein contains 2382 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 251 kDa and has its catalytic domain near the N terminus, including the unique sequence variation around catalytically important lysine residues that characterize the WNK subfamily (5Xu B.

WNK1 contains coiled-coil domains but the bulk sequence reveals no homology to other known protein domains.Currently, the knowledge on WNK1-regulated cellular pathways is still limited (7Moniz S. Jordan P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the one hand, WNK1 can affect multiple signaling pathways related to cell proliferation, including the epidermal growth factor-dependent stimulation of ERK5 (8Xu B.E. Stippec S. Lenertz L.

Additionally, insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells or adipocytes stimulates protein kinase AKT to phosphorylate WNK1 at threonine residue 60, however, the physiological relevance of this event is unclear because phosphorylation did not affect WNK1 kinase activity, or its subcellular localization (10Vitari A.C.

Dipeptide transport by AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 was found to be electrogenic and dependent on protons but not sodium. In the absence of dipeptides, both transporters showed proton-dependent leak currents that were inhibited by Phe-Ala (AtPTR5) and Phe-Ala, Trp-Ala, and Phe-Phe (AtPTR1). Phe-Ala was shown to reduce leak currents by binding to the substrate-binding site with a high apparent affinity. Inhibition of leak currents was only observed when the aromatic amino acids were present at the N-terminal position. AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 transport activity was voltage-dependent, and currents increased supralinearly with more negative membrane potentials and did not saturate. The voltage dependence of the apparent affinities differed between Ala-Ala, Ala-Lys, and Ala-Asp and was not conserved between the two transporters. The apparent affinity of AtPTR1 for these dipeptides was pH-dependent and decreased with decreasing proton concentration. In contrast to most proton-coupled transporters characterized so far, −Imax increased at high pH, indicating that regulation of the transporter by pH overrides the importance of protons as co-substrate.

For most plant PTR/NRT1 proteins, the substrate selectivity has not been determined yet, but it is clear that some transport substrates other than peptides. For example, various Arabidopsis PTR/NRT1 members mediate low affinity uptake or export of nitrate (3Tsay Y.F. Chiu C.C. Tsai C.B. Ho C.H. Hsu P.K.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1022-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).In other kingdoms, only a few members of the PTR/NRT1 family are present, which primarily mediate proton-coupled transport of di- and tripeptides, as well as structurally related compounds (15Biegel A. Knütter I. Hartrodt B. Gebauer S. Theis S. Luckner P. Kottra G. Rastetter M. Zebisch K. Thondorf I. Daniel H. Neubert K. Brandsch M. Amino Acids. 2006; 31: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In mammals, four peptide transporters (PepT1, PepT2, PHT1, and PHT2) show 21–28% amino acid identity to AtPTR1, AtPTR2, and AtPTR5, whereas sequence identity among these three plant transporters is 59–74% (supplemental Table 1). Two of the four mammalian peptide transporters mediate transport of free histidine, in addition to di- and tripeptides (16Daniel H. Kottra G. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The transporters from rat and human have been investigated in detail; one of the mammalian transporters mediates uptake of peptides in the small intestine functioning as a main pathway for the absorption of dietary nitrogen (17Daniel H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Moreover, mammalian PEPT1 and PEPT2 also transport modified peptides, including β-lactam antibiotics, enzyme inhibitors, and other peptide-like drugs (15Biegel A. Knütter I. Hartrodt B. Gebauer S.

That work also revealed important features of compounds to be recognized as substrates by PEPT1 and/or PEPT2 (15Biegel A. Knütter I. Hartrodt B. Gebauer S. Theis S. Luckner P. Kottra G. Rastetter M.

The substrate selectivity of plant peptide transporters has been investigated only for Arabidopsis AtPTR1 and AtPTR2, which, like the mammalian transporters, recognize a large number of di- and tripeptides with moderate to high apparent affinity (18Chiang C.S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Affinity of AtPTR2 is dependent on both the N- and C-terminal amino acids and is largely independent of the membrane potential (18Chiang C.S. Stacey G. Tsay Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30150-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Chiang et al. (18Chiang C.S. Stacey G. Tsay Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30150-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also established that AtPTR2 transports peptides and protons simultaneously by a random binding mechanism.Transporters for di/tripeptides have important functions in plants. Experiments using antisense repression of AtPTR2 showed the importance of peptide transport for flowering and seed development (21Song W. Koh S. Czako M. Marton L. Drenkard E. Becker J.M. Stacey G. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, work with knock-out mutants (atptr1 and atptr5) and overexpression lines (35S-AtPTR5) demonstrated that AtPTR5 facilitates peptide transport into germinating pollen and possibly into maturating pollen, ovules, and seeds and provided evidence that peptide transporters facilitate uptake of nitrogen from the rhizosphere (7Komarova N.Y.

These physiological functions indicated a role in transport of protein degradation products, which is consistent with the low selectivity of these transporters for different di- and tripeptides.Detailed knowledge of transport characteristics and kinetics is essential to understand the physiological role in planta. Here, we report the comprehensive characterization of the biochemical properties of AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamping (TEVC). The results show functional similarities and differences between these two peptide transporters as well as profound differences compared with the properties of AtPTR2.RESULTSDipeptide-induced currents were analyzed in X. laevis oocytes injected with AtPTR1 or AtPTR5 cRNA using TEVC. At pH 7.5 and pH 5.5, the addition of 1 mm Ala-Lys to AtPTR5- or AtPTR1-expressing oocytes induced inward currents (Fig. 1, B and C). Current amplitude was dependent on the batch of oocytes and time after RNA injection. No dipeptide-induced currents were detected in water-injected oocytes (Fig. 1A). The addition of 1 mm Ala-Ala also induced inward currents (data not shown). As Ala-Ala is present in its zwitterionic form at pH 5.5, the induced inward current indicates a co-transport of cations. Ala-Ala transport was confirmed using radio-tracer flux experiments in AtPTR1- and AtPTR5-expressing oocytes, which accumulated [3H]Ala-Ala (Fig. 2). Furthermore, under TEVC inward (leak) currents were observed when the pH was shifted from pH 7.5 to pH 5.5 in AtPTR5- and AtPTR1-injected oocytes in the absence of substrate (Fig. 1, B and C). These results are consistent with a co-transport of protons and peptides as described for AtPTR2 and the mammalian peptide transporters (16Daniel H. Kottra G.

Ala-Ala, Ala-Lys, and Ala-Asp were chosen as representatives for neutral, cationic, and anionic dipeptides. At a membrane potential of −140 mV and pH 5.5, the apparent affinity of AtPTR5 was determined as K0.5Ala-Ala 23 ± 4 μm, K0.5Ala-Lys 167 ± 12 μm, and K0.5Ala-Asp 129 ± 4 μm, respectively (Table 1), the latter two affinities were thus comparable with the apparent affinity of AtPTR5 for Ala-Lys (K0.5Ala-Lys 163 μm) and Ala-Asp (K0.5Ala-Asp 131 μm) determined previously (n = 4 oocytes (7Komarova N.Y.

At pH 5.5, K0.5 of AtPTR1 for Ala-Lys decreased with more negative membrane potentials, whereas the apparent affinity for Ala-Ala was not affected by the membrane potential, and K0.5Ala-Asp was lower at less negative membrane potentials (Fig. 3A). In contrast, K0.5 of AtPTR5 was constant for Ala-Ala and Ala-Lys and increased with more negative membrane potential for Ala-Asp (Fig. 3C). On the other hand −Imax increased at more negative membrane potentials for all three dipeptides in both AtPTR- and AtPTR5-injected oocytes (Fig. 3, B and D).TABLE 1Apparent affinities of AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 for different dipeptides at pH 5.5, measured at Vm −140 mV and Vm −60 mVK0.5 (μm) at Vm = −140 mVK0.5 (μm) at Vm = −60 mVAla-AlaAla-LysAla-AspAla-AlaAla-LysAla-AspAtPTR157 ± 2142 ± 12409 ± 1758 ± 3247 ± 38632 ± 112AtPTR523 ± 4167 ± 12129 ± 419 ± 3134 ± 971 ± 6 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Voltage dependence of K0.5 and −Imax in AtPTR1- and AtPTR5-injected oocytes at pH 5. 5.

Measurements for AtPTR1 revealed that at a membrane potential of −140 mV K0.5 decreased with increasing proton concentration for all three dipeptides (Fig. 4, A–C). Similarly, −Imax for Ala-Ala and Ala-Lys decreased with increasing proton concentration (Fig. 4, D and E). Only −Imax of Ala-Asp was not changed by pH over a broad range and sharply decreased at very low proton concentrations, indicating that the aspartate residue in Ala-Asp might be transported in its protonated form (Fig. 4F). AtPTR5 also showed higher currents at saturating concentrations of Ala-Ala at high pH (pH 7.5) (Fig. 5), demonstrating that higher transport rates at low proton concentrations is a common feature of both transporters and possibly other transporters of this clade. This trend was robust until pH 8.5 was reached, whereas at higher pH values, 10 mm Ala-Ala-induced currents decreased considerably (Fig. 6). This suggests that within the physiological range, the intrinsic pH dependence of the transporter itself overrules the dependence on protons as co-substrate.FIGURE 4Dependence of K0.5 and −Imax of AtPTR1 on pH. K0.5 (A–C) and −Imax (d–F) values of AtPTR1 for Ala-Ala (A and D), Ala-Lys (B and E), and Ala-Asp (C and F) were determined at Vm of −140 mV and increasing proton concentrations.

Substrate-induced currents were normalized on 500 μm Ala-Ala-induced currents at pH 5.5 set at 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Voltage dependence of peptide transport was also influenced by the proton concentration. Maximum transport rates of AtPTR1-mediated dipeptide transport decreased supralinearly with hyperpolarizing voltages at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3B), 6.5, and 7.5 (supplemental Fig. 1). At all membrane potentials, Imax was most negative at high pH for Ala-Ala and Ala-Lys and similar at all pH values for Ala-Asp. Although at pH 5.5 a decrease in apparent affinity at depolarized voltages was only shown for Ala-Lys (Fig. 3A), at pH 7.5 this effect was observed for all three dipeptides (supplemental Fig. 1).To test whether higher −Imax values at high pH were mediated by co-transport of Na+ instead of H+, currents induced by 1 mm Ala-Ala were measured at pH 5.5 and 7.5 in the presence of different concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 5). Increasing the Na+ concentration did not change currents of AtPTR1-injected oocytes at both high and low pH and slightly increased Ala-Al- induced currents for AtPTR5 at pH 7.5, indicating that elevated substrate-induced current at high pH was due to pH regulation of the transporter rather than Na+ replacing H+ as the coupling ion. This was confirmed by experiments showing that at pH 7.5, both AtPTR1- and AtPTR5-expressing oocytes accumulated significantly more [3H]Ala-Ala than at low pH (pH 5.5) (Fig. 2).To further examine the nature of the coupling ion and the functional groups involved in substrate binding or transport, AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 were expressed in S. cerevisiae and Ala-Ala transport rates determined in the presence of various well established inhibitors (Table 2). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a protonophore, reduced uptake rates of [3H]Ala-Ala by AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 to 26 and 20%, respectively, consistent with protons as coupling ions. [3H]Ala-Ala uptake by both transporters was sensitive to the sulfhydryl group-modifying agent N-ethylmaleimide, similar to the effect of this inhibitor on AtPTR2 (20Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B.

Here, we analyzed the ability of AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 to recognize dipeptides with different hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids at the N- or C-terminal position. At a concentration of 1 mm dipeptide, Vm −140 mV, and pH 5.5, the currents induced by various substrates differed considerably (Fig. 7). Whereas Ala-Ile and Ile-Ala induced comparable currents in AtPTR5-injected oocytes, Ile-Ala was transported more efficiently than Ala-Ile by AtPTR1. Ala-containing dipeptides with the aromatic amino acids Trp or Phe induced inward currents only when the hydrophobic residue was at the C-terminal position. Tyr-Ala also induced less current than Ala-Tyr in both AtPTR1- and AtPTR5-injected oocytes. The exception was Phe-Phe, which induced currents comparable with Ala-Ala or Ala-Phe in AtPTR5 but not in AtPTR1-expressing oocytes. Transport of Ala-Phe, Phe-Ala, and Phe-Phe was dependent on pH and was considerably higher at low proton concentrations (Fig. 8).FIGURE 7Substrate selectivity of AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 for dipeptides with hydrophobic or aromatic residues. 1 mm dipeptide-induced currents were determined at Vm −140 mV and pH 5.5 in AtPTR1- (black bars) and AtPTR5 (white bars)-injected oocytes.

Interestingly, the Phe-Ala- and Phe-Phe-induced reduction of the leak current was pH-dependent and could not be observed at pH 7.5 (Fig. 8). The Phe-Ala-mediated reduction in current was concentration-dependent and could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent affinity of the Phe-Ala-induced reduction of the leak current was 9.2 ± 1.8 μm (n = 3 oocytes; Fig. 9A). To test if the reduction is due to occupation of the substrate-binding site, the inhibition constant, Ki (i.e. 50% reduction of Ala-Lys induced current at its K0.5 [100 μm] (19Dietrich D. Hammes U.

Plant J. 2004; 40: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)), was determined by increasing concentrations of Phe-Ala to be 24.2 ± 3.3 μm (Fig. 9B). These results indicate that Phe-Ala is indeed recognized by AtPTR1 with high apparent affinity, even though it does not seem to be transported at pH 5.5. In oocytes expressing AtPTR5, only Phe-Ala reduced the leak current, whereas Trp-Ala induced small inward currents, and Phe-Phe currents were comparable with Ala-Phe-induced currents. This indicates both differences but also common characteristics in substrate recognition of peptide transporters of this clade.FIGURE 9Recognition of Phe-Ala by AtPTR1.

This independently supports the finding that Phe-Ala interacts with the substrate-binding site and not only blocks leak currents.DISCUSSIONPeptide transporters are generally considered to play a role in translocation of peptides generated by protein degradation. Because di- and tripeptides produced by protein hydrolysis vary in size, charge, and hydrophobicity, it is expected that these transporters have a low selectivity regarding the composition of the side chains.

The affinities of AtPTR1 and AtPTR5 were in a similar range for Ala-Ala and Ala-Lys, although the apparent affinity for Ala-Asp was higher than shown for AtPTR2 (i.e. at pH 5.5, Vm −60 mV K0.5Ala-Asp: AtPTR5 71 μm, AtPTR1 632 μm; pH 5.5, Vm −140 K0.5Ala-Asp: AtPTR5 129 μm, AtPTR1 409 μm ((7Komarova N.Y.

Ile-Ala was transported as efficiently as Ala-Ile in AtPTR5 but not in AtPTR1-injected oocytes, indicating slight differences in substrate recognition. Unexpectedly, some of the dipeptides with an aromatic amino acid at the N-terminal position did not induce inward currents but rather reduced the leak current observed at pH 5.5 in a concentration-dependent manner and thereby provided evidence that the leak current originated from the flow of the co-transported ion (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9). Whether the block of the leak current is due to the inhibition of the conformational changes required to facilitate transport into the cell, to masking of the proton-binding site, or whether the (high affinity) binding of Phe-Ala prevents substrate translocation or hinders a coordinated release of both substrates remains elusive. A model illustrating the reduction of the leak current is presented in supplemental Fig. 2.The Phe-Ala-induced reduction of the leak current could be competed for b"

Short term prevention of glycan-calnexin interactions by castanospermine slightly increases ER retention of β1, suggesting minor involvement of calnexin in subunit folding. However, both prolonged incubation with castanospermine and removal of N-glycosylation sites do not affect the α1-assembly or trafficking of β1 but increase the amount of the β1-bound BiP, showing that BiP can compensate for calnexin in assisting β1 folding. In contrast to β1, prevention of either N-glycosylation or glycan-calnexin interactions abolishes the α1-assembly and export of β2 from the ER despite increased β2-BiP binding. Mutations in the α1-interacting regions of β1 and β2 subunits impair α1 assembly but do not affect folding of the β subunits tested by their sensitivity to trypsin. At the same time, these mutations increase the amount of β-bound BiP but not of β-bound calnexin and increase ER retention of both β-isoforms. BiP, therefore, prevents the ER export of folded but α1-unassembled β subunits. These α1-unassembled β subunits are degraded faster than α1-bound β subunits, preventing ER overload.

The mice develop neuromuscular dysfunction by 4–8 weeks of age, and their peripheral nerves show hypomyelination from early postnatal development and subsequent onion bulb formation, which may result from myelin degradation and failed attempts to remyelinate. Interestingly, nerves from the S63C transgenic mouse with varying amounts of endogenous P0wt (S63C(+/+) and S63C(+/−)) show by electron microscopy irregular areas of myelin swelling in a small subset of nerves. The disrupted areas correspond to the intraperiod line (where the extracellular domain is localized); therefore, the amino acid substitution may underlie the evident perturbation of the regular compaction of the membranes (10.Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. Avila R.L. Kirschner D.A. Messing A. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). By comparison, when P0S34C is expressed on a P0 null background (S63C(−/−)), electron microscopy reveals uniform areas of myelin swelling apparently due to widening of the extracellular apposition by 21% (10.Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. Avila R.L. Kirschner D.A. Messing A. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To explore in detail the inferred instability of myelin in S63C transgenic mouse lines, we analyzed myelin structure in whole, unfixed sciatic nerves using x-ray diffraction (XRD). This technique provides a sensitive and quantitative assessment of internodal myelin structure, membrane packing, and interactions in both a native environment or after physical/chemical treatment (14.Kirschner D.A. Blaurock A.E. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 3-78Google Scholar). As the measurements are carried out on a large volume of nerve rather than just thin sections, there is abundant sampling of internodal myelin (15.Avila R.L. Inouye H. Baek R.C. Yin X. Trapp B.D. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Kirschner D.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we found that the myelin period in nerves from S63C(+/−) resembles that of the native state (175 Å), but after ∼7 h a significant amount of myelin swells to 205-Å period arrays (10.Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. Avila R.L. Kirschner D.A. Messing A. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, myelin from S63C(−/−) shows an ∼210-Å period, which is significantly larger than the ∼190-Å period for P0(−/−). These initial results suggest that the myelin packing depends on the amount of P0wt and that above a certain ratio of mutant versus WT protein, the former causes instability or dominates the dimeric adhesion interface because of aberrant interactions. Our objective here was to explore further the varied phenotypes of the P0S34C mutation by using XRD to quantitate the packing defects in freshly dissected nerves and in nerves subjected to electrostatic stress (different pH and ionic strength). We found the following: 1) the instability of P0(+/−) myelin derives from the lower level of P0wt, which provides fewer homophilic contacts at the dimeric adhesion interface; 2) the instability of S63C(+/−) myelin derives from the presence of mutant protein, as the total amount of P0 mRNA is nearly twice the wild type level; 3) the presence of the mutant protein renders the myelin more sensitive to pH changes, because of altered interactions involving His52 and Arg45′ near the dimeric adhesion interface; 4) in the absence of any P0wt, formation of a new disulfide between Cys34 and Cys34′ stabilizes swollen myelin arrays; and 5) swollen myelin containing the mutant protein can be “cured” by subjecting the nerve to a reducing agent. The mice used to analyze myelin structure were bred and maintained on the FVB/N inbred strain at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milano, Italy) and included the following: wild type (WT; P0(+/+)), P0 heterozygous (P0(+/−)), P0null (P0null or P0(−/−)), and S63C on the WT, heterozygous, and null backgrounds (S63C(+/+), S63C(+/−), and S63C(−/−)). The S63C mice have a serine to cysteine substitution at position 34 in the extracellular domain of the processed protein (10.Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. Avila R.L. Kirschner D.A. Messing A. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These mice correspond to the line Tg130.3, Tg(MpzS63C)33Mes. Tg130.3 and heterozygous-null mice were crossed to generate the P0S34C mutation on backgrounds with different expression levels of P0wt, resulting in S63C(+/+) (2.2-fold overexpression of P0wt and P0S34C mRNA), S63C(+/−) (1.7-fold overexpression of total P0 mRNA both P0wt and P0S34C mRNAs), and S63C(−/−) (1.2-fold overexpression of P0S34C mRNA). Sciatic nerves were dissected from wild type and transgenic mice that had been sacrificed by cervical dislocation and decapitation. During dissection, the tissue was continually rinsed with physiological saline (154 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris base, pH 7.4). After being tied off at each end with fine suture, the nerves were pulled into 0.7–0.9-mm capillary tubes (Charles Supper Co., South Natick, MA) containing the appropriate solution, and the tubes were sealed at both ends with wax. For electrostatic stressing (16.Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the sciatic nerves were stretched slightly onto a frame (a notched, plastic pipette tip) and placed into scintillation vials containing 20-ml aliquots of solutions of known ionic strength and pH (see below), gently agitated overnight, and then loaded into quartz capillary tubes as described above. Solutions used were as follows: normal physiological saline, either 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm Trizma® base (tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane) titrated with HCl to pH 7.4, or 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm phosphate buffer, adjusted to each desired pH 6–8; hypotonic alkaline saline, 60 mm NaCl and 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm Trizma® base titrated with NaOH to pH 8, and 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm glycine titrated with NaOH to pH 9; hypotonic acidic saline, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm glycine titrated with HCl to pH 3.1 or 2.1, and 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm glycine buffer titrated with HCl to pH 2.1; alkaline saline, 154 mm NaCl, 5 mm glycine buffer titrated with NaOH to pH 10–10.5. The reducing solution consisted of 10 or 50 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP; catalog no. 20490, Pierce) (17.Han J.C. Han G.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18.Levison M.E. Josephson A.S. Kirschenbaum D.M. Experientia. 1969; 25: 126-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 154 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Trizma® base, titrated with NaOH to pH 7.4. For preliminary screening of myelin structure, we examined nerves fixed by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.12 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, maintained in the same fixative during shipment from the San Raffaele Institute (Milano, Italy) to Boston College, and kept in fixative during x-ray diffraction. These findings, which revealed hypomyelination, specifically a one-third decrease in the relative amount of myelin for S63C(+/+) versus WT (supplemental Fig. 1), encouraged us to proceed with analysis of unfixed myelin from whole nerves, as described here. To better preserve physiological conditions for nerve, we used a perfusion chamber that allowed continuous flow of solution over the nerve during 20 h of intermittent x-ray data collection. A peristaltic pump (Masterflex, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) maintained the flow from a 300-ml reservoir. The experimental details have been described in recent publications (10.Wrabetz L.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, x-ray diffraction patterns from whole sciatic nerves, freshly dissected from the mice or after overnight treatment under defined conditions, were recorded using an electronic detector. The myelin period (d) was directly measured from the positions of the intensity maxima. After background subtraction, the area of the peaks (or integrated intensities) were used to calculate structure amplitudes that were used to calculate the membrane profiles via Fourier synthesis. From the profiles we measured the inter-membrane spaces at the cytoplasmic and extracellular appositions, and the thickness of the lipid bilayer. Such a calculation was undertaken for diffraction data to ∼30 Å spacing (14.Kirschner D.A. Blaurock A.E. Martenson R.E. Myelin: Biology and Chemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 3-78Google Scholar). Whereas for native sciatic nerve myelin, a sufficient number of reflections were present, for swollen myelin this occurred only when the swollen phase was the predominant one and had multiple Bragg orders, e.g. S63C(−/−) and P0(−/−). The relative amount of internodal myelin was expressed as M/(M+B), where M is the total integrated intensity of the myelin reflections after background (B) subtraction, and M+B is the total intensity. A scatterplot of M/(M+B) versus myelin period was used to compare the different genotypes (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). The irregularity (or distortion) in membrane packing (denoted by lattice parameter Δ) was determined by analyzing the peak widths of reflections (15.Avila R.L. Inouye H. Baek R.C. Yin X. Trapp B.D.

The significance of the difference between the means for different parameters was evaluated using the Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Myelin was isolated from sciatic nerves of adult mice, as described previously (Ref. 23.Norton W.T. Poduslo S.E. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar with modifications), separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, A and B) using a pre-cast 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (1.0 mm, 12 wells; Invitrogen), and analyzed by Western blot as described (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. 3) (10.Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. Avila R.L. Kirschner D.A. Messing A. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, the sample buffer, pH 6.8, contained 2% SDS, 63 mm Tris base, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Isolated myelin samples were loaded and run in an XCELL Surelock™ mini-cell (Invitrogen) for 1–2 h at a constant 125 V. For Western blotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto an Immobilon-P PVDF transfer membrane (Bio-Rad) using an XCell II™ blot module (Invitrogen). Proteins were detected using the ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents and analysis system (GE Healthcare). The membrane was incubated for 1 h with either a 1:2000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-P0 primary antibody (kindly provided by Dr. David Colman via Dr. Brian Popko), a 1:2000 dilution of a mouse monoclonal anti-P0 primary antibody (P07, kindly provided by Dr. Juan Archelos), or a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal anti-MBP primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biomedical, Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody at 1:10,000 dilution and ECL™ detection reagents. Molecular mass markers were MagicMark (Invitrogen). Myelin was isolated from mouse sciatic nerves (as described above) with the addition of 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to the reagents, so all the cysteines present as free thiols in myelin would be NEM-alkylated (supplemental Fig. 4). After SDS-PAGE, the bands of interest were excised from the gel, subjected to reduction by 10 mm DTT and alkylation by 55 mm iodoacetamide (IAA), and finally digested with trypsin overnight (Roche Applied Science) (24.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). 1-μl aliquots of the supernatant were used for MS analysis on a MALDI-TOF Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer using the dried droplet technique and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. In parallel, bands already treated with trypsin were further digested with Asp-N enzyme overnight (Roche Applied Science); the supernatants were used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Peak list was obtained by peak de-isotoping. Spectra were accumulated over a mass range of 750–4000 Da with a mean resolution of about 15,000. Spectra were internally calibrated using matrix signals and trypsin autolysis peaks and then processed via Data Explorer software version 4.0.0.0 (Applied Biosystems). Searches were performed with trypsin and Asp-N specificity; cysteine alkylation by IAA, NEM, and oxidation of methionine were considered as variable modifications. Two missed cleavages per peptide were allowed, and an initial mass tolerance of 50 ppm was used in all searches. Peptides with masses corresponding to those of enzymes and matrix were excluded from the peak list. Proteins were identified by searching a comprehensive nonredundant protein data base (NCBInr 20080912 (7031513 sequences; 2427977331 residues) Taxonomy:Rodentia (222606 sequences)) using Mascot (Matrix Science; version 2.1.04) program. Chemical stabilization of myelin by aldehyde fixation results in changes in periodicity and membrane packing (25.Kirschner D.A. Hollingshead C.J. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 73: 211-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); however, such tissue is useful for an initial screening of myelinated nerves that may have altered amounts of internodal myelin (15.Avila R.L. Inouye H. Baek R.C. Yin X. Trapp B.D. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Kirschner D.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Preliminary screening of glutaraldehyde-fixed sciatic nerves from S63C(+/+) mice revealed consistently weaker myelin diffraction patterns compared with WT nerves. Quantitation showed that there was about one-third less internodal myelin in the transgenic nerves but that the myelin periodicities were not significantly different between the genotypes (supplemental Fig. 1). A preliminary XRD study of the unfixed nerves from S63C mice and electron microscopy of embedded tissue substantiated the hypomyelination (10.Wrabetz L. D'Antonio M. Pennuto M. Dati G. Tinelli E. Fratta P. Previtali S. Imperiale D. Zielasek J. Toyka K. Avila R.L. Kirschner D.A. Messing A. Feltri M.L. Quattrini A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and provided the rationale for the current, more systematic study of myelin structural integrity in the S63C genotype series. Diffraction patterns were recorded from the freshly dissected sciatic nerves of mice with genotypes WT, S63C(+/+), S63C(+/−), S63C(−/−), and P0(+/−). Recorded within 30 min of dissection, the initial 10-min patterns of the nerves, which had been sealed into capillaries containing excess physiological saline, revealed obvious differences in the relative intensities of the patterns and in myelin periods (Fig. 1A; Table 1). From strongest to weakest, the patterns ranked as follows: WT > P0(+/−) > S63C(+/+) ≈ S63C(+/−) > S63C(−/−) > P0(−/−) (null not shown; see Ref. 15.Avila R.L. Inouye H. Baek R.C. Yin X. Trapp B.D. Feltri M.L. Wrabetz L. Kirschner D.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Native periods (∼175 Å) were observed for WT and for S63C on the WT and heterozygous backgrounds, and larger periods were recorded for P0(+/−) (∼5 Å greater than native), P0(−/−) (∼10 Å greater), and S63C on the null background (>30 Å greater). Close inspection of the pattern from S63C(+/−) showed elevated intensity between the 2nd and 3rd Bragg reflections (Fig. 1A, asterisk), which corresponded in position to the predominant intensity maximum from the swollen myelin of S63C(−/−) (Fig. 1, peak labeled 3′). To check for stability of the myelin period and membrane packing, we recorded a subsequent pattern from each nerve about 7 h after the initial pattern (Fig. 1B). Four of the nerves gave patterns virtually identical to the originals as follows: the WT (175 Å) and S63C on the WT background, P0(−/−) (187 Å), and S63C on the null background (207 Å). By contrast, P0(+/−) and S63C(+/−) both showed complex patterns indicating new ∼200-Å period swollen arrays coexisting with native arrays. Measurement of the intensities indicated that there were approximately equal amounts of each type of array. Although its predominant structure was native, the myelin with S63C(+/+) showed an increase in background intensity between the 2nd and 3rd Bragg reflections (*, Fig. 1B) indicating a small amount of swollen myelin. Calculation of membrane profiles (data not shown) from the diffraction data revealed that the larger period was accounted for by ∼30 Å swelling at the extracellular apposition in S63C(−/−) and ∼10 Å swelling in P0(−/−) (Table 1).TABLE 1Stability of sciatic nerve myelin in a sealed capillaryTimeaMyelin structure was assessed by XRD immediately after dissection and 7 h later.DimensionsbThe abbreviations used are as follows: d, myelin period, as measured from the diffraction spectra; cyt, cytoplasmic apposition; lpg, separation between lipid polar head group layers; ext, extracellular apposition; all as determined from the membrane density profiles (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).Δ/dcThe irregularity in the packing of myelin membranes was determined from the breadths of the x-ray reflections (15) and expressed as a fraction of the periodicity d.MyelindThe percentage of the total myelin that is in the swollen state, calculated from Pi = Σh (hIi(h)/di2) (50), where I(h) is the integrated intensity of the peak corresponding to the hth Bragg order, and d is periodicity.M/(M+B)eRelative amount of compact myelin M/(M+B) (see “Experimental Procedures”).dcytlpgextÅ%WT 10 min175.03148480.0230.35 7 h174.83149460.0170.35S63C(+/+) 10 min174.33147490.0290.17 7 h173.13246490.029950.15∼219−−−5S63C(+/−) 10 min174.93148490.029920.21∼210−−−8 7 h173.2−−−0.023590.21204.7−−−41S63C(−/−) 10 min210.73349800.0570.13 7 h207.03150760.0480.11P0(+/−) 10 min180.13050500.0280.28 7 h180.23149510.022450.36197.7−−−55P0(−/−) 10 min187.3−−−0.0480.06 7 h187.03346620.0430.04a Myelin structure was assessed by XRD immediately after dissection and 7 h later.b The abbreviations used are as follows: d, myelin period, as measured from the diffraction spectra; cyt, cytoplasmic apposition; lpg, separation between lipid polar head group layers; ext, extracellular apposition; all as determined from the membrane density profiles (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).c The irregularity in the packing of myelin membranes was determined from the breadths of the x-ray reflections (15.Avila R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2085964485,"The transcription factor TFIID components TAF7 and TAF1 regulate eukaryotic transcription initiation. TAF7 regulates transcription initiation of TAF1-dependent genes by binding to the acetyltransferase (AT) domain of TAF1 and inhibiting the enzymatic activity that is essential for transcription. TAF7 is released from the TAF1-TFIID complex upon completion of preinitiation complex assembly, allowing transcription to initiate. However, not all transcription is TAF1-dependent, and the role of TAF7 in regulating TAF1-independent transcription has not been defined. The IFNγ-induced transcriptional co-activator CIITA activates MHC class I and II genes, which are vital for immune responses, in a TAF1-independent manner. Activation by CIITA depends on its intrinsic AT activity. We now show that TAF7 binds to CIITA and inhibits its AT activity, thereby repressing activated transcription. Consistent with this TAF7 function, siRNA-mediated depletion of TAF7 resulted in increased CIITA-dependent transcription. A more global role for TAF7 as a regulator of transcription was revealed by expression profiling analysis: expression of 30-40% of genes affected by TAF7 depletion was independent of either TAF1 or CIITA. Surprisingly, although TAF1-dependent transcripts were largely down-regulated by TAF7 depletion, TAF1-independent transcripts were predominantly up-regulated. We conclude that TAF7, until now considered only a TFIID component and regulator of TAF1-dependent transcription, also regulates TAF1-independent transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1999334841,"Suitable alterations in gene expression are believed to allow animals to survive drastic changes in environmental conditions. Drosophila melanogaster larvae cease eating and exit moist food to search for dry pupation sites after the foraging stage in what is known as the wandering stage. Although the behavioral change from foraging to wandering causes desiccation stress, the mechanism by which Drosophila larvae protect themselves from desiccation remains obscure. Here, we identified a gene, CG14686 (designated as Desiccate (Desi)), whose expression was elevated during the wandering stage. The Desi expression level was reversibly decreased by transferring wandering larvae to wet conditions and increased again by transferring them to dry conditions. Elevation of Desi expression was also observed in foraging larvae when they were placed in dry conditions. Desi encoded a 261-amino acid single-pass transmembrane protein with notable motifs, such as SH2 and PDZ domain-binding motifs and a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation motif, in the cytoplasmic region, and its expression was observed mainly in the epidermal cells of the larval integuments. Overexpression of Desi slightly increased the larval resistance to desiccation stress during the second instar. Furthermore, Desi RNAi larvae lost more weight under dry conditions, and subsequently, their mortalities significantly increased compared with control larvae. Under dry conditions, consumption of carbohydrate was much higher in Desi RNAi larvae than control larvae.

IntroductionA wide variety of stressful stimuli change patterns of gene expression, which enables animals to adapt to stress, and such changes in gene expression are believed to allow them to survive drastic environmental changes. Activation of heat shock protein genes (hsp) is a typical example; all organisms express a particular set of hsp genes in response to stressors such as temperature extremes, aversive chemical application, anoxia, and many other environmental injuries (1Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar, 2Sun Y. MacRae T.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2613-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Hsp proteins are generally divided into three families: the 90-kDa, 70-kDa, and small heat shock proteins (3Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a nonlethal desiccation at 0% relative humidity (RH) 2The abbreviation used is: RHrelative humidity. enhanced transcriptional levels of the two hsp genes, hsp70 and hsp23, in pupae of the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis (4Tammariello S.P. Rinehart J.P. Denlinger D.L. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the two hsp transcripts were up-regulated in response to desiccation, the up-regulation was less dramatic than that elicited by heat shock, and desiccation failed to generate tolerance to high or low temperatures. Recently, it has been also reported that dehydration elicited expression of hsp70 in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex pipiens, but hsp90 expression levels remained fairly constant. Furthermore, injection of dsRNA to knock down expression of hsp70 and hsp90 significantly decreased survival rates of A. aegypti under dehydration (5Benoit J.B. Lopez-Martinez G. Phillips Z.P. Patrick K.R. Denlinger D.L. J. Insect Physiol. 2010; 56: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Exposure of adult male Drosophila melanogaster to desiccation enhanced transcriptional levels of Frost and senescence marker protein-30 (smp-30) but did not change those of hsp70Aa and hsp23 (6Sinclair B.J. Gibbs A.G. Roberts S.P. Insect Mol. Biol. 2007; 16: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although these previous studies demonstrated desiccation-induced gene expression, we do not know whether the up-regulation of the gene expression levels confers desiccation resistance on animals.Drosophila melanogaster, like all holometabolous insects, undergoes complete metamorphosis to reach adulthood. Each phase of the life cycle is characterized by a coordinated program of developmental events and behavioral transitions that have evolved to promote fitness and survival (7Riddiford L.M. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 899-939Google Scholar, 8Thummel C.S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In Drosophila larvae, the essential midthird instar transition from foraging (feeding) to wandering (nonfeeding) behavior occurs prior to pupariation and metamorphosis. Although this behavioral transition imposes desiccation stress on the larvae, it is unknown not only whether there is a specific mechanism responsible for providing the larvae with desiccation tolerance but also how the tolerance of the larvae is enhanced during the wandering stage. In this study, we sought a gene whose expression was elevated by desiccation stress and identified Desiccate (Desi). Desi expression in the larvae is dependent on relative humidity; desiccation enhanced its expression, and conversely, humidification repressed its expression. Desi encoded a single-pass transmembrane protein and expressed its transcripts actively in epidermal cells of the integument. Furthermore, Desi expression specifically increased during the wandering stage and the survival rates of Desi RNAi larvae significantly declined under the dry condition.DISCUSSIONWater conservation is especially essential for the survival of holometabolous insect larvae because they have less lipidic cuticles than pupae and adults. Despite this, Drosophila larvae change their habitat from wet to arid environments during the midthird instar for normal metamorphosis. Although it was recently reported that the sensory neuron of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel subunit, Pickpocket1, contributes to regulation of the behavioral transition of Drosophila larvae from foraging to wandering stages (18Ainsley J.A. Kim M.J. Wegman L.J. Pettus J.M. Johnson W.A. Dev. Biol. 2008; 322: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we do not know how they adapt to the rapid change of habitat from wet to arid conditions. To elucidate the key physiological mechanisms underlying the desiccation resistance that they must acquire around the time of initiation of the wandering stage, we conducted differential display RT-PCR to seek a gene whose expression is enhanced by desiccation. One gene, Desiccate (Desi), that we identified in this study encoded a 261-amino acid single transmembrane protein. The cytoplasmic tail of Desi contains several notable motifs such as SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-binding motifs, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) phosphorylation site, and PDZ domain-binding motifs. One of the SH2 domain-binding motifs is a GRB2-like SH2 domain-binding motif (19Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the other is a STAT5-family SH2 domain-binding motif (20Beisenherz-Huss C. Mundt M. Herrala A. Vihko P. Schubert A. Groner B. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2001; 183: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The PDZ domain-binding motifs in Desi are categorized as a class III PDZ domain-binding motif (21Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Both binding motifs for SH2 domains and PDZ domains are found in signaling molecules through binding with other component proteins of signal transductions. Furthermore, it has been reported that protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation regulates activities of some receptors, including acetylcholine receptors (22Nishizaki T. Sumikawa K. Brain Res. 1998; 812: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (23Crump F.T. Dillman K.S. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of the conserved motifs in the Desi cytoplasmic tail suggested the possibility that Desi transmits signals of extracellular desiccation stress to the intracellular signaling pathway. It is worth emphasizing the fact that most of these motifs are conserved in the orthologous genes identified in the EST data bases of mosquitoes, bees, and beetles.To demonstrate the biological significance of this gene, we established transgenic Drosophila larvae whose Desi expression was either up-regulated by expressing a functional Desi cDNA (UAS-Desi) or down-regulated by expressing Desi dsRNA (UAS-dsDesi). Although a significantly positive effect on desiccation-resistance by overexpression of Desi during the third larval instar was not apparent, the same treatment slightly but significantly increased the survival rates of the second instar larvae under the desiccated condition. This stage-dependent difference in the effect on stress resistance must be due to the difference in the endogenous expression levels of Desi; Desi expression is basically higher in third instar larvae than second instar larvae. Furthermore, it is often observed that larvae repeatedly crawl up and down the food especially at the end of the foraging third instar. Because elevation of Desi expression seemed to have begun already during this stage, it was difficult to detect the positive effect on desiccation-resistance by Desi overexpression in the third instar larvae. Therefore, the overexpression-dependent increase in the survival rates under the desiccated condition occurred only in second instar larvae. Desi knockdown, in contrast, significantly decreased desiccation resistance even during the third larval instar, indicating the contribution of Desi to the protection of Drosophila larvae from desiccation stress. The high mortality rate in Desi RNAi larvae was likely due to increased water loss because the RNAi larvae were the only ones that lost significantly more weight than control larvae after 5 h of desiccation treatment (Fig. 5C). Sørensen et al. (24S⊘rensen J.G. Nielsen M.M. Loeschcke V. J. Evol. Biol. 2007; 20: 1624-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) reported changes in gene expression in D. melanogaster selected for ecologically relevant environmental stress resistance traits including desiccation, starvation, and cold resistance. However, CG14686 (Desi) was not on the list of genes whose expression was changed in such stress-resistant flies. Furthermore, Telonis-Scott and Hoffmann (25Telonis-Scott M. Hoffmann A.A. J. Insect Physiol. 2003; 49: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have reported a desiccation-resistant mutant of D. melanogaster that showed 2-fold higher resistance than control flies when flies were placed under desiccation stress. They had a higher water concentration after desiccation treatment due to decreased rates of water loss but showed no change in body mass, glycogen concentration, hemolymph volume, or the water concentration at death from desiccation. Although the mutant allele is mapped to chromosome 2, specific gene(s) attributed to desiccation resistance have not been identified yet. Although we cannot deny certain functional similarities between the gene(s) mutated in this line and Desi, we recognize a clear difference between the two mutant lines. Although the desiccation resistance of this mutant line was demonstrated using adults, the repressed resistance of Desi transgenic lines to desiccation stresses was demonstrated only in its RNAi larvae. Because there was no significant difference in desiccation resistance between the control and Desi RNAi adults, it is reasonable to expect that the prompt adaptation to desiccation stress in the integument via Desi is more important in larvae than adults.The proximal causes of mortality from desiccation stress are not well understood. It has been suggested that hemolymph volume and hemolymph solute concentrations are important for the enhancement of desiccation resistance in D. melanogaster (26Folk D.G. Han C. Bradley T.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 3323-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Marron et al. (27Marron M.T. Markow T.A. Kain K.J. Gibbs A.G. J. Insect Physiol. 2003; 49: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) reported that the rates of lipid and protein metabolism in Drosophila flies were similar during starvation and desiccation but that carbohydrate metabolism was several times higher during desiccation. This observation is consistent with the previous report that concluded that lower overall rates of water loss in the flies are achieved by reduction of respiratory losses (28Gibbs A.G. Fukuzato F. Matzkin L.M. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The present study indicated a remarkable decrease in internal water and carbohydrates in the Desi RNAi larvae under a dry condition compared with control larvae. In contrast, ATP concentrations in both the RNAi and control larvae were increased under a dry condition, although no significant differences in ATP concentrations were determined between RNAi and control larvae either before or after desiccation. It is possible to interpret these results to mean that the Desi RNAi larvae lost excess amounts of the internal water needed to enhance the metabolic rate by producing ATP molecules that are used by these animals to maintain homeostasis. To evaluate the desiccation resistance of Drosophila, the importance of recovery processes from desiccation stress was also pointed out. Folk and Bradley (29Folk D.G. Bradley T.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2004; 207: 2671-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that the greatest desiccation resistance in a Drosophila population with enhanced desiccation resistance is associated with the restoration of all tested somatic components, whole-body water, dry mass, and sodium concentrations, suggesting the importance of nutrition during rehydration in determining recovery time. Sinclair et al. (6Sinclair B.J. Gibbs A.G. Roberts S.P. Insect Mol. Biol. 2007; 16: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) indicated that up-regulated expression of Frost, a Drosophila stress-responsive gene, was more obvious during recovery from desiccation than during desiccation. These results indicate that temporal factors are involved in desiccation resistance. Although the functional role of Frost was characterized during the adult stage, Desi contributed to enhancing desiccation resistance during the larval stage. To clarify the mechanism underlying the desiccation resistance of insects, it is important to consider the different life stages.Analyses aimed at revealing the molecular function of Desi will lead to an enhanced understanding of desiccation resistance in adults as well as larvae of Drosophila. The outcome of this type of study can develop a better knowledge of the effects of desiccation stress not only on insects but also on vertebrates. IntroductionA wide variety of stressful stimuli change patterns of gene expression, which enables animals to adapt to stress, and such changes in gene expression are believed to allow them to survive drastic environmental changes. Activation of heat shock protein genes (hsp) is a typical example; all organisms express a particular set of hsp genes in response to stressors such as temperature extremes, aversive chemical application, anoxia, and many other environmental injuries (1Feder M.E. Hofmann G.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar, 2Sun Y. MacRae T.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2613-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Hsp proteins are generally divided into three families: the 90-kDa, 70-kDa, and small heat shock proteins (3Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev.

Although the two hsp transcripts were up-regulated in response to desiccation, the up-regulation was less dramatic than that elicited by heat shock, and desiccation failed to generate tolerance to high or low temperatures. Recently, it has been also reported that dehydration elicited expression of hsp70 in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex pipiens, but hsp90 expression levels remained fairly constant.

Exposure of adult male Drosophila melanogaster to desiccation enhanced transcriptional levels of Frost and senescence marker protein-30 (smp-30) but did not change those of hsp70Aa and hsp23 (6Sinclair B.J.

Here, we show that Srg3, a mouse homolog of BAF155 that function as a core subunit of this complex, suppresses tumorigenesis in vivo. DNA damage signals promoted Srg3 degradation by inducing p53. Deficiency of Srg3 promoted G1 cell-cycle arrest, but antagonized apoptotic response to DNA damage by robustly inducing p53 and p21 proteins. Srg3 heterozygous mice were prone to sarcoma formation, which was further enhanced by haploinsufficiency of p53. These tumors highly expressed p53 and p21 but lacked Srg3 expression. Our results establish a novel function of Srg3 in tumor suppression and provide insights into genetic pathways dictating tumor suppression by the SWI/SNF complex."

Agonist binding induces large conformational changes in loops C and F. However, it is controversial as to whether these conformational changes are essential for gating. Here we used voltage clamp fluorometry to investigate the roles of loops C and F in gating the α1 β2 γ2 GABAA receptor. Voltage clamp fluorometry involves labeling introduced cysteines with environmentally sensitive fluorophores and inferring structural rearrangements from ligand-induced fluorescence changes. Previous attempts to define the roles of loops C and F using this technique have focused on homomeric Cys-loop receptors. However, the problem with studying homomeric receptors is that it is difficult to eliminate the possibility of bound ligands interacting directly with attached fluorophores at the same site. Here we show that ligands binding to the β2-α1 interface GABA binding site produce conformational changes at the adjacent subunit interface. This is most likely due to agonist-induced loop C closure directly altering loop F conformation at the adjacent α1-β2 subunit interface. However, as antagonists and agonists produce identical α1 subunit loop F conformational changes, these conformational changes appear unimportant for gating. Finally, we demonstrate that TM2-TM3 loops from adjacent β2 subunits in α1 β2 receptors can dimerize via K24′C disulfides in the closed state.

Individual Cys-loop receptor subunits consist of a large ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a transmembrane domain comprising four α-helices (TM1–TM4). LBDs themselves consist primarily of a “sandwich” of inner and outer β-sheets. The ligand binding site is situated at the interface of adjacent subunits and is formed by binding domain loops A–C from one subunit and loops D–F from the neighboring subunit (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) originally proposed that an agonist binding to its site induces loop C in the outer β-sheet to clasp tightly around the agonist. This is accompanied by a rotation of the inner β-sheet (5Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 7Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M. Le Poupon C.

Abundant structural and functional evidence indicates that these conformational changes are transmitted to the transmembrane domain via a differential movement of loops 2 and 7 (both part of the inner β-sheet) and the pre-TM1 domain (which connects to the outer sheet) (3Miller P.S.

As loops 2 and 7 intercalate with the extracellular TM2-TM3 linker domain, agonist-induced movement of these loops alters the conformation of this linker, leading to channel gating. Crystallography studies on acetylcholine-binding protein have shown that loop F of the outer sheet also moves upon ligand binding (13Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P.

However, there is as yet no consensus as to whether conformational changes in this loop represent local conformational changes to lock the ligand onto the binding site, simple distensions of the site to accommodate the ligand, or global conformational changes that are transmitted to the channel gate (16Khatri A.

Indeed, a recent study on the homomeric α1 GlyR demonstrated that loop C conformational changes occur at high agonist concentrations only, raising the question of whether loop C closure is essential for receptor activation (18Pless S.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15847-15856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to clarify the roles of loops C and F in channel activation using voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF). This technique correlates conformational changes occurring at the gate with those occurring in some other protein domain of interest in real time (20Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y.

It takes advantage of the fact that rhodamine fluorescence exhibits an increase in quantum efficiency as the hydrophobicity of its environment is increased. Thus, rhodamine fluorescence intensity reports receptor conformational changes that alter its immediate chemical microenvironment. The unique advantages of VCF are that it can resolve movements in domains that are distant from the gate and detect conformational changes that are electrophysiologically silent. Indeed, VCF has provided valuable insights into the conformational rearrangements of various Cys-loop receptors (16Khatri A. Sedelnikova A. Weiss D.S. Biophys.

Attempts to date to define the roles of loops C and F using VCF have focused on homomeric ρ1 GABAARs (16Khatri A. Sedelnikova A. Weiss D.S. Biophys.

However, with homomeric receptors, it is not possible to discern whether or not fluorescence changes of fluorophores attached to loop C or F residues are restricted to those sites that contain bound ligands. In the present study, we used α1 β2 and α1 β2 γ2 GABAARs in an attempt to compare conformational changes in loops C and F of each subunit that are induced by the agonists GABA and β-alanine, the antagonist gabazine (SR-95531), and the allosteric modulators diazepam and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). The crucial advantage of GABAARs over homomeric Cys-loop receptors is that GABA, β-alanine, and gabazine bind at LBD β-α interfaces only, whereas diazepam and DMCM bind with high affinity at LBD α-γ interfaces (31Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and possibly to LBD α-β interfaces (see “Discussion”). In addition, a low affinity benzodiazepine site is also present in the transmembrane domain region of GABAARs. Thus, by attaching fluorescent labels to loop C or F residues in one subunit only, we can discriminate between those conformational changes imposed by the immediate proximity of the ligand and those that are propagated to adjacent subunits and binding sites. We also investigated conformational changes in TM2-TM3 domain of each subunit to correlate conformational changes in loops C and F with those occurring at a more distant site along the gating pathway. Sulforhodamine methanethiosulfonate (MTS-R) and 2-((5(6)-tetramethylrhodamine)carboxylamino)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTS-TAMRA) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada). Alexa Fluor 546-C5-maleimide (AF546) and tetramethylrhodamine-6-maleimide (TMRM) were purchased from Invitrogen. MTS-R, MTS-TAMRA, and TMRM were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20 °C. AF546 was dissolved directly into ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES) on the day of the experiment and stored on ice for up to 6 h. GABA, β-alanine, and gabazine (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in ND96 and stored at −20 °C. Diazepam and DMCM (both Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved as 10 mm stocks in DMSO and stored at −20 °C. The 100:400 μm copper phenanthroline solution, which was used as an oxidizing agent, was generated by mixing copper sulfate and 1,10-phenanthroline in ND96 to final concentrations of 100 and 400 μm, respectively. Rat α1, β2, and γ2 GABAAR subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the pGEMHE plasmid vector. To eliminate uncross-linked extracellular cysteines, subunits incorporated the following background mutations: α1 subunit, C233S and C292S; β2 subunit, C287S; and γ2 subunit, C244S and C303A. QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate all cysteine mutants used in this study. The successful incorporation of the mutations was confirmed by the automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence. Capped mRNA for oocyte injection was generated using mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes from female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express) were prepared as described previously (26Pless S.A. Dibas M.I. Lester H.A. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36057-36067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and injected with 10 ng of mRNA. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C for 3–7 days in an incubation solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 0.6 mm theophylline, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ), pH 7.4. On the day of recording, oocytes were transferred into ND96 containing 10–20 μm dye. Typical labeling times were 30 s for MTS-R and MTS-TAMRA (on ice), 30 min for TMRM (on ice), and 45 min for AF546 (at room temperature). Oocytes were washed thoroughly after labeling and stored in ND96 on ice for up to 6 h before recording. All four sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophores used in this study respond with an increase in quantum efficiency as the hydrophobicity of their environment is increased (22Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I. Petersson E.J. Auyeung V.C. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10195-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Muroi Y. Czajkowski C.

Each cysteine mutant was incubated with all four fluorophores in turn, and the one yielding the largest change in fluorescence (ΔF) upon agonist application was analyzed. As unmutated α1 β2 dimeric or α1 β2 γ2 trimeric GABAARs never exhibited a ΔF or a change in electrophysiological properties following fluorophore incubation, we can rule out nonspecific effects of the labels. The experimental setup comprised an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a high-Q tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT), a LUCPlanFLN 40×/numerical aperture 0.6 objective (Olympus), and a PhotoMax 200 photodiode (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) with a 12-V/100-watt halogen lamp (Olympus) as light source. The recording chamber is similar to those described previously (22Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I. Petersson E.J. Auyeung V.C. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10195-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were voltage-clamped at −40 mV, and currents were recorded with an OC-725C oocyte amplifier (Warner, Hamden, CT). Current and fluorescence traces were acquired at 200 Hz via a Digidata 1322A interface using pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Fluorescence signals were digitally filtered at 1–2 Hz with an eight-pole Bessel filter for analysis and display. Half-maximal concentrations (EC50) and Hill coefficient (nH) values for ligand-induced activation of current and fluorescence were obtained using the Hill equation fitted with a non-linear least square algorithm (SigmaPlot 9.0, Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA). All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t test with p < 0.05 representing significance. Oocytes were injected with 1 μg total of α1 and β2-K24′C subunit RNA in a 1:3 ratio. After 3 days of incubation, oocytes were washed once with ND96, and then some oocytes were treated with ND96 containing a 10 mm concentration of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). After 30 min of incubation with gentle shaking at 18 °C, DTT-treated oocytes were rinsed twice with ND96. After washing, DTT-treated and control oocytes were biotinylated in ND96 solution containing 1.22 mg/ml EZ-Link NHS-SS-biotin (succinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate; Pierce) for 60 min on ice accompanied by slow shaking. Oocytes were then washed twice with ND96 and gently pipetted at 4 °C in 20 μl of oocyte lysis buffer (comprising 0.1 m Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 m NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors, EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics)) followed by several passages through a hypodermic syringe fitted with a 30-gauge needle. The resultant lysis mixture was sonicated three times for 20 s each on ice. To solubilize proteins from the membrane, Triton X (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 1% to the sonicated cell mixture. The mixture was solubilized by rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove debris and yolk. The resultant supernatant containing biotinylated proteins was transferred to streptavidin beads (Pierce) and rotated for 12–16 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with lysis buffer, and protein was eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer (no bromphenol blue/no DTT) plus 10 m urea. After concentration analysis using BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce), bromphenol blue was added to both the control and DTT-treated samples, and 10 mm DTT was re-added to the DTT-treated sample. A total of 100 μg of protein from each sample was heated at 65 °C for 15 min before loading on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) to separate. Protein bands were subsequently transferred to PVDF membrane by electrotransfer for 1 h using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell. PVDF membranes were blocked for 1 h with 3.5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and processed with a primary rabbit anti-GABAAR β2 polyclonal antibody (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) and subsequently with goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). PVDF membranes were developed using Super Signal West Pico (Pierce). The GABA binding site lies at the interface of β2 and α1 subunits. Loop F of the α1 subunit is an unstructured domain that lines the base of the ligand binding pocket. In an attempt to clarify the role of this domain, we compared the conformational changes induced by agonists, antagonists, and a positive allosteric modulator in the loop F domains of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits. None of the drugs tested in this study produced a detectable ΔF response at unmutated α1 β2 or α1 β2 γ2 GABAARs following incubation with any of the four fluorophores used in this study. We focused our investigation on the following cysteine-substituted residues: α1-R186C, β2-I180C, and γ2-S195C. Although the precise alignment between subunits in the loop F region is uncertain, any plausible alignment reveals that these three residues correspond closely. The locations of these residues on a GABAAR structural model are shown in Fig. 1. Although we also attempted to investigate a range of other labeled sites in loop F, including A181C, E182C, D183C, G184C, and S185C in the α1 subunit and T175C, G176C, V177C, T178C, and K179C in the β2 subunit, mutant receptors incorporating these mutations did not produce significant ligand-induced ΔF responses following labeling with MTS-R, MTS-TAMRA, TMRM, or AF546. The mean EC50 of the GABA-activated change in current (ΔI) in α1-R186C β2 receptors was significantly higher (p < 0.01, unpaired t test) than that of unmutated α1 β2 GABAARs (Table 1). Labeling with MTS-R resulted in a further rightward shift in the mean GABA ΔI EC50 value and a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in peak current (ΔImax), although the nH did not change (Table 1). A saturating (30 μm) GABA concentration produced a peak ΔF (ΔFmax) of 4.9% in α1-R186C β2 GABAARs (Fig. 2A and Table 1). As MTS-R labeling of unmutated α1 β2 GABAARs had no effect on the GABA ΔI EC50 or ΔImax values (Table 1) and resulted in no detectable GABA-mediated ΔF, we conclude that R186C was specifically covalently labeled by rhodamine. We were unable to detect a significant ΔF following labeling of α1-R186C β2 receptors with AF546 or TMRM, although a small GABA-evoked ΔF was observed following labeling with MTS-TAMRA. The on and off time courses of ΔF responses generally correlated well with agonist application and removal (Fig. 2A). However, because currents are recorded from the entire oocyte and fluorescence is recorded only from a small surface area, slight discrepancies between current and fluorescence on and off rates are expected. After normalization, the ΔI and ΔF concentration-response relationships of MTS-R-labeled α1-R186C β2 GABAARs were almost superimposed (Fig. 2B) with the averaged ΔI and ΔF EC50 values showing no significant difference (p > 0.05; Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of results obtained using GABA as agonistConstructEC50nHImax or ΔFmaxnμmα1 β2 unlabeled0.8 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.19.5 ± 0.7 μA5α1 β2 MTS-R0.7 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.18.9 ± 0.5 μA5α1 β2 γ2 unlabeled3.2 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.19.6 ± 0.7 μA4α1 β2 γ2 MTS-R3.5 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.110.3 ± 1.3 μA4α1-R186C β2 unlabeled3.3 ± 0.2ap < 0.01 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.2 ± 0.17.4 ± 0.2 μA3α1-R186C β2 MTS-R9.2 ± 1.1bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.1 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.3 μAbp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.4α1-R186C β2 MTS-R8.0 ± 0.70.8 ± 0.14.9 ± 0.4%4α1 β2-I180C unlabeled1.0 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.16.9 ± 1.2 μA3α1 β2-I180C MTS-TAMRA1.1 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.17.5 ± 1.8 μA4α1 β2-I180C MTS-TAMRA1.0 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1%4α1 β2 γ2-S195C unlabeled2.9 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.0310.1 ± 1.1 μA4α1 β2 γ2-S195C TMRM6.1 ± 0.6ap < 0.01 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.6 ± 0.113.4 ± 1.7 μA3α1 β2 γ2-S195C TMRM3.8 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.1%3α1-N20′C β2 unlabeled1.5 ± 0.2cp < 0.05 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.1 ± 0.18.1 ± 1.1 μA3α1-N20′C β2 TMRM0.40 ± 0.03ap < 0.01 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.2 ± 0.26.1 ± 0.9 μAcp < 0.05 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.4α1-N20′C β2 TMRM——2.2 ± 0.4%4α1-N20′C β2 γ2 unlabeled14.2 ± 1.6bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.1 ± 0.16.2 ± 1.0 μAcp < 0.05 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.3α1-N20′C β2 γ2 TMRM13.5 ± 0.5bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.1 ± 0.18.3 ± 0.7 μA4α1-N20′C β2 γ2 TMRM——0.8 ± 0.1%4α1 β2-K24′C unlabeled25.6 ± 4.2bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.1 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.2 μAbp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.4α1 β2-K24′C MTS-R30.3 ± 3.8bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.0.7 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.0.7 ± 0.1 μAbp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.4α1 β2-K24′C MTS-R38.4 ± 3.80.90 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1%4α1 β2-K24′C γ2 unlabeled91 ± 9bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.1.1 ± 0.17.8 ± 1.4 μA3α1 β2-K24′C γ2 MTS-R31.0 ± 2.3bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.0.8 ± 0.1bp < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.5.4 ± 1.2 μAcp < 0.05 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.4α1 β2-K24′C γ2 MTS-R67 ± 10.8 ± 0.10.74 ± 0.02%4α1 β2 γ2-P23′C unlabeled2.7 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.19.2 ± 0.8 μA5α1 β2 γ2-P23′C TMRM4.3 ± 0.71.7 ± 0.39.3 ± 0.3 μA5α1 β2 γ2-P23′C TMRM——0.9 ± 0.1%5a p < 0.01 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.b p < 0.001 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.c p < 0.05 relative to corresponding value at unlabeled α1 β2 GABAAR using unpaired t test.

Saturating (10 mm) β-alanine concentrations produced ΔFmax values comparable in magnitude with those produced by GABA (Fig. 2A and Table 1).

At variance with the closely related family of AMPA receptors, the main postsynaptic receptors involved in fast synaptic transmission, KARs exert their function by acting at either pre- or postsynaptic sites. Because their physiological functions critically depend on their specific localization as well as their density in these different neuronal compartments, it is important to better understand the mechanisms by which their trafficking is regulated in neurons. KARs are heterotetrameric receptor channels composed of various combinations of five subunits GluK1, GluK2, GluK3, GluK4, and GluK5 (formerly referred as GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, and KA2, respectively). The diversity of KARs is increased by the existence of splice variants for GluK1, GluK2, and GluK3 subunits. KAR subunits isoforms display different levels of expression at the plasma membrane depending on the alternative splicing of their C terminus (3Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E.

When expressed as homomers in heterologous cells or in cultured neurons, GluK2a is highly addressed to the plasma membrane, whereas GluK2b is present at low levels (3Jaskolski F. Coussen F.

The low level of expression of homomeric GluR6b can be explained by restricted export of the subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum (3Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Native KARs likely exist as heteromers of different GluK subunits, as well as of different splice variants of the same GluK subunit, as for instance, in the case of GluK2a/GluK2b heteromers, which form native KARs (7Coussen F.

The regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors trafficking to the cell surface is probably controlled by a combination of endoplasmic reticulum retention and export signals, as well as by domain-specific protein interactors. KAR subunits and splice variants diverge in their cytoplasmic C-terminal region, which opens the possibility that their trafficking and function are differentially regulated by proteins that interact specifically with subunit specific domains (7Coussen F.

GluK2a and GluK2b interact with two different sets of cytosolic proteins partners, some of which have been identified by proteomic analysis (7Coussen F. Perrais D. Jaskolski F. Sachidhanandam S.

Most reports have concentrated on the regulation of trafficking of homomeric GluK2a receptors by PDZ domain binding proteins (9Coussen F. Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), BTB-Kelch protein, and KRIP6 (10Laezza F. Wilding T.J. Sequeira S. Coussen F. Zhang X.Z. Hill-Robinson R. Mulle C.

Among proteins found to interact with GluK2b in a proteomic screen, profilin IIa (PfnIIa) appears as an interesting candidate for activity-dependent regulation of KARs (7Coussen F. Perrais D.

Mammalian profilins are actin-binding proteins, highly conserved with respect to their affinities for G-actin, poly-l-proline, and phosphoinositides. Profilins act as regulators of various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane transport (11Birbach A. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In mammals, several profilin isoforms have been identified. Whereas profilin I (PfnI) is ubiquitously expressed, PfnIIa is specifically expressed in the brain (12Di Nardo A. Gareus R. Kwiatkowski D. Witke W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3795-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a necessary element in key steps of neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity (13Pilo Boyl P. Di Nardo A. Mulle C. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Panzanelli P. Mele A. Kneussel M. Costantini V. Perlas E. Massimi M. Vara H. Giustetto M. Witke W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PfnIIa interacts with proteins implicated in membrane trafficking, i.e. by interacting with and controlling dynamin-1 activity. Overexpression of PfnIIa inhibits endocytosis, whereas the lack of PfnIIa in neurons results in an increase in endocytosis and membrane recycling (14Gareus R. Di Nardo A. Rybin V. Witke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2803-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, profilins are targeted to dendritic spines after robust synaptic activation suggesting a potential role in synaptic plasticity (15Ackermann M. Matus A. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the potential role of the interaction between GluK2b and PfnIIa in the trafficking of KARs composed of GluK2a and GluK2b. We describe the specific interaction of PfnIIa to a diproline motif in GluK2b, and we show that PfnIIa controls membrane trafficking of heteromeric KARs in heterologous cells and in hippocampal neurons. Our results indicate that PfnIIa acts at two different levels, as a general regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis through its interaction with dynamin-1 and by controlling exocytosis of KARs through a direct interaction with the diproline motif of GluK2b. Myc-GluK2a and Myc-GluK2b were described in Ref. 16Coussen F. Normand E. Marchal C. Costet P. Choquet D. Lambert M. Mège R.M. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6426-6436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Myc or superecliptic pHluorin tobacco etch virus (SEP-TEV) sequences were introduced after the signal sequence in the GluK2 cDNA by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene). SEP-TEV (SGGSGGDYDIPTTENLYFQGELKTVDAD) was amplified by PCR introducing appropriate restriction sites for subcloning (17Wienisch M. Klingauf J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Myc epitope from Myc-GluK2a was exchanged by pHluorin-TEV by subcloning. The C terminus region of SEP-TEV-GluK2a was replaced by the C terminus of either GluK2b or GluK2b/AA. CDNAs were sequenced and expressed in COS-7 cells to verify molecular weight by Western blot analysis with a C-terminal antibody when available. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs using the FuGENE kit (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France). Cultured mouse hippocampal neurons were obtained as described previously (3Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) from mouse pups derived from PfnIIa knock-out mice (13Pilo Boyl P. Di Nardo A. Mulle C. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Panzanelli P. Mele A. Kneussel M. Costantini V. Perlas E. Massimi M. Vara H. Giustetto M. Witke W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Roche Applied Science). For surface labeling, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with primary antibodies (1/500 dilution) in culture media and immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose for 15 min at 37 °C. For intracellular labeling, after fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 min and rinsed in PBS/0.3% BSA. Primary antibodies were then incubated for 30 min at 20 °C, washed with PBS/BSA, and incubated with the secondary fluorescent antibodies (anti-mouse antibody, Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-rabbit antibody, Alexa Fluor 488) for 30 min at 20 °C and extensively washed with PBS/BSA. Coverslips were then mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories). After 24 h of expression, COS-7 cells transfected with the appropriate cDNAs were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the anti-Myc antibody and with transferrin Alexa Fluor 488. Cells were acid washed for 2 min at 20 °C with cultured media adjusted at pH 2.2. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies (anti-rabbit antibody, Alexa Fluor 568) for 30 min at 20 °C. COS-7 cells or hippocampal neurons from profilin knock-out mice were transfected with SEP-TEV-GluK2b and GluK2a or SEP-TEV-GluK2b/AA and GluK2a with the different PfnIIa cDNAs. Neurons were transfected at 6 days in vitro on 5 coverslips. Experiments were performed after 24 h of expression. Coverslips were incubated with culture medium without serum containing 300 units/ml of TEV enzyme (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by 10 min at 20 °C. Cells were then either directly fixed (corresponding to time 0 in the figures) or further incubated in culture medium at 37 °C for the time indicated in the figures. After fixation at different times, cells were incubated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 20 °C (labeling of extracellular receptors). Cells were permeabilized and incubated with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody for 30 min at 20 °C. Cells were then incubated with anti-mouse coupled to Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa Fluor 488. For image acquisitions, the exposure settings and gain were kept the same to compare the different experimental conditions. Quantity of exocytosed receptors was measured as the ratio between extracellular (EC) receptors and intracellular (IC) receptors. For endocytosis experiments, cells were imaged with confocal microscope Leica DMR TCS SP2 AOBS on an upright stand (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany), using an objective HCX Plan Apo CS 40× oil. The lasers used were argon (458 nm), green helium-neon (543 nm), and red helium-neon (633 nm). In the other experiments, cells were visualized with an upright epi-fluorescence microscope (Leica DMR, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Images were acquired with a CoolSnap camera (Roper Scientific) and Metamorph software and analyzed with a macro written in MATLAB. Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad PRISM software as indicated in the figure legends. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (16Coussen F. Normand E. Marchal C. Costet P. Choquet D. Lambert M. Mège R.M. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6426-6436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were directly eluted with SDS gel load buffer, run on polyacrylamide gels, and transferred on membrane for immunoblotting. Gels were quantified with a Syngene apparatus (catalog no. CG2XE/D2-E from Ozyme). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal domain of GluK2b was coupled via its N-terminal extremity to an activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PfnI or PfnIIa were expressed in bacteria, purified, and incubated overnight with the corresponding resins. After extensive washes, samples were directly loaded on SDS gels and Western blotted with antibodies directed against PfnI or PfnIIa. GST pulldown experiments were performed using either the GluK2a C terminus domain (70 amino acids), the GluK2b C terminus domain (27 amino acids), or the GluK2b C terminus domain with mutations of two prolines into alanines. Cytosolic protein extracts from mouse brain or COS-7 cells were incubated with beads coupled to GST, GST- Cterm-GluK2a, GST-Cterm-GluK2b, or GST-Cterm-GluK2b/AA overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed, suspended in loading buffer, run on SDS gels, and transferred onto membranes for immunoblotting. One day after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed with PBS (pH 8.0) and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-LinkTM sulfo-NHS-S-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes, cells were scrapped in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and a mix of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with immobilized streptavidin bead agarose overnight at 4 °C and washed extensively. Samples were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies corresponding to the proteins of interest. The antibodies used in this experiment were as follows: anti-GluK2a/GluK3 (catalog no. 06-309, Upstate); polyclonal anti-myc (catalog no. 06-549, Upstate); monoclonal anti-myc (catalog no. 1-667-149, clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science); anti-dynamin-1 (catalog no. 05-319, Upstate); monoclonal anti-GFP (clone 7.1, Roche Applied Science); and polyclonal anti-GFP (catalog no. A-64-55, Molecular Probes). Anti-PfnI and anti-PfnIIa were kindly provided by Walter Witke (EMBL Monterotondo). We have previously shown that PfnIIa interacts with GluK2b in the brain by peptide pulldown and immunoprecipitation experiments (7Coussen F. Perrais D. Jaskolski F. Sachidhanandam S. Normand E. Bockaert J. Marin P. Mulle C. Neuron. 2005; 47: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To further characterize the interaction between PfnIIa and GluK2b, we first determined whether this interaction was direct or whether it required an intermediate protein partner (Fig. 1). For this, we incubated either PfnI or PfnIIa proteins produced in Escherichia coli with GluK2a and GluK2b C-terminal peptides linked to Sepharose resins (Fig. 1A). This experiment indicated that the last 15 amino acids of GluK2b representing its C-terminal domain directly bind PfnIIa. This interaction was specific for PfnIIa because PfnI did not bind to GluK2b (as well as to GluK2a, data not shown) and was specific for the C-terminal domain of GluK2b as PfnIIa did not bind to the C-terminal domain of GluK2a. In control experiments, we found that GluK2a bound to the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 (data not shown) (16Coussen F. Normand E. Marchal C. Costet P. Choquet D. Lambert M. Mège R.M. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6426-6436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Profilins interact with a wide variety of proteins via their poly-l-proline binding site. GluK2b C-terminal domain contains two consecutive prolines that could correspond to the consensus binding sequence to PfnIIa (Fig. 1B). To determine whether these amino acids are responsible for the binding of GluK2b to PfnIIa, we replaced the two prolines by alanines in GluK2b (GluK2b/AA). We expressed Myc-GluK2a, Myc-GluK2b, and Myc-GluK2b/AA with PfnIIa in COS-7 cells and tested interaction of PfnIIa by a co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1C). PfnIIa was co-immunoprecipitated with myc-GluK2b, but it was not detected in the Western blots after immunoprecipitation of Myc-GluK2a or of Myc-GluK2b/AA. These results confirm the specific interaction of PfnIIa with the C-terminal domain of GluK2b, but not of GluK2a, and show that the diproline motif in the C-terminal domain of GluK2b is essential for its direct interaction with PfnIIa. A number of profilin-interacting molecules identified in the mouse brain are part of the secretary machinery and could be involved in membrane trafficking (18Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether the interaction between PfnIIa and GluK2b could affect the expression of GluK2b-containing receptors at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). We performed biotinylation experiments in COS-7 cells expressing either Myc-GluK2b or Myc-GluK2a, with or without PfnIIa (Fig. 2, A–C, n = 5 for each condition). Only 4% (± 1%) of Myc-GluK2b was present at the plasma membrane when expressed alone. Expression of PfnIIa further decreased membrane localization of Myc-GluK2b to 2% (± 1%) (Fig. 2A), but did not affect plasma membrane expression of GluK2a alone (75 ± 4% without PfnIIa and 80 ± 6% with PfnIIa) (Fig. 2B). Heteromerization regulates KAR trafficking to the plasma membrane, and native GluK2-containing KARs are thought to comprise both GluK2a and GluK2b (7Coussen F. Perrais D. Jaskolski F. Sachidhanandam S. Normand E. Bockaert J. Marin P. Mulle C. Neuron. 2005; 47: 555-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether the interaction between PfnIIa and GluK2b affected the plasma membrane expression of heteromeric GluK2a/GluK2b receptors expressed in COS-7 cells by biotinylation experiments. Expression of GluK2a increased the amount of GluK2b at the plasma membrane (from 4% ± 1.2% to 32 ± 5%, n = 5) (Fig. 2A). Conversely, expression of GluK2b decreased the amount of GluK2a at the plasma membrane (from 75 ± 4% without GluK2b to 41 ± 10% with GluK2b, n = 5) (Fig. 2B). Expression of PfnIIa decreased the amount of heteromeric KARs at the plasma membrane by a factor 2 (to 14 ± 3% when monitoring GluK2b and to 19 ± 10% when monitoring GluK2a, n = 5 for each condition) (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, PfnIIa did not affect expression of Myc-GluK2b/AA at the plasma membrane when transfected alone or with GluK2a (Myc-GluK2b/AA alone, 5 ± 1%; with PfnIIa, 5 ± 1%; myc-GluK2b/AA with GluK2a, 20 ± 1% without PfnIIa, 20 ± 3% with PfnIIa, n = 4). GluK2b/AA expressed with GluK2a is less exported than GluK2b (Myc-GluK2b/AA with GluK2a, 15 ± 1%; Myc-GluK2b with GluK2a, 34 ± 1%) (Fig. 2C). We confirmed these results using immunocytochemistry experiments in COS-7 cells expressing the different combinations of subunits with or without PfnIIa (Fig. 2D, n = 4). Surface labeling of receptors was measured and normalized to the level of expression for each cell. This level was measured as the GFP signal corresponding either to pEGFP or to PfnIIa-GFP plasmids. As expected, the labeling corresponding to extracellular Myc-GluK2b expressed alone was very low (< 1%) and was undetectable in cells co-expressing PfnIIa. The relative amount of Myc-GluK2a at the surface was not affected by co-expression of PfnIIa (32 ± 11% without PfnIIa, 25 ± 10% with PfnIIa, n = 40 cells). However, PfnIIa decreased the relative amount of Myc-GluK2a when expressed in combination with GluK2b (34 ± 4% without PfnIIa, 21 ± 2% with PfnIIa, n = 40 cells). The decrease of surface expressed KARs was even more pronounced when monitoring the Myc-GluK2b subunit in the heteromer (15 ± 2% without PfnIIa, 6 ± 1% with PfnIIa, n = 70 cells) (Fig. 2D, right panel). PfnIIa had no effect on the plasma membrane expression of receptors composed of GluK2a/Myc-GluK2b/AA subunits (15 ± 1% without PfnIIa, 18 ± 2% with PfnIIa, n = 50 cells). These results indicate that PfnIIa decreases the amount of homo- and heteromeric KARs containing GluK2b at the plasma membrane through a direct interaction between GluK2b and PfnIIa in COS-7 cells. To study whether PfnIIa also affected surface trafficking of KARs in hippocampal neurons in culture, we took advantage of cultures derived from PfnIIa knock-out mice (13Pilo Boyl P. Di Nardo A. Mulle C. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Panzanelli P. Mele A. Kneussel M. Costantini V. Perlas E. Massimi M. Vara H. Giustetto M. Witke W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2991-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As previously described in wild-type hippocampal neurons, endogenously expressed GluK2a was able to heteromerize with GluK2b and promoted forward trafficking of GluK2b to the neuronal plasma membrane (3Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We thus expressed Myc-GluK2b (or Myc-GluK2b/AA) with or without PfnIIa in hippocampal neurons and performed live labeling of surface Myc-GluK2b (Fig. 3A). We quantified the level of extracellular KARs and normalized to the GFP signal as for COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of PfnIIa markedly decreased the plasma membrane expression of GluK2b (Myc-GluK2b alone, 50 ± 3%; with PfnIIa, 8 ± 1%). PfnIIa did not affect the surface expression of the mutant form of Myc-GluK2b, which does not bind PfnIIa (Myc-GluK2b/AA alone: 17 ± 3% with PfnIIa, 21 ± 3%). However, the plasma membrane expression of Myc-GluK2b/AA was significantly lower than that of the wild-type Myc-GluK2b (Myc-GluK2b/AA, 18 ± 3%, n = 10 cells; Myc-GluK2b, 50 ± 3%, n = 50 cells). When Myc-GluK2b was expressed in cultured neurons from wild-type mice, the co-expression of PfnIIa did not change its surface expression (Myc-GluK2b alone, 16 ± 3%; with PfnIIa, 14 ± 2%) (data not shown). Overall, these results indicate that PfnIIa decreases surface expression of GluK2b containing KARs in neurons. The decreased surface expression of GluK2b-containing KARs in the presence of PfnIIa could be assigned either to an inhibition of forward trafficking mechanisms or to facilitation of endocytosis. Contrary to this hypothesis, PfnIIa is known to inhibit endocytosis via its interaction with dynamin-1 (14Gareus R. Di Nardo A. Rybin V. Witke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2803-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PfnIIa associates with dynamin-1 via its C-terminal proline-rich domain and thereby interferes with the assembly of the endocytic machinery (14Gareus R. Di Nardo A. Rybin V. Witke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2803-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To understand how this generic inhibition of endocytosis by PfnIIa affects GluK2b trafficking, we used two mutants of PfnIIa (S134Y (PfnIIaY) and S138D (PfnIIaD) mutants), which were previously characterized as lacking interaction with dynamin-1 and fail to inhibit the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin (14Gareus R. Di Nardo A. Rybin V. Witke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2803-2811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We checked whether these mutations affected the binding of PfnIIa with GluK2b subunit (Fig. 4). We examined the binding of dynamin-1 and GluK2b to PfnIIa mutants, by GST pulldown experiments (Fig. 4A, n = 3). As expected, we did not observe any pulldown of dynamin-1 with the PfnIIa mutants, after incubation of the GST beads with a brain extract and quantification of anti-dynamin-1 labeling in Western blots. We next incubated extracts from COS-7 cells expressing the Myc-GluK2b subunit with GST beads. We found that PfnIIaY or PfnIIaD bind GluK2b, as well as wild-type PfnIIa (n = 5). Conversely, we performed a peptide pulldown assay with the C terminus peptide of GluK2b incubated with extracts of COS-7 cells expressing either PfnIIa, PfnIIaY, or PfnIIaD (Fig. 4B, n = 2). We observed that the same amount of PfnIIa and PfnIIa mutants were pulled down with the GluK2b C terminus peptide. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments on extracts from COS-7 cells expressing Myc-GluK2b and PfnIIa (Fig. 4C, n = 3). Myc-GluK2b was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody, and Western blots were probed with an antibody against PfnIIa. Similar amounts of PfnIIa, PfnIIaY, or PfnIIaD were co-immunoprecipitated with the Myc-GluK2b subunit. Thus, although PfnIIaY and PfnIIaD fail to interact with dynamin-1, these two mutations do not appear to affect the binding of PfnIIa to the GluK2b subunit. PfnIIa associates with dynamin-1 via its C-terminal proline-rich domain and thus probably associates with GluK2b via another domain. Using these mutants, we could then differentiate between a specific function for the PfnIIa-GluK2b interaction and a more general effect of PfnIIa on endocytosis of membrane proteins. We first performed biotinylation experiments in COS-7 cells expressing heteromeric GluK2a/Myc-GluK2b receptors with or without PfnIIaY or PfnIIaD (Fig. 5A, n = 3). Extracellular and intracellular pools of receptors were purified on streptavidin beads, and samples were run on SDS gels, blotted with anti-Myc antibody, and quantified. Expression of PfnIIaY or PfnIIaD decreased the relative surface levels of GluK2b containing KARs to similar levels as with PfnIIa (Myc-GluK2b in GluK2a/GluK2b receptor expressed with PfnIIa, 18 ± 4%; with PfnIIaY, 18 ± 6%; with PfnIIaD, 16 ± 5%). Quantification of the relative amount of surface receptors by immunocytochemistry in COS-7 cells expressing PfnIIaY or PfnIIaD yielded similar results (Fig. 5B). By both biochemical and immunocytochemical methods, we found that mutated forms of PfnIIa did not affect membrane trafficking of receptors containing GluK2b/AA, which does not bind PfnIIa. We repeated these experiments in hippocampal neurons cultured from PfnIIa knock-out mice expressing the Myc-GluK2b or Myc-GluK2b/AA with or without the mutated forms of PfnIIa (Fig. 5C). Again, we found that expression of the mutated forms of PfnIIa, that still bind the GluK2b subunit but not dynamin-1, decreased the surface expression of KARs containing GluK2b. If inhibition of endocytosis by PfnIIa was involved in the regulated membrane expression of KARs, we may have expected a greater decrease of surface receptors in the presence of PfnIIaY or PfnIIaD. Our results suggest that PfnIIa does not inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis of GluK2b. We directly tested this hypothesis by examining the mechanisms and the rate of endocytosis of GluK2b-containing receptors expressed in COS-7 cells and the influence of PfnIIa (Fig. 6). Transferrin is internalized through the classical receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway involving clathrin-coated pits and dynamin (19van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2083180401,"The Myc proto-oncoproteins are transcription factors that recognize numerous target genes through hexameric DNA sequences called E-boxes. The mechanism by which they then activate the expression of these targets is still under debate. Here, we use an RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify Drosophila host cell factor (dHCF) as a novel co-factor for Myc that is functionally required for the activation of a Myc-dependent reporter construct. dHCF is also essential for the full activation of endogenous Myc target genes in S2 cells, and for the ability of Myc to promote growth in vivo. Myc and dHCF physically interact, and they colocalize on common target genes. Furthermore, down-regulation of dHCF-associated histone acetyltransferase and histone methyltransferase complexes in vivo interferes with the Myc biological activities. We therefore propose that dHCF recruits such chromatin-modifying complexes and thereby contributes to the expression of Myc targets and hence to the execution of Myc biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2065942389,"Amino acid residues on PotB and PotC involved in spermidine uptake were identified by random and site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that Trp8, Tyr43, Trp100, Leu110, and Tyr261 in PotB and Trp46, Asp108, Glu169, Ser196, Asp198, and Asp199 in PotC were strongly involved in spermidine uptake and that Tyr160, Glu172, and Leu274 in PotB and Tyr19, Tyr88, Tyr148, Glu160, Leu195, and Tyr211 in PotC were moderately involved in spermidine uptake. Among 11 amino acid residues that were strongly involved in spermidine uptake, Trp8 in PotB was important for insertion of PotB and PotC into membranes. Tyr43, Trp100, and Leu110 in PotB and Trp46, Asp108, Ser196, and Asp198 in PotC were found to be involved in the interaction with PotD. Leu110 and Tyr261 in PotB and Asp108, Asp198, and Asp199 in PotC were involved in the recognition of spermidine, and Trp100 and Tyr261 in PotB and Asp108, Glu169, and Asp198 in PotC were involved in ATPase activity of PotA. Accordingly, Trp100 in PotB was involved in both PotD recognition and ATPase activity, Leu110 in PotB was involved in both PotD and spermidine recognition, and Tyr261 in PotB was involved in both spermidine recognition and ATPase activity. Asp108 and Asp198 in PotC were involved in PotD and spermidine recognition as well as ATPase activity. These results suggest that spermidine passage from PotD to the cytoplasm is coupled to the ATPase activity of PotA through a structural change of PotA by its ATPase activity. Amino acid residues on PotB and PotC involved in spermidine uptake were identified by random and site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that Trp8, Tyr43, Trp100, Leu110, and Tyr261 in PotB and Trp46, Asp108, Glu169, Ser196, Asp198, and Asp199 in PotC were strongly involved in spermidine uptake and that Tyr160, Glu172, and Leu274 in PotB and Tyr19, Tyr88, Tyr148, Glu160, Leu195, and Tyr211 in PotC were moderately involved in spermidine uptake.

Tyr43, Trp100, and Leu110 in PotB and Trp46, Asp108, Ser196, and Asp198 in PotC were found to be involved in the interaction with PotD. Leu110 and Tyr261 in PotB and Asp108, Asp198, and Asp199 in PotC were involved in the recognition of spermidine, and Trp100 and Tyr261 in PotB and Asp108, Glu169, and Asp198 in PotC were involved in ATPase activity of PotA. Accordingly, Trp100 in PotB was involved in both PotD recognition and ATPase activity, Leu110 in PotB was involved in both PotD and spermidine recognition, and Tyr261 in PotB was involved in both spermidine recognition and ATPase activity. Asp108 and Asp198 in PotC were involved in PotD and spermidine recognition as well as ATPase activity. These results suggest that spermidine passage from PotD to the cytoplasm is coupled to the ATPase activity of PotA through a structural change of PotA by its ATPase activity. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation (1Cohen S.S. A Guide to Polyamines.

With regard to transport, we characterized three polyamine transport systems in Escherichia coli (5Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Plant Physiol.

Those were the spermidine-preferential and putrescine-specific uptake systems, which belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette transporters (8Eitinger, T., Rodionov, D. A., Grote, M., Schneider, E. (2010) FEMS Microbiol. Rev., in press.Google Scholar), and a protein, PotE, involved in the excretion of putrescine by a putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity. We also examined the properties of CadB, which is a cadaverine-lysine antiporter, and found that both PotE and CadB play important roles for cell growth at acidic pH (9Soksawatmaekhin W. Kuraishi A. Sakata K. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that a new putrescine uptake protein, PuuP, functions when putrescine is used as an energy source (10Kurihara S. Oda S. Kato K. Kim H.G. Koyanagi T. Kumagai H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4602-4608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Two uptake systems (spermidine-preferential, PotABCD, and putrescine-specific, PotFGHI) consist of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (PotD or PotF), two transmembrane proteins (PotB and C or PotH and I), and a membrane-associated ATPase (PotA or PotG) (5Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2010; 48: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the two substrate-binding proteins (PotD and PotF) have been determined (11Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol.

Each consists of two domains with an alternating β-α-β topology, similar to other periplasmic binding proteins (13Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A.

The polyamine binding site lies in a cleft between the two domains as determined by crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis (11Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K.

We also purified a membrane-associated ATPase (PotA) of the spermidine-preferential uptake system, and some properties of PotA, including the existence of an ATP-binding site in the NH2 terminus, have been determined (16Kashiwagi K. Endo H. Kobayashi H. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25377-25382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of HisP (17Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and MalK (18Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Müller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), membrane-associated ATPases of the histidine and maltose uptake systems, have been determined. The structure of HisP was very similar to that of the NH2-terminal domain of MalK (17Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 18Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Müller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but HisP (258 amino acid residues) was smaller than MalK (372 amino acid residues), and MalK had an extra domain in the COOH terminus. It has been reported that the COOH terminus of MalK was critical for negative regulation of the mal operon (19Kühnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found that a mutant (E306K) of the COOH terminus of MalK affects its ATPase activity, suggesting a role for this region in the ATPase activity (20Hunke S. Landmesser H. Schneider E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PotA (378 amino acid residues) was also expected to have an extra COOH-terminal domain, similar to that in MalK. We found that the NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–250) was involved in the recognition of ATP and in the interactions of PotA with a second PotA subunit and with PotB and PotC. The COOH-terminal domain (residues 251–378) of PotA contained a site that regulates ATPase activity and a site involved in the spermidine inhibition of ATPase activity (7Kashiwagi K. Innami A. Zenda R. Tomitori H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, we tried to identify the amino acids of PotB and PotC involved in spermidine transport by random and site-directed mutagenesis and determined the functions of individual amino acid involved in spermidine transport. A polyamine-requiring mutant, E. coli MA261 (speB speC serA thr leu thi) (21Cunningham-Rundles S. Maas W.K. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 791-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was generously provided by W. K. Maas, New York University School of Medicine. E. coli MA261 potB::Km was prepared from E. coli MA261 as described previously (22Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was grown in medium A in the absence of polyamines (23Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another polyamine-requiring mutant, E. coli DR112 (speA speB thi) (24Linderoth N. Morris D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), generously provided by D. R.

Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An ornithine deficiency in DR112 was achieved by the addition of 1 mg of arginine/ml to the medium. A proton-translocating ATPase mutant, JM105atp−, was prepared as described previously (7Kashiwagi K. Innami A. Zenda R. Tomitori H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and grown in an 18-amino acid-supplemented medium containing 1% glucose (26Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J.

Ogura, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, were also grown in an 18-amino acid-supplemented medium containing 1% glucose (26Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3131-3135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A low copy number plasmid pMW119 (Nippon Gene) (29Yamaguchi K. Masamune Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and HindIII. The termini were made blunt-ended with a Klenow fragment and religated, and as a result the BamHI- and HindIII-recognized sequence disappeared from the plasmid. Then, the plasmid was digested with KpnI and Cfr9I, and the 5.5-kbp KpnI and Cfr9I fragment from pPT104 (23Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted (pMWpotABCD, 9.7 kbp). The plasmid was further digested with KpnI and Bpu1102I, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, and religated. The pMWpotABCD thus obtained was 8.5 kbp and used for the experiment in this study. Transformation of E. coli cells with pMWpotABCD was carried out as described by Maniatis et al. (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 250-251Google Scholar). Appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin) were added during the culture of E. coli-containing pMWpotABCD. Random mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based strategy (31Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To obtain 1.2 kbp of mutated potB and potC genes, PCR was performed using 5′-GAGCAAGAGGGCACGCCGCG-3′ and 5′-CCGATAAGCGTACAAAACGTCGCCGAAAAC-3′ as the 5′- and 3′-primers for potB, and 5′-TATTGCCGGATCCCTGCTGGTGATGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-TCACGGGCATTGTCGGTCAAC-3′ as the 5′- and 3′-primers for potC. The first cycle was carried out in the presence of a 200 μm concentration each of three dNTPs and a 0.5 μm concentration of the fourth dNTP, with a 200 μm concentration of the fourth dNTP added in the subsequent 24 cycles. Four separate reaction mixtures (with dA, dC, dG, and dT, each at low concentrations in the first cycle) were combined, purified, and digested with XbaI and SalI for potB gene and with SalI and BamHI for potC gene. The digested fragments were inserted to the same restriction sites of pMWpotABCD. The mutated potABCD was transformed to E. coli MA261 potB::Km, and mutants were selected judging from low activity of spermidine uptake. Site-directed mutagenesis of Asp to Asn, Glu to Gln, and Trp and Tyr to Leu on potB and potC genes was carried out with the QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A list of oligonucleotide primers for mutagenesis has not been included but is available from the authors upon request. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a CEQ8000 DNA genetic analysis system (Beckman Coulter). Antibodies against PotA and PotD were prepared as described previously (32Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against PotB and PotC were prepared according to the method of Posnett et al. (33Posnett D.N. McGrath H. Tam J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the multiple antigenic peptides LVYWRASRLLNKKVE, which corresponds to the PotB COOH-terminal peptide, and LIARDKTKGNTGDVK, which corresponds to the PotC COOH-terminal peptide. Rightside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli MA261 potB::Km/pMWpotABCD according to the procedure of Kaback (34Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of lysozyme was decreased from 500 to 50 μg/ml. For Western blot analysis of PotA, PotB, PotC, and PotD proteins, rightside-out membrane vesicles (10 μg of protein for PotA and PotD, and 30 μg of protein for PotB and PotC) were separated by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on a 12% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore). The levels of four spermidine uptake proteins were detected with ECL Western blotting reagents (GE Healthcare), except that 0.2% Triton X-100 was used instead of 0.05% Tween 20 (36Nielsen P.J. Manchester K.L. Towbin H. Gordon J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12316-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by a LAS-1000 plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film). Spermidine uptake by intact cells (E. coli MA261 potB::Km/pMWpotABCD) was measured as described previously (37Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 50 μg of protein of intact cells and 10 μm [14C]spermidine as substrate. Incubation was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C. Rightside-out membrane vesicles from E. coli DR112/pACYCpotABC (22Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as described above. PotD protein was purified as described previously (11Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Spermidine uptake by rightside-out membrane vesicles was measured as described above using 100 μg of protein of membrane vesicles and various amounts of PotD protein as shown in the Fig. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli JM105 atp−/pMWpotABCD by French press treatment of the E. coli cells suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, and 10 mm EDTA according to the method of Houng et al. (38Houng H.S. Lynn A.R. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured by the method of Lill et al. (39Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), except that the reaction mixture (0.1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 20–50 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg of protein of inside-out membrane vesicles. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (95 μl), containing buffer 1 (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgSO4, 20 mm ascorbic acid, and 10 μm phenazine methosulfate), 50 μg of protein of rightside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli DR112/pACYCpotABC (22Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 μg of PotD, was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of 200 μm spermidine. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, the reaction mixture was placed on the top of 20% sucrose in buffer 1 containing 10 μm spermidine, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The level of PotD in the precipitate containing rightside-out membrane vesicles was detected by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) as described above. DNA-dependent transcription-translation reactions (41Zubay G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1973; 7: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously (42Higashi K. Kashiwagi K. Taniguchi S. Terui Y. Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9527-9537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with some modifications using an E. coli T7 S30 Extract System for Circular DNA (Promega). A reaction mixture (0.02 ml) contained 0.8 μg of pT7-BCD or pT7-BC (22Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 240 kBq of [35S]methionine (27 TBq/mmol), 0.1 mm each 19 amino acids without methionine, 6 μl of T7 S30 extract, and 8 μl of the attached reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, 5 μl of 20 mm methionine and 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid were added to the reaction mixture. After removal of supernatant, the pellet was dissolved with 25 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and boiled for 2 min. A 20-μl aliquot was used for 15% SDS-PAGE, and fluorography was performed according to the method of Laskey and Mills (43Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3026) Google Scholar). Radioactivity of labeled protein was quantified using a BAS-2000II imaging analyzer (Fuji Film). To determine which amino acids in PotB and PotC are involved in spermidine uptake, PotB and PotC mutants that influence spermidine uptake were isolated by random mutagenesis. In some mutants, it was found that there were two mutations. In that case, individual mutants were constructed, and spermidine uptake was measured. If the activity of the mutant was reduced to <30% or 30–60% of the control, the mutated amino acids were defined as having strong and moderate involvement, respectively, in the activity. E. coli MA261 potB::Km was transformed with the mutant potABCD, and spermidine uptake was measured. As shown in Fig. 1, Leu110 in PotB and Ser196 and Asp198 in PotC were strongly involved in spermidine uptake, and Leu274 in PotB and Leu195 and Tyr211 in PotC were moderately involved. Furthermore, Asp349 and Asp374 in PotA were strongly involved, and Val38 in PotD was moderately involved in spermidine uptake. It is known that polyamines are recognized by proteins through interactions with acidic and aromatic amino acid residues (11Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Vassylyev D.G. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12205-12208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There are 9 aspartic acid, 6 glutamic acid, 6 tryptophan, and 9 tyrosine residues in PotB, and 8 aspartic acid, 4 glutamic acid, 4 tryptophan, and 9 tyrosine residues in PotC. These residues were individually mutated to aspargine, glutamine, and leucine, respectively, and spermidine uptake was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, Trp8, Tyr43, and Trp100 in PotB and Trp46, Asp108, Glu169, Asp198, and Asp199 in PotC were strongly involved in spermidine uptake, and Tyr160 and Glu172 in PotB and Tyr19, Tyr88, Tyr148, Glu160, and Tyr211 in PotC were moderately involved. In contrast, mutation of Tyr261 to Leu in PotB enhanced spermidine uptake activity by 2.4-fold. When the hydropathy profile of the proteins was evaluated, it became apparent that PotB and PotC proteins contained six putative transmembrane-spanning segments linked by hydrophilic segments of variable length (32Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the key amino acids identified by mutagenesis were located either on the cytoplasmic or the periplasmic sides, but not on the transmembrane segments (Fig. 3). The results suggest that interactions between PotA or PotD and the transmembrane proteins PotB and PotC occur on both surfaces of the membrane. We next examined the functions of 11 amino acids in PotB and PotC that are strongly involved in spermidine uptake. The association of PotA, PotB, PotC, and PotD in the membrane was studied by Western blot analysis using rightside-out membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 4, association of the four proteins was only disrupted by the Trp8 mutant in PotB. With the Trp8 mutant, the level of all four proteins, but especially PotB and PotC, on the membrane was low. The results suggest that Trp8 in PotB is important for the insertion of PotB and PotC into the membrane, so that association of PotA and PotD to the membrane was inhibited in the Trp8 mutant. To show the importance of Trp8 for the insertion of PotB and PotC to membrane, Trp8 was mutated to 10 other amino acids, consisting of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, acidic, and basic amino acids. In all mutants, association of PotA and PotD to membrane was strongly inhibited because the insertion of PotB and PotC to membrane was inhibited (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Levels of PotA, B, C, and D proteins in rightside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli cells containing control PotB or Trp8 mutated PotB (A and B) and synthesis of control PotB and Trp8 mutated PotB (C). Western blot analysis was performed as described in the legend of Fig. 4 using rightside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli MA261 potB::Km (A) or protease-deficient cells (B) containing pMWpotABCD or pMW-mutated potABCD. Synthesis of PotB (or Trp8 mutated PotB), PotC, and PotD (or NH2-terminal PotD) in a cell-free system was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (C). WT means normal PotB.

The levels of PotA, B, C, and D on membranes in these mutants did not increase significantly, suggesting that the OmpT, Lon, and FtsH proteases do not influence the membrane expression of PotA, B, C, and D (Fig. 5B). It was determined whether synthesis of PotB and PotC is influenced by mutation of Trp8 in PotB in a cell-free protein synthetic system. As shown in Fig. 5C, synthesis of PotB and PotC was nearly equal in both wild type and Trp8-mutated PotB, and synthesis of PotB and PotC was very low compared with synthesis of PotD in both cell-free systems synthesizing normal and Trp8-mutated PotB. These results suggest that synthesis of PotB and PotC may be partially coupled with the insertion of PotB and PotC, and the insertion of PotB and PotC to membrane is inhibited in the Trp8-mutated PotB. The Km and Vmax values were then determined in the 10 mutants of PotB and PotC. As shown in Table 1, the Km value was greatly increased in PotB Leu110 and Tyr261 and PotC Asp108, Asp198, and Asp199 mutants, and Vmax was greatly decreased without significant change of the Km value in PotC Trp46, Glu169, and Ser196 mutants, suggesting that the former is involved in recognition of spermidine and the latter in recognition of the PotD or PotA protein.TABLE 1Km and Vmax values of spermidine uptake activity of PotABCD or PotABCD containing mutated PotB or PotCMutantKmVmaxμmnmol·min·mg proteinWT0.134 ± 0.028.61 ± 0.08PotB-Y43L0.351 ± 0.012.16 ± 0.09PotB-W100L0.150 ± 0.011.55 ± 0.03PotB-L110P>320NDaND, not determined.PotB-Y261L0.520 ± 0.0415.6 ± 0.38PotC-W46L0.102 ± 0.010.74 ± 0.10PotC-D108N>320NDPotC-E169Q0.120 ± 0.020.91 ± 0.01PotC-S196P0.126 ± 0.010.89 ± 0.12PotC-D198N>320NDPotC-D199N>320NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The ATPase activity of PotABC protein complex was determined in the 10 mutants using inside-out membrane vesicles. As shown in Fig. 6A, ATPase activity was greatly decreased in mutants of PotB Trp100 and PotC Asp108, Glu169, and Asp198. A decrease in both the affinity for spermidine and the ATPase activity was observed in mutants of PotC Asp108 and Asp198, suggesting that spermidine movement from PotD to cytoplasm and the structural change of PotB and PotC by PotA ATPase were coupled. At the Tyr261 PotB mutant, ATPase activity was greatly enhanced (Fig. 6B), although the Km value for spermidine increased (see Table 1). Enhancement of spermidine uptake by the PotB Tyr261 mutant is probably due to an increase in ATPase activity. Among 11 PotB and PotC mutants, the function of PotB Tyr43 and PotC Trp46 and Ser196 was not yet identified. These amino acid residues are located on the periplasmic side, and association of PotD with the membrane seems to be weak in these mutants compared with wild type PotB and PotC (see Fig. 4). Thus, association of PotD with the 10 mutants was examined by measuring spermidine uptake activity using rightside-out membrane vesicles with various amounts of PotD. As shown in Fig. 7, association of PotD protein with PotB Y43L and W100L and PotC W46L and S196P was weak compared with association with wild type PotB and PotC. Apparent Kd values of PotD binding to the PotABC complex were 0.7 μm (wild type), 3.4 μm (PotB Y43L), 3.7 μm (PotB W100L), 4.1 μm (PotC W46L), and 5.6 μm (PotC S196P). However, spermidine uptake activity of six other mutants was not recovered even if 10 μm PotD protein was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 7). We next measured the direct binding of PotD to membrane vesicles, i.e. PotB and PotC proteins. As shown in Fig. 8A, PotD binding to membrane vesicles was dependent on the presence of both spermidine and ATP. It was confirmed that spermidine and ATP-dependent PotD binding to the membrane vesicles was weakened in the vesicles containing PotB Y43L and W100L and PotC W46L and S196P mutants. Furthermore, PotD binding was weakened in the presence of spermidine and ATP in vesicles containing PotC D108N mutant, but it was not significantly altered in vesicles containing PotC E169Q and D199N mutants. In the case of PotB L110P and PotC D198N, PotD binding in the absence of spermidine and ATP was greater than that to normal PotB and PotC. These results suggests that PotD may directly bind vesicles containing PotB L110P and PotC D198N mutants in the absence of spermidine and ATP, and release of PotD from these vesicles may be disturbed. The characteristics of the key amino acids are illustrated on a model of the PotABCD spermidine transporter (Fig. 9) following the model of maltose transport system (44Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues (PotB Tyr43 and Leu110 and PotC Trp46, Ser196, Asp198, and Asp199) involved in PotD binding and spermidine recognition during spermidine passage from PotD to cytoplasm are located mainly at the periplasmic side, and those involved in the insertion of PotB and PotC proteins and PotA ATPase (PotB Trp8 and Tyr261 and PotC Asp108 and Glu169) are located mainly at the cytoplasmic side. Amino acid residues involved in both PotD and spermidine recognition as well as PotA ATPase are located in both periplasmic (PotC Asp198) and cytoplasmic (PotC Asp108) sides. The results suggest that spermidine passage from PotD to cytoplasm and PotA ATPase are coupled each other. With regard to ATP-binding cassette transporters, the crystal structures of the maltose (44Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and molybdenum (45Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) transporters in complex with their binding proteins have been resolved. The structure of these two transporters is similar, and it is thought that the structural change for substrate influx is caused by ATPase activity (44Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 45Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P.

The spermidine uptake system comprising PotABCD is one of the ATP-binding cassette tranporters. The structure of PotD, the periplasmic substrate (spermidine)-binding protein, and some properties of PotA, the membrane-bound ATPase have been clarified (7Kashiwagi K. Innami A. Zenda R. Tomitori H.

Thus, the structure-function relationships of the membrane proteins PotB and PotC were studied using mutant PotB and PotC proteins. It was found that Trp8 located in the NH2 terminus of PotB protein is essential for insertion of PotB and PotC into the membrane. Trp cannot be replaced by any other amino acid. Because insertion of PotC was also inhibited by the PotB Trp8 mutant, association between PotB and PotC is probably important for insertion of both proteins. It has been reported that a Trp residue was necessary for correct trafficking of proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) from the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane in COS-7 cells (47Koizume S. Takizawa S. Fujita K. Aida N. Yamashita S. Miyagi Y. Osaka H. Neuroscience. 2006; 141: 1861-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Trp on membrane protein plays important roles for correct arrangement of membrane proteins. Spermidine uptake by PotABCD may be analogous to maltose uptake by the maltose transport system (8Eitinger, T., Rodionov, D. A., Grote, M., Schneider, E. (2010) FEMS Microbiol. Rev., in press.Google Scholar, 44Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 46Oldham M.L. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been reported that EAA loops present in the cytoplasmic loops of MalF and MalG, membrane proteins of the maltose transporter, are important for interaction with ATPase subunit, MalK (48Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 49Daus M.L. Grote M. Müller P. Doebber M. Herrmann A. Steinhoff H.J. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22387-22396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An EAA motif also exists in the cytoplasmic loop of PotB and PotC (see Fig. 3). When Glu172 in PotB and Glu160 in PotC were mutated to Gln, the spermidine transport activity was decreased by about 50%. Thus, the EAA motif in PotB and PotC is important for interaction with PotA. It is thought that PotA dimers interact with PotB and PotC with different angles (see Fig. 9). Thus, the existence of Glu169 in PotC next to the EAA motif is probably important for the interaction of PotA with PotC. We also found that Tyr43 and Leu110 in PotB and Trp46 and Ser196 in PotC, which exist in the periplasmic loop, are important for the interaction with spermidine-binding protein, PotD. It was also found that Val38 and Phe46 in PotD are involved in spermidine uptake (see Fig. 1). The sequence motif at residues 46–54 (FTKETGIKV) of PotD (11Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is highly conserved with residues 53–61 (FEKDTGIKV) of the maltose-binding protein. The results suggest that this region, located at the loop between α1 and βB in PotD, may be important for the interaction with PotB and PotC. Amino acid residues involved in recognition of spermidine were defined as those that influence the Km value for spermidine. They were located either at the periplasmic side (Leu110 in PotB and Asp198 and Asp199 in PotC) or at the cytoplasmic side (Tyr261 in PotB and Asp108 in PotC). Amino acid residues at the periplasmic side may be involved in the release of spermidine from PotD, and those at the cytoplasmic side may be involved in the release of spermidine to the cytoplasm together with ADP (see Fig. 9). With a Tyr261 mutation to Leu in PotB, both spermidine uptake activity and ATPase activity of PotA increased by 2.4-fold, and the Km value for spermidine increased by 3.9-fold. These data support an idea that Tyr261 in PotB is involved in the release of spermidine to the cytoplasm by PotA ATPase. Amino acid residues affecting ATPase activity are also located at both the periplasmic side (Asp198 in PotC) and at cytoplasmic side (Tyr261 in PotB and Asp108 and Glu169 in PotC). A plausible model is one in which the structures of the transmembrane proteins (PotB and PotC) change as a consequence of ATP binding to PotA (see Fig. 9), analogous to the mechanism reported for the maltose uptake system (44Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 46Oldham M.L. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Chem. 2009; 284: 17521-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Asp108 and Asp198 in PotC were involved in both PotD and spermidine recognition as well as PotA ATPase, strongly suggesting that spermidine influx and ATPase are coupled. The results also indicate that these two amino acid residues are key amino acid residues for spermidine uptake by PotABCD because they are involved in all three functions. Unlike maltose binding on the equivalent proteins in the maltose transport system (44Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), a spermidine recognition site on the transmembrane segments of PotB and PotC could not be identified. Thus, our experimental results support the idea that the cytoplasmic side of PotB and PotC is open for binding to the PotD-spermidine complex in the presence of ATP, and the periplasmic side of PotB and PotC is open for the release of spermidine together with hydrolysis of ATP. It has been reported that the NH2-terminal domain (residues 1–250) of PotA contains an active ATPase center and that the COOH-terminal domain (residues 251–378) contains a regulatory site for ATPase activity (7Kashiwagi K. Innami A. Zenda R. Tomitori H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We found that Asp349 and Asp374 in the COOH-terminal domain are involved in spermidine uptake activity (see Fig. 1), indicating that these two aspartic acid residues are involved in regulation of ATPase activity of PotA.

https://openalex.org/W1997133588,"During Ca2+ transport by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, the conformation change of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1PCa2) to ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (E2PCa2) is followed by rapid Ca2+ release into the lumen. Here, we find that in the absence of K+, Ca2+ release occurs considerably faster than E1PCa2 to E2PCa2 conformation change. Therefore, the lumenal Ca2+ release pathway is open to some extent in the K+-free E1PCa2 structure. The Ca2+ affinity of this E1P is as high as that of the unphosphorylated ATPase (E1), indicating the Ca2+ binding sites are not disrupted. Thus, bound K+ stabilizes the E1PCa2 structure with occluded Ca2+, keeping the Ca2+ pathway to the lumen closed. We found previously (Yamasaki, K., Wang, G., Daiho, T., Danko, S., and Suzuki, H. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 29144–29155) that the K+ bound in E2P reduces the Ca2+ affinity essential for achieving the high physiological Ca2+ gradient and to fully open the lumenal Ca2+ gate for rapid Ca2+ release (E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+). These findings show that bound K+ is critical for stabilizing both E1PCa2 and E2P structures, thereby contributing to the structural changes that efficiently couple phosphoenzyme processing and Ca2+ handling.

The ATPase is first activated by the binding of two cytoplasmic Ca2+ ions at the transport sites with a submicromolar high affinity (E2 to E1Ca2, see step 1 in Fig. 1) and then autophosphorylated at Asp351 by ATP to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate (EP) (step 2). This EP is “ADP-sensitive” (E1P) because it is rapidly dephosphorylated by ADP in the reverse reaction. Upon E1P formation, the bound Ca2+ ions are occluded in the transport sites (E1PCa2). Subsequently, E1PCa2 undergoes its isomeric transition to an ADP-insensitive form (E2P), i.e. loss of ADP sensitivity, which results in a large reduction of Ca2+ affinity and opening of the lumenal release gate, i.e. Ca2+ deocclusion and release (steps 3–4). Ca2+ release in step 4 is very rapid, so that an E2PCa2 intermediate state does not accumulate and in fact had never been found until we recently established its existence (10Kato S. Kamidochi M.

The rotation and inclination of the domains result in motions and rearrangements of the transmembrane helices thereby disrupting the Ca2+ sites and opening the lumenal gate.

Despite these findings on the Ca2+ release process and E2P, a possible role for K+ in E1PCa2 has not been explored. The K+ site is situated at the bottom of the P-domain near the cytoplasmic ends of the transmembrane helices. Therefore, the lack of K+ binding might have a serious effect on the stability of the helices and Ca2+ handling in E1PCa2. The E2-E1Ca2 transition is markedly retarded, and its equilibrium is affected by the absence of K+ (31Medda P. Fassold E. Hasselbach W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Lee A.G. Baker K. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Champeil P.

In this study, we explore a possible role of K+ in E1PCa2 especially in regard to Ca2+ occlusion. Results reveal that K+-free E1PCa2 has an open Ca2+ pathway to the lumen. Thus, the Ca2+ binding sites face the lumen, and Ca2+ can be released. The absence of K+ does not reduce the high Ca2+ affinity (Ca2+ site coordination probably unchanged), and yet the cytoplasmic gate is closed, and the lumenal gate is open. These changes probably do not involve large motions of the cytoplasmic domains and transmembrane helices. Therefore, bound K+ likely stabilizes the Ca2+ occluded structure of E1PCa2 by simply keeping the lumenal Ca2+ pathway closed. The structural role of K+ in E1PCa2 is discussed in detail using crystal structures of Ca2+-ATPase with bound K+. SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (34Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site content in the vesicles determined according to Barrabin et al.

SR vesicles were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP as described in the legends to FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6. In the experiments performed in Fig. 2, aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on the HAWP membrane filter (Millipore) and washed continuously with a chasing solution for the periods indicated. At the end of chase, the reaction was terminated by washing with 0.1 m HCl. To determine the amount of E2P in the phosphorylation mixture, the membrane was washed with an ADP solution for 1 s and then with 0.1 m HCl. The membrane was dried, and the radioactivity was measured by digital autoradiography. In FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, total EP was measured by quenching the phosphorylation reaction (in a test tube) with 5% (v/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi, whereas for E2P determination, the reaction was chased with ADP for 1 s and quenched by addition of the trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated proteins were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0 according to Weber and Osborn (36Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography (37Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T.

In the absence of the Ca2+ ionophore, SR vesicles (SRV; 20 μg/ml) were first incubated with 10 μm 45CaCl2 for ∼10 min, and then Ca2+ uptake in a single turnover of EP was initiated by mixing with an equal volume of a solution containing 20 μm ATP and 2 mm EGTA, as described in Fig. 3. After the indicated periods, the reaction was chased with an equal volume of a solution containing 2 mm EGTA without (closed circles) or with (open circles) 2 mm ADP. The mixture was immediately spotted on the membrane and washed for ∼10 s with 1 ml of a 2 mm EGTA solution. The amount of 45Ca2+ on the membrane, i.e. transported into the vesicles and/or remained bound to the ATPase and not released to cytoplasmic side, was normalized to the maximum total amount of EP formed immediately after the addition ATP and EGTA (Fig. 3). In A, the time course obtained with the ADP chase was best described by a single exponential Ca2+ uptake (solid line) with a rate constant of 0.49 s−1 and maximum Ca2+/EP value of 1.26. In B, it was best described by a double exponential (broken line) with a rate constant and maximum Ca2+/EP value of 5.1 s−1 and 0.66 for the fast phase and 0.24 s−1 and 0.98 for the slow phase (but it was not described by a single exponential increase shown by solid line with the rate constant of 1.54 s−1 and maximum value of 1.31). Note also that without the ADP addition, almost of all the bound Ca2+ ions are transported into the vesicles during the ∼10-s EGTA wash because the single turnover of EP is nearly completed in this period (see Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Uptake of site I-bound 45Ca2+ in a single turnover of EP with and without K+.

The total amount of EP (closed circles) and amount of E1P (open circles) were determined as described in Fig. 3. Solid lines show the least squares fit to the Hill equation.

Then, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on the membrane, and the amount of 45Ca2+ specifically bound to the ATPase was determined. Solid lines show the least squares fit to the Hill equation.

Then, the membrane was perfused with a chasing solution for indicated time periods using a rapid filtration apparatus RFS-4 (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). To estimate nonspecific 45Ca2+ binding, the same experiments were done in the presence of 1 μm thapsigargin. Specific 45Ca2+ binding was obtained after subtracting this nonspecific binding. In the experiments performed in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, SR vesicles were incubated with 45Ca2+, and a single turnover of EP was initiated by adding ATP and excess EGTA using the handmade rapid mixing apparatus. After chasing the reaction, the mixture was spotted on the membrane filter and washed for ∼10 s by an EGTA solution, as described in the figure legends. The background level of 45Ca2+ was determined without ATP and subtracted. This background level was <3% of the maximum Ca2+ uptake level. All of the reactions were performed at 4 °C in 7 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.3). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (39Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by the Calcon program. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were produced by the program VMD (40Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase in SR vesicles was phosphorylated with MgATP in the presence of 0.1 m K+, 10 μm Ca2+, and Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (Fig. 2, A and B). The reaction reaches steady state within a few seconds, and almost all of the Ca2+-ATPase is in the ADP-sensitive form of EP (E1P) because of the rate-limiting E1P to E2P transition followed by rapid E2P hydrolysis in the presence of K+ (29Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the reaction was chased with excess EGTA in 0.1 m K+, the amount of EP decreases in a single exponential time course, and the EP during the decay is almost all ADP sensitive (Fig. 2A). The bound Ca2+ decreases concomitantly with E1P decay, i.e. E1PCa2 to E2P transition. The result agrees with the established mechanism that the two Ca2+ ions are occluded in E1PCa2, and Ca2+ release into the lumen occurs very rapidly after the rate-limiting E1PCa2 to E2PCa2 transition, E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+ (11Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Danko S. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2202-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 34429-34447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the EP transition and Ca2+ release are tightly coupled in the presence of K+. Surprisingly, when E1PCa2 formed as above in 0.1 m K+, and A23187 was chased with excess EGTA in the absence of K+, the Ca2+ release is considerably (∼3×) faster than the E1P decay via its transition to E2P (Fig. 2B). The result shows that in the absence of K+, there is an E1P species without bound Ca2+ and that the Ca2+ ions are released from E1PCa2. We found essentially the same results in the presence of choline chloride in place of LiCl without K+ (data not shown). We then examined whether this rapid Ca2+ release from E1PCa2 in the absence of K+ upon the EGTA chase occurs to the lumenal side or cytoplasmic side of the membrane. For this purpose, we performed a 45Ca2+ uptake assay in a single turnover of E1PCa2 in the absence of ionophore, i.e. with sealed SR vesicles. In Fig. 3, for the single turnover of E1PCa2, the Ca2+-ATPase in the vesicles in 10 μm Ca2+ was phosphorylated by a simultaneous addition of [γ-32P]ATP and excess EGTA in either the presence or the absence of 0.1 m K+. Approximately half of the ATPase is phosphorylated rapidly to form E1PCa2 both in the presence and absence of K+, and then EP decays slowly, in contrast to the full phosphorylation achieved without the removal of Ca2+. In sealed vesicles (without A23187), EP decays at the same rate in the presence or absence of K+. In the presence of K+, nearly all EP is E1P (ADP-sensitive), whereas in the absence of K+, E2P increases slowly to ∼20% at ∼2 s of the maximum amount of EP formed immediately after the ATP addition. Then, in Fig. 4 (closed circles), the 45Ca2+ uptake assay during a single turnover of E1PCa2 was performed by membrane filtration with an EGTA chase, i.e. with extensive EGTA washing of the filter for ∼10 s under otherwise the same conditions as in the single turnover of E1PCa2 in Fig. 3. During the ∼10 s of EGTA washing, nearly all EP was dephosphorylated (Fig. 3) as we intended; therefore, all of the bound 45Ca2+ in EP was released even at the first time point (0.1 s after the start when nearly all EP is E1PCa2) either to the cytoplasmic side or lumenal side. If released to the cytoplasmic side, the 45Ca2+ will be lost from the filter by the EGTA wash, and levels will be reduced significantly from the ideal stoichiometry of two Ca2+ ions transported in a single turnover of E1PCa2. However, the results (closed circles) clearly show a maximum uptake of ∼1.7 Ca2+ per EP in 0.1 m K+ and an even higher uptake of 1.8∼1.9 without K+, very close to the ideal stoichiometry. Therefore, during a single turnover, the bound 45Ca2+ ions in E1PCa2 formed in the absence of K+ are not released to the cytoplasmic side but to the lumen. It is concluded that in E1PCa2 without K+, the cytoplasmic gate is closed, but a Ca2+ pathway to the lumen exists. Thus, the Ca2+ binding sites face the lumen. In Fig. 4 (open circles), we assessed at each time point during the single turnover of E1PCa2 the amount of 45Ca2+ remaining on the filter with the vesicles. For this purpose, we chased the reaction with ADP and excess EGTA at each time point, i.e. dephosphorylating to E1Ca2 very rapidly in the reverse reaction and removing 45Ca2+ released to the cytoplasmic side. Both in the presence and absence of K+, at 0.1 s (first time point) immediately after the ATP/EGTA addition, nearly maximum EP is already formed (all E1PCa2, Fig. 3), and all of the bound 45Ca2+ is removed by the ADP chase. Then, in the presence of 0.1 m K+ (A), the ADP-insensitive fraction and the amount of 45Ca2+ released into the lumen increased exponentially due to the forward E1PCa2 decay via its transition to E2P with Ca2+ release as expected from the established transport mechanism. In fact, the time course agreed with that of EP decay via the rate-limiting E1PCa2 to E2P transition (Fig. 3, closed triangles). On the other hand, in the absence of K+ (B), 45Ca2+, and the ADP-insensitive fraction increase very rapidly (within the initial ∼0.5 s) and suddenly slow, showing a clear biphasic time course. The second slow phase occurs at nearly the same rate as the EP decay via the E1P to E2P transition (Fig. 3, open triangles) and the single exponential 45Ca2+ uptake in the presence of K+ (A), i.e. the normal transport process E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+. The initial rapid phase occurs at a significantly faster rate and to a higher extent than in E2P formation (Fig. 3) and therefore cannot be accounted for simply by formation of E2P. Actually, the initial phase is even faster than the Ca2+ release from K+-free E1PCa2 revealed upon excess EGTA addition (without ADP) in A23187 in Fig. 2. The results suggest that, in K+-free E1PCa2, different types of Ca2+ sites are produced in the initial rapid phase; the Ca2+ ions are not released to the cytoplasmic side even upon ADP-induced reverse dephosphorylation. We examined whether the above observed biphasic kinetics revealed by the ADP chase is related to the heterogeneity of the Ca2+ sites I and II in E1Ca2. In E1Ca2, Ca2+ bound at site II is rapidly exchanged with the cytoplasmic Ca2+, and the Ca2+ bound at the deeper site I can be released to the cytoplasm only when site II is vacant (15Toyoshima C.

Therefore, we first labeled site I with 45Ca2+ by exchanging the site II-bound 45Ca2+ with nonradioactive Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1). In Fig. 5B, we clearly observed a biphasic 45Ca2+ increase in the ADP-insensitive fraction in the absence of K+ as in Fig. 4B. The only difference is that, as expected, the total amount of 45Ca2+ uptake (0.8–1.0 Ca2+ per EP) is half of that in Fig. 4 in which both sites I and II are labeled by 45Ca2+. The results show that the heterogeneity of the two Ca2+ sites I and II in E1Ca2 is not related to the biphasic 45Ca2+ increase revealed by the ADP chase in Fig. 4B. Furthermore, we observed a nonsequential release of two Ca2"
