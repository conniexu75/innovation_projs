https://openalex.org/W2017728303,"The widely expressed protein Fas is a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor family which can trigger apoptosis. However, Fas surface expression does not necessarily render cells susceptible to Fas ligand-induced death signals, indicating that inhibitors of the apoptosis-signalling pathway must exist. Here we report the characterization of an inhibitor of apoptosis, designated FLIP (for FLICE-inhibitory protein), which is predominantly expressed in muscle and lymphoid tissues. The short form, FLIPs, contains two death effector domains and is structurally related to the viral FLIP inhibitors of apoptosis, whereas the long form, FLIP(L), contains in addition a caspase-like domain in which the active-centre cysteine residue is substituted by a tyrosine residue. FLIPs and FLIP(L) interact with the adaptor protein FADD and the protease FLICE, and potently inhibit apoptosis induced by all known human death receptors. FLIP(L) is expressed during the early stage of T-cell activation, but disappears when T cells become susceptible to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis. High levels of FLIP(L) protein are also detectable in melanoma cell lines and malignant melanoma tumours. Thus FLIP may be implicated in tissue homeostasis as an important regulator of apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2094579915,"TGFbeta signaling is initiated when the type I receptor phosphorylates the MAD-related protein, Smad2, on C-terminal serine residues. This leads to Smad2 association with Smad4, translocation to the nucleus, and regulation of transcriptional responses. Here we demonstrate that Smad7 is an inhibitor of TGFbeta signaling. Smad7 prevents TGFbeta-dependent formation of Smad2/Smad4 complexes and inhibits the nuclear accumulation of Smad2. Smad7 interacts stably with the activated TGFbeta type I receptor, thereby blocking the association, phosphorylation, and activation of Smad2. Furthermore, mutations in Smad7 that interfere with receptor binding disrupt its inhibitory activity. These studies thus define a novel function for MAD-related proteins as intracellular antagonists of the type I kinase domain of TGFbeta family receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2069013709,"Mutations in the Arabidopsis ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) gene severely limit a plant's response to the gaseous hormone ethylene. ein3 mutants show a loss of ethylene-mediated effects including gene expression, the triple response, cell growth inhibition, and accelerated senescence. EIN3 acts downstream of the histidine kinase ethylene receptor, ETR1, and the Raf-like kinase, CTR1. The EIN3 gene encodes a novel nuclear-localized protein that shares sequence similarity, structural features, and genetic function with three EIN3-LIKE (EIL) proteins. In addition to EIN3, EIL1 or EIL2 were able to complement ein3, suggesting their participation in the ethylene signaling pathway. Overexpression of EIN3 or EIL1 in wild-type or ethylene-insensitive2 plants conferred constitutive ethylene phenotypes, indicating their sufficiency for activation of the pathway in the absence of ethylene."
https://openalex.org/W1883204536,"The ability to acquire and use several languages selectively is a unique and essential human capacity. Here we investigate the fundamental question of how multiple languages are represented in a human brain. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the spatial relationship between native and second languages in the human cortex, and show that within the frontal-lobe language-sensitive regions (Broca's area), second languages acquired in adulthood ('late' bilingual subjects) are spatially separated from native languages. However, when acquired during the early language acquisition stage of development ('early' bilingual subjects), native and second languages tend to be represented in common frontal cortical areas. In both late and early bilingual subjects, the temporal-lobe language-sensitive regions (Wernicke's area) also show effectively little or no separation of activity based on the age of language acquisition. This discovery of language-specific regions in Broca's area advances our understanding of the cortical representation that underlies multiple language functions."
https://openalex.org/W4241091303,"The Fas cell surface receptor induces apoptosis upon receptor oligomerization. We have identified a novel signaling protein, termed Daxx, that binds specifically to the Fas death domain. Overexpression of Daxx enhances Fas-mediated apoptosis and activates the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. A C-terminal portion of Daxx interacts with the Fas death domain, while a different region activates both JNK and apoptosis. The Fas-binding domain of Daxx is a dominant-negative inhibitor of both Fas-induced apoptosis and JNK activation, while the FADD death domain partially inhibits death but not JNK activation. The Daxx apoptotic pathway is sensitive to both Bcl-2 and dominant-negative JNK pathway components and acts cooperatively with the FADD pathway. Thus, Daxx and FADD define two distinct apoptotic pathways downstream of Fas."
https://openalex.org/W2028023732,"We report Ca2(+)-induced release of Ca2+ from mitochondria (mCICR) dependent on transitory opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) operating in a low conductance mode. The Ca2+ fluxes taking place during mCICR are a direct consequence of the mitochondrial depolarization spike (mDPS) caused by PTP opening. Both mDPS and mCICR can propagate from one mitochondrion to another in vitro, generating traveling depolarization and Ca2+ waves. Mitochondria thus appear to be excitable organelles capable of generating and conveying electrical and Ca2+ signals. In living cells, mDPS/mCICR is triggered during IP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization and results in the amplification of the Ca2+ signals primarily emitted from the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2085195718,"The products of the p53 and CBP/p300 genes have been individually implicated in control of cell growth and regulation of transcription. p53 is known to act as a positive and negative regulator of gene expression. Here we show that p53, in both wild-type and mutant conformation, forms a specific protein complex with p300. However, in its wild-type but not mutant conformation, p53 inhibits a promoter containing the DNA-binding sequences for the transcription factor AP1, in a p300-dependent manner. p300 stimulates the transcriptional activity of p53 on p53-regulated promoters, and it enhances the responsiveness to a physiological upstream modulator of p53 function, ionizing radiation. A dominant negative form of p300 prevents transcriptional activation by p53, and it counteracts p53-mediated G1 arrest and apoptosis. The data implicate p300 as an important component of p53-signaling, thus providing new insight into the mechanisms of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1911278511,"Genetic redundancy means that two or more genes are performing the same function and that inactivation of one of these genes has little or no effect on the biological phenotype. Redundancy seems to be widespread in genomes of higher organisms. Examples of apparently redundant genes come from numerous studies of developmental biology, immunology, neurobiology and the cell cycle. Yet there is a problem: genes encoding functional proteins must be under selection pressure. If a gene was truly redundant then it would not be protected against the accumulation of deleterious mutations. A widespread view is therefore that such redundancy cannot be evolutionarily stable. Here we develop a simple genetic model to analyse selection pressures acting on redundant genes. We present four cases that can explain why genetic redundancy is common. In three cases, redundancy is even evolutionarily stable. Our theory provides a framework for exploring the evolution of genetic organization."
https://openalex.org/W2045947221,"Cell–cell communication at anterior/posterior compartment borders in Drosophila involves Hedgehog (Hh), a protein secreted by posterior cells, and Cubitus interruptus (Ci), a protein in the Hh response pathway in anterior cells. Although Ci is thought to have roles as a transcription factor repressing hh expression and activating target genes, it localizes in the cytoplasm of anterior cells. We report here the identification of a domain that tethers Ci in the cytoplasm and show that in some anterior cells, Ci is cleaved to generate a form that lacks the tethering domain. This form translocates to the nucleus where it represses hh and other target genes. Hh inhibits proteolysis of Ci, and we suggest that this inhibition leads to the observed patterns of expression of key target genes at the compartment border."
https://openalex.org/W2065388713,"Mice lacking functional IL-7 or IL-7Rα genes are severely deficient in developing thymocytes, T cells, and B cells. IL-7 and IL-7 receptor functions are believed to result in lymphoid cell proliferation and cell maturation, implying signal transduction pathways directly involved in mitogenesis and elaboration of developmentally specific new gene programs. Here, we show that enforced expression of the bcl-2 gene in T-lymphoid cells (by crossing in the Eμ-bcl-2 transgene) in IL-7Rα-deficient mice results in a significant restoration of thymic positive selection and T cell numbers and function. We propose cell survival signals to be the principal function of IL-7R engagement in thymic and T cell development."
https://openalex.org/W1571689838,"Glutamate, the neurotransmitter at most excitatory synapses in the brain, activates a variety of receptor subtypes that can broadly be divided into ionotropic (ligand-gated ion channels) and metabotropic (G-protein-coupled) receptors. Ionotropic receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission, and based on pharmacological and molecular biological studies are divided into NMDA and non-NMDA subtypes. The non-NMDA receptor group is further divided into AMPA and kainate subtypes1. Virtually all fast excitatory postsynaptic currents studied so far in the central nervous system are mediated by the AMPA and NMDA subtypes of receptors. Surprisingly, despite extensive analysis of their structure, biophysical properties and anatomical distribution, a synaptic role for kainate receptors in the brain has not been found2. Here we report that repetitive activation of the hippocampal mossy fibre pathway, which is associated with high-affinity kainate binding3 and many of the kainate receptor subtypes4,5,6,7,8, generates a slow excitatory synaptic current with all of the properties expected of a kainate receptor. This activity-dependent synaptic current greatly augments the excitatory drive of CA3 pyramidal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085555998,"Signals from cytokine and antigen receptors play crucial roles during lymphocyte development. Mice lacking interleukin-7 receptor are lymphopenic, due to a defect in cell expansion at an early stage of differentiation, and the few mature T cells that develop in IL-7R−/− animals are functionally impaired. Both defects were rescued completely by overexpression of the anti- apoptosis protein Bcl-2. T cell progenitors lacking antigen receptor molecules are also blocked in differentiation and die, presumably because they fail to receive a positive signal via their pre-T cell receptor. Surprisingly, Bcl-2 did not promote survival or differentiation of T cells in rag-1−/− mice. These results provide evidence that blocking apoptosis is the essential function of IL-7R during differentiation and activation of T lymphocytes and that pre-TCR signaling blocks a pathway to apoptosis that is insensitive to Bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W1662963035,"The Smad4/DPC4 tumour suppressor is inactivated in nearly half of pancreatic carcinomas and to a lesser extent in a variety of other cancers. Smad4/DPC4, and the related tumour suppressor Smad2, belong to the SMAD family of proteins that mediate signalling by the TGF-beta/activin/BMP-2/4 cytokine superfamily from receptor Ser/Thr protein kinases at the cell surface to the nucleus. SMAD proteins, which are phosphorylated by the activated receptor, propagate the signal, in part, through homo- and hetero-oligomeric interactions. Smad4/DPC4 plays a central role as it is the shared hetero-oligomerization partner of the other SMADs. The conserved carboxy-terminal domains of SMADs are sufficient for inducing most of the ligand-specific effects, and are the primary targets of tumorigenic inactivation. We now describe the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the Smad4/DPC4 tumour suppressor, determined at 2.5 A resolution. The structure reveals that the Smad4/DPC4 CTD forms a crystallographic trimer through a conserved protein-protein interface, to which the majority of the tumour-derived missense mutations map. These mutations disrupt homo-oligomerization in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the trimeric assembly of the Smad4/DPC4 CTD is critical for signalling and is disrupted by tumorigenic mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1539711621,"The ability of actin filaments to function in cell morphogenesis and motility is coupled to their capacity for rapid assembly and disassembly. Because disassembly in vitro is much slower than in vivo, cellular factors that stimulate disassembly have long been assumed to exist. Although numerous proteins can affect actin dynamics in vitro, demonstration of in vivo relevance of these effects has not been achieved. We have used genetics and an actin-inhibitor in yeast to demonstrate that rapid cycles of actin assembly and disassembly depend on the small actin-binding protein cofilin, and that cofilin stimulates filament disassembly. These results may explain why cofilin is ubiquitous in eukaryotes and is essential for viability in every organism in which its function has been tested genetically. Magnitudes of disassembly defects in cofilin mutants in vivo were found to be correlated closely with the magnitudes of disassembly defects observed in vitro, supporting our conclusions. Furthermore, these cofilin mutants provided an opportunity to distinguish in living cells those actin functions that depend specifically on filament turnover (endocytosis) from those that do not (cortical actin patch motility)."
https://openalex.org/W1528145391,"At least two distinct ATPases, NSF and p97, are known to be involved in the heterotypic fusion of transport vesicles with their target membranes and the homotypic fusion of membrane compartments1. The NSF-mediated fusion pathway is the best characterized, many of the components having been identified and their functions analysed2,3,4,5,6,7. In contrast, none of the accessory proteins for the p97-mediated fusion pathway has been identified8,9,10. Now we have identified the first such component, a protein of relative molecular mass 47,000 (p47), which forms a tight, stoichiometric complex with cytosolic p97 (one trimer of p47 per hexamer of p97). It is essential for the p97-mediated regrowth of Golgi cisternae from mitotic Golgi fragments, a process restricted to animal cells11. As a homologue of p47 exists in budding yeast, this indicates that it might also be involved in other membrane fusion reactions catalysed by p97, such as karyogamy10."
https://openalex.org/W1662302126,"L-Glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, acts on three classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, named after the agonists AMPA, NMDA and kainate1. AMPA receptors are known to mediate fast synaptic responses and NMDA receptors to mediate slow synaptic responses at most excitatory synapses in the brain2. Kainate receptors are formed from a separate set of genes (GluR5–7, KA-1 and KA-2) and are widely distributed throughout the brain3,4,5,6,7,8. They are implicated in epileptogenesis and cell death9. However, the physiological functions of kainate receptors are not known7. The development of 2,3-benzodiazepine antagonists that are selective for AMPA receptors10 enables kainate receptors to be specifically activated by exogenous ligands, such as kainate11,12,13,14,15,16. Here we demonstrate that high-frequency stimulation of mossy fibres in rat hippocampal slices, in the presence of the highly selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 53655 (1315,) plus NMDA- and GABA-receptor antagonists, activates an inward current in CA3 neurons that has a pharmacology typical of kainate receptors. The finding that kainate receptors can be activated synaptically adds to the diversity of information transfer at glutamatergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1650103539,Limb development requires the formation of a proximal–distal axis perpendicular to the main anterior–posterior and dorsal–ventral body axes. The secreted signalling proteins Decapentaplegic and Wingless act in a concentration-dependent manner to organize the proximal–distal axis. Discrete domains of proximal–distal gene expression are defined by different thresholds of Decapentaplegic and Wingless activities. Subsequent modulation of the relative sizes of these domains by growth of the leg is required to form the mature pattern.
https://openalex.org/W1672956489,"Smad2 and Smad4 are related tumour-suppressor proteins, which, when stimulated by the growth factor TGF-beta, form a complex to inhibit growth. The effector function of Smad2 and Smad4 is located in the conserved carboxy-terminal domain (C domain) of these proteins and is inhibited by the presence of their amino-terminal domains (N domain). This inhibitory function of the N domain is shown here to involve an interaction with the C domain that prevents the association of Smad2 with Smad4. This inhibitory function is increased in tumour-derived forms of Smad2 and 4 that carry a missense mutation in a conserved N domain arginine residue. The mutant N domains have an increased affinity for their respective C domains, inhibit the Smad2-Smad4 interaction, and prevent TGF beta-induced Smad2-Smad4 association and signalling. Whereas mutations in the C domain disrupt the effector function of the Smad proteins, N-domain arginine mutations inhibit SMAD signalling through a gain of autoinhibitory function. Gain of autoinhibitory function is a new mechanism for inactivating tumour suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W2142768220,"The primate retina contains three classes of cones, the L, M and S cones, which respond preferentially to long-, middle- and short-wavelength visible light, respectively. Colour appearance results from neural processing of these cone signals within the retina and the brain. Perceptual experiments have identified three types of neural pathways that represent colour: a red-green pathway that signals differences between L- and M-cone responses; a blue-yellow pathway that signals differences between S-cone responses and a sum of L- and M-cone responses; and a luminance pathway that signals a sum of L- and M-cone responses. It might be expected that there are neurons in the primary visual cortex with response properties that resemble these three perceptual pathways, but attempts to find them have led to inconsistent results. We have therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine responses in the human brain to a large number of colours. In visual cortical areas V1 and V2, the strongest response is to red-green stimuli, and much of this activity is from neurons receiving opposing inputs from L and M cones. A strong response is also seen with blue-yellow stimuli, and this response declines rapidly as the temporal frequency of the stimulus is increased. These responses resemble psychophysical measurements, suggesting that colour signals relevant for perception are encoded in a large population of neurons in areas V1 and V2."
https://openalex.org/W2015430118,"The role of the host plasminogen activation system in transmission of and invasion by Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, was investigated using plasminogen (Plg)-knockout mice. PLG was not detected in spirochetes from unfed ticks, but binding occurred as ticks fed on the host's blood. Plasminogen activators were derived from the host blood meal. PLG was required for efficient dissemination of B. burgdorferi within the tick and for enhancement of spirochetemia in mice but was not critical for transmission and infection. These results provide evidence for a bacterium using a vertebrate protease to disseminate in an invertebrate vector and underscores the interplay among vector, pathogen, and host in promoting the life cycle and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2120398510,"The order Insectivora, including living taxa (lipotyphlans) and archaic fossil forms, is central to the question of higher-level relationships among placental mammals. Beginning with Huxley, it has been argued that insectivores retain many primitive features and are closer to the ancestral stock of mammals than are other living groups. Nevertheless, cladistic analysis suggests that living insectivores, at least, are united by derived anatomical features. Here we analyse DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes and two nuclear genes to examine relationships of insectivores to other mammals. The representative insectivores are not monophyletic in any of our analyses. Rather, golden moles are included in a clade that contains hyraxes, manatees, elephants, elephant shrews and aardvarks. Members of this group are of presumed African origin. This implies that there was an extensive African radiation from a single common ancestor that gave rise to ecologically divergent adaptive types. 12S ribosomal RNA transversions suggest that the base of this radiation occurred during Africa's window of isolation in the Cretaceous period before land connections were developed with Europe in the early Cenozoic era."
https://openalex.org/W2081434136,"The Drosophila retinal-specific protein, TRP (transient receptor potential), is the founding member of a family of store-operated channels (SOCs) conserved from C. elegans to humans. In vitro studies indicate that TRP is a SOC, but that the related retinal protein, TRPL, is constitutively active. In the current work, we report that coexpression of TRP and TRPL leads to a store-operated, outwardly rectifying current distinct from that owing to either TRP or TRPL alone. TRP and TRPL interact directly, indicating that the TRP–TRPL-dependent current is mediated by heteromultimeric association between the two subunits. We propose that the light-activated current in photoreceptor cells is produced by a combination of TRP homo- and TRP–TRPL heteromultimers."
https://openalex.org/W2065577210,"Osteopetrotic (op/op) mice lack functional M-CSF and have depressed levels of macrophages and osteoclasts. We prepared transgenic mice (hMRP8bcl-2) that express human Bcl-2 in monocytes. In vitro hMRP8bcl-2 monocytes do not undergo apoptosis in the absence of serum and M-CSF, while op/op and wild-type monocytes die. These Bcl-2-expressing monocytes spontaneously undergo macrophage differentiation. In vivo, the op/op hMRP8bcl-2 mice show significant replenishment of tissue macrophages. Their long bone osteopetrosis is largely reversed, and extensive medullary hematopoiesis appears in the bone marrow. We propose that M-CSF augments monocyte survival, permitting them to respond to internal and external cues for their differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1596172840,"Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as preproteins on cytosolic polysomes and are subsequently imported into the organelle1,2,3. The mitochondrial outer membrane contains a multisubunit preprotein translocase (Tom) which has receptors on the cytosolic side and a general import pore (GIP) in the membrane. Tom20–Tom22 and Tom70–Tom37 function as import receptors4,5,6,7 with a preference for preproteins that have amino-terminal presequences or internal targeting information, respectively. Tom40 is an essential constituent of the GIP8,9, whereas Tom6 and Tom7 modulate the assembly and dissociation of the Tom machinery10,11. Here we report the identification of Tom5, a small subunit that has a crucial role importing preproteins destined for all four mitochondrial subcompartments. Tom5 has a single membrane anchor and a cytosolic segment with a negative net charge, and accepts preproteins from the receptors and mediates their insertion into the GIP. We conclude that Tom5 represents a functional link between surface receptors and GIP, and is part of an ‘acid chain’5 that guides the stepwise transport of positively charged mitochondrial targeting sequences."

https://openalex.org/W3106340805,"Many human social phenomena, such as cooperation, the growth of settlements, traffic dynamics and pedestrian movement, appear to be accessible to mathematical descriptions that invoke self-organization. Here we develop a model of pedestrian motion to explore the evolution of trails in urban green spaces such as parks. Our aim is to address such questions as what the topological structures of these trail systems are, and whether optimal path systems can be predicted for urban planning. We use an 'active walker' model that takes into account pedestrian motion and orientation and the concomitant feedbacks with the surrounding environment. Such models have previously been applied to the study of complex structure formation in physical, chemical and biological systems. We find that our model is able to reproduce many of the observed large-scale spatial features of trail systems."
https://openalex.org/W1507334568,"Embryogenesis is typically initiated by a series of rapid mitotic divisions that are under maternal genetic control. The switch to zygotic control of embryogenesis at the midblastula transition is accompanied by significant increases in cell-cycle length and gene transcription, and changes in embryo morphology. Here we show that mutations in the grapes (grp) checkpoint 1 kinase homologue in Drosophila block the morphological and biochemical changes that accompany the midblastula transition, lead to a continuation of the maternal cell-cycle programme, and disrupt DNA-replication checkpoint control of cell-cycle progression. The timing of the midblastula transition is controlled by the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm (the nucleocytoplasmic ratio), suggesting that this developmental transition is triggered by titration of a maternal factor by the increasing mass of nuclear material that accumulates during the rapid embryonic mitoses. Our observations support a model for cell-cycle control at the midblastula transition in which titration of a maternal component of the DNA-replication machinery slows DNA synthesis and induces a checkpoint-dependent delay in cell-cycle progression. This delay may allow both completion of S phase and transcription of genes that initiate the switch to zygotic control of embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2073750911,"14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved ubiquitous proteins whose explicit functions have remained elusive. Here, we show that the S. cerevisiae 14-3-3 homologs BMH1 and BMH2 are not essential for viability or mating MAPK cascade signaling, but they are essential for pseudohyphal-development MAPK cascade signaling and other processes. Activated alleles of RAS2 and CDC42 induce pseudohyphal development and FG(TyA)-lacZ signaling in Bmh+ strains but not in ste20 (p65PAK) or bmh1 bmh2 mutant strains. Moreover, Bmh1p and Bmh2p associate with Ste20p in vivo. Three alleles of BMH1 encode proteins defective for FG(TyA)-lacZ signaling and association with Ste20p, yet these alleles complement other 14-3-3 functions. Therefore, the 14-3-3 proteins are specifically required for RAS/MAPK cascade signaling during pseudohyphal development in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2016207825,"Tyrosine kinases of the Src family are regulated via their Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains. The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has previously been shown to bind with high affinity and specificity in vitro to the SH3 domain of Hck, a Src family member expressed primarily in myeloid cells. However, the effect of Nef on Hck activity in living cells is unknown. Here we show that Rat-2 fibroblasts co-expressing Hck and Nef rapidly developed transformed foci, whereas control cells expressing either protein alone did not. Nef formed a stable complex with Hck and stimulated its tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. Mutagenesis of the Nef proline-rich motif essential for SH3 binding completely blocked complex formation, kinase activation, and transformation, indicating that the Nef SH3-binding function is required for its effects on Hck. These results provide direct evidence that SH3 engagement is sufficient to activate a Src family kinasein vivo and suggest that Hck may be activated by Nef in HIV-infected macrophages.

These results provide direct evidence that SH3 engagement is sufficient to activate a Src family kinasein vivo and suggest that Hck may be activated by Nef in HIV-infected macrophages. The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases consists of nine members (Src, Lck, Hck, Fyn, Fgr, Yes, Blk, Lyn, and Yrk) that share common structural features and regulation (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of each kinase contains a signal for myristoylation and in some cases palmitoylation; both lipid modifications are involved in membrane targeting. Adjacent to the N-terminal region is a Src homology (SH3) 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; WT, wild-type; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; WT, wild-type; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. domain consisting of approximately 60 amino acids. SH3 domains bind to target proteins via specific proline-rich sequences that adopt a polyproline type II helical conformation (2Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 828-837Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions mediated by Src kinase SH3 domains contribute to substrate recruitment, subcellular localization, and negative regulation of kinase activity (see below). C-terminal to the SH3 domain is the SH2 domain. Comprised of approximately 100 amino acids, SH2 domains bind tightly to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences. As for SH3 domains, SH2 domains also contribute to negative regulation of kinase activity, subcellular localization, and interaction with signaling partners. The SH2 domain is followed by the kinase domain and a C-terminal tail with a highly conserved tyrosine residue essential to kinase regulation. SH2 and SH3 domains cooperate in the negative regulation of Src family kinase activity (1Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail (Tyr-527 in Src) by the regulatory kinase Csk (5Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) is postulated to promote intramolecular binding to the SH2 domain, contributing to a closed and inactive kinase conformation. A large body of genetic and biochemical evidence supports this model. For example, conversion of the conserved Tyr residue in the tail to Phe or mutation of the SH2 domain results in a constitutively active kinase capable of producing a transformed phenotype in rodent fibroblasts (6Hirai H. Varmus H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 49: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Such mutations presumably interfere with intramolecular SH2-tail interaction. Many studies have shown an essential role for the SH3 domain in the negative regulation of Src family kinase activity as well. Mutants of Src lacking a functional SH3 domain are also resistant to Csk-mediated negative regulation and are often transforming (8Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G.

These findings suggest that interaction of Src kinase SH2 or SH3 domains with target proteins may destabilize the closed conformationin vivo, leading to kinase activation. Such a mechanism may be responsible for the activation of Src kinases following recruitment via their SH2 domains to autophosphorylated growth factor receptors (13Courtneidge S.A. Dhand R. Pilat D.

Whether or not SH3-mediated interaction of Src kinases with target proteins is sufficient to activate the kinase domain in vivo is less clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of SH3 domain engagement on the activity of a Src-related kinase in living cells. Our model system consisted of Hck, a Src family member expressed primarily in macrophages and neutrophils (15Ziegler S.F. Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell.

Nef is essential for the high titer replication of HIV and SIV and for the induction of AIDS-like disease in monkeys (reviewed in Refs. 18Stevenson M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and 19Trono D. Cell. 1995; 82: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that Nef specifically binds to the SH3 domain of Hck in vitro with the highest affinity known for an SH3-mediated interaction (20Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 21Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Nef may represent an excellent probe of Hck SH3 function in vivo. As shown below, co-expression of Nef with Hck in Rat-2 fibroblasts resulted in the appearance of a transformed phenotype that correlated with the SH3-dependent activation of Hck in vivo. These results suggest that interaction of Src family kinases with SH3 ligands may be sufficient to activate Src family kinases in vivo. The Nef gene from HIV isolate SF2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the retroviral vector pSRαMSVtkneo (22Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau R.N. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT), kinase-defective (K269E), and activated (Y501F) forms of human p59 Hck were also subcloned into the same vector. The mutant forms of Hck were generated by a standard polymerase chain reaction-based strategy as described elsewhere (23Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs were used to generate high titer retroviral stocks by co-transfection of 293T cells (24Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar) with an ecotropic packaging vector. Control retroviruses were prepared using the parent vector. For each infection, 2.5 × 104 Rat-2 cells were plated per well in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated with viral stocks in a final volume of 6 ml. To enhance the efficiency of infection, cultures were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 4 h at 18 °C (25Bahnson A.B. Dunigan J.T. Baysal B.E. Mohney T. Atchison R.W. Nimgaonkar M.T. Ball E.D. Barranger J.A. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 54: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Following infection, the virus was replaced with fresh medium, and G418 (400 μg/ml) was added 48 h later. Transformed foci were counted after 2 weeks. To detect Hck-Nef protein complexes, cells were sonicated briefly in 1.0 ml of detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). Clarified supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Hck antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, and 1% sodium deoxycholate). Immunoprecipitates were heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for associated Nef by immunoblotting with anti-Nef monoclonal antibodies (kindly supplied by Dr. James A. Hoxie, University of Pennsylvania). For analysis of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation or protein expression, whole cell lysates were prepared by heating cells directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with anti-Hck monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20; Transduction Laboratories), or anti-Nef monoclonal antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized colorimetrically using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. To determine whether interaction with Nef influences Hck activity under physiological conditions, Rat-2 fibroblasts were co-infected with recombinant retroviruses containing wild-type, activated, or kinase-defective forms of Hck and either a Nef retrovirus or a control virus containing only the bacterial neo resistance marker. After 2 weeks, transformed foci were readily observed in cells expressing wild-type Hck and Nef (Fig. 1 and TableI). In contrast, no transformed foci were observed in cells expressing wild-type Hck or Nef alone. The foci resulting from the co-expression of Nef and Hck were morphologically indistinguishable from those produced by an activated allele of Hck in which the negative regulatory tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail was mutated to phenylalanine (Hck-YF mutant) (Fig. 1). Fewer foci were observed with the co-infected cells relative to the Hck-YF cells (Table I), probably because transformation is dependent upon successful co-infection and expression of both Hck and Nef within the same cell. No transformed foci were observed following co-expression of Nef with a kinase-defective Hck mutant (Hck-KE; Ref. 23Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), demonstrating the requirement for Hck tyrosine kinase activity in the initiation of transformation by Nef. We also observed that the transforming activity of Hck-YF was not detectably affected by co-expression with Nef (TableI), despite the ability of these two proteins to associate in vivo (see below).Table ICo-expression of Nef and Hck results in transformation of Rat-2 fibroblastsRetroviral combinationNumber of foci/platenHck-WT + vector06Hck-KE + vector03Hck YF + vector>503Nef + vector03Hck-WT + Nef17 ± 3.7 (S.E.)6Hck-KE + Nef03Hck YF + Nef>503Hck WT + Nef-PA03Vector alone03Rat-2 cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates and infected with recombinant retroviruses in the combinations shown. Two days after infection, cells were trypsinized and replated in duplicate 60-mm tissue culture dishes in the presence of G418. Transformed foci were counted after 14 days. Open table in a new tab Rat-2 cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates and infected with recombinant retroviruses in the combinations shown. Two days after infection, cells were trypsinized and replated in duplicate 60-mm tissue culture dishes in the presence of G418. Transformed foci were counted after 14 days. To verify that the Nef and Hck proteins were expressed in the transformants as well as the non-transformed control cells, immunoblots were performed on whole cell lysates. As shown in Fig.2, Hck and Nef proteins were readily detected in cells infected with the corresponding retroviruses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Nef and Hck cooperate to induce fibroblast transformation in a Hck kinase-dependent manner. The biological data described above support a model in which Nef binds to the Hck SH3 domain in vivo, leading to activation of the kinase domain and cellular transformation. To test this model, we assessed Hck autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous proteins in lysates from control and transformed cell lines. Cells were lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and tyrosine phosphoproteins were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, transformed cells expressing both Hck and Nef showed several prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. These include an ∼60-kDa phosphoprotein with electrophoretic mobility identical to Hck as well as a second strong band of ∼40 kDa. A nearly identical pattern of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in cells transformed with the activated form of Hck (Hck-YF), including the 40-kDa transformation-related protein. Although we have not identified the endogenous 40-kDa transformation-associated tyrosyl phosphoprotein, immunoblotting experiments indicate that it is not the Src substrates c-Crk, annexin I, or annexin II which are in this molecular mass range (data not shown). None of the untransformed control cell lines showed evidence of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, including cells expressing Nef alone, Hck-WT alone, or cells co-expressing Nef and the kinase-defective Hck mutant. These results show that co-expression with Nef leads to constitutive activation of the Hck tyrosine kinase in living cells. We next investigated whether Nef directly interacts with Hck in vivo. Hck was immunoprecipitated from transformed cells and probed for associated Nef by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.4, Hck-Nef complexes were readily immunoprecipitated from the Rat-2 cells transformed by co-expression of these proteins. Nef also formed stable complexes with the kinase-defective and activated forms of Hck, indicating that the SH3 domains of all three Hck proteins are accessible to Nef. Control experiments show that Nef does not cross-react with the anti-Hck antibody. These experiments provide the first evidence for stable Hck-Nef complexes in intact cells. However, the possibility that the observed complexes form in solution after lysis of the cells cannot be formally ruled out. A final series of experiments investigated the dependence of Hck kinase activation and cellular transformation on the SH3-binding activity of Nef. Hck was co-expressed with a mutant of Nef in which the proline residues at positions 72 and 75 were converted to alanine (Nef-PA mutant) (20Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of these prolines has been shown previously to completely block Nef-SH3 bindingin vitro (20Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies of Nef-SH3 complexes have confirmed that these Nef residues form part of the polyproline type II helix essential for interaction with the SH3 domain (26Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.-S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 27Lee C.-H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Hck with the Nef-PA mutant failed to induce transformation (Fig. 1, Table I), despite strong expression of both proteins in the co-infected cultures (Fig. 5). Furthermore, Nef-PA was unable to stimulate Hck kinase activityin vivo as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous protein, p40 (Fig. 5). In addition, Hck autophosphorylation was not stimulated by this Nef mutant (data not shown). Consistent with previous in vitro work, the Nef-PA mutant was unable to bind to Hck in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5). Taken together, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that Nef binds directly to the SH3 domain of Hck in vivo, leading to Hck tyrosine kinase activation and cellular transformation. Data presented in this report show that engagement of a Src family kinase SH3 domain by a target protein leads to kinase activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate proteins, and cellular transformation. These data provide direct new evidence that SH3 domains contribute to the negative regulation of Src family kinases in vivo. While this manuscript was being prepared for submission, the three-dimensional crystal structures of the inactive, Csk-phosphorylated forms of both c-Src and Hck were reported (28Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 29Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Both structures revealed the anticipated intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and the tyrosine-phosphorylated tail. Unexpectedly, both structures also showed an intramolecular interaction of the SH3 domain with a helical region formed by the linker connecting the SH2 and kinase domains. In light of this new structural information, the most likely mechanistic explanation for our data is that engagement of the SH3 domain by Nef disturbs this intramolecular interaction, releasing the kinase from the inactive, closed state. Such a mechanism implies that SH3-mediated activation can occur in the absence of dephosphorylation of the tail and supports a central role for the SH3 domain in negative regulation. Also supporting this view is the recent observation that Nef can stimulate Hck tyrosine kinase activity in vitro despite the presence of a phosphotyrosine residue in the tail region (30Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). SH3 domains of Src family kinases have been reported to interact with a wide variety of substrate proteins via their SH3 domains (23Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Liu X. Marengere L.E.M. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that binding of a substrate protein to the SH3 domain may be sufficient to stimulate Src tyrosine kinase activity in vivo, possibly inducing substrate phosphorylation. Work presented here is consistent with the notion that Nef, which lacks any known catalytic function, acts by influencing kinases or other signaling pathways within the host cell (reviewed in Ref. 18Stevenson M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Also supporting this hypothesis are previous studies of a variant of SIV that may signal by interacting with Src. However, in contrast to our data, the unusual acutely lethal phenotype of this variant (SIVpbj14; Ref. 34Fultz P.N. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4902-4909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is dependent upon the presence of an SH2 recognition sequence encoded by its Nef gene that is phosphorylated by Src (35Du Z. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskii P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The SIVpbj14 Nef allele was able to transform NIH3T3 cells, although the role of Src activation in the transformation event was not investigated directly (35Du Z. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskii P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). SH2-dependent activation of Src may not be required for HIV Nef function in general, since the SIVpbj14 Nef SH2 recognition motifs that govern its acutely pathogenic properties are not found in the Nef genes of known HIV-1 strains (36Myers G. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1994Google Scholar). We were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Nef in the fibroblasts transformed by co-expression of Hck and Nef, suggesting that SH2 domain interaction is not involved in the activation mechanism (data not shown). Our data show that stimulation of Hck protein-tyrosine kinase activity by HIV-1 Nef is sufficient to produce a transformed phenotype in fibroblasts. Given the strong conservation of proline-rich motifs among various Nef alleles, these data argue that SH3-dependent activation of Src family tyrosine kinases may be a general property of primate lentiviruses. Our results, together with previous reports of the remarkable affinity and specificity of HIV-1 Nef for the Hck SH3 domain (20Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 21Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that Hck may be a relevant target for Nef in macrophages, a major site of Hck expression (15Ziegler S.F.

While the role of macrophages in lentivirus replication and pathogenicity is unclear, recent evidence suggests that macrophage infection is necessary for the pathogenic manifestations of both HIV and SIV infection (reviewed in Ref. 37Balter M. Science. 1996; 274: 1464-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hck is rapidly induced following macrophage activation and has been implicated in multiple signaling events including phagocytosis, Fc receptor signal transduction, integrin signaling, and tumor necrosis factor release (38English B.K.

Tomographic reconstructions of heparin-stripped SPBs reveal a central hexagonally packed layer. Overexpression of Spc42p results in the growth of a similar layer, forming a crystal that encircles the SPB.

https://openalex.org/W1621478112,"The satellites Rhea and Dione orbit within the magnetosphere of Saturn, where they are exposed to particle irradiation from trapped ions. A similar situation applies to the galilean moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, which reside within Jupiter's radiation belts. All of these satellites have surfaces rich in water ice. Laboratory studies of the interaction of charged-particle radiation with water ice predicted the tenuous oxygen atmospheres recently found on Europa and Ganymede. However, theoretical investigations did not anticipate the trapping of significantly larger quantities of O2 within the surface ice. The accumulation of detectable abundances of O3, produced by the action of ultraviolet or charged-particle radiation on O2, was also not predicted before being observed on Ganymede. Here we report the identification of O3 in spectra of the saturnian satellites Rhea and Dione. The presence of trapped O3 is thus no longer unique to Ganymede, suggesting that special circumstances may not be required for its production."

Here we show that the benzodiazepine diazepam can also increase the conductance of GABAA channels activated by low concentrations of GABA (0.5 or 5 microM) in rat cultured hippocampal neurons. Before exposure to diazepam, chloride channels activated by GABA had conductances of 8 to 53pS. Diazepam caused a concentration-dependent and reversible increase in the conductance of these channels towards a maximum conductance of 70-80 pS and the effect was as great as 7-fold in channels of lowest initial conductance. Increasing the conductance of GABAA channels tonically activated by low ambient concentrations of GABA in the extracellular environment may be an important way in which these drugs depress excitation in the central nervous system. That any drug has such a large effect on single channel conductance has not been reported previously and has implications for models of channel structure and conductance."

Lipoic acid is a cofactor required for function of the citric acid cycle (1Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Two key enzyme multienzyme complexes use covalently bound lipoic acid to carry reaction intermediates between the active sites of the complexes. These enzymes are the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) 1The abbreviations used are: PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; KGDC, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; GCV, glycine cleavage enzyme (also called glycine decarboxylase); ACP, acyl carrier protein. that is responsible for the synthesis of the acetyl-CoA needed to prime the cycle and the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDC) that catalyzes the C5 to C4 step of the cycle (2Mattevi A. de Kok A. Perham R.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 877-887Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Covalently attached lipoic acid not only provides substrate channeling between the different active sites of these complexes but also maintains the activated carboxyl group in thioester linkage for delivery to coenzyme A. Covalent attachment of lipoic acid to the E2 subunits of these enzyme complexes is required for activity in vivo. The cofactor is attached via an amide linkage formed between the lipoate carboxyl group and the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue of a well conserved E2 subunit N-terminal domain (2Mattevi A. de Kok A. Perham R.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 877-887Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The first enzyme shown to attach lipoic acid to the lipoyl domains of PDC catalyzes a two-step reaction in which ATP activates lipoic acid to lipoyl-AMP followed by transfer of the lipoyl moiety to the appropriate E2 lysine residue (3Reed L.J.

However, these strains retain the ability to attach endogenously synthesized lipoate to PDC and KGDCin vivo indicating the presence of a second enzyme (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report that this enzyme represents a second class of lipoate attachment enzyme that utilizes the lipoyl thioester of the fatty acid synthetic protein, acyl carrier protein (ACP), as the source of lipoic acid. ACPs are an extensive family of small (70–80 residues) acidic proteins modified by covalent attachment of 4′-phosphopantetheine to a centrally located serine residue. ACPs carry acyl groups via thioester linkage to the 4′-phosphopantetheine sulfhydryl group and were first demonstrated to function in the fatty acid synthetic pathways of bacteria and plants (reviewed in Refs. 9Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the ACPs of fatty acid synthesis have been shown to act as acyl donors in the synthesis of phospholipids (9Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lipid A (11Raetz C.R.H. J.

Hughes C. Science. 1994; 266: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Other ACPs function in the synthesis of polyketide (14McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and polypeptide antibiotics (15Stachelhaus T. Huser A. Marahiel M. Chem.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 681-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and compounds regulating bacteria-plant interactions (17Dénarié J. Debellé F. Promé J.-C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 503-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The reaction we report not only provides a new role in central metabolism for ACP but is an unusual reaction in that an enzyme cofactor (lipoic acid) is first bound by thioester linkage to another cofactor, 4′-phosphopantetheine, the covalently attached prosthetic group of acyl carrier protein. This lipoyl-ACP is then used to donate lipoic acid to the enzyme subunits of PDC, KGDC, and GCV. An alternate way of viewing the reaction is that lipoic acid is transferred from one protein to another. We have also demonstrated the presence of this new lipoate transferase (the formal name is lipoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-protein N-lipoyltransferase) in mitochondria of both plant and fungi thus providing a physiological role for the ACPs reported in mitochondria of mammals (18Runswick M.J.

The E. coli K-12 strains used were derived from JK1 (a spontaneous rpsL mutant of the wild type strain, W3110) by P1vir transductions with selection for internal or closely linked antibiotic resistance determinants. The mutant alleles used are all null alleles (deletions or transposon insertions) (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SWJ39 (lplA) is a tetracycline-sensitive (24Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) derivative of TM134 (lplA::tet) and was transduced with a P1vir stock grown on TM122 to give strain SWJ43 (lplA Δ(aroP-aceF)zca::Tn10). Strain TM122 (Δ(aroP-aceEF) zca::Tn10) and strain SWJ43 were transduced with a P1vir stock grown on KER184 to give strain SWJ46 (lipB::kan Δ(aroP-aceF)zca::Tn10) and strain SWJ58 (lplA lipB Δ(aroP-aceF)zca::Tn10). Strains TM134 (lplA::tet), KER184 (lipB::kan), and TM136 (lplA::tet lipB::kan) were described previously (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mixture of the apo (unmodified) PDC and KGDC complexes was purified from E. coli strain TM136 (lplA::Tn10 lipB::Tn1000dkan) grown on glucose minimal medium supplemented with acetate and succinate (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This strain lacks the ability to attach either lipoate or octanoate to protein, and thus the PDC and KGDC from this strain are not lipoylated and lack activity (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mixed enzyme complexes were purified by differential centrifugation (25Reed L.J. Willms C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 247-265Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When fully lipoylated in vitro the complexes had specific activities of 1.5 and 8.1 units/mg in the PDC and KGDC assays, respectively, where 1 unit is defined as the activity required to reduce 1 μmol of 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide/min at 25 °C. The ligation substrate was 0.2 unit of apoPDC in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.3 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction (50 μl, final volume) also contained 80 μg of lipoyl-ACP and 10–100 μg of extract protein (the extracts were from strains that lacked PDC activity due to deletion of the genes encoding the AceE and AceF subunits). The reactions were incubated for 10–30 min at 37 °C (E. coli) or 25 °C (mitochondrial lysates), then stopped by bringing the volume to 500 μl with 120 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The reactions were then assayed (25Reed L.J. Willms C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 247-265Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) for PDC or KGDC activity in a total volume of 1 ml using 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide as the electron acceptor and either 4 mm pyruvate or 4 mm 2-ketoglutarate as the substrate. The acyl-ACPs and lipoyl-ACP were synthesized with acyl-ACP synthetase (26Shen Z. Fice D. Byers D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) except that in the latter case 0.7 mm lipoic acid was substituted for the fatty acid substrate. E. coli cell extracts were made as described previously (7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria from pea (Pisum sativum cotyledons) and Neurospora crassa were gifts from Wada et al. (21Wada H. Shintani D.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The N-terminal lipoyl domain (L1) of the dihydrolipoyltransacetylase subunit of E. coli PDC was produced in the unmodified form and purified as described previously (27Ali S.T. Moir A.J.G. Ashton P.R. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The gel shift assay was done as described previously (27Ali S.T. Moir A.J.G. Ashton P.R. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TheE. coli biotin domain protein was the gift of Chapman-Smithet al. (28Chapman-Smith A. Turner D. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The transfer of octanoate was tested by utilizing tritium-labeled octanoate. Octanoyl-ACP was synthesized using [8-3H]octanoate (20 Ci/mmol) and was then used to modify the lipoyl domain using conditions identical to those of the gel shift assay. The reaction products were then subjected to electrophoresis using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the tritium-labeled bands were detected by fluorography. Two assays were used to detect attachment of lipoic acid (lipoylation) to the apo forms of PDC and KGDC. In the first assay lipoic acid attachment was measured by conversion of the inactive apo forms of PDC or KGDC (Fig.1) to the active holo forms whereas the second assay followed the acylation-dependent shift in the electrophoretic mobility of a purified 80-amino acid residue apolipoyl domain from the E. coli PDC (Fig.2 A). The second assay is much less sensitive but has the advantage that it can be used with any acyl donor because the mobility shift is due to loss of the positive charge of the lysine residue. Both assays detected an enzyme activity in E. colicell extracts that catalyzed the transfer of lipoic acid from lipoyl-ACP to lipoyl domains. Moreover, this activity was present in extracts of E. coli lplA null mutants which lack detectable ATP-dependent ligase activity (7Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Green D.E. Morris T. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and2 B), and unlike the ATP-dependent ligase (8Green D.E. Morris T. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) the activity was not inhibited by chelating agents. As anticipated from prior in vivo studies (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) the enzyme was also active with octanoyl-ACP (Fig. 2 C). [3H]Octanoyl-ACP was used to demonstrate direct transfer of the acyl chain from ACP to the lipoyl domain (Fig. 3), and the stoichiometry of the reaction was appropriate (1 mol of octanoyl-ACP was consumed per 1.4 mol of lipoyl domain modified, the discrepancy is attributed to hydrolysis of a portion of the octanoyl-ACP thioester linkages during electrophoresis). Conversion of the apo form of E. coli PDC to the enzymatically active holo forms requires attachment of lipoate to a specific lysine residue of the lipoyl domains (1Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 29Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of apoPDC (Fig. 1) demonstrated accurate modification of the lipoyl domains (activation of KGDC was also readily detected).Figure 2Transfer of lipoic acid from ACP to an apo-lipoyl domain. A, characteristics of the transfer reaction. Extracts of E. coli strain TM134 (lplA) were tested using octanoyl-ACP as the acyl donor (essentially identical results were obtained using lipoyl-ACP). The modification reaction results in increased electrophoretic mobility of the purified domain, whereas omission of cell-free extract or acyl-ACP blocks the mobility shift. EDTA (a potent inhibitor of the LplA ligase (8Green D.E. Morris T. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) failed to inhibit the reaction. B, extracts of E. colistrains having different genotypes were assayed with octanoyl-ACP as the acyl donor. Strains used were JK1 (wild-type), TM134 (lplA), KER184 (lipB), and TM136 (lplA lipB). C, the activities of ACP species acylated with fatty acids of the designated chain lengths (or lipoate) were tested as transferase substrates using an extract of an lplA null mutant strain (TM134). u, unmodified (apo) domain;m, modified domain. The upper band visible in most lanes is the unmodified lipoyl domain as originally purified. Upon storage a part of the purified domain was converted to a faster migrating form presumably by deamidation of one of the three glutamine residues. The two forms of the domain had identical activities as substrates for both the lipoate transferase and LplA ligase (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Transfer of tritium-labeled octanoate from ACP to lipoyl domain. The assays were done as described under “Experimental Procedures” with detection by fluorography.

ACP indicates octanoyl-ACP, and lipoyl domain indicates the octanoylated lipoyl domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gel mobility shift assay was used to determine the chain length specificity of the enzyme. The lipoate transferase was found to be much more active with the C8 acid than with acids of shorter or longer chain lengths (Fig. 2 C). The C7 acid showed some activity, but since odd chain length acids are not present in vivo (9Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the transferase has an appropriate chain length specificity. The enzyme had no detectable activity with octanoyl-CoA (data not shown). Moreover, octanoyl-CoA failed to inhibit domain modification by octanoyl-ACP, indicating that the detergent character of the acyl-CoA could not explain the lack of activity (data not shown). The specificity of the lipoate transferase for the protein acceptor was tested by use of the apo form of the 87-residue biotin-accepting domain of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase (28Chapman-Smith A. Turner D. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although this protein has a structure remarkably similar to the lipoyl domain structure (30Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), upon substitution of the biotin-accepting domain for the lipoyl domain no modification of the biotin acceptor protein was detected by a gel shift assay (28Chapman-Smith A. Turner D. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (data not shown; the biotin domain gave the expected mobility shift upon biotinylation in the presence of E. colibiotin protein ligase, biotin, and ATP). In vivo studies from this laboratory had indicated that E. coli strains having null mutations in bothlplA and a second gene (lipB) were completely defective in the modification of lipoylated proteins (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover,lipB mutants were specifically defective in the attachment of endogenously synthesized octanoate (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These data indicated thatlipB mutants should be deficient in the transferase activity, and this prediction was confirmed. We were unable to detect lipoate transferase activity in extracts of lipB strains (Figs. 1 and 2 B). Introduction of multicopy plasmids in which lipB was appropriately oriented downstream of a variety of powerful promoters gave only small increases in transferase activity. Moreover, in agreement with prior results from this laboratory (31Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we were unable to detect high level expression of a protein having the molecular weight of LipB. Attempted optimization of translational initiation also failed to markedly increase transferase activity. Thus, we attribute our failure to detect a protein matching the LipB sequence to the very low level of lipB expression such that we failed to detect the protein band in our purified preparations (i.e. the visible bands are contaminating proteins). This very low cellular abundance is consistent with the codon bias of lipB and may be characteristic of vitamin attachment enzymes. We expect that lipB encodes an essential component of the lipoate transferase, although it remains possible that LipB is a positive regulator required for expression of the enzyme. We think this latter possibility is remote since other organisms including diverse bacteria and yeast contain DNA sequences that potentially encode proteins closely similar to LipB (data not shown). The sequences of regulatory proteins are seldom conserved among diverse organisms whereas enzymes often show strong sequence conservation. It should be noted that LipB may be only one subunit of a multisubunit transferase. If so, this would account for only modest increases in transferase activity upon introduction of multicopy lipB plasmids. Several laboratories have reported that mitochondria contain ACPs (18Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Chuman L. Brody S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Shintani D.K.

Biochem. 1990; 187: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and nuclear genes encoding ACP-like proteins having mitochondrial targeting sequences have been detected in plants (20Shintani D.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and fungi (32Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The role of these proteins has been a puzzle since the major fatty acid synthetic enzymes reside in other cellular compartments. Since mitochondria contain lipoylated proteins as well as ACP we tested lysates of plant (from pea, P. sativum) and fungal (N. crassa) mitochondria for a lipoate transferase active with lipoyl-ACP. Activity was readily detected in these preparations using either the gel shift assay (data not shown) or the E. coliapoPDC activation assay (Fig. 4). In the latter case we inactivated the endogenous mitochondrial PDCs by addition of ATP. In the presence of ATP an endogenous PDC kinase converts the plant and fungal mitochondrial PDCs to their phosphorylated and inactive forms (33Wieland O.H. Hartmann U. Siess E.A. FEBS Lett. 1972; 27: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Randall D.D. Williams M. Rapp B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 485: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (the kinase has no effect on E. coli PDC). TheN. crassa transferase was also active with octanoyl-ACP. We also used apoPDC activation to test for the presence of lipoyl-ACP in the mitochondrial lysates and detected appreciable levels of endogenous lipoyl donors in both the plant and fungal preparations (Fig. 4). To demonstrate a stronger dependence of the N. crassatransferase activity on added lipoyl-ACP we serially diluted the lysate and proportionally extended the incubation time of each dilution (to compensate for dilution); the rationale being to dilute the endogenous lipoyl-ACP to concentrations at which the transferase could not efficiently bind the endogenous substrate. Under these conditions addition of E. coli lipoyl-ACP gave a 6.6-fold increase in apoPDC activation (data not shown). The endogenous lipoyl donor present in N. crassa lysates may be a better transferase substrate than E. coli lipoyl-ACP, since addition of a low concentration of E. coli lipoyl-ACP (22 μm) decreased the rate of apoPDC activation, presumably through occupation of the transferase active site by the less active E. colilipoyl-ACP substrate. Moreover, E. coli octanoyl-ACP (but not nonacylated ACP) was a potent inhibitor of the endogenous donor-dependent transferase reaction (22 μmgave complete inhibition in the presence of excess apoPDC) consistent with identity of the endogenous donors as lipoyl thioesters of the mitochondrial ACPs. Although lipoic acid attachment is required for activity of several enzymes essential to central metabolism (1Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Mattevi A. de Kok A. Perham R.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 877-887Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and this cofactor is synthesized by most organisms (including plants and probably mammals), the mechanism of lipoic acid synthesis is not understood. Octanoic acid has been shown to be the precursor of the carbon chain (35Parry R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 6464-6466Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but neither the origin nor the mechanism whereby the sulfur atoms are inserted into the hydrocarbon chain are known. Our finding that lipoyl-ACP donates lipoate to PDC suggests that lipoic acid synthesis may proceed through ACP-bound intermediates, the first of which (octanoyl-ACP) is produced by the fatty acid synthetic pathway. The amino acid sequences of PDC and KGDC and of their lipoyl domains are highly conserved throughout biology, and the structures of the lipoyl domains are also highly conserved. This conservation extends to function in that mammalian and plant lipoyl domains are appropriately lipoylated upon expression in E. coli (4Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12932-12936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J.

J. 1993; 289: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose that the lipoate synthetic pathway is also conserved. We suspect that the low rates of de novo fatty acid synthesis reported for isolated mitochondria and mitochondrial lysates (20Shintani D.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Wada H. Shintani D.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1990; 187: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) represents (at least in part) lipoic acid synthesis. Although the lipoylated enzymes, PDC, KGDC, GCV, and the branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex can comprise major fractions of the mitochondrial proteins (e.g. more than one-third of the total plant mitochondrial soluble proteins; Ref. 3Reed L.J. Leach F.R. Koike M. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 123-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these are very large protein assemblies (often larger than ribosomes) with each complex carrying only a few hundred lipoate molecules. Thus, what appears to be a low rate of fatty acid synthesis could readily suffice for synthesis of lipoic acid. Indeed, a major fatty acid chain synthesized by isolated mitochondria is octanoic acid, some of which is found in thioester linkage to the mitochondrial ACPs (21Wada H. Shintani D.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 23Mikolajczyk S. Brody S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wada et al. (21Wada H. Shintani D.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have recently reported that a portion of the octanoic acid synthesized by purified pea and N. crassa mitochondria is covalently attached to the H subunit of GCV, the subunit that normally carries the lipoate cofactor. Since the typical lipoylated enzymes of eucaryotes are located within the mitochondria, we propose that lipoic acid synthesis and attachment proceed within this cellular compartment and that mitochondrial ACP functions as an essential cofactor in this pathway. We thank Drs. H. Wada and J. Ohlrogge for mitochondrial preparations and free exchange of experimental results and Dr. A. Chapman-Smith for the gift of biotin domain."
https://openalex.org/W2107771639,"The site(s) of action of the volatile general anesthetics remain(s) controversial, but evidence in favor of specific protein targets is accumulating. The techniques to measure directly volatile anesthetic binding to proteins are still under development. Further experience with the intrinsic protein fluorescence quenching approach to monitor anesthetic-protein complexation is reported using chloroform. Chloroform quenches the steady-state tryptophan fluorescence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner with aK d = 2.7 ± 0.2 mm. Tryptophan fluorescence lifetime analysis reveals that the majority of the quenching is due to a static mechanism, indicative of anesthetic binding. The ability of chloroform to quench BSA tryptophan fluorescence was decreased markedly in the presence of 50% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, which causes loss of tertiary structural contacts in BSA, indicating that protein conformation is crucial for anesthetic binding. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed no measurable effect of chloroform on the secondary structure of BSA. The results suggest that chloroform binds to subdomains IB and IIA in BSA, each of which contains a single tryptophan. Earlier work has shown that these sites are also occupied by halothane. The present study therefore provides experimental support for the theory that structurally distinct general anesthetics may occupy the same domains on protein targets. The site(s) of action of the volatile general anesthetics remain(s) controversial, but evidence in favor of specific protein targets is accumulating. The techniques to measure directly volatile anesthetic binding to proteins are still under development. Further experience with the intrinsic protein fluorescence quenching approach to monitor anesthetic-protein complexation is reported using chloroform.

The site(s) of action of the volatile general anesthetics remain(s) to be defined. Current consensus favors membrane proteins in the central nervous system which function as ion channels and/or neurotransmitter receptors (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 2Harris R.A. Mihic S.J. Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Machu T.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1454-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this view are the numerous studies demonstrating changes in membrane protein function in the presence of anesthetics. For example, isoflurane converts the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor into a desensitized conformation (3Raines D.E. Rankin S.E. Miller K.W. Anesthesiology. 1995; 82: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and halothane inhibits the (Ca2+/Mg2+)-ATPase activity present in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (4Karon B.S. Geddis L.M. Kutchai H. Thomas D.D. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 936-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, because anesthetics also partition into the lipid portion of biological membranes, functional studies fail to differentiate between direct effects of anesthetics on proteins secondary to bindingversus indirect effects on protein function which follow from alterations in lipid properties. This is a crucial point because changes in both the chemical composition of the lipid bilayer, and its physical properties, are known to alter the activity of a number of membrane proteins (5Lee A.G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, techniques based on 19F NMR spectroscopy (6Dubois B.W. Evers A.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Dubois B.W. Cherian S.F. Evers A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1996; 70: 532-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), photoaffinity labeling (9Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Eckenhoff R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and intrinsic protein fluorescence spectroscopy (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Johansson J.S. Rabanal F. Dutton P.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 56-61PubMed Google Scholar) have been introduced to study directly the binding of volatile general anesthetics to proteins. Using these approaches it has been possible to demonstrate that discrete binding sites for volatile general anesthetics exist on water-soluble proteins. Recent results for photoaffinity labeling of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with halothane suggest that such sites are also present on membrane proteins (13Eckenhoff R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A long held assumption in the anesthetic mechanisms field has been that a single site exists in the central nervous system which is the relevant site of action of the structurally diverse general anesthetics (14Taheri S. Halsey M.J. Liu J. Eger E.I. Koblin D.D. Laster M.J. Anesth. Analg. 1991; 72: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). No direct binding studies have addressed this issue. Indirect evidence has been obtained using both functional and competition binding studies on model systems. Thus, Franks and Lieb (15Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) showed that a number of anesthetics, ranging from halogenated alkanes and ethers to n-alkanes, alter the activity of firefly luciferase, apparently by competing for the same site on the enzyme which normally binds the substrate luciferin. In addition, competition studies on anesthetic binding to serum albumin using 19F NMR spectroscopy (7Dubois B.W. Cherian S.F. Evers A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6478-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), photoaffinity labeling (9Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and fluorescence spectroscopy (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) suggest that different volatile anesthetics may bind to the same site(s) on certain proteins. However, competitive binding displayed by different ligands may result from allosteric effects, whereby binding of ligand A at a certain site causes a conformational change in the protein such that binding of ligand B at a separate site is altered (16Miles J.L. Morey E. Crain F. Gross S. San Julian J. Canady W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1319-1322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the observations on halothane binding to proteins as monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching are extended to include the volatile general anesthetic chloroform. The approach used allows direct monitoring of anesthetic binding to the protein and, in addition, provides information about the location of the anesthetic in the protein matrix. The results indicate that chloroform occupies the same binding site on this model mammalian protein as does halothane. Chloroform (high performance liquid chromatography grade) was obtained from Fisher Scientific. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; HSA, human serum albumin. fatty acid-free human serum albumin (HSA), myoglobin (from horse skeletal muscle), and l-tryptophan were purchased from Sigma. Hexane and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (NMR grade) were from Aldrich. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The buffer used for all fluorescence experimentation was 130 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Proteins were equilibrated with chloroform (final concentration 35 mm) in gas-tight Hamilton (Reno, NV) syringes. Chloroform-equilibrated protein was diluted with predetermined volumes of plain protein (treated in the same manner) to achieve the final anesthetic concentrations shown in the figures. BSA and HSA were used without further purification (purity > 96% by electrophoresis). There are two tryptophans in BSA, at positions 134 and 212. Trp-134 is thought to be more solvent-exposed than is Trp-212 (17Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). HSA has a single Trp-214. Protein concentrations were determined as described (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed with a spectrophotometer F-4500 (Hitachi, Danbury, CT). Tryptophan was excited at 295 nm and emission spectra recorded with peaks at 344 nm for BSA and 342 nm for HSA at pH 7.0. This excitation wavelength minimizes radiationless energy transfer from tyrosine residues. A 10-mm path length quartz cell with a Teflon stopper was used. Care was taken to avoid the presence of significant air pockets. The cuvette was placed in a thermostatically controlled cell holder with a temperature of 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. Both excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm. Chloroform was determined to have an extinction coefficient at 200 nm of 150m−1·cm−1 (data not shown), so inner filter effects were negligible. Steady-state fluorescence intensity data were fitted to the equation F=1−((Qmax∗[chloroform])/(Kd+[chloroform]))Equation 1 where F is fluorescence intensity,Q max is the maximum fluorescence that can be quenched, and K d is the dissociation constant for the binding of anesthetic to albumin, as described previously (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fluorescence decay kinetics were measured on a K2 multifrequency cross-correlation phase and modulation spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). Albumin solutions in Teflon-stoppered 5-mm path length quartz cells, with varying concentrations of chloroform, were excited at 295 nm with a 4-nm bandwidth, at room temperature. Emitted photons passed through a 308-nm cut-on filter, followed by a polarizer set at the magic angle (55°) to the vertical to minimize the effect of rotational diffusion. A glycogen solution served as the scattered excitation light reference. Fluorescence lifetime data were obtained and analyzed at 20 modulation frequencies (1–300 MHz) using 0.2° and 0.004° standard error limits for phase and modulation, respectively. ISS software was used for both the acquisition (ISSL) and analysis (ISS187) of the fluorescence decay data. The fluorescence decay intensity at timet, I(t), was analyzed as a sum of exponentials: I(t) = Σi α i exp(−t/τ i), where τ i is the lifetime, and α i is the fractional intensity, of the ith decay component (18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar, 19Beechem J.M. Brandt L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Global χ2 minimization was used as a criterion for the goodness of fit of the applied model to the experimental values. A reduced χ2 value less than 1.3 was regarded as an acceptable description of the data (20Lakowicz J.R. Laczko G. Cherek H. Gratton E. Limkeman M. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 463-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 21Gratton E. Limkeman M. Lakowicz J.R. Maliwal B.P. Cherek H. Laczko G. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 479-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The fluorescence lifetime standardp-terphenyl in aerated ethanol was used to evaluate instrument performance, yielding a τ = 1.06 ± 0.02 ns (n = 4), in good agreement with the accepted value (18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded on a model 62 DS Spectropolarimeter (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ). BSA (1.0 μm) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 was equilibrated with chloroform in gas-tight Hamilton syringes. A 1-mm path length quartz cell with a Teflon stopper was used. The cell holder was temperature-controlled at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The bandwidth was 1.00 nm, with a scan step of 0.5 nm and an average scan time of 3.0 s. Buffer concentrations of chloroform were determined using gas chromatography on an HP 6890 series instrument (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE). Aliquots (100 μl) of chloroform-equilibrated protein solutions were added to 2.0 ml of hexane in 5.0-ml glass tubes with Teflon stoppers. Samples (3 μl) of chloroform in hexane were injected into a 30-m 5% phenyl-substituted methylpolysiloxane column (internal diameter of 0.32 mm), using nitrogen carrier gas at a flow rate of 188 ml/min. The oven temperature was 80 °C, with the electron capture detector operating at 350 °C. Best fit curves were generated with the KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA) program. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Data points are the averages of at least three experiments conducted with separate samples. Fig. 1 shows fluorescence emission spectra for BSA in the presence of increasing concentrations of chloroform. Chloroform causes a decrease in the protein tryptophan fluorescence quantum yield. A slight blue shift (2 nm at 10.5 mm chloroform) in the emission wavelength maximum (344 nm for uncomplexed protein) was observed, suggesting that binding of the anesthetic is associated with changes in the dielectric environment of at least one of the two indole rings in BSA. Fig. 2 a shows that coequilibration of chloroform with BSA at pH 7.0 causes a concentration-dependent decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The line through the data points is a best fit curve derived using Equation 1. The K d = 2.7 ± 0.2 mm, with a Q max = 1.01 ± 0.02, implying that the fluorescence of both tryptophan residues in BSA is effectively quenched. The free energy of this interaction (ΔG° = RTlnK d, molar standard state) at 25 °C is −3.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, or equivalent to up to three conventional hydrogen bonds (22Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P.

Trifluoroethanol negates the hydrophobic interactions that are in part responsible for the native folded state of proteins (24Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while maintaining secondary structure (25Jasanoff A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 26Gibney B.R. Johansson J.S. Rabanal F. Skalicky J.J. Wand A.J. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 b shows that there is a significant decrease in the amount of quenching of BSA tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol compared with that at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2 a). The diminished quenching of partially unfolded BSA tryptophan fluorescence suggests that tertiary structural features are crucial for creating suitable binding sites for chloroform on a protein target. The effect of chloroform on free l-tryptophan fluorescence at pH 7.0 was assessed (Fig. 2 c). A linear decrease in tryptophan fluorescence was observed with a Q maxof 33 ± 1% (n = 3) at 35 mmchloroform. The slope of this fluorescence quenching corresponds to aK sv = 10.3 ± 0.4m−1 (see Fig. 4). Also shown in Fig. 2 d is the effect of chloroform on myoglobin tryptophan fluorescence at pH 7.0. Myoglobin has two tryptophan residues (27Postnikova G.B. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), at positions 7 and 14, one of which is buried, and the other of which is exposed to the solvent (28Wasylewski Z. Koloczek H. Wasniowska A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Addition of chloroform causes a linear decrease in the intrinsic myoglobin tryptophan fluorescence with lack of saturation over the concentration range studied (up to 35 mm chloroform). At 35 mm chloroform 22 ± 4% (n = 3) of the total tryptophan fluorescence of myoglobin is quenched. This degree of myoglobin fluorescence quenching is somewhat less than that observed with free l-tryptophan, indicating that collisional encounters between chloroform and the protein are the principal mechanism responsible, as opposed to a binding interaction. Fig. 2 a shows that chloroform is able to quench the fluorescence of both of the tryptophan residues in BSA. Trp-134 and Trp-212 are located in subdomains IB and IIA, respectively, of BSA (17Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of at least two chloroform binding sites. To measure the relative affinities of the two chloroform binding sites identified by tryptophan fluorescence quenching in BSA, experiments were carried out with HSA, which contains a single tryptophan at the conserved position 214 (17Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Trp-214 in HSA is analogous to Trp-212 in BSA (17Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the concentration-dependent quenching of HSA and BSA tryptophan fluorescence by added chloroform. Using Equation 1, theK d = 5.6 ± 0.3 mm, and theQ max = 1.01 ± 0.02 for HSA (compared with the K d = 2.7 ± 0.2 mm for BSA). Assuming that the chloroform binding site in the vicinity of Trp-212 in BSA is similar to that in HSA, one can calculate the affinity of the more exposed Trp-134 site for chloroform in BSA. TheK d of the Trp-212 site can be taken as 5.6 ± 0.3 mm and the data in Fig. 2 a fitted to an equation of the form F=1−((0.37∗[chloroform])/(5.6+[chloroform])+(0.63∗[chloroform])/(Kd134+[chloroform]))Equation 2 where chloroform concentrations are expressed in millimolar units; 0.63 and 0.37 are the experimentally determined contributions (17Peters T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar) of each of the two tryptophan residues to the total fluorescence at 344 nm in BSA; and K d 134 is the dissociation constant of the Trp-134 site. Equation 2 allows a value of 1.5 ± 0.1 mm to be calculated for theK d 134 of the more solvent-exposed site. Almost identical χ2 (0.00687versus 0.00732 for one versus two affinity models, respectively) and correlation coefficients (both 0.998) are obtained with both solutions. Because electron transfer (29Steiner R.F. Kirby E.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 30Eberson L. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B Org. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 36: 533-543Crossref Google Scholar) from the excited indole ring to chloroform might be responsible for the observed fluorescence quenching, which would involve free radical production, the reversibility of the protein-anesthetic interaction was examined. Samples of BSA with chloroform (35 mm) were examined fluorometrically and degassed with nitrogen for 45 min, at which time a second tryptophan emission spectrum was obtained. Compared with a control sample of BSA treated in the same manner, the BSA exposed to chloroform and to ultraviolet light, and subsequently degassed, retained 86 ± 4% (n = 5) of its tryptophan fluorescence. This result indicates that the vast majority of the observed fluorescence quenching is reversible. Furthermore, the reversibility means that the observed quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence is not caused by chloroform-induced aggregation, or precipitation, of BSA. As shown in Fig. 2 c, chloroform has a less pronounced quenching effect on free l-tryptophan fluorescence in buffer at pH 7.0 compared with its effect on albumin fluorescence. Experiments were performed in methanol to examine the effect of higher concentrations of chloroform (to 170 mm) on tryptophan fluorescence. This higher concentration range was chosen to approximate the known partitioning of volatile anesthetics into hydrophobic regions of membranes (31Kaufman R.D. Anesthesiology. 1977; 46: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At these high concentrations chloroform quenched free l-tryptophan fluorescence to the same degree as it did BSA tryptophan fluorescence. Fig.4 a presents the data in the form of a Stern-Volmer plot, using the equation F0/F=1+Ksv∗[chloroform]=τ0/τEquation 3 where K sv is the collisional quenching constant, and τ0 and τ are the fluorescence lifetimes of tryptophan in the absence and presence of chloroform, respectively (see below). A K sv = 10.4 ± 0.1m−1 was calculated from the slope of the plot. A linear Stern-Volmer plot can be obtained with either collisional or static quenching (18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Collisional quenching is a diffusion-controlled process that occurs when a quencher molecule is within a certain minimal distance from the fluorophore at the time of excitation. In contrast, static quenching results from the formation of a complex between fluorophore and quencher. To differentiate between these quenching mechanisms, the viscosity of the solvent was increased by adding glycerol. Fig. 4 b shows the Stern-Volmer plot of chloroform quenching of tryptophan in 1:1 (v/v) glycerol:methanol. AK sv = 5.6 ± 0.1m−1 was now determined, confirming the collisional nature of the quenching reaction under these conditions. Fluorescence lifetime analysis was used to differentiate between static and dynamic quenching (32Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) for the case of proteintryptophan fluorescence quenching by chloroform. A static interaction follows association between fluorophore and quencher, as might be expected with a ligand-protein interaction that involves the fluorophore. Global χ2 minimization was achieved using biexponential fits with lifetimes of 0.29 ± 0.12 ns and 6.2 ± 0.1 ns for BSA, and 0.41 ± 0.17 ns and 5.4 ± 0.1 ns for HSA. The duration of the long lived component of tryptophan fluorescence is comparable to the value of 6.1 ns reported by others for BSA (33Steinhardt J. Krijn J. Leidy J.G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Lakowicz J.R. Weber G. Biophys. J. 1980; 32: 591-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the value of 5.4 ns for HSA agrees reasonably well with the 5.9–6.0 ns reported previously (33Steinhardt J. Krijn J. Leidy J.G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The preexponential factor ratio was 1:19 for the short and long lifetimes, respectively, for BSA, and 1:7 for HSA. With a biexponential fit, the global χ2 values were <1.3 for all conditions examined. Assignment of lifetimes in the presence of chloroform revealed that the longer lifetime component decreased by 36 ± 7% at the maximum chloroform concentration (35 mm, Fig. 3 d). As seen in Fig. 3, the fluorescence changes measured under steady-state conditions for BSA and HSA (curves a and b, respectively) far exceed the quenching predicted from changes in lifetime data (curves d and c, respectively). These results indicate that a static mechanism is principally responsible for the observed steady-state fluorescence quenching (especially at the lower anesthetic concentrations), implying that chloroform does indeed bind to albumin. In addition to the proximity of bound chloroform to tryptophan residues, fluorescence quenching might result from structural modifications of BSA upon chloroform binding. Far ultraviolet CD spectroscopy was performed to examine the secondary structure of BSA in the presence of as much as 25 mm chloroform. As shown in Fig. 5, BSA in the absence of chloroform exhibits negative absorption bands with maxima at 222 and 208 nm and a positive band with a maximum at 192 nm, consistent with its highly α-helical secondary structure (36Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2971) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that no measurable effect of chloroform on the CD spectrum of BSA was detected. The present study demonstrates that intrinsic protein tryptophan fluorescence quenching can be used to monitor the binding of the volatile general anesthetic chloroform. This allows calculation of the energetics of complexation and provides an estimate of the location of the anesthetic in the protein matrix. Furthermore, in conjunction with earlier work (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the results indicate that chloroform binds to sites on BSA and HSA which are occupied by halothane. Although prior studies using competition assays have suggested that different volatile anesthetics might bind to the same site on a protein (7Dubois B.W. Cherian S.F. Evers A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6478-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), this is the first such demonstration using a direct approach to monitor complex formation. This indicates that the clefts, grooves, or cavities on albumin are sufficiently large, or flexible, to accommodate both chloroform (molecular volume = 102 Å3 using the characteristic atomic volumes of Abraham and McGowan (37Abraham M.H. McGowan J.C. Chromatographia. 1987; 23: 243-246Crossref Scopus (721) Google Scholar)) and halothane (molecular volume = 123 Å3). This raises the possibility that similar binding domains might also exist on central nervous system proteins that are the actual site(s) of action of the volatile general anesthetics. The decreased binding of chloroform to the partially denatured BSA in the presence of 50% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol compared with the binding to the native pH 7.0 form of BSA indicates that tertiary structural features of the protein are critical for the creation of a suitable binding domain. The importance of tertiary structure for the creation of anesthetic binding sites has been implicated in earlier studies using halothane as the ligand (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Johansson J.S. Rabanal F. Dutton P.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 56-61PubMed Google Scholar, 38Johansson J.S.

J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 417Google Scholar). The CD studies on BSA in the presence of chloroform indicate that anesthetic binding is not associated with substantial structural changes, in agreement with previous results obtained using halothane (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This is in accord with other studies on more conventional ligand-receptor interactions (40Laskowski R.A. Luscombe N.M. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2438-2452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) which demonstrate minor structural changes in proteins following ligand complexation. The experiments with myoglobin further demonstrate that chloroform binding to proteins is conformation-dependent. Myoglobin also contains two tryptophans (27Postnikova G.B. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the environments of the two indole rings in myoglobin apparently do not favor the binding of chloroform with sufficient proximity or concentration to quench tryptophan fluorescence. This agrees well with prior work (11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that failed to show an association between halothane and myoglobin. The high degree of quenching of BSA fluorescence by chloroform follows from the partitioning of the anesthetic into hydrophobic domains in the vicinity of the indole rings. Subdomain IIA (containing Trp-214) is known to bind a number of hydrophobic ligands such as warfarin and bilirubin (42He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3408) Google Scholar). The quenching of free l-tryptophan in methanol in Fig. 4 demonstrates that at sufficiently high concentrations, the degree of fluorescence quenching observed in Fig.2 a for BSA can be attained. This apparent elevated chloroform concentration in the protein matrix is attributed to the favorable energetics of the anesthetic-protein interaction and to steric hindrance to dissociation from the tryptophan residues imposed by the surrounding polypeptide. The fluorescence lifetime studies reveal that chloroform quenches albumin tryptophan fluorescence predominantly via a static mechanism, which indicates that the anesthetic does indeed bind to the protein. The average binding affinity of the two sites on BSA as reported by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching is 2.7 ± 0.2 mm. The more solvent-exposed Trp-134 site apparently has a somewhat higher affinity with a K d = 1.5 ± 0.1 mm. A prior study on the affinity of chloroform for BSA using a competition approach yielded a K i = 1.3 ± 0.1 mm (9Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), in good agreement with the present result. The binding constants determined in the present and the earlier study (9Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) are comparable to the clinical EC50 concentration for chloroform in dogs of 1.2 ± 0.2 mm (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 43Eger E.I. Lundgren C. Miller S.L. Stevens W.C. Anesthesiology. 1969; 30: 129-135PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the anesthetic binding domains on BSA may have structural features that mimic the central nervous system sites of action of the general anesthetics, which remain to be described. Albumin may therefore serve as a readily available mammalian protein model for studying the structural features of anesthetic-protein complexes until further information regarding the in vivosite(s) of action of the volatile general anesthetics becomes available. The mechanism of tryptophan fluorescence quenching by chloroform is unclear but may involve electron transfer (29Steiner R.F. Kirby E.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 30Eberson L. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B Org. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 36: 533-543Crossref Google Scholar) from the excited indole ring to the anesthetic. Whether the same mechanism is operative in the case of tryptophan residues located in different protein environments remains to be determined. In addition, heavy atom perturbation secondary to the chlorine atoms on the anesthetic may play a role, leading to enhanced rates of intersystem crossing (44Cowan D.O. Drisko R.L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 6281-6285Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mechanism is of importance since it may define the proximity of chloroform to the tryptophan residues. It should be noted that anesthetic-induced structural changes in BSA may cause fluorescence quenching by mechanisms that do not involve close contact between tryptophan and chloroform. A variety of chemical groups present in proteins (including histidine, cysteine, proline, arginine, and the peptide bond) are capable of quenching tryptophan fluorescence (29Steiner R.F. Kirby E.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 45Chen Y. Liu B. Yu H.-T. Barkley M.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9271-9278Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar), if structural changes alter their proximity to the indole ring. However, chloroform (up to 25 mm) has no effect on the far ultraviolet CD spectrum of BSA, indicating a lack of major secondary structural changes. This result suggests that chloroform interacts with BSA in a manner that does not involve extensive hydrogen bond disruption. It is, however, not possible to exclude the contribution of more subtle structural changes in the protein to the observed fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the finding that volatile anesthetics reverse the chiral nature of bilirubin binding to the subdomain IIA site (46McDonagh A.F. Pu Y.M. Lightner D.A. Experientia ( Basel ). 1992; 48: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is presumably the result of a local structural change. In summary, the volatile general anesthetic chloroform binds to serum albumin in a saturable and reversible manner at, or close to, the sites occupied by the anesthetic halothane. The results suggest that both Trp-134 and Trp-212 are part of the chloroform binding domains, as reported previously for halothane (10Eckenhoff R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Johansson J.S. Eckenhoff R.G. Dutton P.L. Anesthesiology. 1995; 83: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and represent the highest resolution to which such binding sites for chloroform in BSA have been described. This is the first direct study to demonstrate that different volatile general anesthetics may bind to the same site on a protein in solution, providing experimental support for the hypothesis that these structurally diverse drugs may act at similar sites on proteins in the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1631093856,"Edges are important in the interpretation of the retinal image. Although luminance edges have been studied extensively, much less is known about how or where the primate visual system detects boundaries defined by differences in surface properties such as texture, motion or binocular disparity. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to localize human visual cortical activity related to the processing of one such higher-order edge type: motion boundaries. We describe a robust fMRI signal that is selective for motion segmentation. This boundary-specific signal is present, and retinotopically organized, within early visual areas, beginning in the primary visual cortex (area V1). Surprisingly, it is largely absent from the motion-selective area MT/V5 and far extrastriate visual areas. Changes in the surface velocity defining the motion boundaries affect the strength of the fMRI signal. In parallel psychophysical experiments, the perceptual salience of the boundaries shows a similar dependence on surface velocity. These results demonstrate that information for segmenting scenes by relative motion is represented as early as V1."
https://openalex.org/W1624124226,"Muscle force is generated by myosin crossbridges interacting with actin. As estimated from stiffness1,2 and equatorial X-ray diffraction3 of muscle and muscle fibres, most myosin crossbridges are attached to actin during isometric contraction, but a much smaller fraction is bound stereospecifically4,5,6,7. To determine the fraction of crossbridges contributing to tension and the structural changes that attached crossbridges undergo when generating force, we monitored the X-ray diffraction pattern during temperature-induced tension rise in fully activated permeabilized frog muscle fibres. Temperature jumps8 from 5–6 °C to 16–19 °C initiated a 1.7-fold increase in tension without significantly changing fibre stiffness or the intensities of the (1,1) equatorial and (14.5 nm)−1 meridional X-ray reflections. However, tension rise was accompanied by a 20% decrease in the intensity of the (1,0) equatorial reflection and an increase in the intensity of the first actin layer line by ∼13% of that in rigor. Our results show that muscle force is associated with a transition of the crossbridges from a state in which they are nonspecifically attached to actin to one in which stereospecifically bound myosin crossbridges label the actin helix."
https://openalex.org/W2015285602,"The fungal toxin gliotoxin induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of cells. Apoptosis induced in thymocytes by gliotoxin is rapid, and DNA fragmentation is observable within 4 h treatment. Apoptosis induced by gliotoxin is calcium-independent and unaffected by protein synthesis inhibitors. We have previously shown that gliotoxin results in phosphorylation of a 16.3-kDa protein within 10 min treatment of thymocytes. Here we show that this protein is histone H3 and phosphorylation occurs on Ser-10. Cyclic AMP levels and activity of protein kinase A (PKA) are raised in cells treated with gliotoxin. Apoptosis is inhibited by genistein which also inhibits PKA and histone H3 phosphorylation. Apoptosis is also inhibited by a number of specific inhibitors of PKA suggesting apoptosis induced by gliotoxin is modulated by this kinase. The agents forskolin and cholera toxin do not induce rapid phosphorylation of H3 although some increase in phosphorylation of H3 does occur after 8 h with these agents. Forskolin and cholera toxin also induce apoptosis but over a longer time course than gliotoxin. In all cases levels of apoptosis correlate with degree of H3 phosphorylation. Cells treated with gliotoxin show an early sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion indicating a functional relationship between DNA fragmentation and H3 phosphorylation.

Cells treated with gliotoxin show an early sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion indicating a functional relationship between DNA fragmentation and H3 phosphorylation. Apoptotic cell death is a widely studied phenomenon with implications extending from toxin-induced cell death through immunological control to developmental biology where it is best referred to as programmed cell death (1Kerr J.F.R. Searle J.S. Harmon B.V. Bishop C.J. Potten C.S. Perspectives in Mammalian Cell Death. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1987: 93-128Google Scholar, 2Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev.

Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The biochemical and morphological features of final stage apoptosis are well defined and include condensation of chromatin and DNA fragmentation into large (4Brown D.G. Sun X.-M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3037-3039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and finally nucleosomal size fragments (5Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be induced in cells by a multitude of noxious agents including radiation, hyperthermia, and a plethora of toxins. Different agents result in different initial cellular lesions such as DNA damage or a disturbance in calcium homeostasis. These “private” pathways then presumably converge onto an apoptotic pathway common to all cells. Searches for a common biochemical pathway to apoptosis, while uncovering many possible routes, have yet to yield a signal transduction pathway unique to apoptosis. For example calcium mobilization occurs in many instances of apoptosis but is not universally required for its progression (6McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 7Duke R.C. Witter R.Z. Nash P.B. Young J.D.-E. Ojcius D.M.

It is now clear that activation of proteases plays an important role in apoptotic cell death (9Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2244-2293Crossref Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 10Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and they are proving to be key modulators of apoptosis. Gliotoxin is a fungal metabolite belonging to the epipolythiodioxopiperazine class of secondary metabolites. It has been shown to possess potent immunomodulating properties allowing selective depletion of mature lymphocytes resulting in successful bone marrow transplantation without graft versus host disease in a murine model (11Mullbacher A. Moreland A.F. Waring P. Sjaarda A. Eichner R.D. Transplantation. 1988; 46: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin has also been implicated in the etiology of fungal infections caused by the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus (12Sutton P. Newcombe N.R. Waring P. Mullbacher A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective effects of gliotoxin on immune cells are probably due to the rapid induction of apoptosis in cells treated with gliotoxin together with the relative ease of induction of apoptosis in certain cells of the immune system. Gliotoxin has been shown to induce apoptosis in thymocytes, peripheral lymphocytes, macrophages, and some cell lines such as the mastocytoma cell line P815 (13Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14476-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Waring P. Eichner R.D. Mullbacher A. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18493-18499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Waring P. Egan M. Braithwaite A.W. Mullbacher A. Sjaarda A. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1990; 12: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which gliotoxin induces apoptosis is currently not known. Gliotoxin has been shown to inhibit NFkB, and this would explain its immunosuppressive effects (16Pahl H.L. Kraub B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Traencker E.B.-M. Myers C. Parks T. Waring P. Czernilofsky A.-P. Baeuerle P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis, but this cannot be the property responsible for apoptosis in thymocytes since such cells are protected from apoptosis by protein synthesis inhibitors, at least over the time course examined here. In addition gliotoxin induces apoptosis without any accompanying rise in intracellular calcium in thymocytes (8Beaver J.P. Waring P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 489-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so perturbation of calcium levels is not involved. We have presented evidence that gliotoxin induces early incorporation of labeled thymidine into treated cells and proposed that these cells die by apoptosis after an aborted entry into the cell cycle (17Waring P. Mamchak A. Khan T. Sjaarda A. Sutton P. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). Inappropriate entry into the cell cycle has been shown to be a feature of a number of cells undergoing apoptosis (18Colombel M. Olsson C.A. Ng P. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4313-4319PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rubin L.L. Philpott K.L. Brooks S.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 391-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it is apparent that there may be common features in processes involved in mitosis and apoptosis. For example premature activation of p34 cdc2 can lead to apoptosis (20Shi L. Nishioka W.K. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M. Litchfield D. Greenberg A.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of proteins involved in proliferation are essential control elements in cell cycle progression, and there is increasing evidence that phosphorylation may be important in control of apoptosis as well as normal cell proliferation (21Gjertsen B.T. Doskeland S.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Lavin M.F. Watters D. Song Q. Experientia ( Basel ). 1996; 52: 979-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Histone phosphorylation in particular has been shown to be involved in condensation of chromatin during mitosis (23Th'ng J.P.H. Guo X.-W. Bradbury E.M. Stein G.S. Stein J.B. Molecular and Cellular Approaches to the Control of Proliferation and Differentiation. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 381-407Google Scholar,24Bradbury E. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Here we show that hyperphosphorylation of histone H3 occurs on serine(s) residues within minutes of treatment with gliotoxin and that permeabilized cells at this point are more sensitive to the effect of nucleases. Our results also show that gliotoxin causes a rapid rise in cAMP levels in thymocytes consistent with our results with splenocytes (25Sutton P. Beaver J.P. Waring P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 2009-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) resulting in phosphorylation of H3 at the mitogenic Ser-10 site followed by apoptosis. Using other agents that would be expected to effect cAMP levels, we show that apoptosis correlated with the level of H3 phosphorylation and propose that rapid chromatin phosphorylation may provide a trigger for subsequent DNA dissolution. Thymocytes were harvested from 10-day-old BALB/c mice as described previously (17Waring P. Mamchak A. Khan T. Sjaarda A. Sutton P. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium, F15 (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 5% fetal calf serum. P815 cells were cultured in F15 in 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were treated with gliotoxin at 0.5–1 × 106/ml. Gliotoxin, cycloheximide, genistein, DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, and all protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. Anti-p34 cdc2 kinase was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Propidium iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes. Radiolabeled inorganic phosphate and ATP were purchased from Bresatec. BMCI 1The abbreviations used are: BMCI, 1-n-butylamino-3-methyl-4-cyanoisoquinoline; PKA, protein kinase A; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. was a kind gift from the laboratory of Dr. D. Deady. The PKI-(5–24) peptide was synthesized in the John Curtin School Biomolecular Resources Facility by Kerry McAndrew. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate and resuspended at 2 × 107/ml. Carrier-free 32P- or33P-phosphate was added (20 μCi/2 × 106cells), and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then resuspended in complete medium (F15) at 2 × 106/ml and treated with gliotoxin or other agents for varying times. Cells were then pelleted and the supernatant discarded. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing PMSF (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (60 μg/ml), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) on ice for 30 min. Samples were then treated with standard electrophoresis sample buffers, and electrophoresis was carried out in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels using Bio-Rad equipment. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and run in duplicate lanes. Only one lane is shown in figures which in each case are results from a single experiment and gel. Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using Bio-Rad equipment. Transfer buffer consisted of 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol and transfers were carried out at 75 V, 0.5 A for 60 min at 4 °C. Following autoradiography to locate the bands, the protein band was excised from the membrane. In each case the same area and location of membrane was excised for comparison purposes. The protein was then either sequenced or removed for phosphoamino acid analysis. Sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 477 Protein Sequencer using a standard blot cycle. The first 15 residues were detected, and matching was made using a FASTA/GCG software package (Wisconsin University Biotechnology Center). For amino acid analysis, the membranes were incubated with 300 μl of 6 n constant boiling hydrochloric acid in a heating block at 105°C for 60 min. The sample was then dried in a SpeedieVac®. The residue was dissolved in 5 μl of acetic acid:pyridine:water, 5:0.5:94.5. Electrophoresis was performed in the electrophoresis buffer using Kodak chromatogram cellulose sheets at 1000 V for 60 min. The thin layer chromatography plate was dried and autoradiographed. Cold standards of phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine for comparison were run at the same time and developed using ninhydrin spray. For tryptic digests the portion of the dried gel containing the protein located by autoradiography was excised using a scalpel and rehydrated in 2 ml of doubly distilled water. The paper backing was removed and the gel just covered with 0.2 mNH4HCO3, 50% aqueous acetonitrile and incubated at 30°C for 60 min. The fluid was removed and discarded, and the gel dried under a stream of nitrogen for 40 min. In the gel digestion was accomplished by addition of 10–25 μl of 0.02% Tween 20, 0.2 m NH4HCO3 followed by 25 μg of porcine modified trypsin. Further 0.2 mNH4HCO3 may need to be added to fully hydrate the gel. Incubation is continued overnight followed by incubation in the same volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile for 1–2 h. The supernatant was removed, dried on a SpeedieVac, and rehydrated in a total of 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (formic acid (88%) 50 ml, acetic acid 156 ml, deionized water 1794 ml, pH 1.9). Samples were loaded onto cellulose electrophoresis paper and air-dried, and electrophoresis in one dimension was performed using a Hunter thin layer peptide mapping system (7000). The paper was air-dried and run in the second dimension in n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:acetic acid:water, 1:0.66:0.2:0.8, by volume for 5–6 h. After air drying spots were visualized using autoradiography, scraped, and placed in 50 μl of water with polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight and sequenced from the membrane. Apoptosis was estimated following ethanol fixation and measurement of the subdiploid population using FACS (26Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Holtz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that thymocytes treated with gliotoxin show the classic morphological features of apoptotic cells (8Beaver J.P. Waring P. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 489-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS followed by 3 ml of 90% ethanol. After fixing for 24 h at 4 °C cells were washed three times in PBS and stained with propidium iodide at 40 μg/ml and RNase at 10 μg/ml and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN. Cells with less than the normal subdiploid DNA content were scored as apoptotic. FACS analysis was always consistent with nucleosomal DNA fragmentation as seen on agarose gels (not shown). Cells were prepared for electron microscopy by standard procedures and apoptosis quantified as described previously (27Waring P. Beaver J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). c-AMP was measured as described previously (25Sutton P. Beaver J.P. Waring P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 2009-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using an enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity was assessed by estimating phosphorylation of the peptide Kemptide using the PKA assay kit from Promega. Briefly cells (2 × 106/ml in 2 ml) after treatment were pelleted at 400 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Cells were quickly washed in ice-cold PBS, repelleted, and suspended in 50 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF) and the cell pellet macerated using disposable plastic pestles. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. PKA was estimated by taking 10 μl of this lysate and mixing with PKA assay buffer (200 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA), 10 μl of biotinylated Kemptide (stock solution at 0.5 mm), 10 μl of PBS or 10 μl of 25 μm cAMP (for estimation of maximum PKA), and 10 μl of [γ-33P]ATP (100–200 cpm/pmol ATP) for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction is terminated by adding 25 μl of 7.5m guanidine·HCl. A 25-μl aliquot was removed and spotted on a streptavidin disc, and the discs were washed immediately according to the manufacturer's protocol and counted in a Beckman beta counter. Cells were treated with gliotoxin with or without inhibitors at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 30 min. Cells were pelleted at 4 °C, and 400 μl of permeabilizing buffer per 2 × 106cells was added at 4 °C. Permeabilizing buffer consisted of 9 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm dithiothreitol. 4.5% Dextran 110,000, 1 mm EGTA, 4.5 mmMgCl2, 15 μg/ml digitonin. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min before transfer to FACS tubes. The nuclease was then added at the desired concentrations and the solution made 2 mm in calcium chloride. Tubes were then incubated for 20–30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold PBS, and cells were pelleted and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then washed in PBS and stained with propidium iodide at 40 μg/ml and RNase at 10 μg/ml and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN. After treatment cells were pelleted at 4 °C and lysed for 10 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate containing 5 μg/ml each ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF. Debris was pelleted at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, and the solution was precleared with 30 μl of Santa Cruz A/G agarose secondary antibody. After preclearing, 5 μl of Santa Cruz anti-p34 cdc2 was added, giving a final dilution of 1:100, and incubated on ice for 1 h followed by 30 μl of Santa Cruz A/G agarose and the solution rotated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose was pelleted and washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in HB buffer consisting of 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2. 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. The pellet was suspended in 10 μl of KIN buffer for 20 min. KIN buffer consisted of HB buffer containing 1 mg/ml histone H1 and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP at 10–40 μCi/ml. After 20 min 20 μl of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and run in a 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel using Bio-Rad equipment. The gel was dried and H1 phosphorylation detected by autoradiography. Treatment of thymocytes with gliotoxin at concentrations causing apoptosis has been shown to result in hyperphosphorylation of a 16.3K protein (17Waring P. Mamchak A. Khan T. Sjaarda A. Sutton P. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). No other proteins were observed to undergo the same degree of increased phosphorylation. Fig.1 shows that this phosphorylation occurs rapidly and is detectable within 10 min of gliotoxin treatment. The level of phosphorylation shown in Fig. 1 at 30 min remains unchanged over a period of 2 h. The protein indicated by the arrow had a molecular mass of 16.3 kDa. Similar results were found using 3 μm gliotoxin, but at 100 μm gliotoxin there was no hyperphosphorylation of this protein. In fact at 100 μm gliotoxin phosphorylation generally was greatly reduced (data not shown). Treatment of P815 cells with 1 and 3 μm gliotoxin also resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of the same protein after 60 min as shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Increased phosphorylation of histone H3 by gliotoxin in P815 cells.

The first 15 residues determined were ARTKQTARKXTGGKA (single letter code) matching histone H3 except for residue 10 which could not be determined due to insufficient signal in the sequencing cycle. We also sequenced the band immediately below H3. This protein was an unresolved mixture of histones H2A and H2B. No enhanced phosphorylation of these proteins was observed at any time, and they were used in some experiments as control phosphorylated proteins. Histone H3 was excised, digested, and analyzed for phosphoamino acids. Fig. 3 indicated that enhanced phosphorylation occurs on a serine residue. Increased labeling on threonine or tyrosine was not detected. In gel digestion of the labeled protein after excision followed by two-dimensional peptide mapping showed that most radioactivity was concentrated in a single spot indicated as A in Fig. 4. A second spot marked B with much less radioactivity may correspond to a fragment resulting from a second cleavage site (see below) and gave insufficient material for sequencing. A number of very weak spots (not visible in the figure), corresponding to bands in untreated cells, were also detected. Microsequencing of A indicated that the partial sequence KXTGGK was present in the spot indicating that phosphorylation occurs at Ser-10 exclusively. The detection of lysine (K) as the first residue is consistent with Ser-10 phosphorylation since the phosphorylated serine would tend to inhibit normal cleavage after Lys-9, resulting in cleavage after Arg-8 giving rise to a lysine as first residue detected. Some cleavage may have occurred after Lys-9 giving rise to spot B. The position ofB is consistent with lesser positive charge on this residue (1 lysine versus 2 in fragment A). Further evidence for phosphorylation at Ser-10 was the lack of a detectable residue at this position during sequencing of the intact labeled protein after electroblotting. Phosphoamino acid analysis shows exclusive phosphorylation on a serine residue. These data together establish that the primary site of phosphorylation was Ser-10.Figure 4Two-dimensional tryptic digest map of radiolabeled H3. Spot A was removed and was shown to contain the partial sequence, Lysine-X-threonine consistent with cleavage between Arg-8–Lys-9 in H3. Serine 10 (indicated asX), being phosphorylated, is not detected in the sequencer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gliotoxin is a known protein synthesis inhibitor although we have shown that this cannot be responsible for apoptosis induced by this toxin in thymocytes or P815 cells (17Waring P. Mamchak A. Khan T. Sjaarda A. Sutton P. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of H3 in fibroblasts has been shown to occur in the presence of some protein synthesis inhibitors (28Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We therefore examined if cycloheximide, a potent protein synthesis inhibitor, also resulted in histone phosphorylation. Fig.5 shows that no phosphorylation of H3 occurs with cycloheximide. Therefore the effect of gliotoxin cannot be due to its ability to inhibit protein synthesis. We have shown earlier that gliotoxin can modulate cAMP levels in splenocytes (25Sutton P. Beaver J.P. Waring P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 2009-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and apoptosis has been shown to be induced by agents that raise cAMP levels (29McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Jondal M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1227-1230PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 confirms that treatment of thymocytes with dibutyryl cyclic AMP, a cell-permeant analogue of cyclic AMP, also results in enhanced phosphorylation of histone H3. The level of phosphorylation caused by dibutyryl cyclic AMP even at 500 μm, however, is significantly less than that caused by gliotoxin. Table I shows that cAMP levels in thymocytes treated with gliotoxin reach levels almost 7 times that found in untreated cells. In some experiments cyclic AMP levels in cells treated with 3 μm gliotoxin were up to 20 times untreated cells. Because we examined the effects of forskolin and cholera toxin on thymocytes, we also measured cAMP levels in thymocytes treated with these two agents. In all experiments these latter two agents caused greater increases in cAMP than gliotoxin. Forskolin at 100 μm produced levels of cyclic AMP 4–5 times that seen with cholera toxin.Table IGliotoxin (GT) increases cyclic AMP and PKA activity in thymocytesTreatmentc-AMP1-aConcentration of cAMP determined in the lysate (500 μl) of cells.pmExperiment 1 Untreated0.15 ± 0.03 3 μm GT1.03 ± 0.25 10 ng/ml CTx3.63 ± 1.2 100 ng/ml CTx4.80 ± 1.5Experiment 2 Untreated<0.05 10 ng/ml CTx1.4 ± 0.07 100 μm forskolin6.3 ± 0.25PKA activity1-bActivity is expressed as counts of incorporated [33P]ATP into Kemptide.Experiment 1 Untreated1261 ± 168 3 μm GT3230 ± 620Experiment 2 Untreated940 ± 127 GT 3 μm2395 ± 443 GT 3 μm + 100 μm genistein1720 ± 257 Lysate + 10 μm c-AMP3323 ± 3961-cMaximum expected activity determined by adding cAMP to the untreated cell lysate.1-a Concentration of cAMP determined in the lysate (500 μl) of cells.1-b Activity is expressed as counts of incorporated [33P]ATP into Kemptide.1-c Maximum expected activity determined by adding cAMP to the untreated cell lysate. Open table in a new tab To determine if phosphorylation of H3 was generally associated with induction of apoptosis, we examined the effect of dexamethasone on histone H3. Fig.7 shows that there is no enhanced phosphorylation in the presence of dexamethasone indicating that this is not a feature common to apoptosis induced by dexamethasone. We also found no increased phosphorylation of H3 with the calcium mobilizing agent thapsigargin (data not shown). In Fig. 7, endogenous phosphorylation of H3 can be detected because of the greater exposure time. Genistein is nominally a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (30Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by gliotoxin (17Waring P. Mamchak A. Khan T. Sjaarda A. Sutton P. Cell Death Differ. 1995; 2: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). The result shown in Fig. 7 also shows that this agent at concentrations which inhibit apoptosis results in abrogation of the hyperphosphorylation of H3. The effect of genistein at 100 μm on H3 phosphorylation is also shown in Fig. 9 a. When we examined the effect of forskolin and cholera toxin on apoptosis in thymocytes, we found very different kinetics from that seen with gliotoxin. Fig. 8 shows kinetics observed with gliotoxin, forskolin, cholera toxin, and the cell-permeant analogue of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP. We consistently observed a far rapid onset of DNA fragmentation with gliotoxin compared with dibutyryl cAMP although both achieved the same level by 12 h as shown in Fig. 8. Forskolin and cholera toxin both showed a slow onset of DNA fragmentation and in addition did not reach the levels seen with gliotoxin even by 16 h. Neither forskolin nor cholera toxin resulted in any rapid phosphorylation of histone H3 at 1 h (Fig. 9 a). Although there was no detectable H3 phosphorylation at 1 h, when we measured levels of H3 phosphorylation at 8 h we found a significant but small increase in cells treated with forskolin and cholera toxin correlating with the levels of apoptosis seen with these agents (Fig. 9 b). It is notable that detection of H3 phosphorylation at 8 h with gliotoxin was impossible because of extensive apoptosis in the cells at this point. In this experiment we used 33P rather than32P labeling to minimize long exposure of thymocytes to irradiation. We have confirmed by electron microscopy that DNA fragmentation occurred in cells treated with cholera toxin and forskolin with the morphology of apoptosis and parallels the time course as assessed by DNA fragmentation (data not shown). We used the synthetic peptide Kemptide to asses"
https://openalex.org/W1638964621,"Sex is determined in Caenorhabditis elegans by an X-chromosome-counting mechanism that reliably distinguishes the twofold difference in X-chromosome dose between males (1X) and hermaphrodites (2X). This small quantitative difference is translated into the 'on/off' response of the target gene, xol-1, a switch that specifies the male fate when active and the hermaphrodite fate when inactive. Specific regions of X contain counted signal elements whose combined dose sets the activity of xol-1. Here we ascribe the dose effects of one region to a discrete, protein-encoding gene, fox-1. We demonstrate that the dose-sensitive signal elements on chromosome X control xol-1 through two different molecular mechanisms. One involves the transcriptional repression of xol-1 in XX animals. The other uses the putative RNA-binding protein encoded by fox-1 to reduce the level of xol-1 protein. These two mechanisms of repression act together to ensure the fidelity of the X-chromosome counting process."
https://openalex.org/W1610621306,"The shortest tube of constant diameter that can form a given knot represents the ‘ideal’ form of the knot1,2. Ideal knots provide an irreducible representation of the knot, and they have some intriguing mathematical and physical features, including a direct correspondence with the time-averaged shapes of knotted DNA molecules in solution1,2. Here we describe the properties of ideal forms of composite knots — knots obtained by the sequential tying of two or more independent knots (called factor knots) on the same string. We find that the writhe (related to the handedness of crossing points) of composite knots is the sum of that of the ideal forms of the factor knots. By comparing ideal composite knots with simulated configurations of knotted, thermally fluctuating DNA, we conclude that the additivity of writhe applies also to randomly distorted configurations of composite knots and their corresponding factor knots. We show that composite knots with several factor knots may possess distinct structural isomers that can be interconverted only by loosening the knot."
https://openalex.org/W2085066029,"Inward rectifier K+ channels control the cell's membrane potential and neuronal excitability. We report that the IRK3 but not the IRK1 inward rectifier K+ channel activity is inhibited by m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. This m1 modulation cannot be accounted for by protein kinase C, Ca2+, or channel phosphorylation, but can be mimicked by Mg2+. Based on quantitative analyses of IRK3 and two different IRK1 mutant channels bestowed with sensitivity to m1 modulation, we suggest that the resting Mg2+ level causes chronic inhibition of IRK3 channels, and m1 receptor stimulation may lead to an increase of cytoplasmic Mg2+ concentration and further channel inhibition, due to the ability of Mg2+ to lead these channels into a prolonged inactivated state."

Glucose is an important regulator of gene transcription in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. In vertebrates, it modulates the expression of genes for enzymes involved in metabolic regulation in the liver and adipose tissue and of insulin in β cells of the endocrine pancreas (1Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 28-35Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar).

II in adipocytes and by hexokinase IV (or glucokinase) in the liver and β cells; expression of the glucokinase gene is constitutive in the pancreas and insulin-dependent in the liver due to the existence of two different tissue-specific alternative promoters (7Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, glucokinase is replaced by other insulin-independent hexokinase isoforms (mainly HK I) in cultured hepatoma cell lines (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A.

Tissues whose function is regulated by glucose also possess particular glucose transporters, GLUT 4 in adipocytes and GLUT 2 in tissues secreting glucose into the blood (liver, small intestine, and proximal tubular cells of the kidney) as well as GLUT 2 in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans (10Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 11Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In pancreas β cells, it has been suggested that GLUT 2 and glucokinase are essential components of the “glucose sensor” (12Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

However, the mechanisms of the GLUT 2-specific role in the regulation of insulin secretion by glucose remain unclear (13Newgard C.B.

In most hepatoma cell lines in culture, glucose responsiveness of glucose-dependent genes is lost (15Meienhofer M.C. De Medicis E. Cognet M. Kahn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) even when these cells remain well differentiated (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 89-96Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fact, expression of glucose-responsive genes is generally constitutive in these cells in which glucokinase is replaced by HK I and GLUT 2 is replaced by GLUT 1, another glucose transporter isoform expressed in most cells not specialized in metabolism regulation, e.g. in cancerous cells (8Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). However, we recently succeeded in isolating various well differentiated cell lines that have conserved sensitivity of their transcriptional machinery to glucose (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 89-96Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we show that glucose responsiveness of the L-PK gene in these cells requires synthesis of GLUT 2, and we suggest that GLUT 2, but not GLUT 1, allows for efflux of glucose endogenously produced by the gluconeogenic pathway when cells are cultured without glucose. Therefore, in the absence of GLUT 2, glucose-responsive genes would be permanently stimulated by glycolytic intermediates of endogeneously produced glucose. mhAT and mhPKT hepatoma cell lines were derived from transgenic mice synthesizing the SV40 large T and small t antigens in the liver under the direction of either the antithrombin III gene or L-PK gene regulatory sequences (17Dubois N.

All hepatoma cell lines were usually grown in Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (v/v), Glutamax medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Chagrin Falls, OH) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 0.1 μm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 1 μm triiodothyronine, and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For the glucose induction studies, cells were cultured in a serum-free medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml transferrin and 100 μg/ml albumin. In general, cells were cultured for 24 h before induction in a glucose-free, serum-free medium supplemented with 1 μm triiodothyronine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 10 mm lactate (“lactate” conditions). Induction was then performed by replacing lactate with 17 mm glucose for 24 h (or less when mentioned). Induction of the L-PK and GLUT 2 mRNA levels was also analyzed in the presence of various concentrations of glucose for 24 h or in the presence of 17 mm glucose and protein inhibitors, such as 10 mm cycloheximide or 25 mm anisomycin, for the times given in the legend to Fig.5. Total RNAs were isolated from cell lines by lysis in 7 m guanidinium HCl followed by phenol extraction (22Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNAs were denatured with methylmercury (II) hydroxide, were electrophoretically separated on formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gels, and then were transferred and UV cross-linked to nylon membranes (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.). Prehybridization (1 h with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and hybridization were carried out as described previously (19Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Dubois N. Briand P. Kahn A.

Quantitation of the radioactive bands on the nylon membranes was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

The probe for rat hexokinase I sequence was from the laboratory of D. Granner (24Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed by lipofection usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTAP, Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer instructions in cells cultured in glucose-free, serum-free medium for 3–4 h. Five μg of CAT constructs and 2 μg of pRSV-luciferase (or 1 μg of pCMV-GLUT) were cotransfected in 60-mm plastic dishes (Falcon, Oxnard, CA) when cells were 60–80% confluent. After 16 h, the medium containing the liposome-DNA complex was removed and replaced with a 17 mmglucose or a 10 mm lactate medium for 24 h. CAT and luciferase activity assays were performed as described (25Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). CAT activity was calculated as the percentage of diacetylated formversus nonmetabolized chloramphenicol. Results were expressed as a ratio of CAT activity to luciferase activity to correct for the variable transfectability. When transfections were performed with pCMV expression vectors, pRSV-luciferase was omitted because of the risk of titration of ubiquitous transcription factors. In such a case, CAT activities were measured in the entire extract of each dish to compensate for the differential growth of the cells (i.e. dilution of the CAT activity) when cultured in glucose versus lactate medium for induction studies. The GlRE-mediated glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter was assessed by standardizing the activities obtained with the L4L3–119L-PK/CAT construct according to those obtained with the control -119L-PK/CAT construct. mhPKTf3 cells were attached to coverslips and treated as described previously by Hughes et al.

A. 1992; 89: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) excepted that permeabilization was done with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5′. Immunofluorescent staining of GLUT 1 and GLUT 2 was carried out using a 1:100 dilution of antisera kindly provided by B. Thorens (Lausanne, Switzerland) that recognized GLUT1 from human, rat, and mouse and GLUT 2 from rat. Staining of recombinant or endogenous GLUT 2 was also confirmed with other antisera kindly provided by S. W. Cushman (Bethesda, MD) and Luc Pénicaud (Toulouse, France) (data not shown). Glucose 6-phosphate in cultured hepatoma cells was assayed enzymatically according to Slein (27Slein M.W. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1963: 1238-1242Google Scholar) as described previously (9Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Kahn A. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10213-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are given as means + S.D. Statistical significance of the differences between treatment groups was determined by Student's t test. Different lines of hepatoma cells were derived from transgenic mice synthesizing the SV40 large T and small t antigens in the liver under the direction of either antithrombin III gene or L-PK gene regulatory sequences (17Dubois N. Bennoun M. Allemand I. Molina T. Grimber G. Daudet-Monsac M. Abelanet R. Briand P. J. Hepatol. 1991; 13: 227-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Cartier N. Miquerol L. Tulliez M. Lepetit N. Levrat F. Grimber G. Briand P. Kahn A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were obtained from fetal or adult transgenic animals with either normal (mhPKTf3) or tumoral livers (mhPKT, mhAT1, and mhAT3 cell lines) and established in culture as described previously (19Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Dubois N. Briand P. Kahn A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Antoine B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Each line was derived from a single clone. Fig. 1 A shows that induction of L-PK mRNA accumulation by 17 mm glucose in 26 independent clones was proportional (r = 0.92 by linear regression analysis) to their GLUT 2 mRNA content at the same time. In addition, all these clones also contain more or less GLUT 1 mRNA roughly in reverse proportion to GLUT 2 mRNA (not shown). The results obtained for three clones, which synthesized different amounts of GLUT 2 mRNA when cultured in the presence of 17 mmglucose, are presented in Fig. 1 B. In cells with low GLUT 2 mRNA levels, L-PK mRNA accumulation was practically constitutive, independent of glucose concentration in the medium. In contrast, in GLUT 2-expressing cells, the amplitude of the glucose responsiveness of the L-PK mRNA expression was correlated with the GLUT 2 mRNA level. It should be observed that GLUT 2 mRNA accumulation is itself dependent on glucose, as previously demonstrated in hepatocytes and mhAT3F cells (3Rencurel F. Waeber G. Antoine B. Rocchiccioli F.

J. 1993; 293: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas abundance of GLUT 1 mRNA was independent of glucose (Fig. 5). To confirm whether the positive correlation between GLUT 2 expression and response of the L-PK gene to glucose was mediated by the L-PK glucose response element (GlRE), we chose 8 clones among the 26 presented in Fig. 1 in which we tested glucose responsiveness of the L4L3–119L-PK/CAT construct (25Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It was previously demonstrated that the responsiveness of this construct to glucose was due to the GlRE located from −168 to −144 base pairs with respect to the cap site (25Bergot M.O. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that induction of the CAT activity in transiently transfected cells was also dependent on GLUT 2 mRNA level. Activity of the transfected L-PK promoter was almost constitutive in GLUT 2(−) cells (mhAT1G8) and inducible in GLUT 2(+) cells (mhAT3F) (Fig. 2 B). It is noteworthy that 2 mm fructose was also able to activate the L-PK promoter in GLUT 2(+) cells, in agreement with the known efficiency of GLUT 2 on fructose transport (30Gould G.W. Thomas H.M. Jess T.J. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5139-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To study the effect of GLUT2 (or GLUT1) on the glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter, two hepatoma cell lines lacking GLUT 2, i.e. mhPKTf3 previously established 3A. Vandewalle, unpublished results. and HepG2, were transiently transfected with L-PK CAT constructs and CMV-expression vectors for GLUT 1 or GLUT 2. Immunofluorescence studies were performed to provide evidence of the GLUT 1 and GLUT 2 expression induced by transient transfection of the relevant vectors (Fig. 3 A). In the mhPKTf3 cell line, GLUT 1 immunofluorescence was easily detectable at the plasma membrane of the cells while no membrane-associated GLUT 2 immunofluorescence was observed. When mhPKTf3 cells were transfected with CMV-GLUT 1 or CMV-GLUT 2 expression vectors, 4–5% of the cells exhibited greatest immunofluorescence at the plasma membrane level, confirming the correct localization of the forced expressed transporters. Response of the L4L3-L-PK promoter to glucose was calculated by dividing the CAT activities with the glucose-sensitive L4L3–119L-PK/CAT construct by those of with glucose insensitive -119L-PK/CAT construct (Fig. 3 B). Glucose responsiveness was nil in mhPKTf3 cells and very weak (× 1.58) in HepG2 cells. Co-transfection with the GLUT 2 expression vector resulted in a clear and significant L-PK glucose responsiveness in both cell lines (3.0- and 3.8-fold increase between lactate (Fig. 3 B,LO) and glucose (Fig. 3 B, G17) medium in mhPKTf3 and HepG2 cells, respectively). In HepG2 cells, 17 mm fructose stimulated the L-PK promoter almost as efficiently as glucose, which confirms that GLUT 2 synthesized by transfected cells was active on fructose entry into the cells (30Gould G.W. Thomas H.M. Jess T.J. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5139-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the response to glucose in HepG2 cells resulted in both decreased activity of the L-PK promoter under lactate conditions (× 0.70) and increased activity under glucose condition (× 1.70). In contrast, forced expression of GLUT 1 in these cells, which already synthesize GLUT 1 (Fig. 3 A), did not significantly change glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter. We observed that most of the clones isolated in our laboratory that exhibit a high GLUT 2 expression and, thus, a good glucose responsiveness had been selected for “liver-specific functions” by culture in a medium in which glucose was replaced by 2 mm fructose (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 89-96Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Initially, in designing these conditions, we wanted to select cells able to use fructose efficiently through their endogenous fructokinase and aldolsase B, two enzymes specific to liver, kidney, and small intestine (31Shapira F. Shapira G. Dreyfus J.C. Enzymol. Biol. Clin. 1961; 7: 170-175Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In fact, we also selected for the expression of GLUT 2, a transporter permissive for fructose transport (30Gould G.W. Thomas H.M. Jess T.J. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5139-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we subjected mhPKTf3 cells, which had never been selected by culture with fructose before, to fructose selection. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that the amount of endogenous L-PK mRNA in mhPKTf3 GLUT 2(−) cells was rather independent of glucose (× 1.8) before selection and became significantly glucose-responsive in fructose-selected mhPKTf3F1 (× 3, 7) and mhPKTf3F2 (× 11) clones, concomitantly with appearance of GLUT 2 expression. Fig. 4 C confirms that the recovery of GLUT 2 expression in mhPKTf3F1 clone is parallel with restoration of the L-PK promoter activation by glucose (× 2.5) or by fructose (× 2.4). The GLUT 2 gene is known to be regulated by glucose (3Rencurel F. Waeber G. Antoine B. Rocchiccioli F. Maulard P. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Asano T. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.J. Ishihara H. Yasaki Y. Oka Y. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pegorier J.P. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We raised the question of whether the kinetics of glucose responsiveness of the GLUT 2 and L-PK genes were similar or different in mhAT3F cells. Fig. 5 shows that time course (Fig.5 B) and concentration dependence of the response of the endogenous GLUT 2 and L-PK genes to glucose (Fig. 5 C) were practically similar, both requiring active protein synthesis and, therefore, being blocked by translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide and anisomycin (Fig. 5 A). However, these results did not preclude that a major cause of the delay of L-PK gene response to glucose (and perhaps of its dependence on active protein synthesis) could be the need for active GLUT 2 protein synthesis. In fact, the same requirement could exert itself on GLUT 2 mRNA accumulation, with GLUT 2 gene induction by glucose being subjected, in such a case, to a positive auto-regulatory loop. Fig. 5 Aalso shows that mhAT3F cells expressed the GLUT 1 and HK 1 genes regardless of the presence of glucose in the medium and with a low sensitivity to translation inhibitors. In contrast, these cells, like all the lines used in this study or reported in the literature (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 89-96Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Kahn A. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10213-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were devoid of glucokinase gene expression (not shown). To further test the hypothesis that the need for previous GLUT 2 synthesis could be involved in the delayed response of the L-PK gene to glucose in cells deprived of glucose for more than 30 h before induction, we forced the expression of GLUT 2 in mhAT3F cells cultured in lactate for 64 h (endogenous GLUT 2 mRNA being absent) and then analyzed the time course of the L4L3–119L-PK/CAT construct activation by glucose (Fig. 6 B). As recalled in Fig.6 A, when mhAT3F cells were deprived of glucose for more than 30 h, activation of the L-PK promoter was very low until the 14th h (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 89-96Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) while induction was more rapid after glucose deprivation of only 15 h. In cells that accumulated exogenous GLUT 2 for 24 h before glucose switch, the L-PK promoter was already activated 2.5- and 3.8-fold after 2 and 6 h of glucose refeeding, respectively. GLUT 2 overexpression resulted in both decreased activity under lactate conditions and increased activity under high glucose conditions (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, overexpression of GLUT 1 tended rather to decrease the response to glucose (Fig. 6 B), particularly by increasing activity of the L-PK promoter in cells cultured in the presence of lactate (Fig. 6 C), as also observed in mhPKTf3 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). Activation of the L-PK promoter by glucose requires Glu-6-P accumulation (9Doiron B. Cuif M.-H. Kahn A. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10213-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The permanent transcription of the L-PK gene in GLUT 2(-) cells cultured in lactate suggested that Glu-6-P produced by the gluconeogenic pathway might remain at a high concentration in these cells while it may be low in GLUT 2(+) cells. To test this hypothesis, GLUT 2(−) lines (mhPKTf3 and HepG2 cells) and GLUT 2(+) lines (mhPKTf3F1 and mhAT3F cells) were cultured for 30–40 h in a lactate-containing, glucose-free medium, and intracellular Glu-6-P was assayed. Its value was compared with that observed after 1 h of culture in the presence of 17 mm glucose. TableI shows that Glu-6-P was practically undetectable in mhAT3F and mhPKTf3F1 cells cultured for 30 h in lactate and slightly increased at the 40th h. In contrast, it was about 80% of the values obtained after 1 h of culture in a high glucose medium in mhPKTf3 and HepG2 cells. This high Glu-6-P concentration in GLUT 2(−) hepatoma cells cultured without glucose easily explains the glucose-independent activity of the L-PK promoter and gene in these cells.Table IGlucose 6-phosphate concentration in nmol per mg of proteinGlucose at 1 hLactate at 30 hLactate at 40 hGLUT 2(+) mhAT3F2.62 (2.51–2.85)00.73 (0.57–0.85) mhPKTf3F12.22 (1.79–2.89)0.15 (0–0.45)0.39 (0–0.85)GLUT 2(−) mhPKTf33.03 (2.44–3.48)2.39 (1.79–2.91)2.48 (1.88–2.86) HepG22.56 (2.36–2.79)ND1-aND, not determined.2.141-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Hepatocytes and β cells were the only cells to express the couple “GLUT 2-glucokinase” for transport and phosphorylation of glucose from the blood. In the hepatoma cell lines described to date, neither GLUT 2 nor glucokinase were ever reported to be significantly expressed, being replaced by GLUT 1 and insulin-independent hexokinase isoforms, mainly HK 1 (8Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). We have previously established and characterized various new hepatoma cell lines, some of which express GLUT 2 but not glucokinase and yet are responsive to glucose (2Lefrançois-Martinez A.M. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B. FASEB J. 1993; 8: 89-96Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Dubois N. Briand P. Kahn A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,20Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Miquerol L. Kahn A. Antoine B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hepatoma cells that express mostly GLUT 1 exhibit a glucose-independent L-PK gene expression, whereas GLUT 2(+) cell lines express the L-PK gene poorly under glucose-free conditions and strongly under glucose conditions. Induction of GLUT 2 synthesis in GLUT 2(−) cells, either by selection for ability to grow in a fructose medium or by transient transfection of a GLUT 2 expression vector, allows for concomitant occurrence of glucose responsiveness of the L-PK promoter. Thus, the main question is what is the mechanism of GLUT 2 action on the response of glucose-sensitive genes to glucose in liver cells? In other words, what does GLUT 2 do that GLUT 1 is unable to do ? GLUT 1 and GLUT 2 have similar V max, but affinity of GLUT 1 is 2–3-fold higher than that of GLUT 2. In addition, GLUT 1 is highly asymmetrical, much more efficient for glucose influx than efflux, wheras GLUT 2 is symmetrical, which explains its specific role in organs whose function is to secrete glucose (11Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Finally, GLUT 2 but not GLUT 1 is capable to transport fructose (30Gould G.W. Thomas H.M. Jess T.J. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5139-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In endocrine pancreas β cells, the predominant glucose-sensor has been definitively identified as glucokinase by knock out of the gene in mice (32Grupe A. Hultgren B. Ryann A. Hui Ma Y. Bauer M. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Terauchi Y. Sakura H. Yasuda K. Iwamoto K. Takahashi N. Ito K. Kasai H. Suzuki H. Ueda O. Kamada H. Jishage K. Komeda K. Noda M. Kanazawa Y. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Akanuma Y. Komada T. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30253-30256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the significance of the specific GLUT 2 expression in rodent β cells is still disputed, especially as the amount of the GLUT 2 isoform seems to be very low in human β cells (34De Vos A. Heimberg H. Quartier E. Bouwens L. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2489-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 35Ferrer J. Benito C. Gomis R. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1369-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). German (36German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) has shown that β cells overexpressing GLUT 1 do not lose their ability to sense changes in glucose concentration within the physiological range and to respond by an appropriate stimulation of the insulin gene promoter. In contrast, Newgard and co-workers (12Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15205-15212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hughes S.D. Johnson J.H. Quaade C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) hypothesized that GLUT 2, perhaps by specific interaction with glucokinase, could generate an intracellular signal needed for the response of insulin secretion to glucose. This view is consistent with the report by Valera et al. that, in mice, an antisense GLUT 2 mRNA impaired the normal activation of insulin secretion by glucose (37Valera A. Solanes G. Fernandez-Alvarez J. Pujol A. Ferrer J. Asins G. Gomis R. Bosch F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28543-28546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GLUT 2 could be needed to allow normal regulation for insulin secretion by glucose in β cells, at least in rodents, but be non-essential for glucose-dependent regulation of insulin gene transcription. A glucose sensor system is also essential in the liver to provide a correct metabolic response to dietary modifications, either glucose utilization and glycogen storage or glucose production. This sensor seems to be composed, as in β cells, of GLUT 2 and glucokinase. However, glucokinase could be replaced by other insulin-independent hexokinases, in vivo and ex vivo. In vivo, knocked out mice specifically deficient in glucokinase in liver have an almost normal glucose regulation (32Grupe A. Hultgren B. Ryann A. Hui Ma Y. Bauer M. Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas deficiency in pancreas glucokinase leads to neonatal death from severe insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (33Terauchi Y. Sakura H. Yasuda K. Iwamoto K. Takahashi N. Ito K. Kasai H. Suzuki H. Ueda O. Kamada H. Jishage K. Komeda K. Noda M. Kanazawa Y. Taniguchi S. Miwa I. Akanuma Y. Komada T. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30253-30256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ex vivo, we have shown that hepatoma cells with hexokinase 1 (2, and this paper) respond to glucose in modulating transcription of glucose-responsive genes, e.g. the L-PK gene. Thus, in contrast to the essential role of glucokinase in glucose-dependent insulin secretion by β cells, glucokinase seems to be needed in the liver mainly for phosphorylating glucose to Glu-6-P, a role that can be performed by other hexokinase isoforms as well. However, GLUT 2 seems to be essential for the liver glucose sensor function, as suggested by its requirement for the normal response of the L-PK gene to glucose in liver-derived cells. We have found that the main effect of GLUT 2 does not seem to be to generate a positive signal needed for glucose action, but rather to allow for L-PK gene extinction in cells cultured in the absence of glucose. All the hepatoma cells used in this work are more or less capable of gluconeogenesis and, accordingly, several of them have been selected for persistence of liver-specific functions by prolonged culture in glucose-free media (18Cartier N. Miquerol L. Tulliez M. Lepetit N. Levrat F. Grimber G. Briand P. Kahn A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1413-1422PubMed Google Scholar, 19Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Dubois N. Briand P. Kahn A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, hepatoma cells cultured under glucose-free conditions are expected to synthesize Glu-6-P and glucose, and to secrete glucose provided that Glu-6-Pase and the transporter specialized in glucose export, i.e. GLUT 2, are present. In the absence of GLUT 2, glucose efflux from the cells might be limited. As a consequence, the sequestered intracellular glucose could be phosphorylated back to Glu-6-P in a sort of futile cycle by the constitutive hexokinase isoforms replacing glucokinase, resulting in a high Glu-6-P concentration. This hypothesis is in complete agreement with our results that hepatoma cells cultured for 30 or 40 h in lactate medium had a high Glu-6-P concentration when they are GLUT 2(−) and an undectable or low Glu-6-P concentration when they are GLUT 2(+). Intracellular Glu-6-P concentration in GLUT 2(+) cells seems to increase between hour 30 and 40 of culture in glucose-free medium (Table I). In fact, this result was not surprising because expression of the GLUT 2 gene is itself glucose-dependent (3Rencurel F. Waeber G. Antoine B. Rocchiccioli F. Maulard P. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consequently, prolonged culture in lactate medium should result in the progressive disappearance of the GLUT 2 transporter. Glu-6-P is the first glucose metabolite needed for the transcriptional response of glucose-responsive genes to glucose (4Foufelle F. Gouhot B. Pégorier J.-P. Perdereau D. Girard J. Ferré P. J.

Accumulation of this compound (and derivated glycolytic intermediates) in GLUT 2(−) cells cultured without glucose could therefore activate L-PK gene transcription. In contrast, GLUT 1 expression could contribute to limited glucose export or promote rapid reentry of glucose secreted in the extracellular medium. In conclusion, our results provide a new insight into the correlation between expression of the GLUT 2 transporter and the physiological response to glucose observed in gluconeogenic cells. In hepatoma cell lines, the usually expressed “couple” for transport and phosphorylation of glucose is GLUT 1-HK1, whereas it is GLUT 2-glucokinase in the liver. We show in this paper that hepatoma cell lines that express the couple GLUT 2-HK1 conserve the sensitivity of metabolic genes to glucose concentration and suggest that GLUT 2 acts in this process more as a component of the gluconeogenic pathway than as an essential element for glucose influx. In vivo, GLUT 2 is present in the liver under both gluconeogenic and glycolytic conditions. Under the former condition, GLUT 2 activity would be essential for both glucose secretion and keeping the intracellular Glu-6-P concentration low and thus avoid permanent activation of glycolytic and lipogenic genes, which otherwise would result in a futile metabolic cycle and inappropriate energy dissipation.

https://openalex.org/W2021777946,"Soluble immune complexes bind to unprimed neutrophils and generate intracellular Ca2+transients but fail to activate the NADPH oxidase. Following priming of the neutrophils with either tumor necrosis factor α or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stimulation of the cells with the soluble immune complexes leads to an enhanced Ca2+ signal and significant secretion of reactive oxidants. The enhanced Ca2+ signal observed in primed neutrophils results from the influx of Ca2+ from the external environment and is partly sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is in contrast to the Ca2+ signal observed in unprimed neutrophils, which arises from the mobilization of intracellular stores. When the surface expression of FcγRIIIb on primed neutrophils was decreased either through incubation with Pronase or phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, the extra enhanced Ca2+ mobilization seen in primed cells was significantly lowered, while the initial rise in intracellular Ca2+ was unaffected. Depletion of FcγRIIIb had no significant effect on the Ca2+ transients in unprimed neutrophils. Cross-linking FcγRII, but not FcγRIIIb, induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ in unprimed neutrophils, while cross-linking either of these receptors increased Ca2+ levels in primed neutrophils. The FcγRII-dependent intracellular Ca2+ rise in primed cells was unaffected by incubation in Ca2+-free medium, whereas the FcγRIIIb-dependent transient was significantly decreased when Ca2+ influx was prevented in Ca2+-free medium supplemented with EGTA. Cross-linking either FcγRII or FcγRIIIb in primed or unprimed cells failed to stimulate substantial levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. These results indicate that following stimulation of primed neutrophils with soluble immune complexes the enhanced Ca2+ mobilization observed is the result of a functional activation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked FcγRIIIb. Soluble immune complexes bind to unprimed neutrophils and generate intracellular Ca2+transients but fail to activate the NADPH oxidase. Following priming of the neutrophils with either tumor necrosis factor α or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, stimulation of the cells with the soluble immune complexes leads to an enhanced Ca2+ signal and significant secretion of reactive oxidants. The enhanced Ca2+ signal observed in primed neutrophils results from the influx of Ca2+ from the external environment and is partly sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is in contrast to the Ca2+ signal observed in unprimed neutrophils, which arises from the mobilization of intracellular stores. When the surface expression of FcγRIIIb on primed neutrophils was decreased either through incubation with Pronase or phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, the extra enhanced Ca2+ mobilization seen in primed cells was significantly lowered, while the initial rise in intracellular Ca2+ was unaffected. Depletion of FcγRIIIb had no significant effect on the Ca2+ transients in unprimed neutrophils. Cross-linking FcγRII, but not FcγRIIIb, induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ in unprimed neutrophils, while cross-linking either of these receptors increased Ca2+ levels in primed neutrophils. The FcγRII-dependent intracellular Ca2+ rise in primed cells was unaffected by incubation in Ca2+-free medium, whereas the FcγRIIIb-dependent transient was significantly decreased when Ca2+ influx was prevented in Ca2+-free medium supplemented with EGTA. Cross-linking either FcγRII or FcγRIIIb in primed or unprimed cells failed to stimulate substantial levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. These results indicate that following stimulation of primed neutrophils with soluble immune complexes the enhanced Ca2+ mobilization observed is the result of a functional activation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked FcγRIIIb. Neutrophils play a major role in host defense via the phagocytosis and destruction of pathogens during acute inflammation. The binding of opsonized bacteria or immune complexes to neutrophil immunoglobulin receptors (FcγR) can activate a number of processes such as phagocytosis, degranulation and activation of the NADPH oxidase (1Edwards S.W. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Neutrophil. Cambridge University Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Abraham J.S. Wheeler J.G. The Natural Immune System: The Neutrophil. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, 1993Google Scholar). However, in addition to this protective role, inappropriate activation of neutrophils to release oxygen metabolites and granule enzymes within tissues can result in tissue damage in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (1Edwards S.W. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Neutrophil. Cambridge University Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Abraham J.S. Wheeler J.G. The Natural Immune System: The Neutrophil. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, 1993Google Scholar). Furthermore, immune complex deposition followed by subsequent neutrophil activation is important in the pathogenesis of serum sickness, the Arthus reaction, acute glomerulonephritis, and other idiopathic inflammatory diseases (3Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1972; 68: 593-605PubMed Google Scholar, 4Test S.T. Weiss S.J. Adv. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1986; 2: 91-116Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

Dis. 1993; 52: 353-359Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and we have shown that synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis contains both soluble and insoluble IgG-containing immune complexes, which are capable of activating neutrophils (11Robinson J.J.

However, the soluble immune complexes only activate neutrophils that have been previously primed in vivo or in vitro by GM-CSF 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PI, phosphoinositide; PLC, phospholipase C; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PI, phosphoinositide; PLC, phospholipase C; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.or γ-interferon and this activation leads to the secretionof reactive oxidants and granule enzymes (11Robinson J.J.

Dis. 1993; 52: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, insoluble immune complexes activate both primed and unprimed neutrophils with nearly equal efficacy but the oxidants generated are largely retained intracellularly, i.e. within phagolysosomes. Thus, soluble immune complexes may be of greater importance than insoluble complexes in the destructive processes that occur during inflammatory diseases because they activate the secretion of large quantities of cytotoxic products. The identification of the molecular processes that occur during neutrophil priming to allow activation of oxidant secretion in response to soluble complexes may therefore be of value in identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention. IgG-containing immune complexes stimulate neutrophils via Fcγ receptors, two types of which are expressed on freshly isolated control blood cells (14Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). FcγRII (CD32) is a 40-kDa transmembrane-spanning molecule with a cytoplasmic tail that allows its interaction with G-proteins, whereas FcγRIIIb is a heavily glycosylated molecule of 50–70 kDa, linked to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (15Huizinga T.W.J. van der Schoot C.E. Jost C. Klassen R. Kleijer M. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Tetteroo P.A.T. Roos D. Nature. 1988; 333: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, although FcγRIIIb has the potential for rapid lateral mobility within the membrane, it is unable to couple directly to either G-proteins or to the cytoskeleton, and it is unclear how ligation to this receptor might lead to the transduction of intracellular signals. Expression of FcγRIIIb on the plasma membrane (100,000–200,000 molecules/cell) is approximately 10–15-fold greater than the expression of FcγRII (7000–15,000 molecules/cell). There is much debate as to the independent and co-operative roles of FcγRII and FcγRIIIb in neutrophil activation. Neither receptor binds monomeric IgG, but they bind dimers, trimers, immune complexes, and opsonized particles (16Huizinga T.W.J. Kerst M. Nuyens J.H. Vlug A. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Roos D. Tetteroo P.A.T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2359-2364PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hundt M. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although reports in the literature are conflicting, it is currently thought that occupancy of FcγRII leads to activation of reactive oxidant production, degranulation, and phagocytosis (18Huizinga T.W.J. van Kemenade F. Koenderman L. Dolman K.M. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Tetteroo P.A.T. Roos D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2365-2369PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kimberley R.P. Ahlstrom J.W. Click M.E. Edberg J.C. J. Exp.

Kimberley R.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 997-1004PubMed Google Scholar). While there have been a few reports of FcγRIIIb occupancy inducing functional responses, its main role is thought to enhance the binding of immune complexes and to augment the function of FcγRII. Similarly, the intracellular signaling molecules generated via FcγRII and FcγRIIIb ligation are undefined. Although it is not clear how FcγRIIIb, which lacks a transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain can generate intracellular signals, it has recently been reported that occupancy of either FcγRII or FcγRIIIb can activate Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinases (23Richard S. Shaw A.S. Showell H.J. Connelly P.A. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Dusi S. Donini M. Della Bianca V. Gandini G. Rossi F. Biochem.

Occupancy of FcγRII is associated with the activation and translocation of Fgr to the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton, while FcγRIIIb is associated with Hck activation. Ligation of either FcγRII or FcγRIIIb can mediate a cytosolic Ca2+ increase that has been reported to come primarily from the release of intracellular stores, and it has been suggested that occupancy of FcγRII and FcγRIIIb can lead to the generation of both independent and synergistic Ca2+fluxes (28Mackenzie S.J.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 3702-3709PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which FcγR engagement leads to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ are unclear; reports indicate that that it may be pertussis toxin-insensitive and largely independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) accumulation (31Walker B.A.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5265-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most observations have, however, been made following stimulation with large insoluble immune complexes or by cross-linking individual Fcγ receptors. Few reports have examined changes in FcγR function during priming (33Edwards S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 362-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the method used to isolate neutrophils may influence the results obtained because some separation procedures may result in inadvertent priming of the neutrophil (34Watson F. Robinson J.J. Edwards S.W. Biosci. Rep. 1992; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Fearon D.T. Collins L.A. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 370-375PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated Ca2+ mobilization in neutrophils stimulated with soluble immune complexes in both primed and unprimed neutrophils. We present evidence that the initial cytosolic Ca2+ increase observed following stimulation with soluble complexes is the result of ligation of FcγRII and that this interaction is insufficient to activate the respiratory burst. When soluble complexes are added to primed neutrophils oxidant secretion is initiated and an enhanced mobilization of Ca2+ results, mainly via influx from extracellular sources. It would appear that this extra intracellular Ca2+ signal results from functional activation of FcγRIIIb during priming. These studies add new insights into the mechanisms by which cellular priming alters the functional responsiveness of neutrophils during inflammatory activation. Neutrophil isolation medium was from Cardinal Associates Inc., RPMI 1640 medium from Flow Laboratories; Fluo-3-AM, erbstatin, and genistein were from Calbiochem. rGM-CSF was a non-glycosylated peptide from Glaxo and had an activity of ≥1.5 milliunits/mg of protein in the AML-193 proliferation assay. TNFα was from National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, United Kingdom. F(ab′)2 fragments of monoclonal antibody 3G8 (recognizing FcγRIIIb) and Fab fragments of IV.3 (recognizing FcγRII) were from Medarex, Inc. PI-PLC was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other specialist reagents were from Sigma. Neutrophils were isolated from the venous blood of healthy volunteers by centrifugation on neutrophil isolation medium for 15 min at 400 × g (36Edwards S.W. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 563-578Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After removal of contaminating erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis, purified neutrophils were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium and counted. Neutrophil purity (assessed by Wright's staining) and viability (assessed by trypan blue exclusion) were >97% and >95%, respectively. Neutrophils were primed using either GM-CSF or TNFα. Cells (107/ml) were incubated in the presence and absence of GM-CSF (50 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, whereas TNFα (50 ng/ml) was added 10 min prior to stimulation. Synthetic immune complexes were made from human serum albumin and rabbit anti-human serum albumin antibodies as described previously (37Crockett-Torabi E. Fantone J.C. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3026-3032PubMed Google Scholar). The antigen was titrated against constant antibody concentration and theA 450 nm measured to identify equivalence. The soluble complexes were formed at 6 × antigen equivalence and were briefly centrifuged (2 min at 13,000 × g in a microcentrifuge) to remove any contaminating insoluble immune complexes that may have been present. Soluble complexes were formed at 180 μg/ml antigen and 125 μg/ml antibody. A 10% (v/v) solution of complexes was used routinely for neutrophil stimulation. Chemiluminescence was measured at 37 °C in neutrophil suspensions (5 × 105/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium that was supplemented with 10 μm Luminol using an LKB 1251 luminometer (38Watson F. Robinson J. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7432-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Edwards S.W. J. Lab. Clin. Immunol. 1987; 22: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar). For measurements of superoxide secretion, neutrophils were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 75 μm cytochrome c (40Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). Absorption changes were recorded at 550 nm using a Bio-Rad 3550 kinetic plate reader. Reference wells contained 30 μg/ml superoxide dismutase. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+] i, were monitored with the fluorescent probe Fluo-3. Neutrophils in RPMI 1640 (2 × 107/ml) were loaded by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min with 2 μm Fluo-3 AM. The cells were then washed twice and resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in Ca2+-free medium (145 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, 0.5 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) to which 1 mmCaCl2 was added as required. In some experiments, 1 mm EGTA was added to media devoid of Ca2+. Fluorescence was then measured at 505 nm excitation and 530 nm emission. Calibration of changes in intracellular Ca2+levels was as described in Ref. 41Merrit J.E. McCarthy S.A. Davies M.P.A. Moores K.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar using a K d for Fluo-3 of 864 nm at 37 °C. For measurements of intracellular Ca2+ following the cross-linking of receptors, Fluo-3-loaded neutrophils (2 × 106/ml) were incubated with 1 μg/ml Fab/F(ab′)2 fragments of appropriate monoclonal antibodies at 37 °C prior to cross-linking with 40 μg/ml F(ab′)2fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG. For mAb blocking studies, 3 × 106 neutrophils were incubated with 3 μg of Fab/F(ab′)2 fragments in a volume of 250 μl for 10 min at 37 °C prior to dilution (to 5 × 105 cells/ml) and stimulation of cells with soluble immune complexes. Neutrophils were incubated for 45 min in the presence (primed) and absence (control) of 50 units/ml GM-CSF. FcγRII and FcγRIIIb were then cross-linked (as described above), and samples were removed at time intervals. IP3 was then extracted by rapidly mixing samples with 0.2 volume of ice-cold 20% (v/v) perchloric acid. After neutralizing extracts, IP3 was quantified using a competitive binding assay (Amersham, UK) using d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as a calibration standard. Addition of synthetic soluble IgG immune complexes to freshly isolated neutrophils failed to activate reactive oxidant generation (Fig. 1), as detected by Luminol chemiluminescence. However, if the cells were primed by prior addition of GM-CSF (50 units/ml for 1 h) or TNFα (50 ng/ml for 10 min), then the soluble complexes activated a rapid and transient burst of oxidase activity that peaked 2–3 min after addition (Fig. 1,A and C). Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence detects both intra- and extracellular oxidant production (39Edwards S.W. J. Lab. Clin. Immunol. 1987; 22: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar), but the use of cytochrome c, which is a large basic molecule that cannot permeate the cell, specifically measures O·̄2 secretion (38Watson F. Robinson J. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7432-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of soluble immune complexes to unprimed cells similarly did not activate O·̄2secretion but did lead to a rapid and significant secretion of O·̄2 in cells that had been primed either with TNFα or with GM-CSF (Fig. 1, B and D). Resting levels of intracellular Ca2+ were approximately 140 nm(n = 18) in unstimulated neutrophils. When soluble immune complexes were added to unprimed cells, there was a rapid and transient monophasic increase in the level of intracellular Ca2+, which reached a maximal level of 0.9–1.0 μm Ca2+ approximately 30–45 s following stimulation (Fig. 2). This increase in intracellular Ca2+ was comparable to that induced by addition of 0.1 μm fMet-Leu-Phe (data not shown). When the neutrophils were primed by exposure to TNFα prior to stimulation with the soluble complexes, there was again a rapid rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2 A), but the kinetics of the increase were altered. The initial increase in intracellular Ca2+ seen in unprimed neutrophils was unaffected, but this was followed by a second, more sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+. Similarly, when the neutrophils were primed with GM-CSF (Fig. 2 B), the intracellular Ca2+mobilization induced by the soluble immune complexes was enhanced and prolonged in comparison to that observed in unprimed cells. Increasing the concentrations of soluble immune complexes (to 20% and 30%, v/v) did not change either the kinetics or the magnitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transients seen in unprimed cells. Thus, priming does not affect the affinity of binding of soluble immune complexes under these conditions. To determine the source of the increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in both unprimed and primed neutrophils, incubations in Ca2+-free medium in the presence of 1 mm EGTA were performed. Fig.3 A shows that when unprimed cells were stimulated with soluble immune complexes in Ca2+-free buffer, there was no significant difference in the kinetics of intracellular Ca2+ changes compared with those obtained in Ca2+-containing buffer. Thus, in unprimed neutrophils, the observed increases in intracellular Ca2+ arise from the mobilization of intracellular stores. In contrast, when primed cells were stimulated with soluble immune complexes Ca2+-free buffer, the initial intracellular Ca2+ increase was unaffected, but the extended “extra” Ca2+ signal only seen in primed cells, was not observed (Fig. 3, B andC). These experiments thus indicate that the enhanced and prolonged increase in intracellular Ca2+ observed only in primed cells is due to Ca2+ influx from external sources. When unprimed neutrophils were incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erbstatin (1 μg/ml), the intracellular Ca2+ response obtained following stimulation with the soluble complexes was inhibited by 30% (± 8%, n = 6). When neutrophils were primed with either TNFα (Fig.4 B) or GM-CSF (Fig. 4 C), the enhanced intracellular Ca2+ signal seen only in primed neutrophils was similarly decreased. This concentration of erbstatin decreased reactive oxidant generation stimulated by soluble immune complexes in primed neutrophils by >95% (data not shown). Similar results were obtained following addition of another tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein at 100 μm (data not shown). Addition of erbstatin at 2 μg/ml inhibited the unprimed Ca2+signal by over 50%, but did not result in greater inhibition of the primed response (data not shown). To determine whether erbstatin exhibited nonspecific toxic effects at these concentrations, the experiments shown in Fig. 5were performed. After addition of soluble immune complexes to primed neutrophils incubated in the presence and absence of erbstatin, fMet-Leu-Phe was added. The intracellular Ca2+ transients stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe were unaffected by the inhibitor; this fMet-Leu-Phe-induced response was identical to that observed following its addition to suspensions that had not previously been stimulated by immune complexes. When neutrophils were incubated with PI-PLC (at 0.25 units/ml for 30 min), the surface expression of FcγRIIIb, which is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked (14Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 15Huizinga T.W.J. van der Schoot C.E. Jost C. Klassen R. Kleijer M. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Tetteroo P.A.T. Roos D. Nature. 1988; 333: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), detected by fluorescent-activated cell sorting was decreased to levels that were indistinguishable from nonspecific antibody binding (Fig.6 A, i). This treatment had no effect on the expression of FcγRII (Fig. 6 A, ii) or on the expression of CD11b (data not shown). Similarly, incubation with Pronase (0.05 mg/ml for 30 min) also resulted in the decreased surface expression of FcγRIIIb but had no effect on expression of FcγRII or CD11b (data not shown). When FcγRIIIb expression on the surface of primed neutrophils was depleted by treatment with either Pronase or PI-PLC, the soluble immune complexes failed to activate the respiratory burst (Fig. 6,inset). Neutrophils treated in this way can, however, still generate reactive oxidants in response to large, insoluble immune complexes or PMA (13Robinson J.J. Watson F. Phelan M. Bucknall R.C. Edwards S.W. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 52: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When unprimed neutrophils were depleted of surface FcγRIIIb by treatment with PI-PLC, there was very little effect on the intracellular Ca2+ rise stimulated by soluble immune complexes (Fig. 6 B, i). This result indicates that expression of FcγRIIIb is not required for the transient, intracellular Ca2+ increase that arises from the mobilization of intracellular stores following the binding of soluble immune complexes to the surface of unprimed cells. However, in primed cells, Pronase treatment had a marked effect on the intracellular Ca2+ signals (Fig. 6 B, ii). In primed cells depleted of FcγRIIIb, the initial intracellular Ca2+ transient was unaffected, but the later, sustained intracellular Ca2+ signal that arises from Ca2+influx was not observed. Similar results were obtained when the neutrophils were primed with TNFα and when FcγRIIIb was depleted from the cell surface by incubation with Pronase (data not shown). These data thus indicate distinct roles for individual FcγR in the control of these intracellular Ca2+ signals in primed and unprimed neutrophils. Thus, the initial intracellular Ca2+transient that is seen in both unprimed and primed neutrophils appears to be due to signals generated via occupancy of FcγRII; this intracellular Ca2+ signal arises from the mobilization of intracellular stores. In contrast, the extra intracellular Ca2+ signal that is only seen in primed cells requires FcγRIIIb and arises from Ca2+ influx. To confirm the above conclusions on the roles of FcγRII and FcγRIIIb in the differential intracellular Ca2+ signals, cross-linking Fab/F(ab′)2 fragments of specific anti-FcγR mAbs was employed. Incubation of unprimed neutrophils with Fab fragments of IV3 (anti-FcγRII), followed by cross-linking with goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments, resulted in a monophasic increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig.7 A). The kinetics of this intracellular Ca2+ increase were unaltered when the cells were primed with either GM-CSF (Fig. 7 A) or TNFα (data not shown), but a greater intracellular Ca2+ transient was observed in primed cells. The kinetics of these increases in intracellular Ca2+ resemble those observed during incubation of unprimed neutrophils with soluble immune complexes (Fig. 2). However, when unprimed neutrophils were incubated with F(ab′)2 fragments of 3G8 (anti-FcγRIIIb) prior to cross-linking, no increases in intracellular Ca2+ were observed (Fig. 7 B). Thus, ligation of FcγRIIIb in unprimed neutrophils fails to generate increases in intracellular Ca2+. However, if the cells were primed with either GM-CSF (Fig. 7 B) or TNFα (data not shown), then cross-linking of 3G8 resulted in increases in intracellular Ca2+. The kinetics of these increases in intracellular Ca2+ were significantly slower than those observed following ligation of FcγRII and very similar to the kinetics of the extra intracellular Ca2+ signal only seen in primed cells (Fig. 2). These results thus clearly show that ligation of FcγRII can lead to rapid intracellular Ca2+ transients in either primed or unprimed neutrophils and the priming process does not alter the kinetics of these transients. In contrast, ligation of FcγRIIIb results in elevations in intracellular Ca2+, but only in cells that are primed. Thus, priming leads to afunctional activation of FcγRIIIb that results in its ability to generate intracellular Ca2+ transients via Ca2+ influx. When intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured by cross-linking FcγRII in primed neutrophils similar responses were observed in Ca2+-containing and in Ca2+-free medium (containing 1 mm EGTA) (Fig.8 A). This result indicates that the Ca2+ signal generated following ligation of this receptor arises largely from the mobilization of intracellular stores. In complete contrast, the FcγRIIIb-dependent intracellular Ca2+ signal was greatly decreased when the cells were suspended in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 8 B), indicating that Ca2+ influx is largely responsible for the intracellular Ca2+ signal following ligation of this receptor. The Fab/F(ab′)2 fragments were then used to confirm the roles of these FcγRs in the generation of intracellular Ca2+ signals in response to soluble immune complexes. Addition of 3G8 F(ab′)2 fragments (anti-FcγRIIIb) prior to the addition of soluble immune complexes had no effect on the intracellular Ca2+ transients generated in unprimed cells (Fig. 9 A), but significantly decreased the extra Ca2+ signal observed in primed cells (Fig.9 B). However, addition of IV3 Fab fragments (anti-FcγRII) prior to the addition of soluble immune complexes inconsistently affected the intracellular Ca2+ transients. It may be that mAb IV3 is readily displaced from FcγRII by the soluble immune complexes. These experiments, however, confirm a role for FcγRIIIb in the extra intracellular signal seen in primed cells. Stimulation of neutrophils with fMet-Leu-Phe resulted in a rapid and transient elevation in the levels of IP3(Fig. 10 A), which peaked within 10–15 s and then declined. However, ligation of either FcγRII (Fig.10 B) or FcγRIIIb (Fig. 10 C) failed to activate the production of significant levels of IP3 in either primed or unprimed cells. In this study we have investigated the mechanisms by which soluble immune complexes activate neutrophils via Fcγ receptors. Defining this interaction is important because several immune conditions are associated with neutrophil activation via immune complexes (1Edwards S.W. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Neutrophil. Cambridge University Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Abraham J.S. Wheeler J.G. The Natural Immune System: The Neutrophil. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, 1993Google Scholar, 3Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1972; 68: 593-605PubMed Google Scholar). These soluble immune complexes fail to activate the respiratory burst when added to suspensions of unprimed cells. However, if the cells are primed (as in our study using the cytokines GM-CSF and TNFα), then soluble immune complex binding results in the secretion of large quantities of reactive oxygen metabolites. Because neutrophil function in vivo is invariably regulated by exposure to priming agents and because these soluble immune complexes activate the secretion of potentially tissue-damaging components, these results are important in understanding the molecular pathology of certain neutrophil-mediated conditions. In our study, we have used a neutrophil isolation procedure that induces minimal priming during cell isolation. Many commonly used isolation methods (33Edwards S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 362-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Watson F. Robinson J.J. Edwards S.W. Biosci. Rep. 1992; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Kuijpers T.W. Tool A.T.J. van der Schoot C.E. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J.M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, inadvertently prime both receptor number/function and NADPH oxidase activity and hence experiments with cells isolated by such methods cannot clearly distinguish between neutrophil responses that are restricted to either the primed or the unprimed state. Whereas the soluble immune complexes failed to activate the NADPH oxidase in unprimed cells, the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled complexes showed that they clearly bind to the cell surface (data not shown). These fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled complexes activated neutrophils in identical ways to the unlabeled complexes, indicating that their molecular properties were unaltered during the labeling process. We have previously shown that the synthetic soluble immune complexes used in these studies and those isolated from rheumatoid synovial fluid, activate primed and unprimed neutrophils by analogous mechanisms (12Robinson J.J. Watson F. Bucknall R.C. Edwards S.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Robinson J.J. Watson F. Bucknall R.C. Edwards S.W. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 8: 247-258Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The fact that these complexes activated increases in intracellular Ca2+ in unprimed cells is indicative that they bind to functionally active receptors on the cell surface. Hence, we conclude that the key event that occurs during priming that allows the primed cell to generate reactive oxidants in response to soluble immune complexes isnot increased complex binding. Indeed, priming results in only small changes in the level of expression of either FcγRII or FcγRIIIb, whereas surface expression of CR3 is greatly up-regulated (44Edwards S.W. Watson F. MacLeod R. Davies J.M. Biosci. Rep. 1990; 10: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We thus searched for events downstream of receptor/ligand binding that may account for the altered functional responses of primed cells. In unprimed cells, the soluble immune complexes activated a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ that was due to mobilization of intracellular stores and was partly sensitive to inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Several other reports have shown that, while intracellular Ca2+ transients are necessary for NADPH oxidase activation, they are in themselves not sufficient to induce activation (45Edwards S.W. Taylor C.D. Humphreys J.M. Gadd G.M. Soulioti A.M.A. Hart C.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 256: 333-343Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 46Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1779-1783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the cells were primed, however, an extra intracellular Ca2+ transient was generated. This arose from influx of Ca2+ from external sources and was also partly sensitive to inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These data indicate that this extra intracellular Ca2+ signal may be due to signals generated via receptors that become “activated” during the priming process. We thus set out to identify these putative receptors. Circulating blood neutrophils possess two types of receptors that recognize IgG-containing immune complexes, namely FcγRII and FcγRIIIb (14Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). FcγRIIIb is linked to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage that can be easily cleaved eitherin vivo or in vitro with Pronase or PI-PLC (15Huizinga T.W.J. van der Schoot C.E. Jost C. Klassen R. Kleijer M. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Tetteroo P.A.T. Roos D. Nature. 1988; 333: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,17Hundt M. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our first experiments thus used Pronase and PI-PLC to deplete the cell surface of FcγRIIIb while not affecting expression of FcγRII. FcγRIIIb-depleted (unprimed) neutrophils could generate intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to soluble immune complexes, and the kinetics of these transients were identical with those observed in untreated (FcγRIIIb-expressing) cells. However, the extra intracellular Ca2+ signal normally observed during priming was not observed after FcγRIIIb depletion. Furthermore, this extra intracellular Ca2+ signal was not observed when primed cells were incubated F(ab′)2 fragments of 3G8 (anti-FcγRIIIb) prior to addition of soluble immune complexes. Taken together, our experiments indicate that in unprimed neutrophils, soluble immune complexes bind to the cell surface via binding to FcγRII and this results in an increase in intracellular Ca2+: this interaction fails to activate the NADPH oxidase. Upon priming, the soluble complexes now generate an extra intracellular Ca2+ signal that arises via the functional activation of FcγRIIIb. This extra Ca2+ signal arises from Ca2+ influx and requires protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Experiments cross-linking individual receptors confirm these conclusions that ligation of FcγRII can elevate intracellular Ca2+ via internal store mobilization in either primed or unprimed cells, whereas ligation of FcγRIIIb can only elevate intracellular Ca2+ via Ca2+ influx in primed cells. If the traces of the intracellular Ca2+ transients generated via ligation of FcγRII and FcγRIIIb are combined, they closely resemble the kinetics of intracellular Ca2+transients observed when primed and unprimed neutrophils are stimulated with soluble immune complexes. It was noteworthy that ligation of either FcγRII or FcγRIIIb failed to activate the synthesis of substantial levels of IP3, in agreement with previous reports (31Walker B.A.M. Hagenlocker B.E. Stubbs Jr., E.B. Sandborg R.R. Agranoff B.W. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rosales C. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5265-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are numerous reports in the literature regarding the interaction of immune complexes with neutrophil Fc receptors, but none have addressed the interaction of soluble complexes with primed and unprimed cells. In our experiments, the intracellular Ca2+transients generated by FcγRII ligation were partly sensitive to inhibition with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, confirming the recently reported association of FcγRII with tyrosine kinase activity (23Richard S. Shaw A.S. Showell H.J. Connelly P.A. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Dusi S. Donini M. Della Bianca V. Gandini G. Rossi F. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13553-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our data also confirm the importance of tyrosine kinase activity and FcγRIIIb function (27Zhou M. Lubin D.M. Link D.C. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13553-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we propose that tyrosine kinase activity becomes associated with FcγRIIIb during priming and regulates Ca2+ influx. We speculate that during priming a Src-like tyrosine kinase (perhaps Hck; Ref. 27Zhou M. Lubin D.M. Link D.C. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13553-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) becomes associated with FcγRIIIb. This could then result in the assembly of a new signaling cassette linking FcγRIIIb ligation to cell activation. Several reports have shown that FcγRIIIb can transduce signals, including intracellular Ca2+ transients independently of FcγRII (28Mackenzie S.J. Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Vossebeld P.J.M. Kessler J. von dem Borne A.E.G.Kr. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10671-10679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Naziruddin B. Duffy B.F. Tucker J. Mohanakumar T. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3702-3709PubMed Google Scholar). A synergistic response of FcγRIIIb and CR3 has previously been reported, whereby CR3 immobilizes FcγRII to the plasma membrane via a cytoskeletal-dependent mechanism and then ligation of FcγRIIIb induces tyrosine activation in the proximity of FcγRII (25Zhou M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In our experiments using synthetic soluble immune complexes, anti-CR3 antibodies do not affect the ability of primed neutrophils to activate a respiratory burst. Thus, the dependence of the response on CR3 may be diminished in primed neutrophils. These studies shed new insights into the mechanisms by which soluble immune complexes activate neutrophils in pathological conditions that may result in tissue damage. There is much interest in the pharmacological down-regulation of neutrophil function in inflammatory conditions, but any therapy designed to interfere with neutrophil-mediated responses must be selective; such therapy must specifically block the harmful consequences of neutrophil activation that lead to tissue damage (e.g. result in secretion of cytotoxic products) but not compromise opsono-phagocytosis and host defense against infections. It is interesting to note that individuals with FcγRIIIb deficiency are often asymptomatic and do not generally suffer recurrent infections (47Veys P.A. Wilkes S.A. Hoffbrand A.V. Blood. 1991; 78: 852-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48De Haas M. Kliejer M. Van Zwieten R. Roos D. van dem Borne A.E.K. Blood. 1995; 86: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we predict that neutrophils from these individuals will not be able to secrete reactive oxygen metabolites in response to soluble immune complexes, and thus it will be necessary to test this hypothesis using neutrophils from these individuals. If correct, then our data offer the possibility that selective inhibition of the signaling pathway from FcγRIIIb/soluble immune complex ligation to activation of the NADPH oxidase could provide the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of immune disorders involving soluble immune complexes and primed neutrophils."

Following the conventional chemical rules of the direct-readout mechanism, amino acid mutagenesis at position 187 yielded several new base preferences for the protein. Specific interactions between proteins and DNA are critical to gene expression and regulation, so a general readout mechanism of the information encoded in DNA has been sought (1Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 2Lehming N. Sartorius J. Kisters-Woike B. von Wilcken-Bergmann B. Müller-Hill B.

However, a number of complex structures of DNA duplexes and proteins determined at atomic resolution have revealed that nature uses a great variety of readout mechanisms (4Otwinowski Z. Schevitz R.W.

Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In most complex structures, the direct-readout mechanism is mediated by intermolecular hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic interactions between DNA duplexes and proteins. The interaction modes have been classified into: (i) the intrinsic chemical features of bases and amino acids (1Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 3Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki M. Yagi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and (ii) the stereochemical relations between the amino acids and the bases inside the DNA major grooves (12Suzuki M. Yagi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the indirect-readout mechanism works in several systems, such as the trp repressor/operator (4Otwinowski Z. Schevitz R.W. Zhang R.-G. Lawson C.L. Joachimiak A. Marmorstein R.Q. Luisi B.F. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 5Lawson C.L. Carey J. Nature. 1993; 366: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), where the DNA bases are specifically recognized by proteins without the use of particular hydrogen bonds or non-polar contacts. Instead, each sequence-dependent deformation of the DNA conformation stabilizes the characteristic geometry of the phosphate backbone, which directly interacts with the protein through polar contacts (6Travers A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 71-77Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Water molecules are often observed to mediate the specific interaction through additional hydrogen bonds (4Otwinowski Z. Schevitz R.W. Zhang R.-G. Lawson C.L. Joachimiak A. Marmorstein R.Q. Luisi B.F. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 5Lawson C.L. Carey J. Nature. 1993; 366: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One common type of DNA deformation is a steep kink of the duplex (7Winkler F.K. Banner D.W. Oefner C. Tsernoglou D. Brown R.S. Heathman S.P. Bryan R.K. Martin P.D. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1781-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 8Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B.

Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), which substantially contributes to readout of the minor groove (8Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In general, a combination of the direct- and indirect-readout mechanisms results in specific base pair recognition. In other words, both the specific binding affinity and the DNA bending contribute to the free energy of complex formation (6Travers A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 71-77Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This situation has made it difficult to determine how each consensus base sequence is recognized by the corresponding protein, even when the precise complex structure is known. The c-myb gene product (c-Myb) is a transcriptional activator that specifically binds to DNA fragments containing the consensus sequence PyAAC(G/T)G, where Py indicates a pyrimidine (15Biedenkapp H.

The DNA-binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA-binding domain; MBS, Myb-binding DNA sequence. of c-Myb consists of three imperfect 51- or 52-residue repeats (designated R1, R2, and R3 from the N terminus) (18Gonda T.J.

A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The last two repeats, R2 and R3, are sufficient for the recognition of the specific DNA sequences (20Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NMR analysis revealed that both R2 and R3 contain three helices, and the third helix in each is a recognition helix (22Ogata K. Hojo H. Aimoto S. Nakai T. Nakamura H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6428-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Ogata K. Morikawa S.

R2 and R3 are closely packed in the major groove, so that the two recognition helices directly contact each other to bind cooperatively to the specific base sequence. In the complex of c-Myb R2R3 with the Myb-binding DNA sequence (MBS-I), the consensus A4, the counterpart guanine of C6, and the last G8 directly interact with Asn183 in R3, Lys182 in R3, and Lys128 in R2, respectively (Fig. 1) (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The strong cooperativity between R2 and R3 originates from the putative polar interactions between the side chains of Glu132 and Asn179, and between those of Arg131 and Asp178. However, it is not clear why the initial Py corresponding to the third base position in the MBS-I fragment is preferred by c-Myb R2R3, although this Py3 is less specific than the other A4, A5, C6, and G8 sites in the consensus DNA sequence (17Tanikawa J.

In our NMR structure shown in Fig. 1, Ser187 is the only candidate that interacts with the T3 base, and this ability was suggested in our previous paper (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group in the Ser side chain could form a hydrogen bond with the O4 oxygen of the T3 base, either directly or through water molecules. Thus far, the Myb-homologous DBD has been found in over 30 proteins from many species. An alignment of the DBDs shows that the Ser at position 187 is highly conserved in the animal sequences, whereas it is variable in the plant sequences (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A.

Here, to investigate the role of Ser187 and the origin of this pyrimidine preference at the third base position, both Ser187 in the c-Myb R2R3 and the third T-A base pair in the 22-mer MBS-I fragment containing the Myb-binding site were substituted by other amino acids and other base pairs, respectively. The interactions between them were examined using a filter binding assay, whose efficiency has already been shown (17Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K. Nishimura Y. Ishii S. Sarai A. Proc.

The recognition mechanism will be discussed. A DNA fragment encompassing R2R3 (Leu90–Val193) in the DNA-binding domain of c-Myb was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using pact-c-myb (28Nishina Y. Nakagoshi H. Imamoto F. Gonda T.J.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by two-step polymerase chain reaction, as described by Higuchi (29Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-88Crossref Google Scholar). Here the name of each mutant protein is indicated as, for example, C130I/S187G for the simultaneous mutations that replace Cys130 with Ile and Ser187 with Gly. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the wild type and mutant plasmids (30Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Freshly precultivated cells were inoculated into growth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and were grown at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A 600 of about 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were cultured at 22 °C for another 12 h. The harvested cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 mmMgCl2, and were lysed by sonication at 4 °C. After the cell debris was removed by centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 50% saturation. After an incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm NaCl, and was then applied to a phosphocellulose column (Whatman, P11). The purified fractions were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged to 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm KCl. The protein concentrations were determined from UV absorption at 280 nm and were calculated by using the molar absorption coefficient of 3.7 × 104m−1cm−1 (17Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured at 20 °C on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a water-circulating cell holder. The spectra were obtained in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm KCl, using a 0.2-cm optical path length cell. The protein concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. CD spectra between 200 and 250 nm were obtained using a scanning speed of 20 nm/min, a time response of 1 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and an average over 8 scans.

The purified DNA was suspended in STE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and complementary strands were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The labeled DNAs were purified by passage through spin columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., HR-300). Here the name of each variant DNA is indicated as, for example, [C3]MBS-I, for the substitution of the T-A base pair at the third position by a C-G base pair. All filter binding assays for the protein-DNA binding were carried out essentially as described (32Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeois S. J. Mol.

[32P]DNA and various amounts of the c-Myb R2R3 mutant proteins were incubated in 100 μl of binding buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 20 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) on ice for 30 min. The final concentration of the [32P]DNA in binding buffer was 0.4 nm, which was always a lower concentration than the K d value. The incubated samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, BA-85, 0.45 μm) in approximately 10 s with suction. The filters were dried and counted by a liquid scintillation counter. The equilibrium dissociation constantsK d were obtained from the binding titration curve, based on the least square fitting to the normalized bound DNA (y) with the protein concentration (x) using the formula, y = x/(x +K d). Prior to the mutational analyses of Ser187, the Cys130 in R2, which is the only cysteine residue in the c-Myb R2R3 and is located at a position equivalent to an isoleucine in R3, was replaced with Ile, to facilitate the protein purification and the DNA-binding assay (35Guehmann S. Vorbrueggen G. Kalkbrenner F. Moelling K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was reported that this mutation has little effect on DNA binding (36Myrset A.H. Bostad A. Jamin N. Lirsac P.-N. Toma F. Gabrielsen O.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The affinity of the C130I mutant was also measured in our own assay system, and it was shown to be almost equal to that of the wild type, and to maintain the pyrimidine preference at the third base position (Table I).Table IDissociation constants for the cognate 22-mer MBS-I fragments and the third base-pair substituted variants with the Ser187-substituted mutantsProteinK dT3C3A3G3nMWild-type1-aAn additional Met-Ala-sequence was introduced at the N terminus of R2R3, which was used in the NMR experiment (23).3.23.78.725C130I5.55.71227C130I/S187G18173337C130I/S187A9.3122224C130I/S187T15112136C130I/S187N26371553C130I/S187Q36395439C130I/S187V138.93734C130I/S187L13073≥10372C130I/S187K6122≥10336C130I/S187R4322≥10321C130I/S187D≥103≥103≥103≥1031-a An additional Met-Ala-sequence was introduced at the N terminus of R2R3, which was used in the NMR experiment (23Ogata K.

Open table in a new tab A series of 10 amino acids, Gly, Ala, Thr, Asn, Gln, Val, Leu, Lys Arg, and Asp, were introduced into position 187 of the c-Myb R2R3, which is a Ser residue in the wild type. The purity of each mutant protein was about 95%, as monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All of the mutant proteins have secondary structure contents similar to the wild type, as confirmed by the CD spectra at the far UV region (Fig.3). The perfect coincidence of all the spectra suggests that the global tertiary structures of the mutant proteins were not deformed. The binding affinities of the mutants to the cognate 22-mer MBS-I fragments and the third base pair substituted variants were analyzed using the filter binding assay, and the results are summarized in TableI. All measurements were repeated at least twice, and typical experimental errors for the K d value were less than 10%, although the retention efficiency was 20 ± 10% depending on the experimental conditions. From the methylation interference experiments (17Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K. Nishimura Y. Ishii S. Sarai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the NMR analyses (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the number of bound DNA duplexes per the c-Myb is considered to be one within the concentration used in this assay. As already indicated in the previous experiments (17Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K. Nishimura Y. Ishii S. Sarai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Takeda Y. Sarai A Rivera V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1989; 86: 6513-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the filter binding assay was validated for this investigation. The C130I/S187G mutant protein binds about one-third less strongly to the cognate MBS-I than the standard C130I mutant. The relative binding free energy change for the replacement of Ser with Gly, calculated from the K d values, is 0.65 kcal/mol. It should correspond to the free energy derived from the interaction between the Ser side chain and the T3 base. This Gly mutant preferentially binds to both the cognate [T3]MBS-I and the substituted [C3]MBS-I. That is, even when residue 187 has no side chain, the mutant protein prefers the third pyrimidine as well as the wild type and the C130I mutant proteins. The substitutions of Ser187 by Ala (C130I/S187A), Thr (C130I/S187T), or Val (C130I/S187V) reveal slightly reduced binding affinities, although the sequence specificities are retained like the standard C130I. In contrast, the C130I/S187N mutant preferentially binds to the [A3]MBS-I. The affinity for the A3 base is similar to that of the wild type, although those for the other three bases (T, C, and G) are greatly reduced, by approximately one-half to one-sixth. The specific interaction between the Asn residue and the A3 base closely follows the intrinsic chemical features. Interestingly, for the substitution by Gln, which is one methylene group longer than Asn, the C130I/S187Q mutant loses the preference for the A3 base. Also, in the case of the C130I/S187L mutant, in which Leu is one methylene group longer than Val, the binding affinity is greatly reduced. The mutant proteins C130I/S187K and C130I/S187R, which introduced basic amino acids into position 187, specifically prefer to bind to the [G3]MBS-I and [C3]MBS-I variants. In contrast, for the substitution of Ser187 by acidic Asp (C130I/S187D), the binding affinity is completely reduced and is no longer sequence-specific. Thus far, many amino acid replacements in the c-Myb R2R3 have been created and assayed by specific DNA binding (37Saikumar P. Murali R. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 39Frampton J. Gibson T.J. Ness S.A. Doderlein G. Graf T. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and almost all of their effects have been explained by the specific polar contacts between the R2R3 and the DNA in the three-dimensional structure of the R2R3-DNA complex (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The current mutational study clearly indicates that residue 187 in R2R3 is also able to interact with the T3 base, as estimated from the geometry of Ser187 in the NMR complex structure (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This specific DNA-binding mode is very different from the telomeric DNA recognition by the yeast RAP1-DBD (40König P. Giraldo R. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Cell. 1996; 85: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whose amino acid sequence is weakly homologous to that of the c-Myb R2R3. However, the substitution of Ser187 with Gly, Ala, or Val unexpectedly resulted in only about a 3-fold decrease in the binding affinity toward any base, which would be a consequence of a direct-readout mechanism, while the pyrimidine base preference at the third position in the MBS-I fragment was retained. Ser is thought to have weak specificity, because its side chain can act as either a hydrogen bond donor or an acceptor, and thus can bind to any base. Nevertheless, Ser187 of the R2R3 preferentially binds to the pyrimidine bases. If this interaction were attributable only to the direct-readout mechanism, then the substitution of Ser187should have resulted in an over 100-fold reduction of the binding affinity and a loss of the sequence specificity, like the substitution of Lys128 by Ala (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and those of Asn136 and Asn186 by Ala (38Gabrielsen O.S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Science. 1991; 253: 1140-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the preference of the pyrimidine bases at the third position of MBS-I should occur primarily by an indirect-readout mechanism. In our previous structural study, no distinct deformation of the global DNA conformation was observed (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, when the local bending of the DNA duplex was carefully analyzed in 25 NMR complex structures and the refined average structure (Protein Data Bank codes 1MSF and 1MSE, respectively), significantly positive roll angles were always observed between the third pyrimidine and the fourth purine, as indicated by anarrow in Fig. 4. Characteristic negative slides (−1.1 ± 0.3 Å) were also observed at the same pyrimidine-purine step, corresponding to positive rolling, while the twist angles at this step were 34.1 ± 2.3°, nearly equal to the twist angle in standard B-form DNA. Similar significant, positive rolls at pyrimidine-purine steps are general phenomena (42Suzuki M. Yagi N. Gerstein M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), observed in many complex crystal structures of repressors and homeodomains with the helix-turn-helix motif, as summarized in Table II. In every case, as a part of the consensus base sequence, the base pair roll bends the DNA so that the recognition helix is wrapped by the DNA duplex in the major groove (3Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar,42Suzuki M. Yagi N. Gerstein M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Schultz S.C.

Biol. 1991; 219: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Consequently, a large contact area is created between the recognition helix and the DNA major groove, facilitating the preferable polar contacts between the protein side chains and the DNA phosphate backbone. The local roll in the MBS-I fragment may be associated with the small magnitude of observed bending in long DNA duplexes bound with the c-Myb R2R3 (52Saikumar P. Gabriel J.L. Reddy E.P Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1279-1287PubMed Google Scholar). This bending may be enhanced by other regions in the protein, like the transactivation domain.Table IISignificant roll angles of DNA duplexes at the pyrimidine-purine steps in the protein-DNA crystal structures with the helix-turn-helix motifProtein-DNA (PDB/resolution)Pyrimidine-purine step2-aThe residue and chain identifiers are those as registered in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).Roll2-bThe roll angles were calculated using the program rna (41).

Open table in a new tab Due to the intrinsic propeller-twist of the DNA base pairs, the pyrimidine-purine step has two stable conformations, with rolling of 0° and around 10° (53Calladine C.R. Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 54Nelson H.C.M. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), from the physical requirements of the base stacking (55Calladine C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 161: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). There is negligible additional free energy cost required for the 10° rolling at the pyrimidine-purine step, even for a free DNA duplex without a protein. This is the physical origin of the so-called “bendability” of kinked DNA duplexes, commonly observed in the minor groove readout mechanism (8Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 9Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). At the other pyrimidine-pyrimidine, purine-purine, and purine-pyrimidine steps, no such tendency toward a strongly bistable step is observed (53Calladine C.R. Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In fact, the binding free energy differences between the pyrimidine bases and the purine bases at the third base position for the current Gly187, Ala187, and Val187 mutants are 0.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, as calculated from the dissociation constants in Table I. Fig. 5 shows the results of the relative binding free energy changes ΔΔG toward the C130I/S187G mutant: ΔΔG = ΔG bind (mutant against the third N base) − ΔG bind (C130I/S187G against the same third N base), where ΔG bind =RT ln K d. Here, the difference was calculated while keeping the same third position base pair. We can now separate the bendability effect from the total binding free energies between the c-Myb R2R3 mutants and the variety of DNA sequences, unless the binding modes vary from the wild type. Each positive and negative free energy corresponds to a decrease and an increase of the binding affinity, depending upon the intrinsic chemical features of the amino acids and the bases, and subtracting the DNA bending effect. For the Ala substitution, the binding affinity is increased as compared with Gly187, independent of the bases at the third position, probably due to the hydrophobic contacts. When the side chain volume is larger in the Val substitution, a similar binding affinity to the pyrimidines remains, but the affinity becomes neutral to the purines. Therefore, the volume of space created between residue 187 and the third base may allow at most the Val-pyrimidine pair, but the Val-purine pair would be slightly too large for the space. In fact, other amino acids, such as Leu and Gln, with larger side chain volumes than Val, significantly lack binding affinity, as indicated in Fig. 5. Moreover, the Val-, Leu-, and Gln-substituted mutants always have lower affinities for adenine than for guanine. This is also supported by the fact that the amino N6 of adenine occupies a larger volume than the oxygen O6 of guanine, which should be located at the position nearest to the side chain of residue 187. From this consideration of the space volume around residue 187 and the third base, the native and the optimum interaction between Ser187 and T3 should be mediated by water molecules, as long as the binding mode is assumed to be the same in all of the mutant proteins and DNAs. In the Thr mutant, the disposition of the water molecules could be different from that in the wild type, thus yielding a slight decrease in the binding affinity. Since there is no possible conformation on the helix in which the methyl group of the Thr side chain would be able to access the methyl group in T3, as shown in a modeling study, a specific non-polar contact between the Thr mutant and T3 is not expected. Following the conventional chemical rules for specific binding between amino acids and bases (1Seeman N.C. Rosenberg J.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 3Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki M. Yagi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the current Asn mutant specifically binds to the A3 base relative to the other bases, as indicated in Fig.5. The Asn side chain size is less than that of Val, and there should be enough space for the Asn-adenine pair, resulting in the formation of direct hydrogen bonds with a free energy gain of about 0.5 kcal/mol. In addition, the Lys and Arg mutant proteins prefer to bind to the G3 base. From their intrinsic chemical nature, both basic amino acids can bind to the guanine base almost exclusively by electrostatic interaction. In contrast, these mutant proteins bind to the [A3]MBS-I and [T3]MBS-I bases with only weak affinity, probably because of the bulky side chains of the amino acids, like the Leu mutant. It is interesting that their long side chains seem to interact with the guanine base on the opposite side of C3. The acidic Asp substitution results in a severe reduction of its DNA binding, which is much lower than the Gly substitution, suggesting that the Asp side chain cannot interact with any base, including cytosine, in this geometry. Rather, the negative ionic charge may disturb other specific hydrogen bonds between the protein and the DNA. The wild type protein and the C130I mutant with Ser187 bind to the cognate DNA most tightly among the mutant proteins, and theirK d values are in the nanomolar order. Generally, transcriptional regulator proteins bind to their target genes with greater affinity (57Spolar R.S. Record Jr., T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the conservation of Ser in position 187 of c-Myb among animal species (23Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In contrast, among plant species, the amino acid in this position varies (25Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This suggests that the recognition mode in the plant Myb homologues may be different from that of the c-Myb DBD from animal species. In fact, in the case of the yeast RAP1 domain 1, the corresponding Val409 residue does not interact with the DNA in the complex structure (40König P. Giraldo R. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Cell. 1996; 85: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), although the free domain structure is similar to that of the c-Myb R3. In conclusion, the current mutational analysis revealed that the pyrimidine preference of the native c-Myb DBD for the initial base of the consensus sequence originates principally in the intrinsic positive roll at the pyrimidine-purine step of the DNA duplex. For the purine-purine step, as much as 0.4 kcal/mol of additional free energy would be necessary, corresponding to the bendability. When these bending energies are separated, the conventional chemical rules between the amino acids and the bases are distinctively observed in the c-Myb R2R3 mutants. It is still difficult to extract a definite “recognition code” from the variety of DNA information readout mechanisms. The situation becomes much more complicated when the DNA flexibility is considered. Only a screening technology, such as a phage display library (58Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11163-11167Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 59Choo Y. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11168-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 60Reber E.J. Pabo C.O. Science. 1994; 263: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), would be expected to reveal a novel, specific form of DNA recognition, instead of an artificial molecular design. However, based upon the complex structure and the mutational analysis, one may be able to dissect the sequence specific affinity into the DNA bendability and the specific interaction between the amino acids and the bases. Without this kind of precise analysis, we may never reach a complete understanding of the readout mechanism, nor produce any novel devices for molecular readout."
