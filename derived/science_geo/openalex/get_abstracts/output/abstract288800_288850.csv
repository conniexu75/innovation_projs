https://openalex.org/W2168604508,"Tree turnover rates were assessed at 40 tropical forest sites. Averaged across inventoried forests, turnover, as measured by tree mortality and recruitment, has increased since the 1950s, with an apparent pantropical acceleration since 1980. Among 22 mature forest sites with two or more inventory periods, forest turnover also increased. The trend in forest dynamics may have profound effects on biological diversity."

After adjustment for demographic differences, recruitment patterns explained over 90 percent of the spatial variation in abundance of a common damselfish among seven coral reefs. The age structures from individual reefs also preserved major temporal variations in the recruitment signal over at least 10 years. Abundance and demography of this small fish at these spatial and temporal scales can be explained almost entirely as variable recruitment interacting with density-independent mortality."
https://openalex.org/W1982308279,We have observed the production of strings (disclination lines and loops) via the Kibble mechanism of domain (bubble) formation in the isotropic to nematic phase transition of a sample of uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. The probablity of string formation per bubble is measured to be $0.33 \pm 0.01$. This is in good agreement with the theoretical value $1/ \pi$ expected in two dimensions for the order parameter space $S^2/{\bf Z}_2$ of a simple uniaxial nematic liquid crystal.
https://openalex.org/W1983203464,"The crystal structure of superconducting Na(2)CsC(60) was studied by high-resolution powder neutron diffraction between 1.6 and 425 K. Contrary to the literature, the structure at low temperatures is primitive cubic [See equation in the PDF file], isostructural with pristine C(60). Anticlockwise rotation of the C(60) units by 98 degrees about [111] allows simultaneous optimization of C(60)-C(60) and alkali-fulleride interactions. Optimal Na(+)-C(60)(3-) coordination is achieved with each sodium ion located above one hexagon face and three hexagon-hexagon fusions of neighboring fulleride ions (coordination number 12). Reduction of the C(60) molecule lengthens the hexagon-hexagon fusions and shortens the pentagon-hexagon fusions (to approximately 1.43 angstroms). On heating, Na(2)CsC(60) undergoes a phase transition to a face-centered-cubic [See equation in the PDF file] phase, best modeled as containing quasi-spherical C(60)(3-) ions. The modified structure and intermolecular potential provide an additional dimension to the behavior of superconducting fullerides and should sensitively affect their electronic and conducting properties."
https://openalex.org/W2063841646,"The inversion of previously reported, delay-Doppler images of Castalia yields a 167-parameter, three-dimensional shape model that is bifurcated into two distinct, irregular, kilometer-sized lobes. The crevice that separates the lobes has an average depth of between 100 and 150 meters and is oriented roughly perpendicular to the asteroid's longest dimension. The constrained least-squares reconstruction method introduced here can be used to determine the shape, spin vector, and radar-scattering properties of any asteroid or comet for which delay-Doppler images provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, orientational coverage, and spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2087527639,"The electron transfer through an organized organic monolayer of alkyl chains adsorbed on a silicon wafer has been studied. The silicon was used as an electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell, and the current versus voltage response was measured. The results show that when the chains in the monolayer are in the ""all trans"" configuration, the charge transfer efficiency is higher than when the chains have a ""gauche"" configuration. A mechanism rationalizing all the observations is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1973880050,"Evidence is beginning to accumulate that human development of coastlines and overfishing may be having deleterious effects on marine biodiversity. Although some biologists doubt marine extinctions, the possibility is being taken seriously by scientific organizations, who have been sponsoring conferences and workshops on the changing diversity of the oceans. Four federal agencies (NSF, NOAA, the Office of Naval Research, and DOE) have banded together to sponsor a National Research Council initiative to chart a research agenda."
https://openalex.org/W2087013069,"Researchers have found that the turnover rate for tropical trees has increased worldwide. The increasing turnover corresponds with the buildup of atmospheric CO[sub 2] over an equivalent time period. Changes in temperature, nutrient availability, and insolation could produce similar results. The long-term effect of increased turnover is likely to be a decrease in tropical diversity."

https://openalex.org/W1977155744,"California desperately needs a place to store as much as 5.5 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste over the next 30 years. Ward Valley, a barren stretch of the Mojave Desert located some 250 miles east of Los Angeles, was supposed to be that place. Last year, trenches dug in the arid, seismically stable valley were supposed to be that place. Last year, trenches dug in the arid, seismically stable valley were supposed to begin holding wastes like the gadolinium-153 used to detect osteoporosis and the selenium-75 used to study proteins, as well as wastes from nuclear power plants. But construction crews haven't even begun to dig, because Ward Valley has become ground zero in the fierce national debate over radioactive waste disposal. Lawsuits filed by opponents, who fear the waste will contaminate the environment, and the intervention of influential politicians such as Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) have blocked the Interior Department from selling the federally owned Ward Valley land to California to begin construction. As a result, universities, biotechnology companies, and hospitals may be stuck with wastes piling up at their institutions, which could have repercussions."

https://openalex.org/W2048937507,"Laboratories around the world plan to send beams of neutrinos on journeys to distant detectors in an effort to find out whether these elusive particles have mass. These experiments will generate beams of neutrinos and send them through kilometers of solid rock, to be captured at the other end. Researchers will be looking for evidence that neutrinos can switch identities among the three types. Evidence of identity changes would imply a mass for at least one of the three types."
