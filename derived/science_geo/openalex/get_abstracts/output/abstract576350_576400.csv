https://openalex.org/W2564456678,"It has recently been demonstrated that inference methods based on genealogical processes with recombination can uncover past population history in unprecedented detail. However, these methods scale poorly with sample size, limiting resolution in the recent past, and they require phased genomes, which contain switch errors that can catastrophically distort the inferred history. Here we present SMC++, a new statistical tool capable of analyzing orders of magnitude more samples than existing methods while requiring only unphased genomes (its results are independent of phasing). SMC++ can jointly infer population size histories and split times in diverged populations, and it employs a novel spline regularization scheme that greatly reduces estimation error. We apply SMC++ to analyze sequence data from over a thousand human genomes in Africa and Eurasia, hundreds of genomes from a Drosophila melanogaster population in Africa, and tens of genomes from zebra finch and long-tailed finch populations in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2562998505,"The removal of unwanted or damaged mitochondria by autophagy, a process called mitophagy, is essential for key events in development, cellular homeostasis, tumor suppression, and prevention of neurodegeneration and aging. However, the precise mechanisms of mitophagy remain uncertain. Here, we identify the inner mitochondrial membrane protein, prohibitin 2 (PHB2), as a crucial mitophagy receptor involved in targeting mitochondria for autophagic degradation. PHB2 binds the autophagosomal membrane-associated protein LC3 through an LC3-interaction region (LIR) domain upon mitochondrial depolarization and proteasome-dependent outer membrane rupture. PHB2 is required for Parkin-induced mitophagy in mammalian cells and for the clearance of paternal mitochondria after embryonic fertilization in C. elegans. Our findings pinpoint a conserved mechanism of eukaryotic mitophagy and demonstrate a function of prohibitin 2 that may underlie its roles in physiology, aging, and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2561697517,"Signaling receptors dynamically exit cilia upon activation of signaling pathways such as Hedgehog. Here, we find that when activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) fail to undergo BBSome-mediated retrieval from cilia back into the cell, these GPCRs concentrate into membranous buds at the tips of cilia before release into extracellular vesicles named ectosomes. Unexpectedly, actin and the actin regulators drebrin and myosin 6 mediate ectosome release from the tip of cilia. Mirroring signal-dependent retrieval, signal-dependent ectocytosis is a selective and effective process that removes activated signaling molecules from cilia. Congruently, ectocytosis compensates for BBSome defects as ectocytic removal of GPR161, a negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling, permits the appropriate transduction of Hedgehog signals in Bbs mutants. Finally, ciliary receptors that lack retrieval determinants such as the anorexigenic GPCR NPY2R undergo signal-dependent ectocytosis in wild-type cells. Our data show that signal-dependent ectocytosis regulates ciliary signaling in physiological and pathological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2564262333,"Mammalian tissues rely on a variety of nutrients to support their physiological functions. It is known that altered metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, but which nutrients support the inappropriate growth of intact malignant tumors is incompletely understood. Amino acids are essential nutrients for many cancer cells that can be obtained through the scavenging and catabolism of extracellular protein via macropinocytosis. In particular, macropinocytosis can be a nutrient source for pancreatic cancer cells, but it is not fully understood how the tumor environment influences metabolic phenotypes and whether macropinocytosis supports the maintenance of amino acid levels within pancreatic tumors. Here we utilize miniaturized plasma exchange to deliver labeled albumin to tissues in live mice, and we demonstrate that breakdown of albumin contributes to the supply of free amino acids in pancreatic tumors. We also deliver albumin directly into tumors using an implantable microdevice, which was adapted and modified from ref. 9. Following implantation, we directly observe protein catabolism and macropinocytosis in situ by pancreatic cancer cells, but not by adjacent, non-cancerous pancreatic tissue. In addition, we find that intratumoral inhibition of macropinocytosis decreases amino acid levels. Taken together, these data suggest that pancreatic cancer cells consume extracellular protein, including albumin, and that this consumption serves as an important source of amino acids for pancreatic cancer cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2567210166,"Lymphatic vessels are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and are critical for health. However, the role of metabolism in lymphatic development has not yet been elucidated. Here we report that in transgenic mouse models, LEC-specific loss of CPT1A, a rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation, impairs lymphatic development. LECs use fatty acid β-oxidation to proliferate and for epigenetic regulation of lymphatic marker expression during LEC differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor PROX1 upregulates CPT1A expression, which increases acetyl coenzyme A production dependent on fatty acid β-oxidation. Acetyl coenzyme A is used by the histone acetyltransferase p300 to acetylate histones at lymphangiogenic genes. PROX1-p300 interaction facilitates preferential histone acetylation at PROX1-target genes. Through this metabolism-dependent mechanism, PROX1 mediates epigenetic changes that promote lymphangiogenesis. Notably, blockade of CPT1 enzymes inhibits injury-induced lymphangiogenesis, and replenishing acetyl coenzyme A by supplementing acetate rescues this process in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2566688801,"In vivo reprogramming is a promising approach for tissue regeneration in response to injury. Several examples of in vivo reprogramming have been reported in a variety of lineages, but some including skeletal muscle have so far proven refractory. Here, we show that acute and chronic injury enables transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming in skeletal muscle. Lineage tracing indicates that this response frequently originates from Pax7+ muscle stem cells. Injury is associated with accumulation of senescent cells, and advanced aging or local irradiation further enhanced in vivo reprogramming, while selective elimination of senescent cells reduced reprogramming efficiency. The effect of senescence appears to be, at least in part, due to the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6), suggesting a potential link with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Collectively, our findings highlight a beneficial paracrine effect of injury-induced senescence on cellular plasticity, which will be important for devising strategies for reprogramming-based tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2566843361,"Variability in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines remains a concern for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. We have used RNA-sequencing analysis and linear mixed models to examine the sources of gene expression variability in 317 human iPSC lines from 101 individuals. We found that ∼50% of genome-wide expression variability is explained by variation across individuals and identified a set of expression quantitative trait loci that contribute to this variation. These analyses coupled with allele-specific expression show that iPSCs retain a donor-specific gene expression pattern. Network, pathway, and key driver analyses showed that Polycomb targets contribute significantly to the non-genetic variability seen within and across individuals, highlighting this chromatin regulator as a likely source of reprogramming-based variability. Our findings therefore shed light on variation between iPSC lines and illustrate the potential for our dataset and other similar large-scale analyses to identify underlying drivers relevant to iPSC applications."
https://openalex.org/W2564133151,"Controlled distribution of lipids across various cell membranes is crucial for cell homeostasis and regulation. We developed an imaging method that allows simultaneous in situ quantification of cholesterol in two leaflets of the plasma membrane (PM) using tunable orthogonal cholesterol sensors. Our imaging revealed marked transbilayer asymmetry of PM cholesterol (TAPMC) in various mammalian cells, with the concentration in the inner leaflet (IPM) being ∼12-fold lower than that in the outer leaflet (OPM). The asymmetry was maintained by active transport of cholesterol from IPM to OPM and its chemical retention at OPM. Furthermore, the increase in the IPM cholesterol level was triggered in a stimulus-specific manner, allowing cholesterol to serve as a signaling lipid. We found excellent correlation between the IPM cholesterol level and cellular Wnt signaling activity, suggesting that TAPMC and stimulus-induced PM cholesterol redistribution are crucial for tight regulation of cellular processes under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2564191431,"In familial pulmonary arterial hypertension (FPAH), the autosomal dominant disease-causing BMPR2 mutation is only 20% penetrant, suggesting that genetic variation provides modifiers that alleviate the disease. Here, we used comparison of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) from three families with unaffected mutation carriers (UMCs), FPAH patients, and gender-matched controls to investigate this variation. Our analysis identified features of UMC iPSC-ECs related to modifiers of BMPR2 signaling or to differentially expressed genes. FPAH-iPSC-ECs showed reduced adhesion, survival, migration, and angiogenesis compared to UMC-iPSC-ECs and control cells. The ""rescued"" phenotype of UMC cells was related to an increase in specific BMPR2 activators and/or a reduction in inhibitors, and the improved cell adhesion could be attributed to preservation of related signaling. The improved survival was related to increased BIRC3 and was independent of BMPR2. Our findings therefore highlight protective modifiers for FPAH that could help inform development of future treatment strategies."

As threat intensity increases, fear transitions from discriminative to generalized. The circuit mechanisms that process threats of different intensity are not well resolved.

Defensive behavioral responses to threatening stimuli involve both innate and adaptive processes (Anderson and Adolphs, 2014Anderson D.J. Adolphs R.

Neuronal circuits for fear and anxiety.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The amygdala is a key brain region that serves as an integration point for sensory and affective information from cortical and thalamic brain regions to promote defensive behavior and threat-related learning (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (6169) Google Scholar). Within the amygdala, information processing and behavioral output occur through highly interconnected subdivisions defined by distinct cell types (Janak and Tye, 2015Janak P.H. Tye K.M. From circuits to behaviour in the amygdala.Nature. 2015; 517: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). While considerable progress has been made in establishing basic circuitry underlying fear-related behavior, a major unresolved question is how threats of different intensity are processed by this circuitry to give rise to adaptive discriminative fear in response to low-to-moderate threats and the maladaptive processes that lead to generalized fear in response to high-intensity threats. One possibility is that distinct neural circuit components or signaling pathways provide gain control to fine-tune temporal precision in discriminative processes, and that high-intensity signals bypass this gain control to promote aberrant learning and stimulus generalization. Neuropeptides are of particular interest in gain control due to their ability to modulate synaptic strength (Rosen and Schulkin, 1998Rosen J.B. Schulkin J. From normal fear to pathological anxiety.Psychol. Rev. 1998; 105: 325-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, Keifer et al., 2015Keifer Jr., O.P. Hurt R.C. Ressler K.J. Marvar P.J. The physiology of fear: reconceptualizing the role of the central amygdala in fear learning.Physiology (Bethesda). 2015; 30: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar). Support for the graded dependency of neuropeptides in the modulation of behavioral responses to a noxious threat has been shown in spinal cord circuitry (Lichtman and Fanselow, 1991Lichtman A.H. Fanselow M.S. Opioid and nonopioid conditional analgesia: the role of spinal opioid, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems.Behav. Neurosci. 1991; 105: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but whether this occurs within the brain is not clear. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is rich in the expression of neuropeptides (Cassell et al., 1986Cassell M.D. Gray T.S. Kiss J.Z.

Neurol. 1986; 246: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Many of these peptides have been shown to modulate threat-related behaviors and are thought to allow for complex bidirectional control over a variety of defensive responses (Davis et al., 2010Davis M. Walker D.L. Miles L. Grillon C.

Behav. 2012; 107: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Of the neuropeptides expressed in the CeA, CRF is the most often associated with fear-related behaviors (Gafford and Ressler, 2015Gafford G.M. Ressler K.J. GABA and NMDA receptors in CRF neurons have opposing effects in fear acquisition and anxiety in central amygdala vs. bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.Horm. Behav. 2015; 76: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that previous studies designed to assess the function of CRF signaling in the brain for modulating defensive behavior yielded conflicting results, with one study demonstrating a key role for CRF (Swerdlow et al., 1989Swerdlow N.R. Britton K.T. Koob G.F. Potentiation of acoustic startle by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and by fear are both reversed by α-helical CRF (9-41).Neuropsychopharmacology. 1989; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and a second study using a similar strategy finding no effect (de Jongh et al., 2003de Jongh R. Groenink L. van der Gugten J. Olivier B. Light-enhanced and fear-potentiated startle: temporal characteristics and effects of α-helical corticotropin-releasing hormone.Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these differences may relate to the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus (US) (de Jongh et al., 2003de Jongh R. Groenink L. van der Gugten J. Olivier B. Light-enhanced and fear-potentiated startle: temporal characteristics and effects of α-helical corticotropin-releasing hormone.Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), such that threat conditioning with a weaker US (Swerdlow et al., 1989Swerdlow N.R. Britton K.T. Koob G.F. Potentiation of acoustic startle by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and by fear are both reversed by α-helical CRF (9-41).Neuropsychopharmacology. 1989; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) is more sensitive to CRF manipulation than conditioning with a higher-intensity US (de Jongh et al., 2003de Jongh R. Groenink L. van der Gugten J. Olivier B. Light-enhanced and fear-potentiated startle: temporal characteristics and effects of α-helical corticotropin-releasing hormone.Biol. Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings indirectly implicate a threshold dependence and putative gain control function of CRF, but whether CRF actually operates in this manner is not known. Moreover, because these experiments used intracerebroventricular and not site-specific antagonist delivery, which cells are responsible for the production of CRF in this context, and where in the brain CRF is required, is not discernable. Here we establish the identity of CRF-producing neurons in the CeA and the role of CRF in this region for conditioning to different threat levels. We find that CRF-producing neurons are largely distinct from previously characterized somatostatin (Sst) and PKCδ neurons in the CeA. CRF neurons form local inhibitory connections, undergo plasticity following threat conditioning, and selectively respond to threat-predictive stimuli. To establish the role of CeA-derived CRF, we generated a mouse line that allows for the conditional inactivation of the CRF gene (Crhlox/lox). Consistent with a gain control function for CRF, we find that CRF facilitates conditioned fear acquisition at low, but not high, US intensities. Surprisingly, we also find that inhibitory synaptic transmission from CRF neurons is also nonessential for fear at high US intensities, demonstrating a functional specificity for these cells. Using a newly generated Cre-driver mouse line, Crhr1IRES-Cre, we demonstrate that CRF-receptive neurons are broadly localized within the central CeA (CeAC), lateral CeA (CeAL), and medial CeA (CeAM), partially overlapping with Sst neurons in the caudal CeAL. We further show that CRF potently enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto CRFR1 neurons, and CRFR1 signaling in the CeA is critical for discriminative fear. Collectively, these data define a novel modulatory gain control circuit within the CeA that specifically operates at low threat levels to facilitate learning through the release of CRF. Electrophysiological recordings in the CeAL during presentations of threat-associated stimuli have revealed two primary response profiles: “fear-on” and “fear-off” neurons (Haubensak et al., 2010Haubensak W. Kunwar P.S. Cai H. Ciocchi S. Wall N.R. Ponnusamy R. Biag J. Dong H.W. Deisseroth K. Callaway E.M. et al.Genetic dissection of an amygdala microcircuit that gates conditioned fear.Nature. 2010; 468: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Genetic and functional analyses of cells within the CeAL have demonstrated that “fear-on” neurons principally express the neuropeptide Sst (Li et al., 2013Li H. Penzo M.A. Taniguchi H. Kopec C.D. Huang Z.J. Li B. Experience-dependent modification of a central amygdala fear circuit.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), whereas “fear-off” neurons are predominantly found to express the delta isoform of a calcium-activated protein kinase (PKCδ) (Haubensak et al., 2010Haubensak W. Kunwar P.S. Cai H. Ciocchi S. Wall N.R. Ponnusamy R. Biag J. Dong H.W. Deisseroth K. Callaway E.M. et al.Genetic dissection of an amygdala microcircuit that gates conditioned fear.Nature. 2010; 468: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To determine whether CRF-producing neurons are selectively encapsulated by one of these two major cell types in the CeAL, we performed immunostaining for PKCδ and Sst, as well as the neuropeptide neurotensin (Nts), which labels the CeAC, in tissue sections obtained from a CrhIRES-Cre mouse line (Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H. He M. Wu P. Kim S. Paik R. Sugino K. Kvitsiani D. Fu Y. Lu J. Lin Y. et al.A resource of Cre driver lines for genetic targeting of GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 71: 995-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) crossed with a reporter (CrhIRES-Cre;Ai14TdTomato; Figure 1A). Quantification of PKCδ immunoreactivity, which robustly labeled cell bodies, and tdTomato across the rostral-caudal axis revealed very little overlap between PKCδ and CRF neuronal populations (Figure 1B). Sst also did not significantly overlap with the distribution of CRF neurons (Figure S1, available online) and NTS, which predominantly labeled nerve terminals, showed little co-localization with tdTomato. Results from all three immunostaining experiments revealed that CRF neurons are predominantly localized to the rostral regions of the CeAL, diminishing significantly within the caudal-most aspect. PKCδ, Sst, and Nts localized prominently within the caudal aspect of the CeAL, with a small number of CRF neurons showing partial overlap with these markers (Figures 1A and 1B). To confirm the findings of our immunohistochemistry analysis, we utilized the RiboTag (Sanz et al., 2009Sanz E. Yang L. Su T. Morris D.R. McKnight G.S. Amieux P.S. Cell-type-specific isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from complex tissues.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 13939-13944Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) strategy to selectively isolate actively translated mRNA from genetically defined CRF neurons. This approach allows for the identification of genetic markers with enriched expression within specific cell populations. Selective expression of the HA-tagged ribosomal protein L22 (Rpl22-HA) in CRF neurons was achieved by injecting an adeno-associated viral vector encoding a Cre-dependent Rpl22-HA (AAV1-FLEX-Rpl22-HA) into the CeAL of mice expressing Cre-recombinase from the endogenous Crh locus encoding CRF (CrhIRES-Cre; Figure S1B). HA-tagged polyribosomes were immunoprecipitated (IP) from homogenates of tissue punches collected from injected mice (Figure S1C). RNA isolated from the IP fraction was screened for enrichment relative to the total RNA (input) for specific genes via qPCR. The genes included those encoding CRF (Crh), Sst (Sst), PKCδ (Prkcd), as well as other neuropeptides known to be expressed in the CeAL such as neurotensin (Nts) and dynorphin (Pdyn) (Cassell et al., 1986Cassell M.D. Gray T.S. Kiss J.Z. Neuronal architecture in the rat central nucleus of the amygdala: a cytological, hodological, and immunocytochemical study.J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 246: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Analysis of the IP versus the input RNA revealed a significant enrichment of Crh message relative to all other markers (Figure 1C). Enrichment of other markers was not significantly different than the negative control oligodendrocyte marker Cnp. Neurons within the CeAL have been shown to project locally within the CeA as well as to distant structures (Keifer et al., 2015Keifer Jr., O.P. Hurt R.C. Ressler K.J. Marvar P.J. The physiology of fear: reconceptualizing the role of the central amygdala in fear learning.Physiology (Bethesda). 2015; 30: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CRF neurons show similar projection patterns to previously identified cell groups, we performed a semi-quantitative analysis of projection data from the Allen Brain Institute Mouse Connectivity Atlas (Oh et al., 2014Oh S.W. Harris J.A. Ng L. Winslow B. Cain N. Mihalas S. Wang Q. Lau C. Kuan L. Henry A.M. et al.A mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), in which the projection patterns of genetically identified cell types within the CeA, including PKCδ neurons, have been established. The weighted density of fibers from CRF neurons is highest within the CeA, suggestive of strong local projections (Figure S1D). In line with our molecular and histological findings, the few long-range projections of CRF neurons differ from those of PKCδ neurons (Figure S1D). Conditional viral-mediated expression of the synaptic marker synaptophysin fused to GFP (AAV1-FLEX-SynGFP) in CRF neurons of the CeA (Figures S1E and S1F) confirmed the projection data from the connectivity atlas. Collectively, these results indicate that CRF neurons are largely distinct from other known populations in the CeAL. Neuronal cell types within the CeAL, such as those producing Sst, have been shown to undergo plasticity following fear conditioning that contributes to conditioned threat learning (Li et al., 2013Li H. Penzo M.A. Taniguchi H. Kopec C.D. Huang Z.J. Li B. Experience-dependent modification of a central amygdala fear circuit.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, Penzo et al., 2014Penzo M.A. Robert V. Li B.

He M. et al.The paraventricular thalamus controls a central amygdala fear circuit.Nature. 2015; 519: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To determine whether CRF neurons also undergo synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses, we measured the ratio of AMPA/NMDA receptor (AMPAR/NMDAR) currents (Malinow and Malenka, 2002Malinow R. Malenka R.C. AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar) following conditioning in a differential delayed cue fear conditioning paradigm. To allow for visual identification of CRF neurons in an ex vivo slice preparation, we utilized CrhIRES-Cre;Ai14TdTomato reporter mice (Figure 2A). Mice were conditioned for 2 consecutive days to a predictive conditioned stimulus (ten presentations of a 10 s auditory cue, CS+) that co-terminated with a 0.5 s, 0.3 mA unconditioned foot shock stimulus (US). CS+ presentations were interleaved with ten presentations of a distinct auditory cue (CS−) not paired with the US. Approximately 24 hr after the last conditioning session, we isolated AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CeAL CRF neurons evoked by stimulation of the lateral amygdala (LA) in acute brain slices (Figure 2B). Shock-conditioned mice showed a significantly increased ratio of AMPA/NMDA EPSCs relative to control mice that received cue presentations but no shock (Figure 2C). To confirm that the observed increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio is due to a selective enhancement of AMPAR-mediated currents, and not a decrease in the NMDAR-mediated current, we quantified currents evoked by bath application of either AMPA (1 μM) or NMDA (10 μM). AMPA-evoked currents were significantly enhanced in shocked mice relative to controls (Figure 2D), while NMDA-evoked currents remained equivalent (Figure 2E). To further establish that fear conditioning evokes plasticity in CRF neurons, we quantified long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in fluorescently identified neurons from shocked and non-shocked control mice (Figures 2F and 2G). Control mice that received only cue presentations displayed robust LTP in CRF neurons of the CeAL following high-frequency stimulation of the LA (Fu et al., 2007Fu Y. Pollandt S. Liu J. Krishnan B. Genzer K. Orozco-Cabal L. Gallagher J.P. Shinnick-Gallagher P. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the central amygdala (CeA) is enhanced after prolonged withdrawal from chronic cocaine and requires CRF1 receptors.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The same stimulation pattern failed to induce LTP in shock-conditioned mice, consistent with the occlusion of LTP induction. Plasticity in CRF CeAL neurons suggests that these cells may differentially respond to conditioned versus non-conditioned stimuli. It has been previously demonstrated that subpopulations of neurons in the CeA selectively respond to cues predicting threatening outcomes (CSON or “fear-on”), whereas as other neurons, specifically those expressing PKCδ, are inhibited by predictive cues (CSOFF or “fear-off”) (Ciocchi et al., 2010Ciocchi S. Herry C. Grenier F. Wolff S.B. Letzkus J.J. Vlachos I. Ehrlich I. Sprengel R. Deisseroth K.

To establish whether CRF CeAL neurons respond to fear-predictive stimuli, we directly imaged calcium dynamics in the CeAL using fiber-optic confocal microscopy (Vincent et al., 2006Vincent P.

Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B.

CrhIRES-Cre mice were injected with a conditional adeno-associated viral vector containing GCaMP6m (AAV1-DIO-GCaMP6) and implanted with a guide cannula targeting the CeAL (Figures 2H, 2I, and S2A–S2C). Two weeks following surgery, mice were fear conditioned for 2 days in a discriminative delayed cue conditioning paradigm, as described above. On the third day, a fiber-optic objective was lowered into the CeAL until fluorescence from CRF neurons was observed (Figure S2D). Mice were returned to the conditioning chamber, and calcium-associated fluorescence signals were imaged during CS+ and CS− presentations. Putative CRF neurons were visually identified and analyzed for changes in fluorescence intensity during CS+ and CS− presentations. Fluorescence signals were significantly increased in CRF neurons following CS+ deliveries relative to CS− (Figures 2J, 2K, and S2E). Consistent with the activity-dependent nature of increased calcium signals in vivo, calcium dynamics detected in CRF neurons in an acute slice preparation following stimulation of the LA at stimulus frequencies consistent with firing rates previously reported for CeAL neurons (Veinante and Freund-Mercier, 1998Veinante P. Freund-Mercier M.J. Intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the rat central extended amygdala: an in vivo electrophysiological study of the central amygdaloid nucleus.Brain Res. 1998; 794: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) demonstrated fluorescent changes similar in amplitude and duration to those observed in vivo (Figures S2F–S2I). Our results thus far demonstrate that CRF neurons are largely distinct from previously defined populations. Furthermore, activity-dependent plasticity following threat conditioning implies that these neurons are engaged during fear processing. To determine the role of CRF for the regulation of defensive behaviors and establish the threshold dependence of this neuropeptide, we genetically inactivated the gene encoding CRF, Crh, in the CeAL (Crh:CeA KO [knockout]) by generating a mouse with a conditional floxed allele (Crhlox/lox; Figures S3A and S3B). Crh inactivation was anatomically restricted by site-specific injection of AAV1-CreGFP into the CeA of Crhlox/lox mice (Figure 3A). An adeno-associated virus containing an expression cassette for a Cre-dead enzyme (AAV1-CreΔGFP) was used as a control. Immunohistochemical analysis of CRF following AAV1-CreGFP or AAV1-CreΔGFP confirmed inactivation (Figure S3C). Different groups of Crh:CeA KO and control mice were conditioned with either a 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 mA US using a discriminative delayed cued fear conditioning paradigm (Figure 3B). Baseline responses to two distinct auditory stimuli were established by three interleaved presentations of the cues. Mice were then conditioned to CS+ presentations (10 s auditory cue) co-terminating with the US and CS− presentations (distinct 10 s auditory cue that did not co-terminate with a US) on 2 consecutive days. Ten presentations of each cue were used for 0.3 and 0.4 mA, while five presentations were used for 0.5 mA (see below). Twenty-four hours after conditioning, mice were probed for discriminative threat responding by monitoring freezing in response to three interleaved presentations of the CS+ and CS−. In mice that received the 0.3 mA US, we observed a significant interaction between groups (Crh:CeA KO versus control) and conditioning trial bin, with Crh:CeA KO mice exhibiting significantly less freezing relative to controls during acquisition (Figure 3C). During probe trials, Crh:CeA KO mice displayed less freezing to the CS+ relative to control mice (Figure 3D). To establish whether reduced freezing behavior represents a general lack of fear, we quantified the distribution of mice that showed no fear (cue-induced freezing below the 95th percentile of baseline freezing), low fear (cue-induced freezing one to two times greater than the 95th percentile of baseline), and high fear (>two times the 95th percentile of baseline). Mice with Crh genetic inactivation in the CeA showed a significant difference in the fear distribution compared to control mice (Figure 3E). Similar to 0.3 mA US intensity, at 0.4 mA we observed a significant difference between Crh:CeA KO mice and control mice during acquisition (Figure 3F), though the difference was less than that observed with the 0.3 mA stimulus. We also observed a significant difference between Crh:CeA KO mice and controls during testing, with Crh:CeA KO mice displaying reduced freezing (Figure 3G). Analysis of the distribution of mice displaying conditioned fear revealed a significant difference between groups, with fewer Crh:CeA KO mice displaying fear greater than the 95th percentile of baseline responses, although more Crh:CeA KO mice showed significant fear at 0.4 mA than was observed with the 0.3 mA US (Figure 3H). To assess the role of CRF at higher US intensity, we conditioned mice to a 0.5 mA foot shock. Due to the intense nature of the US, mice were conditioned with five CS-US pairings per day instead of ten (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for additional details). Analysis of conditioned threat behavior did not reveal significant differences between Crh:CeA KO mice and control mice during acquisition or testing (Figures 3I and 3J). The distribution of mice displaying conditioned fear also did not differ significantly, though there were a slightly smaller number of control mice displaying low fear responses. However, both groups displayed predominantly high fear responses (Figure 3K). Interestingly, both control and Crh:CeA KO mice showed generalized threat responses, consistent with previous reports of behavioral phenotypes observed in response to increasing US strength (Baldi et al., 2004Baldi E. Lorenzini C.A. Bucherelli C. Footshock intensity and generalization in contextual and auditory-cued fear conditioning in the rat.Neurobiol. Learn.

It is possible that the differences observed in threat conditioning between Crh:CeA KO mice and controls in response to conditioning at lower US intensities is a reflection of reduced responsiveness to the US or to alterations in basal affective state, such as anxiety. To test this, we quantified changes in the velocity (cm/s) of mice in response to delivery of different US intensities. W"

However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1-3 nucleosome (50-500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA-DNA contacts that are spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome-nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres."
https://openalex.org/W2562013491,"The neuromuscular disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common inherited killer of infants, is caused by insufficient expression of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA therapeutics development efforts have focused on identifying strategies to increase SMN expression. We identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that arises from the antisense strand of SMN, SMN-AS1, which is enriched in neurons and transcriptionally represses SMN expression by recruiting the epigenetic Polycomb repressive complex-2. Targeted degradation of SMN-AS1 with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) increases SMN expression in patient-derived cells, cultured neurons, and the mouse central nervous system. SMN-AS1 ASOs delivered together with SMN2 splice-switching oligonucleotides additively increase SMN expression and improve survival of severe SMA mice. This study is the first proof of concept that targeting a lncRNA to transcriptionally activate SMN2 can be combined with SMN2 splicing modification to ameliorate SMA and demonstrates the promise of combinatorial ASOs for the treatment of neurogenetic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2561712047,"Identification of specific neurophysiological dysfunctions resulting in selective reading difficulty (dyslexia) has remained elusive. In addition to impaired reading development, individuals with dyslexia frequently exhibit behavioral deficits in perceptual adaptation. Here, we assessed neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition in adults and children with dyslexia for a wide variety of stimuli, spoken words, written words, visual objects, and faces. For every stimulus type, individuals with dyslexia exhibited significantly diminished neural adaptation compared to controls in stimulus-specific cortical areas. Better reading skills in adults and children with dyslexia were associated with greater repetition-induced neural adaptation. These results highlight a dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation as a core neurophysiological difference in dyslexia that may underlie impaired reading development. Reduced neurophysiological adaptation may relate to prior reports of reduced behavioral adaptation in dyslexia and may reveal a difference in brain functions that ultimately results in a specific reading impairment."

Here we present 'survey of regulatory elements' (SuRE), a method that assays more than 108 DNA fragments, each 0.2-2 kb in size, for their ability to drive transcription autonomously. In SuRE, a plasmid library of random genomic fragments upstream of a 20-bp barcode is constructed, and decoded by paired-end sequencing. This library is used to transfect cells, and barcodes in transcribed RNA are quantified by high-throughput sequencing. When applied to the human genome, we achieve 55-fold genome coverage, allowing us to map autonomous promoter activity genome-wide in K562 cells. By computational modeling we delineate subregions within promoters that are relevant for their activity. We show that antisense promoter transcription is generally dependent on the sense core promoter sequences, and that most enhancers and several families of repetitive elements act as autonomous transcription initiation sites."
https://openalex.org/W2566892327,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an imprinting disorder caused by a deficiency of paternally expressed gene(s) in the 15q11-q13 chromosomal region. The regulation of imprinted gene expression in this region is coordinated by an imprinting center (PWS-IC). In individuals with PWS, genes responsible for PWS on the maternal chromosome are present, but repressed epigenetically, which provides an opportunity for the use of epigenetic therapy to restore expression from the maternal copies of PWS-associated genes. Through a high-content screen (HCS) of >9,000 small molecules, we discovered that UNC0638 and UNC0642-two selective inhibitors of euchromatic histone lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (EHMT2, also known as G9a)-activated the maternal (m) copy of candidate genes underlying PWS, including the SnoRNA cluster SNORD116, in cells from humans with PWS and also from a mouse model of PWS carrying a paternal (p) deletion from small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N (Snrpn (S)) to ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (Ube3a (U)) (mouse model referred to hereafter as m+/pΔS-U). Both UNC0642 and UNC0638 caused a selective reduction of the dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) at PWS-IC, without changing DNA methylation, when analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing. This indicates that histone modification is essential for the imprinting of candidate genes underlying PWS. UNC0642 displayed therapeutic effects in the PWS mouse model by improving the survival and the growth of m+/pΔS-U newborn pups. This study provides the first proof of principle for an epigenetics-based therapy for PWS."

Mitochondria are essential organelles for all metazoans, and defects of mitochondrial function are implicated in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases (Pickrell and Youle, 2015Pickrell A.M.

The mechanisms leading to degeneration are often associated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) or decreased ATP production due to defects in the electron transport chain (ETC) (Johri and Beal, 2012Johri A. Beal M.F. Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2012; 342: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, mitochondria also play a critical role in metabolism via the Krebs or TCA cycle. Among the TCA cycle metabolites, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG or 2-oxoglutarate) lies at the intersection between carbon and nitrogen metabolism where it plays an important role in nutrition sensing and metabolic homeostasis (Huergo and Dixon, 2015Huergo L.F.

Enzyme complexes consisting of multiple units in mitochondria are thought to require molecular chaperones or assembly factors since each unit imported from the cytosol into the mitochondria needs to be properly folded and protected from aggregation until assembled into a complex. For example, succinate dehydrogenase assembly factors (SDHAFs) are required for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex function (Na et al., 2014Na U. Yu W. Cox J. Bricker D.K. Brockmann K. Rutter J. Thummel C.S. Winge D.R.

No assembly factor, however, has yet been identified for chaperoning enzymes in α-KGDHc. We identified mutations in Drosophila Nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase; dNrd1) in an unbiased forward genetic screen designed to identify genes whose loss of function causes neurodegeneration (Yamamoto et al., 2014Yamamoto S.

In mammals, NRD1 is expressed in the brain (Fumagalli et al., 1998Fumagalli P. Accarino M. Egeo A. Scartezzini P. Rappazzo G. Pizzuti A. Avvantaggiato V. Simeone A. Arrigo G.

Nardilysin regulates axonal maturation and myelination in the central and peripheral nervous system.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Some mutant mice escape neonatal death and live for about 2 years. However, these escapers show a slow progressive neurodegeneration, enhanced limb-clasping reflexes, impaired motor activity, cognitive deficits, and hypomyelination (Ohno et al., 2009Ohno M. Hiraoka Y. Matsuoka T. Tomimoto H. Takao K. Miyakawa T. Oshima N. Kiyonari H. Kimura T. Kita T. Nishi E.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are ill defined, and how the loss of NRD1 causes the phenotypes remains unclear. In this study, we show that NRD1 localizes to mitochondria, where it recruits mitochondrial chaperones to properly fold OGDH. We document that absence of NRD1 leads to a severe reduction of OGDH enzyme activity and elevated levels of its substrate, α-KG. Our findings also led to the identification of patients with neurodegenerative phenotypes that carry homozygous deleterious variants in NRD1 and OGDH-like (OGDHL). Using recently developed genetic tools in Drosophila, we show that the proteins with these variants are not functional, suggesting that these genes may be linked to neurological disorders. Hence, we uncovered a novel factor required for chaperoning OGDH, an essential enzyme in the TCA cycle. Furthermore, we show that loss of Nrd1 or Drosophila Ogdh (dOgdh) causes a progressive neurodegeneration and provide genetic data that link these genes to neurological conditions in human. To identify novel genes required for neuronal function, we performed a forward genetic screen for essential genes on the Drosophila X chromosome (Haelterman et al., 2014Haelterman N.A. Jiang L. Li Y. Bayat V. Sandoval H. Ugur B. Tan K.L. Zhang K. Bei D.

To assess whether these mutations cause defects in neuronal function, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings in homozygous mutant clones in the eye. We isolated four nonsense mutations in CG2025 that cause pupal lethality, fail to complement each other (Figure S1A), and cause similar phenotypes in ERG assays (Figures 1A–1C). CG2025 is a Drosophila homolog of NRD1 (dNrd1) (Figure 1E; Figure S1B). All alleles are rescued by wild-type (WT) genomic transgenes (Venken et al., 2009Venken K.J.T. Carlson J.W. Schulze K.L. Pan H.

Since on- and off-transients are a measure of synaptic transmission between the photoreceptor cells (PRs) and the postsynaptic neurons (Verstreken et al., 2003Verstreken P. Koh T.W. Schulze K.L. Zhai R.G. Hiesinger P.R. Zhou Y. Mehta S.Q. Cao Y. Roos J. Bellen H.J. Synaptojanin is recruited by endophilin to promote synaptic vesicle uncoating.Neuron. 2003; 40: 733-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), these data suggest a progressive loss of synaptic transmission in dNrd1 mutants. To assess whether dNrd1 loss is associated with morphological defects, we sectioned the retinae of 1-day-old adult flies with dNrd1 mutant clones. As shown in Figure 1D, dNrd1A exhibits subtle defects in young flies, and 35-day-old mutant clones exhibit gross morphological abnormalities with loss of numerous PRs (Figure 1D). Therefore, mutations in dNrd1 cause subtle developmental defects and display a striking progressive age-dependent demise of PRs. To unravel the mechanism by which loss of NRD1 causes defects in neuronal maintenance, we examined the subcellular localization of NRD1. NRD1 has been reported to localize to the cell surface, cytoplasm (Hospital et al., 2000Hospital V. Chesneau V. Balogh A. Joulie C. Seidah N.G. Cohen P. Prat A.

As our X chromosome screen led to the isolation of more than 30 nuclear-encoded genes that cause neurodegeneration and encode proteins targeted to mitochondria (Yamamoto et al., 2014Yamamoto S. Jaiswal M. Charng W.L. Gambin T. Karaca E. Mirzaa G. Wiszniewski W. Sandoval H. Haelterman N.A. Xiong B. et al.A drosophila genetic resource of mutants to study mechanisms underlying human genetic diseases.Cell. 2014; 159: 200-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we analyzed Drosophila NRD1 (DNRD1) sequence using MitoProt (Claros and Vincens, 1996Claros M.G. Vincens P. Computational method to predict mitochondrially imported proteins and their targeting sequences.Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) and noted that it contains a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) in the N-terminal 42 amino acids (Figure 1E). Similarly, vertebrate NRD1s also contain MTSs (Figure 1E). To test whether DNRD1 is localized to mitochondria, we expressed a C-terminally V5-tagged DNRD1 (DNRD1-V5) in Schneider 2 (S2) cells expressing mito-GFP (Rizzuto et al., 1995Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Chimeric green fluorescent protein as a tool for visualizing subcellular organelles in living cells.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and found that DNRD1-V5 colocalized with mito-GFP (Figure 2A). Similarly, DNRD1-V5 expressed in fly muscles (Figure 2B) or neurons (Figure 2C) also colocalizes with ATP5A, the α subunit of mitochondrial complex V, or with mito-GFP. C-terminally V5-tagged human NRD1 (NRD1-V5) also colocalizes with mito-GFP in S2 cells and fly muscles (Figures 2D and 2E). However, fly or human NRD1s lacking MTS (NRD1-ΔMTS) fail to localize to mitochondria in S2 cells (Figures 2A and 2D). Interestingly, a small fraction of DNRD1-ΔMTS colocalizes with mitochondrial markers in muscles of dNrd1 mutants (Figure 2B), suggesting that other sequences within DNRD1 may also participate in mitochondria targeting of DNRD1 in vivo. Finally, we tested whether substitution of an alanine residue for the glutamate residue required for the catalytic Zn2+ binding (E161A) affects protein localization. As shown in Figure S2, this point mutation alters the protein localization in S2 cells and muscles, resulting in cytoplasmic localization. In summary, our data show that both DNRD1 and human NRD1 localize to mitochondria (Figures 2A–2E). Failure to control ATP production, mitochondrial biogenesis or dynamics, as well as many other lesions of mitochondrial proteins, are associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Burté et al., 2015Burté F.

The roles of PINK1, parkin, and mitochondrial fidelity in Parkinson’s disease.Neuron. 2015; 85: 257-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). We, therefore, assessed basic mitochondrial properties in dNrd1 mutant tissues. We did not observe obvious differences in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (Figure 3A) or abundance of numerous mitochondrial proteins between dNrd1 mutants and controls (Figure 3B). In addition, dNrd1 mutants exhibit a normal mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 3C). Moreover, NADH levels in dNrd1 mutants are very similar to those observed in controls (Figure 3D). Furthermore, ATP levels in dNrd1 mutants are not different from controls (Figure 3E). In addition, the activity of Aconitase, an enzyme that is sensitive to ROS, is not altered in dNrd1 mutants (Figure 3F). However, the activities of the ETC complexes I, III, and IV are increased about 2-fold compared to controls (Figure 3G), but complex II activity is not significantly altered (Figure 3G). These data indicate that total energy production is not altered in dNrd1 mutants but suggest that a compensatory upregulation of complexes I, III, and IV activities may mask potential defects in energy production. The lack of obvious mitochondrial phenotypes associated with the loss of dNrd1 prompted us to explore metabolites in dNrd1 mutant animals. The most obvious defect that we observed was a dramatic increase in α-KG and glutamine in dNrd1 mutants (Figure 4A). Similarly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that lack NRD1 (Ohno et al., 2009Ohno M. Hiraoka Y. Matsuoka T. Tomimoto H. Takao K. Miyakawa T. Oshima N. Kiyonari H. Kimura T. Kita T. Nishi E. Nardilysin regulates axonal maturation and myelination in the central and peripheral nervous system.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1506-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also exhibit a significant accumulation of α-KG and glutamine (Figure 4B). Our data suggest that when NRD1 is lost, the activity or levels of enzymes of the α-KGDHc are reduced, leading to the accumulation of its substrate, α-KG (Figure 4L). An accumulation of α-KG may lead to an increase in glutamine in dNrd1 mutants and mutant MEFs through cataplerosis, a process that attempts to deplete the pool of α-KG by converting it into glutamine (Owen et al., 2002Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. The key role of anaplerosis and cataplerosis for citric acid cycle function.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). To determine the cause of α-KG accumulation, we examined the enzymatic activity of Drosophila OGDH, along with other TCA cycle enzymes in dNrd1 mutants. As shown in Figure 4C, loss of dNrd1 leads to a severe loss of the OGDH activity, whereas the activity of other enzymes in the TCA cycle are not affected or are mildly affected in dNrd1 mutants when compared to controls (Figures 3F and 4D–4F). These results indicate that loss of dNrd1 affects the stability, abundance, or enzymatic activity of OGDH. To measure the protein level of DOGDH in dNrd1 mutants in vivo, we took advantage of the presence of a MiMIC (Minos-mediated integration cassette) transposon inserted in a coding intron of dOgdh (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015Nagarkar-Jaiswal S. Lee P.T. Campbell M.E. Chen K. Anguiano-Zarate S. Gutierrez M.C. Busby T. Lin W.W. He Y.

Schulze K.L. Haelterman N.A. Pan H. He Y. Evans-Holm M. Carlson J.W. Levis R.W. Spradling A.C. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. MiMIC: a highly versatile transposon insertion resource for engineering Drosophila melanogaster genes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). We generated a fly strain in which the MiMIC transposon was replaced with an artificial exon encoding GFP. As shown in Figure S3B, the internally tagged DOGDH-GFP protein localizes to the mitochondria and co-localizes with ATP5A. To test whether the loss of dNrd1 affects DOGDH protein levels, we generated dNrd1 mutants carrying dOgdh-GFP. dNrd1 mutants exhibit a dramatic decrease of the protein levels of DOGDH-GFP, both in total lysate and in the mitochondrial fraction when compared to controls, whereas the level of ATP5A in the mutants is comparable to controls (Figure 4G). To test whether DNRD1 regulates the level of other enzymes in the TCA cycle, we compared the level of malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) in dNrd1 mutants with that of controls and found that they are similar (Figure 4H). Therefore, DNRD1 is required for the activity and proper protein levels of DOGDH in Drosophila. To assess the levels and activity of OGDH in the absence of NRD1 in mammalian cells, we compared the expression of OGDH in mNrd1−/− MEFs to that in control mNrd1+/+ MEFs. Since the levels of α-KG are elevated in mNrd1−/− MEFs, we expected a loss of OGDH. Surprisingly, the level of OGDH protein in mNrd1−/− MEFs is elevated compared to wild-type MEFs, whereas the levels of citrate synthase (CS) are similar in mutant and wild-type MEFs (Figure 4I). However, the enzymatic activity of OGDH in mNrd1−/− MEFs is severely reduced compared to wild-type MEFs (Figure 4J), consistent with an elevation in α-KG (Figure 4B). These data suggest that, in mammalian cells, NRD1 is required for the activity of OGDH, similar to flies, but not for abundance of OGDH. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that NRD1 is required for the proper function of OGDH in flies and mice. If OGDH is the major target of NRD1 in vivo, we anticipated that reduction of dOgdh would phenocopy the loss of dNrd1. Knockdown of dOgdh via RNAi in larvae causes a dramatic increase in α-KG and glutamine (Figure 4K) similar to and more severe than the dNrd1 mutant (Figure 4A), suggesting that DOGDH activity is incompletely lost in dNrd1 mutants, consistent with the enzymatic assays (Figure 4C). Additionally, the profile of amino acid changes, including elevated lysine level in mNrd1−/− MEFs, are similarly observed in dOgdh knockdown flies (Figures S4A and S4B). Moreover, knockdown of dOgdh in PRs causes a slow progressive loss of synaptic transmission (Figure S4C), similar to the ERG phenotypes seen in dNrd1 mutant clones (Figures 1A–1C). Altogether, these data reveal that OGDH is a major target of NRD1 in vivo and that loss/reduction of function of the two proteins have similar metabolic and neurologic phenotypes. To further determine the role of NRD1, we sought to identify proteins that physically interact with NRD1. We performed immunoprecipitation (IP) mass spectrometry (MS) of V5-tagged DNRD1 and identified numerous mitochondrial proteins, including Drosophila OGDH (DOGDH) (Figure 5A; Figure S5A; Table S1). The interaction between DNRD1 and DOGDH was confirmed via co-IP in S2 cells (Figure 5B). Interestingly, 20 out of 60 proteins with spectral counts of 9-fold or more in DNRD1-V5-expressing samples when compared to controls were associated with mitochondria (Figure 5A). Bioinformatics analyses based on STRING (http://string-db.org/) (Franceschini et al., 2013Franceschini A. Szklarczyk D. Frankild S. Kuhn M. Simonovic M. Roth A. Lin J. Minguez P.

Hu Y. Kulkarni M. Roesel C. Sopko R. Mohr S.E. Perrimon N. Protein complex-based analysis framework for high-throughput data sets.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: rs5Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) revealed that 10 of the 20 mitochondrial proteins can be assigned to three different functional categories (Figure S5B). These include mitochondrial chaperones (L(2)tid/DNAJA3; Roe1/GRPEL1; Hsc70-5/HSPA9; Hsp60C/HSP60; CG3731/PMPCB), enzymes of the TCA cycle (DOGDH/OGDH; CG6439/IDH3B; Gdh/GLUD1), and proteins involved in amino acid catabolism (CG2118/MCCC1; CG3267/MCCC2) (Figure S5B). In addition, two other proteases that also function as chaperones (Lon/LonP1; CG4538/CLPX) interact with DNRD1 (Figure 5A). We verified the interaction between DNRD1 and Hsc70-5, L(2)tid and Hsp60 in S2 cells (Figure 5C). Given that DNRD1 can interact with DOGDH and a number of mitochondrial chaperone proteins, NRD1 may help chaperone OGDH. The interaction between DNRD1 with DOGDH and mitochondrial chaperones when combined with a dramatic decrease in activity of DOGDH in the absence of DNRD1 suggests that DNRD1 is required for proper mitochondrial import, folding, and/or stabilization of DOGDH (Figure 5H). Similarly, an increase in OGDH protein levels in mNrd1−/− MEFs combined with a severe decrease in OGDH activity also suggests that the folding of the protein may be impaired. However, unlike in flies, the protein is not degraded and leads to an accumulation of OGDH (Figure 4I). As DNRD1 interacts with Hsc70-5 and Roe1, two subunits of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) complex in the inner mitochondria (Pfanner et al., 1997Pfanner N. Craig E.A. Hönlinger A. Mitochondrial preprotein translocase.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Figures 5A and 5H; Figure S5B), we performed a mitochondrial import assay in which in vitro translated DOGDH protein was mixed with purified mitochondria (Horwich et al., 1985Horwich A.L. Kalousek F. Mellman I. Rosenberg L.E. A leader peptide is sufficient to direct mitochondrial import of a chimeric protein.EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). C-terminally Flag-tagged DOGDH protein (DOGDH-Flag) produced by in vitro transcription and translation was incubated with mitochondria purified from either dNrd1 mutant or control animals. Upon incubation for different time periods, the mitochondria were isolated and washed with buffer containing protease inhibitors. Western blots allowed assessment of the abundance of DOGDH in mitochondria. The data indicate that the protein is imported into mitochondria and that the levels are maximal after 20 min in controls (Figure 5D). At early time points (Figure 5D; 2 and 5 min), the amount of imported DOGDH protein in dNrd1 mutant and control mitochondria is similar, suggesting that mitochondrial import is not defective in the absence of DNRD1 (Figure 5D). However, imported DOGDH protein is gradually lost in dNrd1 mutant mitochondria (Figure 5D). These data indicate that DNRD1 is not required for the import of DOGDH but is essential for the stability of newly imported DOGDH in mitochondria. The loss of DOGDH in mitochondria in the absence of DNRD1 suggests that DOGDH is misfolded and degraded. MDJ1, a yeast homolog of L(2)tid, is required for the folding of newly imported proteins in the mitochondrial matrix (Rowley et al., 1994Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Mdj1p, a novel chaperone of the DnaJ family, is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and protein folding.Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We find that L(2)tid protein enhances the physical interaction between DNRD1 and DOGDH proteins (Figure 5E), but other chaperones did not promote this interaction. This suggests that DNRD1, DOGDH, and L(2)tid form a complex and may assist in the proper folding of DOGDH. Misfolded mitochondrial proteins typically precipitate more easily than native proteins (Bender et al., 2011Bender T. Lewrenz I. Franken S. Baitzel C. Voos W. Mitochondrial enzymes are protected from stress-induced aggregation by mitochondrial chaperones and the Pim1/LON protease.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 54"

Here, we investigate the function of mouse whisker primary motor cortex (wM1), a frontal region defined by dense innervation from whisker primary somatosensory cortex (wS1). Optogenetic stimulation of wM1 evokes rhythmic whisker protraction (whisking), whereas optogenetic inactivation of wM1 suppresses initiation of whisking. Whole-cell membrane potential recordings and silicon probe recordings of action potentials reveal layer-specific neuronal activity in wM1 at movement initiation, and encoding of fast and slow parameters of movements during whisking. Interestingly, optogenetic inactivation of wS1 caused hyperpolarization and reduced firing in wM1, together with reduced whisking. Optogenetic stimulation of wS1 drove activity in wM1 with complex dynamics, as well as evoking long-latency, wM1-dependent whisking. Our results advance understanding of a well-defined frontal region and point to an important role for sensory input in controlling motor cortex."

Although a key function of core promoters is to convert enhancer activities into gene transcription, whether and how strongly they activate transcription in response to enhancers has not been systematically assessed on a genome-wide level. Here we describe self-transcribing active core promoter sequencing (STAP-seq), a method to determine the responsiveness of genomic sequences to enhancers, and apply it to the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We cloned candidate fragments at the position of the core promoter (also called minimal promoter) in reporter plasmids with or without a strong enhancer, transfected the resulting library into cells, and quantified the transcripts that initiated from each candidate for each setup by deep sequencing. In the presence of a single strong enhancer, the enhancer responsiveness of different sequences differs by several orders of magnitude, and different levels of responsiveness are associated with genes of different functions. We also identify sequence features that predict enhancer responsiveness and discuss how different core promoters are employed for the regulation of gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2567202920,"Amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced neuron death is considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among several death modalities, autophagy and apoptosis play important roles in Aβ-induced neuron death suggesting that there may be regulatory mechanisms that initiate both cell death pathways.

Here, we report that, upon Aβ treatment, tribbles pseudokinase 3 (Trib3, an ortholog of Drosophila Tribbles) is up-regulated in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. Increased Trib3 levels inhibited the activity of the kinase Akt by interacting with it.

Conversely, FoxO1 responded to Aβ insult by binding to the Trib3 gene promoter, enhancing its expression. Our investigations further revealed that Trib3 also induces autophagy. We found that Trib3 indirectly activates unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase1 (Ulk1) by impeding phosphorylation of, and thus inactivating, a negative regulator of Ulk1, mechanistic target of rapamycin. Ulk1 activation augmented autophagosome formation and reduced autophagy flux. Thus, Trib3 was required for formation of autophagosomes, which accumulated in neurons as autophagic flux was thwarted.

It involves a gradual deterioration in several cognitive domains, including loss of memory.

Disturbances in cellular homeostasis lead to increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sensitivity, which is a characteristic feature in AD. Excessive ER stress is detrimental to neurons because it can switch on an apoptotic program and also can trigger inflammatory responses (6Salminen A. Kauppinen A. Suuronen T. Kaarniranta K. Ojala J.

AD has well been characterized as a multifactorial disease where a single unwavering approach to tackle the disease might be ineffective. A combination of treatment strategies may prove beneficial in this arena. Several approaches have been studied, yet most of them have met with failure at the stage of clinical trials. Because the Aβ cascade hypothesis holds the spotlight of the pathogenesis of the disease, targeting Aβ proves to be a promising approach (34Huang Y. Mucke L. Alzheimer mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Cell. 2012; 148: 1204-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 35Musiek E.S. Holtzman D.M. Three dimensions of the amyloid hypothesis: time, space and 'wingmen'.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Apart from this, a complementary therapy is imperative to impede the toxicity due to Aβ, the complete removal of which is difficult. Hence, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of Aβ-induced death is quintessential. In this study, we have investigated the role of Trib3 in neuronal death induced by Aβ. It appears that Trib3 is induced and promotes death of neurons by both apoptosis and autophagy in response to Aβ. Accumulating evidence implicates Aβ oligomers as the principal cause of AD pathogenesis (36Gilbert B.J. The role of amyloid β in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.J. Clin. Pathol. 2013; 66: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Lesné S.E. Sherman M.A. Grant M. Kuskowski M. Schneider J.A. Bennett D.A. Ashe K.H. Brain amyloid-β oligomers in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.Brain. 2013; 136: 1383-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Oligomeric Aβ at a concentration of 1.5 μm leads to significant death of primary cortical and hippocampal neurons after 24 h of exposure (38Sanphui P. Biswas S.C. FoxO3a is activated and executes neuron death via Bim in response to β-amyloid.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e625Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We determined the levels of Trib3 in neurons after Aβ exposure. We found that Trib3 levels were increased in cultured cortical neurons following Aβ(1–42) treatment. To check the specificity of the action of Aβ(1–42), we used a reverse peptide, Aβ(42–1), and we found that the reverse peptide Aβ(42–1) has no effect on Trib3 levels in the primary cortical neurons (data not shown). Trib3 transcript levels were significantly increased as early as after 4 h and about 3-fold increased after 8 h of Aβ(1–42) treatment as detected by semi-quantitative (Fig. 1A) and real time PCR (Fig. 1B). Protein levels of Trib3 were also significantly increased within 4 h and they were about 3- and 3.5-fold increased after 8 and 16 h of Aβ treatment, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, Trib3 expression was elevated well before cell death became apparent (see below and Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Trib3 is essential for neuronal death evoked by Aβ.

Reports reveal that oligomeric Aβ when infused into adult rat brains results in Aβ deposition, caspase-3 activation, and neuronal cell loss in the vicinity of Aβ infusion (38Sanphui P. Biswas S.C. FoxO3a is activated and executes neuron death via Bim in response to β-amyloid.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e625Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In our study adult rats were infused with Aβ or PBS on the right hemisphere of their brains. 21 days later these animals were sacrificed, and their brains were fixed, cryosectioned, and then immunostained with Aβ(1–42) antibody to check Aβ deposition in the site of Aβ infusion (Fig. 1E). Adjacent sections were also co-immunostained with Trib3 and NeuN (a neuronal marker) antibodies. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Results revealed marked up-regulation of Trib3 in Aβ-infused rat brains as compared with PBS-infused rat brains (Fig. 1, F and G). Because synthetic Aβ may behave differently from naturally secreted Aβ, brain sections of APPswe-PS1de9 (Swedish mutation in amyloid precursor protein and PS1 mutation) transgenic mice, which naturally secrete Aβ, were also examined for Trib3 expression. The presence of Aβ plaques in the transgenic mouse brain was checked by Congo red staining (Fig. 1H). Transgenic and control littermate mouse brains were cryosectioned and co-immunostained with Trib3 and NeuN antibodies. Hoechst dye was used to stain the nuclei. It was observed that there was a significant increase in Trib3 levels in transgenic mice as compared with the control littermates (Fig. 1, I and J). Therefore, our study indicates that Trib3 expression is increased in neurons upon exposure to Aβ in vitro and in vivo. To find the role of Trib3 in Aβ-induced neuronal cell death in vivo, we performed immunostaining of Trib3 along with TUNEL assay in sections in the vicinity of Aβ infusion. We observed that increased Trib3 expression co-localized with TUNEL-positive cells in Aβ-infused rat brain sections as compared with PBS-infused rats (Fig. 1K, see arrows). This indicates the role of Trib3 in Aβ-induced neuronal cell death in vivo. We next assessed whether Trib3 is necessary in evoking neuronal death in response to Aβ. We interfered with the expression of Trib3 using previously described shRNA constructs (23Zareen N. Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. A feed-forward loop involving Trib3, Akt and FoxO mediates death of NGF-deprived neurons.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 1719-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Trib3 shRNA construct efficiently blocked induction of Trib3 by Aβ in neuronally differentiated (primed) PC12 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Primary cultured cortical neurons were then transfected with this shRNA construct (shTrib3) or a control shRNA construct (shRand) and maintained for 48 h followed by oligomeric Aβ treatment (1.5 μm). Transfected live green cells were monitored and counted under a fluorescence microscope at different time intervals. Down-regulation of Trib3 by shRNA blocked neurodegeneration as evident from the retention of neuronal processes and caused significant survival of these neurons compared with shRand-transfected neurons even after 72 h of Aβ treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). A similar experiment with cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that down-regulation of Trib3 also provided significant protection of hippocampal neurons from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 2, E and F). Hippocampal neurons expressing shTrib3 not only showed increased viability as compared with shRand-transfected neurons but also displayed enhanced retention of neurites and overall neuronal morphology (Fig. 2, E and F). Furthermore, we quantitatively assessed the retention of neurites and neuronal networks in shTrib3-transfected hippocampal neurons after Aβ treatment by Sholl analysis as described (38Sanphui P. Biswas S.C. FoxO3a is activated and executes neuron death via Bim in response to β-amyloid.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e625Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Cuesto G. Enriquez-Barreto L. Caramés C. Cantarero M. Gasull X. Sandi C. Ferrús A. Acebes Á. Morales M. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase activation controls synaptogenesis and spinogenesis in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2721-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Single hippocampal neurons transfected with either shTrib3 or shRand were analyzed by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results revealed that the number of crossings remained almost same before and after treatment of Aβ in the case of shTrib3-transfected neurons, although there was a drastic reduction in the number of crossings in shRand-transfected neurons (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, we found that down-regulating Trib3 retains mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2H), maintains post-synaptic membrane integrity (Fig. 2I), and decreases nuclear localization of cleaved caspase3 (Fig. 2J) even in Aβ-treated conditions. We also found a similar protective effect of shTrib3 on neuronal PC12 cells upon Aβ treatment (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Trib3 plays a necessary role in mediating neuron degeneration and death evoked by Aβ toxicity. It has been shown that Trib3 blocks Akt activity by physically interacting with it in various non-neuronal cells (40He L. Simmen F.A. Mehendale H.M. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M.

As phospho-Akt level is reported to be markedly reduced in AD brain (43Lee H.K. Kumar P. Fu Q. Rosen K.M. Querfurth H.W. The insulin/Akt signaling pathway is targeted by intracellular β-amyloid.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we tested whether Trib3 also negatively regulates Akt in neuronal cells in response to Aβ. Primary cultures of cortical neurons were treated with Aβ, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Trib3 antibody and Western blotted with Akt antibody and vice versa. Results revealed increased binding of Trib3 with Akt in Aβ-treated neurons compared with control neurons (Fig. 3, A and B). We then checked the phosphorylation status of Akt upon Aβ treatment. We observed that the decrease in phosphorylation at Ser-473 of Akt caused by Aβ insult was rescued when Trib3 was down-regulated (Fig. 3, C and D). We also observed that when PI3K is inhibited by a specific PI3K inhibitor in the presence or absence of Aβ, the protein levels of Trib3 increased even in the absence of Aβ (Fig. 3, E and F). This allowed us to see whether Trib3 is regulated by some downstream substrate of PI3K/Akt, which gets activated upon PI3K inhibition and in turn regulates Trib3. Transcription factor FoxO, downstream to PI3K/AKT and an entrenched substrate of it, is known to translocate from the cytosol to nucleus and induces its target genes in Aβ-treated neurons (38Sanphui P. Biswas S.C. FoxO3a is activated and executes neuron death via Bim in response to β-amyloid.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e625Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 44Akhter R. Sanphui P. Biswas S.C.

We therefore hypothesized that Trib3 may be regulated by FoxO transcription factors in Aβ-treated neurons. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to check the direct binding of FoxO1 with the Trib3 promoter. The result showed that FoxO1 occupancy of the Trib3 promoter was markedly increased in response to Aβ (Fig. 3, G and H). These results indicate that Trib3 directly binds and inactivates Akt; this in turn activates the transcription factor FoxO1, and FoxO1 can occupy the Trib3 gene promoter upon Aβ treatment. Previous results prompted us to test whether"

Human mitochondria contain a small circular genome that encodes 22 tRNA, 2 rRNA, and 13 proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation.

In addition to the function as a transcription factor, TFAM also binds DNA in a nonspecific manner, and it has been shown to completely cover mtDNA.

TFB2M enters the transcription initiation complex after POLRMT has been recruited to the promoter by TFAM, and triggers initiation of transcription (6Posse V. Hoberg E. Dierckx A. Shahzad S.

A novel intermediate in transcription initiation by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3884-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TFB2M interacts with POLRMT and functions as a transient component of the catalytic site during transcription initiation, where it is placed in direct proximity of the priming substrate in the process of transcription initiation (17Sologub M.

TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Cell. 2009; 139: 934-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After transcription has been initiated, TFB2M probably dissociates from POLRMT when the enzyme enters the elongation phase (18Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A.

TFB2M has been suggested to be required for promoter melting, but this has never been directly demonstrated (17Sologub M. Litonin D. Anikin M. Mustaev A. Temiakov D.

POLRMT contributes actively to promoter recognition by sequence-specific interactions in the vicinity of the transcription start site, but possibly also by recognition of a region upstream of the TFAM binding site (6Posse V.

DNase I footprinting and crosslinking experiments have shown that TFAM is absolutely required to initiate the formation of a pre-initiation complex. In the absence of TFAM, neither POLRMT nor the combination of POLRMT and TFB2M binds to promoter DNA in a sequence-specific manner (6Posse V. Hoberg E. Dierckx A. Shahzad S. Koolmeister C.

The mitochondrial RNA polymerase contributes critically to promoter specificity in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the presence of TFAM, POLRMT on its own is efficiently recruited to the promoter, whereas TFB2M is only recruited when both TFAM and POLRMT are present (6Posse V. Hoberg E. Dierckx A. Shahzad S. Koolmeister C. Larsson N.G. Wilhelmsson L.M. Hällberg B.M. Gustafsson C.M. The amino terminal extension of mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase ensures promoter specific transcription initiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These and other findings have led us to propose a model for transcription initiation where TFAM recruits POLRMT to the promoter, aided by POLRMT-DNA interactions. Formation of this pre-initiation complex releases the negative effect of the NTE of POLRMT and opens up the polymerase for TFB2M binding and transcription initiation (6Posse V. Hoberg E. Dierckx A. Shahzad S. Koolmeister C. Larsson N.G. Wilhelmsson L.M. Hällberg B.M. Gustafsson C.M. The amino terminal extension of mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase ensures promoter specific transcription initiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In yeast, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the TFB2M homologue Mtf1 are the only factors required for transcription initiation (21Xu B. Clayton D.A. Assignment of a yeast protein necessary for mitochondrial transcription initiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dependence on Mtf1 can be circumvented by the introduction of a mismatch region over the transcription start site, or by the use of negatively supercoiled templates for transcription (22Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. Intrinsic promoter recognition by a “core” RNA polymerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When a similar mismatch bubble template is used in the human transcription system, transcription is independent of both TFB2M and TFAM (17Sologub M. Litonin D. Anikin M. Mustaev A. Temiakov D. TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Cell. 2009; 139: 934-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This observation is difficult to reconcile with the sequential model for the assembly of the mitochondrial pre-initiation complex, which states that TFAM is required to recruit POLRMT to the promoter region. In the current work, we have specifically analyzed the role of TFB2M in the process of mitochondrial transcription initiation. We have used DNase I and potassium permanganate footprinting to study promoter interactions and unwinding. We have also performed in vitro transcription with mismatch bubble oligonucleotide templates and supercoiled plasmid templates to elucidate the requirement of transcription factors for promoter melting. Our analysis helps to distinguish the roles of TFAM and TFB2M at the promoter, and provides further evidence for the sequential model of transcription initiation in human mitochondria. To monitor structural changes in the promoter region during transcription initiation, we used potassium permanganate (KMnO4) footprinting (Fig. 1, A and B). Permanganate primarily oxidizes thymidine residues, and the reaction has a strong preference for nucleotides within single-stranded regions. DNA is next cleaved with piperidine at the modified bases (23Borowiec J.A. Zhang L. Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. DNA supercoiling promotes formation of a bent repression loop in lac DNA.J. Mol.

Schmid C.W. Pyrimidine-specific chemical reactions useful for DNA sequencing.Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In parallel to the permanganate footprinting, we performed DNase I footprinting to monitor binding of the mitochondrial transcription factors to the promoter (Fig. 1C). Both sets of reactions were performed using the same buffer and salt conditions, which allowed us to directly compare promoter binding events with effects on promoter structure. For the analysis, we used a P32-labeled PCR fragment covering the LSP promoter region. The permanganate footprinting templates showed some background cleavage in the absence of proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 7). This effect could be due to intrinsic permanganate-sensitive sites induced by breathing in the DNA. The background signals do not however interfere with the interpretation of the data. The addition of TFAM created a DNase I footprint from positions −15 to −40 relative to the transcription start site, corresponding to the previously characterized TFAM binding site (Fig. 1C, lane 3) (9Fisher R.P. Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Promoter selection in human mitochondria involves binding of a transcription factor to orientation-independent upstream regulatory elements.Cell. 1987; 50: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). On their own, neither TFB2M nor POLRMT binds to LSP (19Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. The mitochondrial RNA polymerase contributes critically to promoter specificity in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The addition of POLRMT together with TFAM caused an even stronger footprint over the −15 to −40 region. The presence of POLRMT also promoted changes in DNase I sensitivity around position −45 and strong protection over the transcription start site (−4 to +5), indicating correct positioning of the polymerase (Fig. 1C, lane 4). These changes were in agreement with previous studies, which had shown that TFAM recruits POLRMT to the transcription start site (6Posse V. Hoberg E. Dierckx A. Shahzad S. Koolmeister C. Larsson N.G. Wilhelmsson L.M. Hällberg B.M. Gustafsson C.M. The amino terminal extension of mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase ensures promoter specific transcription initiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Gaspari M.

The mitochondrial RNA polymerase contributes critically to promoter specificity in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In parallel with the DNase I experiments, we monitored permanganate sensitivity. The addition of TFAM did not change permanganate sensitivity, demonstrating that TFAM on its own is unable to unwind promoter sequences (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 8, and Fig. 1B). Furthermore, no changes in the permanganate sensitivity were observed when POLRMT was added (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 9, and Fig. 1B). When TFB2M was added in addition to TFAM and POLRMT, we observed no obvious effect on DNase I protection (Fig. 1C, lane 5). However, TFB2M induced a permanganate-sensitive region at positions −1 to +3 relative to the transcription start site on the template strand (Fig. 1A, lane 5, and Fig. 1B), indicating that the addition of TFB2M causes DNA unwinding in this region. Apart from the bases at −1 to +3, the closest thymidines on the template strand are located at positions −7 and +5. No melting was observed on the non-template strand, where the closest thymidines are found at −8 and +6 (Fig. 1A, lane 10, and Fig. 1B). Our results demonstrate that the promoter-bound TFAM-POLRMT complex is unable to melt the dsDNA promoter region, but requires TFB2M to catalyze this reaction. We also conclude that the start site melting is seen at positions −1 to +3 and does not propagate farther than positions −6 and +4. In previous in vitro transcription experiments, a 7-bp mismatch region over the LSP transcription start site circumvented the requirement of both TFAM and TFB2M (17Sologub M. Litonin D. Anikin M. Mustaev A. Temiakov D. TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Cell. 2009; 139: 934-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found this result puzzling, because our data suggested that TFAM was needed to recruit POLRMT in a step preceding start site unwinding, whereas the actual unwinding also required TFB2M (the sequential model for transcription initiation is summarized in Fig. 1D). We reasoned that if the current transcription initiation complex formation model is correct, it should be possible to find a mismatch template that can circumvent the requirement for TFB2M, but still depend on TFAM for recruitment of POLRMT and transcription initiation. To investigate this possibility, we used a 62-mer DNA template strand (−42 to +20) that includes the TFAM binding site and the LSP promoter, annealed to either WT or mismatch non-template strands. As expected, transcription from the double-stranded WT template (Fig. 2A, template LWT) was strictly dependent on TFAM and TFB2M (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4) and gave two clear run-off products (LSP transcription can be initiated from two different positions, +1 and +2). We also examined a template with the same sized mismatch bubble (−3 to +4) as used in earlier published experiments (17Sologub M. Litonin D. Anikin M. Mustaev A. Temiakov D. TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Cell. 2009; 139: 934-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, template LP1). Transcription from this LP1 template was indeed independent of both TFAM and TFB2M; however, on this template, POLRMT did not produce LSP-specific run-off products, but instead caused the formation of multiple shorter transcripts (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8). POLRMT uses ATP as the initiating nucleotide, and we have previously demonstrated that it can initiate non-sequence-specifically from ssDNA-containing thymidines (26Wanrooij S. Fusté J.M. Farge G. Shi Y. Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Human mitochondrial RNA polymerase primes lagging-strand DNA synthesis in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11122-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Most likely, the observed products produced with the 7-bp mismatch bubble were the result of initiation from thymidines in the mismatch template, e.g. at positions +3 and +5. We hypothesized that the 7-bp mismatch bubble template displays a sufficiently long ssDNA stretch to allow POLRMT to initiate transcription in a non-sequence-specific manner. When the same sized mismatch template was used in a previous study, this effect was not observed because short RNA primers were used in combination with the bubble template and such primers will direct transcription initiation to the correct start site (17Sologub M. Litonin D. Anikin M. Mustaev A. Temiakov D. TFB2 is a transient component of the catalytic site of the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase.Cell. 2009; 139: 934-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We decided to create a series of shorter mismatch bubble templates in an attempt to find an unwound region that could specifically circumvent the requirement for TFB2M, and thus lead to transcription initiation from the same sites observed in vivo, i.e. positions +1 and +2. To this end, we screened 11 new templates, each with a 3–5-bp mismatch, for TFB2M-independent, LSP-specific transcription (Fig. 3A). We found that 4 out of 11 templates displayed LSP-specific transcription patterns in the absence of TFB2M: LP4 (mismatch −3 to +2), LP7 (mismatch −3 to +1), LP8 (mismatch −2 to +2), and LP10 (mismatch −3 to −1), with specific run-off products at 19 and 20 nucleotides (nt) (Fig. 3A, lanes 6, 9, 10, and 12). All four templates were highly active in the absence of TFB2M and were transcribed at higher levels than the WT control transcribed by the complete transcription machinery (Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 with lanes 6, 9, 10, and 12). Furthermore, the fraction of 19- and 20-nt products produced by correct transcription initiation, relative to all transcription products observed in the same lane, was nearly as high for these four bubble templates as what was observed for the WT LSP construct (84, 99, 84, and 95% of the WT levels for LP4, LP7, LP8, and LP10, respectively, Fig. 3A). We continued analyzing the two templates that produced the highest levels of correctly initiated transcripts in the absence of TFB2M, i.e. LP4, with a mismatch between −3 to +2, and LP7, with a mismatch between −3 and +1 (Fig. 3B). These two templates were tested in reactions with different combinations of transcription factors. Again, both templates displayed TFB2M-independent, LSP-specific transcription (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 7). In the absence of TFAM, LSP-specific transcription was reduced on both templates (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4 for LP4 and lanes 6 and 8 for LP7). The TFB2M-independent, TFAM-dependent pattern was most obvious with the LP7 template (Fig. 3C lanes 6–9). In addition, TFB2M-independent transcription on the LP4 and the LP7 templates was markedly higher than that from a WT duplex template (Fig. 3C, compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 7). When TFB2M was added in addition to TFAM, transcription was slightly inhibited from both the LP4 and the LP7 template (Fig. 3C, compare lane 3 with lane 5 and lane 7 with lane 9). This could indicate an effect similar to that seen in yeast, where the presence of Mtf1 inhibits run-off transcription from a mismatch bubble template (22Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 16109-16120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effect of TFB2M on the human system, we used the WT and LP7 templates for in vitro transcription and compared the effects of increasing TFB2M concentrations (Fig. 3D). As expected, we observed increased transcription with higher TFB2M concentrations using the WT template, leveling out when the POLRMT:TFB2M ratio exceeded 1:1 (Fig. 3D, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, the highest levels of bubble template transcription were seen in the absence of TFB2M, and increasing concentrations of this transcription factor had a mild inhibiting effect (Fig. 3D, lanes 7–12), even if the inhibition was less dramatic than what had been observed previously in yeast (22Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. Intrinsic promoter recognition by a “core” RNA polymerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44239-44242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). From our analysis in Fig. 3A, it was clear that bubble templates with mismatches farther upstream than −3 showed no transcription in the absence of TFB2M (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). These templates also displayed substantially lower levels of transcription as compared with other bubble constructs when all three transcription proteins were present (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that mismatches upstream of −3 may disturb the POLRMT recognition site. All templates with bubbles extending downstream to +3 and +4 were active, but failed to produce the promoter-specific 19- and 20-nt products (Fig. 3A, LP1, LP5, LP6, and LP9, lanes 3, 7, 8, and 11, respectively). These templates also showed similar transcription patterns when both TFAM and TFB2M were omitted (Fig. 3F, lanes 3, 7, 8, and 11). As with template LP1, it is possible that these four constructs present a sufficiently long single-stranded stretch of thymidines for non-promoter-specific transcription initiation to occur. The precise position of the mismatch was important for transcription activity and specificity. A 4-bp mismatch covering positions −3 to +1 (LP7) produced a strong, TFAM-dependent, but TFB2M-independent transcription reaction. When the mismatch region was moved one step downstream (−2 to +2, LP8), transcription initiation was reduced, and a further move to −1 to +3 (LP9) completely abolished the reaction (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 9–11). Even if the LP8 construct (mismatch at −2 to +2) still supported promoter-specific transcription, initiation was mainly seen from the most downstream start site (+2, 19-nt run-off), indicating that melting at −3 is i"

In this study, we demonstrated that anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was a critical mediator for PGRN-mediated anti-inflammation in collagen-induced arthritis by using PGRN and IL-10 genetically modified mouse models. IL-10 green fluorescent protein reporter mice revealed that regulatory T (Treg) cells were the predominant source of IL-10 in response to PGRN. In addition, PGRN-mediated expansion and activation of Treg cells, as well as IL-10 production, depends on JNK signaling, but not on known PGRN-activated ERK and PI3K pathways. Furthermore, microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing screens led to the discovery of forkhead box protein O4 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as the transcription factors required for PGRN induction of IL-10 in Treg cells. These findings define a previously unrecognized signaling pathway that underlies IL-10 production by PGRN in Treg cells and present new insights into the mechanisms by which PGRN resolves inflammation in inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, particularly inflammatory arthritis.-Fu, W., Hu, W., Shi, L., Mundra, J.

https://openalex.org/W2565207404,"The authors show that, unlike the consolidation and refinement of excitatory connections observed during sensory map formation, a dramatic broadening of patterned activation domains, connectivity, and tuning occurs in interneurons in the olfactory bulb. This developmental expansion is sensitive to activity manipulations and may reveal general principles of interneuron network development. Sensory maps are created by networks of neuronal responses that vary with their anatomical position, such that representations of the external world are systematically and topographically organized in the brain. Current understanding from studying excitatory maps is that maps are sculpted and refined throughout development and/or through sensory experience. Investigating the mouse olfactory bulb, where ongoing neurogenesis continually supplies new inhibitory granule cells into existing circuitry, we isolated the development of sensory maps formed by inhibitory networks. Using in vivo calcium imaging of odor responses, we compared functional responses of both maturing and established granule cells. We found that, in contrast to the refinement observed for excitatory maps, inhibitory sensory maps became broader with maturation. However, like excitatory maps, inhibitory sensory maps are sensitive to experience. These data describe the development of an inhibitory sensory map as a network, highlighting the differences from previously described excitatory maps."

Virus-induced SGs function in different ways, depending on the species of virus; however, the mechanism of SG regulation of virus replication is not well understood. In this study, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) triggered stable formation of bona fide SGs on HeLa cells through activating the protein kinase R (PKR)/eIF2α pathway. NDV-induced SGs contained classic SG markers T-cell internal antigen (TIA)-1, Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein (G3BP)-1, eukaryotic initiation factors, and small ribosomal subunit, which could be disassembled in the presence of cycloheximide. Treatment with nocodazole, a microtubule disruption drug, led to the formation of relatively small and circular granules, indicating that NDV infection induces canonical SGs. Furthermore, the role of SGs on NDV replication was investigated by knockdown of TIA-1 and TIA-1-related (TIAR) protein, the 2 critical components involved in SG formation from the HeLa cells, followed by NDV infection. Results showed that depletion of TIA-1 or TIAR inhibited viral protein synthesis, reduced extracellular virus yields, but increased global protein translation. FISH revealed that NDV-induced SGs contained predominantly cellular mRNA rather than viral mRNA. Deletion of TIA-1 or TIAR reduced NP mRNA levels in polysomes. These results demonstrate that NDV triggers stable formation of bona fide SGs, which benefit viral protein translation and virus replication by arresting cellular mRNA. —Sun, Y., Dong, L., Yu, S., Wang, X., Zheng, H., Zhang, P., Meng, C., Zhan, Y., Tan, L., Song, C., Qiu, X., Wang, G., Liao, Y., Ding, C.

Acetylation of histones is regulated by two antagonist enzyme groups: histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (9Wang Z. Zang C. Cui K. Schones D.E. Barski A. Peng W. Zhao K.

The family of mammalian HDACs is composed of four classes based on their homologies to yeast proteins and enzymatic function (10Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N.

Because of their higher levels of expression, nuclear localization, and high enzymatic activity toward histone substrates, class I HDACs are thought to play a central role in cell differentiation and tissue development, especially in neurogenesis (11Morris M.J. Monteggia L.M. Unique functional roles for class I and class II histone deacetylases in central nervous system development and function.Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2013; 31: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 14Reichert N. Choukrallah M.-A. Matthias P. Multiple roles of class I HDACs in proliferation, differentiation, and development.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2173-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Class I HDACs exert their functions as subunits in chromatin complexes such as Sin3, nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD), corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST) and nuclear receptor co-repressor/silencing mediator for retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors (NCoR/SMRT). Class II HDACs have several additional protein domains, demonstrate low enzymatic activity in vitro, and are found in cytoplasm as well as in nuclei. They are subdivided into class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9) and class IIb (HDAC6 and HDAC10). Class II HDACs are expressed at lower levels, show more restricted patterns of expression, and shuttle between cytoplasm and nuclei. They are thought to function by recruiting class I HDACs or other transcriptional repressors to chromatin complexes (10Haberland M. Montgomery R.L. Olson E.N. The many roles of histone deacetylases in development and physiology: implications for disease and therapy.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar, 15Cho Y. Cavalli V. HDAC signaling in neuronal development and axon regeneration.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 27: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system (CNS), HDACs regulate differentiation of both neuronal and glial lineages (16Hsieh J. Nakashima K. Kuwabara T. Mejia E. Gage F.H. Histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated neuronal differentiation of multipotent adult neural progenitor cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16659-16664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 17Montgomery R.L. Hsieh J. Barbosa A.C. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Several studies of histone acetylation in neural development using pan-HDAC inhibitors or knockdown or knock-out models have given somewhat contradictory results (for a review, see Ref. 18Mitrousis N. Tropepe V. Hermanson O. Post-translational modifications of histones in vertebrate neurogenesis.Front. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 483Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that spatial-temporal differences in expression of different HDACs are crucial for their function. So far, there have been few studies of the actions of individual HDACs. Given the importance of these enzymes in various cellular functions, they have become targets for treatment of cancer, neurological disorders, and other diseases. It has been shown by protein crystallography that HDAC inhibitors interact directly with the zinc-binding site and that this interaction is required for inhibitory activity, which can be reversible or irreversible (19Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Breslow R. Pavletich N.P. Structures of a histone deacetylase homolog bound to the TSA and SAHA inhibitors.Nature. 1999; 401: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitors are classified by structure and can be divided into four major classes: short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate (CAS 156-54-7) and valproic acid (CAS 99-66-1); cyclic tetrapeptides such as trapoxin A (CAS 133155-89-2), romidepsin (CAS 128517-07-7), and apicidin (CAS 183506–66-3); hydroxamic acids such as vorinostat (CAS 149647-78-9) and trichostatin A (TSA) (CAS 58880-19-6); and benzamides such as entinostat (CAS 209783-80-2); and 4-(dimethylamino)-N-[6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl]benzamide (CAS 193551-00-7). Sodium butyrate was first discovered by Riggs et al. (20Riggs M.G. Whittaker R.G. Neumann J.R. Ingram V.M. n-Butyrate causes histone modification in HeLa and Friend erythroleukaemia cells.Nature. 1977; 268: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) to cause acetylated histones to accumulate in HeLa and Friend erythroleukemia cells, and further studies by Candido et al. (21Candido E.P. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Sodium butyrate inhibits histone deacetylation in cultured cells.Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) showed that the effect was due to the inhibition of histone deacetylases in a reversible manner. In a deacetylase activity assay with recombinant human HDACs (rhHDACs), entinostat exhibits EC50 in the 100 nm range for rhHDAC1. No inhibition was found for rhHDACs 4, 6, 7 and 8 and an EC50 in the low μm range was described for rhHDACs 2, 3, and 9 (22Khan N. Jeffers M. Kumar S. Hackett C. Boldog F. Khramtsov N. Qian X.

Jensen P.B. et al.Determination of the class and isoform selectivity of small-molecule histone deacetylase inhibitors.Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The same assay showed that apicidin inhibits rhHDACs 2 and 3 in the nanomolar range (120 and 8 nm, respectively) with no inhibitory effect on rhHDAC1 and class II rhHDACs (22Khan N. Jeffers M. Kumar S. Hackett C. Boldog F. Khramtsov N. Qian X. Mills E. Berghs S.C. Carey N. Finn P.W. Collins L.S. Tumber A. Ritchie J.W.

CAS 193551-00-7 is a benzamide derived from entinostat with selective inhibitory activity for HDAC1 in the range of 100 nm (23Jung M. Brosch G. Kölle D. Scherf H. Gerhäuser C. Loidl P. Amide analogues of trichostatin A as inhibitors of histone deacetylase and inducers of terminal cell differentiation.J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4669-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). An in vitro enzyme inhibition assay has shown the selectivity for only HDAC1 with an effect on cell proliferation in murine erythroleukemia cells (23Jung M. Brosch G. Kölle D. Scherf H. Gerhäuser C. Loidl P. Amide analogues of trichostatin A as inhibitors of histone deacetylase and inducers of terminal cell differentiation.J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4669-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In primary cell cultures, 1 μm CAS 193551-00-7 had the same effect as specific HDAC1 siRNA (24Galletti M. Cantoni S. Zambelli F.

Romidepsin is produced by Chromobacterium violaceum and in an assay using HDACs prepared from 293T cells showed that the IC50 for HDAC1 and HDAC2 is in the 40 nm range, whereas inhibition for class II HDAC4 is 500 nm and for HDAC6 is 14,000 nm (26Furumai R.

No inhibitory activity was found for HDAC1, whereas 55% of HDAC4 activity was inhibited in these enzymes immunoprecipitated from human breast cancer ZR-75.1 cell lysates (29Mai A. Massa S. Pezzi R.

We have used the mouse retina as a model to investigate the role of HDACs in terminal differentiation of a specific neuronal cell type, the rod photoreceptor. All retinal cell types originate from a multipotent retinal progenitor cell in a time-dependent manner with horizontal, cone, amacrine, and ganglion cells born embryonically and the great majority of rod, bipolar, and Müller cells being born postnatally (for a review, see Ref. 30Lamb T.D. Evolution of phototransduction, vertebrate photoreceptors and retina.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2013; 36: 52-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). After postnatal day 1 (PN1), rod photoreceptors, which represent the majority of cells in the retina, begin differentiation and start expressing a number of cell type-specific molecules, including the visual pigment protein rhodopsin. Previous studies have linked non-selective inhibition of HDACs by TSA or sodium butyrate to a complete blockage of rod photoreceptor development and an induction of apoptosis in mice (31Chen B. Cepko C.L. Requirement of histone deacetylase activity for the expression of critical photoreceptor genes.BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Wallace D.M. Donovan M. Cotter T.G. Histone deacetylase activity regulates apaf-1 and caspase 3 expression in the developing mouse retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 2765-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies, however, could not define whether all or only some of the specific HDACs were important in retinal development. Here we have used a pharmacological approach to show that inhibition of class I HDACs, particularly HDAC1, leads to the same phenotypic changes seen with broad spectrum inhibitors. Under specific inhibition of HDAC1, acetylation of H3K9 and H4K12 but not H3K27 is increased, and expression of progenitor-specific genes is maintained with concomitant block of expression of rod-specific genes. HDAC1 appears to be key enzyme controlling the passage of cells from a progenitor to a terminally differentiated state. To analyze HDAC expression in the retina, total RNA was isolated from retinas at embryonic day 16 (E16), PN1, PN7, and PN21 and compared with expression in the body and in brain. Most HDACs are expressed in retina, with the exception of HDAC7 (HDAC8 was not tested), and show varying levels throughout development (Fig. 1). General inhibition of HDACs by nonselective inhibitor TSA or sodium butyrate blocks rod photoreceptor development in mouse retina (31Chen B. Cepko C.L. Requirement of histone deacetylase activity for the expression of critical photoreceptor genes.BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test whether there was selectivity in the inhibition of rod differentiation by HDACs, we compared the effects of inhibitors of two classes. In retina explants cultured from PN1–PN4, we tested a panel of inhibitors for class I and class IIa HDACs (Table 1) and followed rhodopsin expression as a marker of rod photoreceptor differentiation. No difference in rhodopsin staining was observed in retinas treated for 96 h with class IIa HDAC inhibitor MC-1568 when compared with control (Fig. 2, A, B, and E). In contrast, inhibition of class I HDACs by entinostat for 96 h showed a 60% decrease in rhodopsin labeling, a decrease comparable with rhodopsin down-regulation by sodium butyrate (Fig. 2, C, D, and E). Co-staining with antibodies recognizing one histone acetylation site, H3K9ac, showed that the level of acetylation was dramatically increased under entinostat and sodium butyrate treatment but not under MC-1568 treatment (Fig. 2, C, D, and F).TABLE 1HDAC inhibitors used in this workHDACsInhibitorIC50Refs.HDAC1CAS 193551-00-7100 (HDAC1); >1,000 nm (HDAC3)23Jung M.

Inhibition of HDAC1 using CAS 193551-00-7 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rhodopsin (Fig. 3, A–G and I) and an increase in labeling by antibodies recognizing H4K12ac (Fig. 3, A–D and J) and H3K9ac (Fig. 3, F and K) but no change in labeling with anti-H3K27ac (Fig. 3, G, H, and L). At the highest concentration of CAS 193551-00-7, there was a clear loss of retinal structure. To confirm that HDAC1 inhibition was not selectively impacting rhodopsin expression but had a more general effect on photoreceptors generation, we examined another photoreceptor specific protein, recoverin, and found that levels were decreased under specific HDAC1 inhibition similarly to rhodopsin (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Specific inhibition of HDAC1 affects recoverin expression.

There is no HDAC2-specific inhibitor, and we were unable to assess HDAC2-specific regulation of retina development, but we could not rule out a possible role of HDAC2 in this process. From these results, we conclude that class I HDACs are important for rod differentiation as defined by the appearance of rhodopsin- or recoverin-expressing cells in developing retina and that within this class HDAC1 is the most important for this process.

https://openalex.org/W2562923316,"MsrPQ is a newly identified methionine sulfoxide reductase system found in bacteria, which appears to be specifically involved in the repair of periplasmic proteins oxidized by hypochlorous acid. It involves two proteins: a periplasmic one, MsrP, previously named YedY, carrying out the Msr activity, and MsrQ, an integral b-type heme membrane-spanning protein, which acts as the specific electron donor to MsrP. MsrQ, previously named YedZ, was mainly characterized by bioinformatics as a member of the FRD superfamily of heme-containing membrane proteins, which include the NADPH oxidase proteins (NOX/DUOX). Here we report a detailed biochemical characterization of the MsrQ protein from Escherichia coli. We optimized conditions for the overexpression and membrane solubilization of an MsrQ-GFP fusion and set up a purification scheme allowing the production of pure MsrQ. Combining UV-visible spectroscopy, heme quantification, and site-directed mutagenesis of histidine residues, we demonstrated that MsrQ is able to bind two b-type hemes through the histidine residues conserved between the MsrQ and NOX protein families. In addition, we identify the E. coli flavin reductase Fre, which is related to the dehydrogenase domain of eukaryotic NOX enzymes, as an efficient cytosolic electron donor to the MsrQ heme moieties. Cross-linking experiments as well as surface Plasmon resonance showed that Fre interacts with MsrQ to form a specific complex. Taken together, these data support the identification of the first prokaryotic two-component protein system related to the eukaryotic NOX family and involved in the reduction of periplasmic oxidized proteins.

Taken together, these data support the identification of the first prokaryotic two-component protein system related to the eukaryotic NOX family and involved in the reduction of periplasmic oxidized proteins. The repair of oxidative damage to proteins associated with the formation of methionine sulfoxide is an important issue for living organisms. This is possible thanks to the presence of the ubiquitous methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes (Msr), which catalyze the reduction of the methionine sulfoxide into the original methionine (1Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Methionine sulfoxide reductase: chemistry, substrate binding, recycling process and oxidase activity.Bioorg. Chem. 2014; 57: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Very recently, a new type of Msr has been discovered in Gram-negative bacteria (2Melnyk R.A. Youngblut M.D. Clark I.C. Carlson H.K. Wetmore K.M. Price M.N. Iavarone A.T. Deutschbauer A.M. Arkin A.P.

This system appears to be specifically involved in the repair of periplasmic proteins oxidized by hypochlorous acid HOCl. HOCl is generated in particular within phagocytic cells of the mammalian innate immune system to kill internalized pathogens. It is a powerful antimicrobial associated with its capability to oxidize methionine residues into methionine sulfoxide, leading to protein misfolding, loss of their cellular function, and aggregation (4Gray M.J.

This new methionine sulfoxide reductase system, named MsrPQ, involves two proteins encoded in the same operon (2Melnyk R.A. Youngblut M.D. Clark I.C. Carlson H.K. Wetmore K.M. Price M.N.

MsrP, which carries out the Msr activity, is a periplasmic soluble protein with a molybdenum atom in its active site. It was previously named YedY (5Loschi L. Brokx S.J. Hills T.L. Zhang G.

To be functional in vivo, MsrP has to be specifically associated with MsrQ, an integral b-type heme containing membrane-spanning protein, previously named YedZ (6Drew D. Sjöstrand D. Nilsson J.

MsrQ was proposed to be the specific electron donor for MsrP, allowing catalysis of methionine sulfoxide reduction (3Gennaris A. Ezraty B. Henry C. Agrebi R. Vergnes A. Oheix E. Bos J. Leverrier P.

Detailed functional characterization of this new Msr system is an important issue to better understand its involvement in the bacterial defense against HOCl stress. This system could play an important role in some pathogenic bacteria to escape the mammalian innate immune system and to cope with the oxidative burst and HOCl killing. Whereas MsrP (YedY) has been structurally well characterized (5Loschi L. Brokx S.J. Hills T.L. Zhang G. Bertero M.G. Lovering A.L. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C.J.

Characterization of an Escherichia coli sulfite oxidase homologue reveals the role of a conserved active site cysteine in assembly and function.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10339-10348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Long before the identification of its physiological function, bioinformatic studies recognized MsrQ as an archetypal domain present in an important superfamily of heme-containing membrane proteins initially designated as the YedZ family (11von Rozycki T. Yen M.-R. Lende E.E. Saier Jr., M.H. The YedZ family: possible heme binding proteins that can be fused to transporters and electron carriers.J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2004; 8: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently, this domain, present in bacterial and eukaryotic representatives, has been renamed as the FRD domain (for ferric reductase domain) (12Zhang X. Krause K.-H. Xenarios I. Soldati T. Boeckmann B. Evolution of the ferric reductase domain (FRD) superfamily: modularity, functional diversification, and signature motifs.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58126Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), based on its identification within STEAP (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate) and FRE (yeast ferric reductases) proteins, which are both involved in iron metabolism (13Ohgami R.S.

Furthermore, the FRD domain is also present within the NADPH oxidase (NOX/DUOX) family of transmembrane enzymes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesDDMdodecyl maltosideEGSethylene glycol-bis-(succinimidylsuccinate)FNRferredoxin NADP+ reductaseFprE. coli ferredoxin NADP+ reductaseFREyeast ferric reductaseFreNAD(P)H:flavin reductase from Escherichia coliLDAON,N-lauryl-(dimethyl)-amine oxideNOXNADPH oxidaseβ-OGoctyl-β-d-glucosideTMtransmembrane segment(s)Fcflow cell(s)Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidSPRsurface plasmon resonancePDBProtein Data BankTEVtobacco etch virus.

The archetype of this FRD membrane domain, with structural similarity to cytochrome b of the mitochondrial bc1 complex, consists of six transmembrane segments (TM) with two bis-histidyl motifs in TM3 and TM5, allowing the chelation of two b-type hemes. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that among the FRD family, MsrQ proteins form a specific group together with the eukaryotic ferric reductases of the STEAP family on one side and the FRE and NOX family on the other side (16Sanchez-Pulido L. Rojas A.M. Valencia A. Martinez-A C. Andrade M.A. ACRATA: a novel electron transfer domain associated to apoptosis and cancer.BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In particular, differences with the NOX and FRE family can be seen within the number of predicted histidine residues involved in heme binding (Fig. 1). In the MsrQ/STEAP family, one of these histidines was replaced by an arginine residue. In addition, whereas the STEAP proteins possess two histidyl residues, MsrQ presents three histidines among the four (Fig. 1). These data suggested that the STEAP/MsrQ proteins might lack one of the two b-type hemes present in the NOX and FRE enzymes (17Kleven M.D. Dlakić M. Lawrence C.M. Characterization of a single b-type heme, FAD, and metal binding sites in the transmembrane domain of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) family proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22558-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MsrQ is also remarkable in that it contains only the transmembrane domain, without any additional cytosolic domains (Fig. 1). In fact, NOX, FRE, and STEAP proteins contain additional dehydrogenase cytosolic domain(s), allowing NADPH and flavin binding (12Zhang X. Krause K.-H. Xenarios I. Soldati T. Boeckmann B. Evolution of the ferric reductase domain (FRD) superfamily: modularity, functional diversification, and signature motifs.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58126Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The presence of such cofactor sites permits efficient electron transfer from NADPH to the membrane b-type hemes, which, for NOX, leads to the catalysis of oxygen reduction and ROS formation and, for ferric reductase, to the reduction of ferric complexes required for iron assimilation. In the case of MsrQ, the membrane reduced quinone pool was proposed to be the source of electrons for the MsrQ heme reduction (3Gennaris A. Ezraty B. Henry C. Agrebi R. Vergnes A. Oheix E. Bos J. Leverrier P. Espinosa L. Szewczyk J. Vertommen D. Iranzo O. Collet J.-F. Barras F. Repairing oxidized proteins in the bacterial envelope using respiratory chain electrons.Nature. 2015; 528: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, taking into account the efficiency of the dehydrogenase systems to reduce the membrane b-type hemes in the FRD family, the existence of soluble cytosolic dehydrogenase protein functioning as MsrQ electron donor might be envisioned. However, for MsrQ, the dehydrogenase would not be an associated cytosolic domain but a separate soluble partner. In this work, we have optimized overproduction, solubilization, and purification of MsrQ. From this new preparation, we have shown that MsrQ contains two b-type hemes, with UV-visible spectra identical to those of NOX proteins. The presence of the two b-type hemes was also supported by mutations of the conserved histidine heme ligands within TM3 and TM5, which led to the loss of one or two b-type hemes. In addition, we have identified Fre, 4It should be noted that Fre, the E. coli flavin reductase, and FRE, the ferric reductases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are different proteins, catalyzing different enzymatic reactions. We discriminate these two proteins by using capital letters, FRE, for ferric reductase and lowercase, Fre, for flavin reductase. This homonymy is even more uncomfortable when considering that Fre from E. coli is homologue to the C-terminal dehydrogenase domain of FRE from S. cerevisiae (as it is with respect to NOX proteins). a cytosolic NAD(P)H flavin reductase, as a potential soluble physiological dehydrogenase partner for MsrQ in Escherichia coli. Altogether, these data suggest that the Fre and MsrQ proteins form a prokaryotic two-component system for electrons transfer through membrane, which could be structurally related to eukaryotic NADPH oxidase enzymes of the NOX family. The optimization of MsrQ production in E. coli was performed following a standardized protocol, which has allowed the overproduction of many E. coli MG1655 membrane proteins fused to GFP (18Drew D. Slotboom D.-J. Friso G. Reda T. Genevaux P. Rapp M. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Lambert W. Lerch M. Daley D.O. Van Wijk K.-J. Hirst J. Kunji E. De Gier J.-W. A scalable, GFP-based pipeline for membrane protein overexpression screening and purification.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2011-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Using a MsrQ-GFP fusion gene cloned into the pET28 vector, 72 different expression conditions, involving the use of seven E. coli strains, three culture media, and three induction temperatures, were screened simultaneously. For each of these conditions, the GFP fluorescence was measured on the whole bacterial cell population to assess the MsrQ-GFP production level. As shown in Fig. 2A, the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain exhibited the highest MsrQ-GFP production level after an overnight induction at 20 °C in a rich culture medium (Terrific Broth, TB). These conditions were selected for MsrQ-GFP production. Cytoplasmic membranes prepared after induction were subsequently solubilized using six different detergents. The soluble and insoluble fractions were recovered and analyzed by immunoblotting, using anti-His tag antibody, to detect the presence of MsrQ-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 2B). DDM was the only detergent able to fully solubilize MsrQ-GFP protein. Whereas detergents belonging to the Fos-choline family were totally ineffective, other detergents, such as LDAO or β-OG, only ensured a partial extraction of the protein from the membrane (Fig. 2B). MsrQ-GFP was purified from membranes solubilized in DDM and loaded onto an Ni-NTA-agarose column (Fig. 2, C and D). 6.5 mg of pure MsrQ-GFP protein per liter of culture were obtained, a yield 2.5 times higher than that reported previously (18Drew D. Slotboom D.-J. Friso G. Reda T. Genevaux P. Rapp M. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Lambert W. Lerch M. Daley D.O. Van Wijk K.-J. Hirst J. Kunji E. De Gier J.-W. A scalable, GFP-based pipeline for membrane protein overexpression screening and purification.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2011-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation with TEV protease, the MsrQ protein without the GFP domain was recovered in the flow-through of a second Ni-NTA-agarose column. A subsequent purification through an anion exchange chromatography led to a yield of 1.5 mg of pure MsrQ protein/liter of culture (Fig. 2D). UV-visible spectroscopy showed that the as-isolated oxidized MsrQ-GFP protein exhibited two intense absorption peaks at 412 and 490 nm, characteristics of oxidized b-type heme and a GFP chromophore, respectively (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, the purified oxidized MsrQ protein, obtained after removal of the GFP part of the fusion, still exhibited the absorption peak centered at 412 nm, and now peaks at 534 and 562 nm were clearly visible (Fig. 3A). Following dithionite reduction, reduced minus oxidized difference spectra of both MsrQ-GFP and MsrQ proteins were found to be identical, revealing three new absorption peaks at 558, 530, and 426 nm corresponding to the α, β, and Soret heme bands, respectively (Fig. 3B). The GFP contribution was abrogated in these difference spectra. This absorption spectrum, identical to that of reduced human neutrophil flavocytochrome b558 (19Segal A.W. Jones O.T. Novel cytochrome b system in phagocytic vacuoles of human granulocytes.Nature. 1978; 276: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), is characteristic of b-type hemoproteins in their reduced states. Using the MsrQ heme content reported in Table 1, the extinction coefficient value for the oxidized MsrQ form at 412 nm was calculated to be 51,950 m−1 cm−1. For the reduced MsrQ form at 426 and 558 nm, the extinction coefficient values were found to be 69,015 m−1 cm−1 and 11,075 m−1 cm−1, respectively.TABLE 1Quantification of MsrQ heme/protein ratioMsrQ concentrationHeme concentration[Heme]/[MsrQ] ratioμmμmAmino acid analysis7.9 ± 0.419.8 ± 1.42.5 ± 0.3Infrared spectroscopy9.5 ± 0.619.8 ± 1.42.1 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab To quantify the MsrQ heme content, a purified MsrQ sample was divided into two parts. The first part of the sample was used for the quantification of heme using the pyridine hemochromogen assay (20Rieske J.S. [76] The quantitative determination of mitochondrial hemoproteins.Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 488-493Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The heme concentration was found to be 19.8 ± 1.4 μm (Table 1). The second part of the sample was used to determine the MsrQ protein concentration by two different techniques. First, quantitative amino acid analysis was carried out. A protein concentration of 7.9 ± 0.4 μm was determined, leading to the calculation of a heme/protein ratio of 2.5 ± 0.3 (Table 1). Second, the protein concentration was determined by infrared spectroscopy using the amide I band corresponding to the carbonyl vibration of the peptide bonds (21Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. The use and misuse of FTIR spectroscopy in the determination of protein structure.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The heme/MsrQ protein ratio quantified by this approach was found to be 2.1 ± 0.3 (Table 1). These data show that MsrQ contains two b-type hemes per polypeptide chain. In the human neutrophil flavocytochrome b558, four histidine residues located in the third and fifth transmembrane domains are involved in the coordination of two b-type hemes (22Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. DeLeo F.R. Epstein R.I. LeRoy B.A. Nauseef W.M. Dinauer M.C. Heme-ligating histidines in flavocytochrome b558: identification of specific histidines in gp91phox.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31105-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Among these histidines, three were remarkably conserved in the MsrQ primary sequence and localized in the third (His-91) and fifth (His-151 and His-164) transmembrane helices (Fig. 1B) (16Sanchez-Pulido L. Rojas A.M. Valencia A. Martinez-A C. Andrade M.A. ACRATA: a novel electron transfer domain associated to apoptosis and cancer.BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As suggested by the topological representation of MsrQ, histidines 91 and 164 could be considered as a first heme-binding site facing the periplasmic compartment, whereas the histidine 151 could be part of a second binding site on the cytoplasmic side. To address the role of histidines 91, 151, and 164 in heme binding, histidine mutants of MsrQ-GFP protein were designed. The impact of these mutations on heme content was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy on the purified proteins (Fig. 3C). The protein concentration of each mutant was normalized using the GFP absorption peak at 490 nm, and the heme content was calculated from the absorbance value at 412 nm, corrected from the absorbance contribution of GFP at this wavelength. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, about half (57%) of the total MsrQ heme content remained present in the H151A mutant protein. These data are in agreement with the involvement of His-151 in the coordination of one of the two MsrQ hemes. Furthermore, whereas the H91A single mutation led to the almost total loss (93%) of the two hemes, the H164A single mutation induced the loss of 63% of the total MsrQ heme content (Fig. 3C). This suggests that His-164 is involved in the coordination of one of the two hemes of MsrQ. Together with the above mentioned topological representation of MsrQ (Fig. 1A), these results suggest that one heme-binding site involves His-164 and most likely His-91, similarly to that reported for NOX enzyme (Fig. 1A) (22Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. DeLeo F.R. Epstein R.I. LeRoy B.A. Nauseef W.M. Dinauer M.C. Heme-ligating histidines in flavocytochrome b558: identification of specific histidines in gp91phox.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31105-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The loss of the two hemes in H91A mutant suggests that His-91 could play an additional role in the global stabilization of the second b-type heme cofactor present in MsrQ. The data also indicate that His-151 is involved in the coordination of the second heme. However, in this case, the second canonical heme binding histidine is missing in the third transmembrane helix (Fig. 1B), suggesting an atypical coordination for the second heme present in MsrQ. Previous bioinformatics analyses suggested an evolutionary relationship between MsrQ and the FRE-NOX protein families (11von Rozycki T. Yen M.-R. Lende E.E. Saier Jr., M.H.

Andrade M.A. ACRATA: a novel electron transfer domain associated to apoptosis and cancer.BMC Cancer. 2004; 4: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that an E. coli cytosolic NADPH-dependent flavoprotein related to the cytosolic dehydrogenase domain of FRE-NOX enzymes could be the source of the electrons for MsrQ heme reduction. This FRE-NOX cytosolic dehydrogenase domain is homologous to the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family (FNR), which bears NADPH and flavin binding sites (23Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R.

To identify such E. coli proteins, a 3D screening of the currently available protein structures in the PDB was performed with the DALI and PDBeFold servers using the spinach FNR structure as a template (the spinach FNR, first structure solved, was used because it historically defined this family).

Fre and Fpr are both NAD(P)H flavin-dependent oxidoreductases, which catalyze the transfer of electrons between NADPH and their cellular targets via a flavin, tightly bound (Fpr) or not bound (Fre) to the polypeptide chain. Thus, Fpr is a flavoprotein (25Bianchi V. Reichard P. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Haggård-Ljungquist E.

Among these two, the physiological role of Fre has never been clearly stated or identified, whereas Fpr is well known for its involvement in glycyl radical generation within pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (25Bianchi V.

Additionally, Sin3A knockdown results in an increase in global histone H3K4me3 levels. Furthermore, decreased H3K4me3 caused by knockdown of either SAM synthetase (Sam-S) or the histone methyltransferase Set1 is restored to near normal levels when SIN3 is also reduced.

https://openalex.org/W2562739910,"CodY is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and GTP sensor and a global regulator of transcription in low G + C Gram-positive bacteria. It controls the expression of over 100 genes and operons, principally by repressing during growth genes whose products are required for adaptations to nutrient limitation. However, the mechanism by which BCAA binding regulates transcriptional changes is not clear. It is known that CodY consists of a GAF (cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterases, adenylate cyclases, FhlA) domain that binds BCAAs and a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain that binds to DNA, but the way in which these domains interact and the structural basis of the BCAA dependence of this interaction are unknown. To gain new insights, we determined the crystal structure of unliganded CodY from Bacillus subtilis revealing a 10-turn α-helix linking otherwise discrete GAF and wHTH domains. The structure of CodY in complex with isoleucine revealed a reorganized GAF domain. In both complexes CodY was tetrameric. Size exclusion chromatography with multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) experiments showed that CodY is a dimer at concentrations found in bacterial cells. Comparison of structures of dimers of unliganded CodY and CodY-Ile derived from the tetramers showed a splaying of the wHTH domains when Ile was bound; splaying is likely to account for the increased affinity of Ile-bound CodY for DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift and SEC-MALLS analyses of CodY binding to 19-36-bp operator fragments are consistent with isoleucine-dependent binding of two CodY dimers per duplex. The implications of these observations for effector control of CodY activity are discussed."

Crystal structures of P- and E-selectin suggest a two-state model in which ligand binding to the lectin domain closes loop 83–89 around the Ca2+ coordination site, enabling Glu-88 to engage Ca2+ and fucose.

Our data support a two-state model for selectins in which Glu-88 must engage ligand to trigger allostery that stabilizes the high affinity state under force. Selectins are adhesion receptors that mediate the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes on vascular surfaces during inflammation, hemostasis, and immune surveillance (1McEver R.P. Zhu C.

Selectins: initiators of leucocyte adhesion and signalling at the vascular wall.Cardiovasc. Res. 2015; 107: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). L-selectin is expressed on leukocytes, E-selectin is expressed on activated endothelial cells, and P-selectin is expressed on activated platelets and endothelial cells. Selectins mediate rolling through reversible interactions (bonds) with cell-surface ligands that are subjected to forces exerted by blood flow. Lower forces prolong bond lifetimes by decreasing off-rates (catch bonds), whereas higher forces shorten bond lifetimes by increasing off-rates (slip bonds). Each of the selectins has an N-terminal C-type lectin domain followed by an EGF domain, a series of consensus repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (1McEver R.P. Zhu C.

In contrast, P-selectin cocrystallized with an N-terminal PSGL-1 fragment and E-selectin cocrystallized with sLex or an sLex mimetic are in the extended state. These structures are consistent with a two-state model in which ligand binding favors allosteric conversion to the extended state (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

Allosteric conversion to the extended state could represent a mechanism for catch bonds (7Lou J. Zhu C. A structure-based sliding-rebinding mechanism for catch bonds.Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 1471-1485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mutating an L-selectin residue that increases the flexibility of the lectin/EGF domain hinge reduces the force required to elicit catch bonds, consistent with this hypothesis (8Lou J. Yago T.

However, mutations that lock selectins in the putative low affinity conformations of the bent states have not been described. A key feature of the two-state model is movement of a loop comprising residues 83–89 near the Ca2+ coordination site of the lectin domain (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

In both bent and extended states of P- and E-selectin, conserved residues Glu-80, Asn-82, Asn-105, and Asn-106 simultaneously coordinate a Ca2+ ion and the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups of fucose. In the bent state the 83–89 loop is open. In the extended state the loop closes, allowing Glu-88 to interact with Ca2+ and the 2-hydroxyl group of fucose. The closed loop also enables Arg-85 in P-selectin to interact with a tyrosine sulfate in PSGL-1 and Gln-85 in E-selectin to dock with fucose (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

Cell Biol. 2016; 8: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glu-88 is conserved in L-selectin, but no structure has documented its orientation in the presence or absence of bound ligand. It is not known whether the Glu-88 interactions are essential for high affinity binding of selectins to their ligands, particularly when bonds are subjected to force. The two-state model further predicts that ligand-induced closure of the 83–89 loop precedes the large scale movements of interdomain extension (5Preston R.C. Jakob R.P. Binder F.P. Sager C.P.

Structural basis for selectin mechanochemistry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no crystal structure has captured this intermediate conformation. Here we report the structure of the lectin and EGF domains of human L-selectin bound to a fucose mimetic; that is, a terminal mannose on an N-glycan attached to the lectin domain of a neighboring molecule. The structure has an intermediate conformation in which the 83–89 loop closes to allow Glu-88 to interact with Ca2+ and mannose but without the large scale movements required for extension. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that all three selectins require Glu-88 to sustain bonds with sLex-containing ligands under force. Mutating Glu-88 to Asp locks selectins in their functionally inactive states and markedly impairs selectin-mediated cell rolling under flow. We expressed the lectin and EGF domains of human L-selectin in Lec1 CHO cells that permit synthesis of Man5GlcNAc2 but not complex N-glycans (11Patnaik S.K. Stanley P. Lectin-resistant CHO glycosylation mutants.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 416: 159-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We crystallized the glycosylated L-selectin protein, which is unlike previous P- and E-selectin proteins in which N-glycans were enzymatically removed before crystallization (3Graves B.J.

Clear electron density was observed throughout the structure except for residues 125–131 and 145–156 in the distal regions of the EGF domain. Fig. 1A depicts a ribbon diagram of the structure. L-selectin has potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn-22 and Asn-66 in the lectin domain and at Asn-139 in the EGF domain. A single GlcNAc, termed N-glycan 1, is attached to Asn-22. A Man5GlcNAc2 pentasaccharide, termed N-glycan 2, is attached to Asn-66. No N-glycan is attached to Asn-139, although its side chain is visible.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for L-selectinPDB entry3CFWData collectionSpace groupI 23 (197)Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)118.477α, β, γ (o)90Molecules in asymmetric unit1Resolution range (Å)25-2.2Rsym (%)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.12.6 (64.4)Completeness %aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.99.8 (98.9)Total observations197,554Unique reflections14,192〈I/s(I)〉aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.12.8 (2.3)Model refinementResolution (Å)25-2.2Rfactor (%)20.1Rfree (%)24.9〈B value〉 (Å)30Root mean square deviationsBonds (Å)0.013Angles (o)1.52a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The L-selectin structure has a bent orientation between the lectin and EGF domains that closely resembles the bent states of P- and E-selectin (Fig. 1B). The singular difference is the loop comprising residues 83–89 near the Ca2+ coordination site in the lectin domain. The loop in L-selectin is closed, much like the closed loop in the extended structure of P-selectin cocrystallized with an sLex-containing PSGL-1 fragment and of E-selectin cocrystallized with sLex or an sLex mimetic (Fig. 1, C and D). Closer examination of L-selectin revealed that the Ca2+ coordination site is occupied by the terminal mannose of N-glycan 2 on a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal lattice (Fig. 2, A and B). The Ca2+ coordination sites of all three selectins have a Glu-Pro-Asn motif at residues 80–82, in common with a larger group of C-type lectins, including the prototypical mannose-binding protein, which binds both fucose and mannose (12Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. The C-type lectin superfamily in the immune system.Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Thus, we obtained a cocrystal structure of L-selectin bound to an endogenous ligand. Binding of mannose stabilizes the 83–89 loop in the closed conformation (see below). This orientation is further stabilized by lattice contacts of Lys-85 with residues in a neighboring molecule (Fig. 2, C and D). Ligand binding that closes the 83–89 loop is thought to trigger allosteric conversion from the bent to extended states of selectins (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The L-selectin structure captures a ligand-bound conformation with a closed 83–89 loop that retains the overall bent orientation between the lectin and EGF domains. N-Glycan 2 is attached to Asn-66 on a surface loop that is normally part of a larger rigid-body movement in the lectin domain during extension. The simultaneous linkage of N-glycan 2 to the ligand binding region of one molecule and to Asn-66 on a neighboring molecule restrains the Asn-66-containing loop, decoupling linked allostery after ligand binding. Binding of the terminal mannose of N-glycan 2 to L-selectin closely resembles binding of fucose to P- and E-selectin cocrystallized with sLex-containing ligands (Fig. 3, A–C). L-selectin engages the equatorial 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups of mannose, whereas P- and E-selectin engage the equatorial 3-hydroxyl and axial 4-hydroxyl groups of fucose. In all structures, Glu-80, Asn-82, Asn-105, and Asp-106 form hydrogen bonds with the hexose and ionic interactions with the Ca2+ ion. The closed 83–89 loop of L-selectin positions Glu-88 to simultaneously ligate Ca2+ and the 4-hydroxyl of mannose, whereas the closed loops of P- and E-selectin position Glu-88 to ligate Ca2+ and the 2-hydroxyl group of fucose. In E-selectin, unique loop residue Gln-85 also engages the 2-hydroxyl of fucose. Equivalent residues in mannose-binding protein (except for Gln-85) interact with Ca2+ and mannose, including Glu-193, which corresponds to Glu-88 in selectins (Fig. 3D). The loop containing Glu-193 remains closed in mannose-binding protein crystallized without ligand (13Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure of the calcium-dependent lectin domain from a rat mannose-binding protein determined by MAD phasing.Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the loop is open in P- and E-selectin crystallized without ligand and does not move when sLex is soaked into these crystals, leaving Glu-88 unengaged (Fig. 3, E and F). To assess the role of Glu-88 in high affinity binding to ligands, we expressed two soluble human P-selectin monomers comprising the lectin and EGF domains: the WT protein and an E88D mutant that replaced Glu-88 with Asp, thus shortening the side chain by 1.5 Å but retaining the core structure and charge. We used surface plasmon resonance to measure binding of each protein to 2-GSP-6, a glycosulfopeptide that recapitulates the N-terminal binding site on PSGL-1 (8Lou J. Yago T. Klopocki A.G. Mehta P. Chen W. Zarnitsyna V.I. Bovin N.V. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Flow-enhanced adhesion regulated by a selectin interdomain hinge.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The 2-GSP-6 was biotinylated and captured on a streptavidin sensor at low density to avoid rebinding of P-selectin after dissociation. Sensor plots demonstrated rapid association and dissociation kinetics for both proteins, but dissociation was clearly more rapid for P-selectinE88D (Fig. 4, A and B). Data for both proteins best fit a one-state binding model. The measured koff for WT P-selectin was 3.1 ± 0.3 s−1, similar to previous results (14Mehta P. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. Affinity and kinetic analysis of P-selectin binding to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32506-32513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas the koff for P-selectinE88D was greater than 10 s−1, the upper limits for detection on the instrument. Non-linear curve-fitting of the equilibrium binding isotherms indicated that P-selectinE88D bound with an ∼9-fold lower affinity than WT P-selectin (Fig. 4, C and D), at least in part from faster dissociation. As a complementary assay, we used a biomembrane force probe to measure two-dimensional interactions of WT or E88D forms of P-selectin with 2-GSP-6 at high temporal and spatial resolution (Fig. 5A). Two micropipettes were placed on opposite sides of a chamber visualized with an inverted microscope. One micropipette held a biotinylated red blood cell used as a force transducer. Biotinylated 2-GSP-6 was attached to a streptavidin-coated glass bead, which was then attached to the biotinylated red blood cell, forming a force probe. The other micropipette held a glass bead (target) to which soluble P-selectin or P-selectinE88D was captured with an immobilized non-blocking mAb. Alternatively, the micropipette held as a target a transfected murine L1–2 pre-B cell expressing full-length P-selectin or P-selectinE88D. The micropipette bearing the target was brought in contact with the 2-GSP-6-coated probe for 0.1 s and then retracted. Adhesion was measured by deflection of the red blood cell. The adhesion frequency for 50 contacts was measured. Beads bearing P-selectin bound specifically to 2-GSP-6. However, beads bearing P-selectinE88D did not bind (Fig. 5B). Similarly, cells expressing P-selectin bound to 2-GSP-6, whereas cells expressing P-selectinE88D did not bind (Fig. 5C). To assess the role of Glu-88 in selectin binding to ligands under force, we expressed full-length WT and E88D forms of each human selectin in transfected murine L1–2 pre-B cells that do not express endogenous L-selectin. Cell sorting was used to obtain populations with matched densities of WT and E88D for each human selectin (Fig. 6, A–C). Selectin-expressing cells were allowed to settle on monolayers of CHO cells expressing PSGL-1 and the glycosyltransferases required to express sLex on N-glycans and core 2 branched O-glycans (CHO-C2/FTVII/PSGL-1 cells). Flow was then initiated at various wall shear stresses, and the number of rolling cells was quantified. Cells expressing each of the WT selectins rolled on the monolayers (Fig. 6, D, F, and G). Cells expressing L-selectin also rolled on immobilized 6-sulfo-sLex (Fig. 6E). In marked contrast, cells expressing P-selectinE88D or L-selectinE88D failed to roll on these ligands. Instead, they detached immediately after flow was initiated. Significantly fewer cells expressing E-selectinE88D rolled on the monolayers, particularly at higher shear stress (Fig. 6G). However, the adhesion defect was less pronounced than for cells expressing P-selectinE88D or L-selectinE88D. Our studies provide strong experimental support for the two-state model of selectin allostery. In particular, they demonstrate that the selectin 83–89 loop must precisely align Glu-88 to strengthen binding to glycan ligands. Our structure of L-selectin binding to terminal mannose on a neighboring N-glycan validates the placement of selectins within a subset of C-type lectins that can interact with mannose or fucose (12Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. The C-type lectin superfamily in the immune system.Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with an early report that mannose and mannose phosphate inhibit L-selectin-dependent adhesion of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules (15Stoolman L.M. Tenforde T.S. Rosen S.D. Phosphomannosyl receptors may participate in the adhesive interaction between lymphocytes and high endothelial venules.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). L-selectin uses the same conserved residues around the Ca2+ coordination site to bind to mannose as P- and E-selectin use to bind to fucose. Thus, the structure mimics L-selectin binding to fucose in a physiological selectin ligand, but it has the advantage of freezing allosteric movement after binding. The 83–89 loop closes to dock Glu-88 with mannose and the Ca2+ ion, as in cocrystal structures of extended P- and E-selectin binding to sLex-containing ligands. However, L-selectin remains bent, because binding of the mannose terminating N-glycan 2 to another molecule restricts movement of the loop containing Asn-66, to which the glycan is anchored. This prevents downstream rearrangements that open the angle between the lectin and EGF domains (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, our structure reveals how ligand binding initiates allostery by first closing the 83–89 loop. It also shows that binding of a single monosaccharide is sufficient to trigger allostery. The engagement of Glu-88 in putative high affinity complexes of each selectin with glycan ligands suggested its importance. Glu-88 is conserved in E- and L-selectin of all species sequenced. In primates, P-selectin has Glu-88; in other species, Glu-88 is substituted with Gln, which has a side chain of identical length that could also interact with Ca2+ and with mannose or fucose. In our studies, shortening the side chain by only 1.5 Å markedly reduced the force-free affinity of P-selectinE88D for PSGL-1. Thus, the 83–89 loop has limited flexibility and requires a relatively long side chain at residue 88 to reach Ca2+ and sugar. The low affinity binding of P-selectinE88D to PSGL-1 is consistent with the hypothesized low affinity binding of sLex to the bent, open-loop crystal structures of P- and E-selectin, where Glu-88 does not engage Ca2+ or fucose (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

Moreover, our results demonstrate that ligand binding without Glu-88 is exquisitely sensitive to force. Cells expressing E88D mutants of P- or L-selectin immediately detached from immobilized ligands at all shear stresses tested. Binding of E-selectinE88D to sLex was less force-sensitive. This may be due to a unique, additional interaction of Gln-85 with fucose when loop 83–89 closes. In the P-selectin-PSGL-1 cocrystal structure, Arg-85 in P-selectin engages sulfated Tyr-10 (4Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T.

This interaction was not sufficient to prevent flow-induced detachment of cells expressing P-selectinE88D from immobilized PSGL-1. Conversely, if Glu-88 remains, mutating Tyr-10 does not prevent rolling of cells expressing P-selectin on PSGL-1 (16Ramachandran V. Nollert M.U. Qiu H. Liu W-J. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Tyrosine replacement in P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 affects distinct kinetic and mechanical properties of bonds with P- and L-selectin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Why is Glu-88 so critical for selectin bonds? Fucose in sLex-containing ligands forms a ternary complex with Ca2+ and with Glu-80, Asn-82, Asn-105, and Asp-106. This region is part of a rigid surface that includes a loop from 77–82 with Glu-80 and Asn-82, the β5 strand from 103–108 with Asn-105 and Asp-106, and the β4 strand from 90–94 with Glu-92 and Tyr-94 (Fig. 7A). A disulfide bond between Cys-109 and Cys-90 connects the two β strands, limiting their movement. The broad surface surrounding the Ca2+ coordination site permits sLex-containing ligands to bind rapidly. However, they dissociate rapidly even without applied force unless closure of the 83–89 loop permits Glu-88 to interact with Ca2+ and fucose, strengthening the ternary complex. The fitting of data to a one-state binding model in our surface-plasmon-resonance experiments suggests that ligand binding to the open-loop form of P-selectin immediately triggers loop closure. Fucose binding moves Glu-80 and Asn-82 closer to Ca2+ and creates strain on the 83–89 loop. This induces loop closure by disruption of a hydrogen bond between the main-chain nitrogen of Cys-109 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of residue 87 and of interactions of the Asp-89 side chain"

The test can be combined with existing methods to determine whether genetic heterogeneity is driven by population stratification or by different mechanisms of disease pathology. Many common diseases show wide phenotypic variation. We present a statistical method for determining whether phenotypically defined subgroups of disease cases represent different genetic architectures, in which disease-associated variants have different effect sizes in two subgroups. Our method models the genome-wide distributions of genetic association statistics with mixture Gaussians. We apply a global test without requiring explicit identification of disease-associated variants, thus maximizing power in comparison to standard variant-by-variant subgroup analysis. Where evidence for genetic subgrouping is found, we present methods for post hoc identification of the contributing genetic variants. We demonstrate the method on a range of simulated and test data sets, for which expected results are already known. We investigate subgroups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) defined by autoantibody positivity, establishing evidence for differential genetic architecture with positivity for thyroid-peroxidase-specific antibody, driven generally by variants in known T1D-associated genomic regions."

Zinc-requiring enzymes are involved in a myriad of critical biological functions in the cytosol, the lumen of various organelles, and the extracellular space. As compared with cytosolic zinc-requiring enzymes, secreted, membrane-bound, and organelle-resident zinc-requiring enzymes (hereafter “ectoenzymes”) require a distinct regulatory mechanism for activation because ectoenzymes are considered to capture zinc in the early secretory pathway, including in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, before trafficking to their final destination.

CAs catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate and thus maintain the required pH in biological fluids, and these enzymes are consequently involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes both intracellularly and extracellularly (10Supuran C.T.

In this study, we investigated, in comparison with TNAP, whether the activation processes of ATX, MMP9, and CAIX are governed by zinc metalation mediated by ZNT transporters by using chicken DT40 cell mutants (25Kambe T. Methods to evaluate zinc transport into and out of the secretory and endosomal-lysosomal compartments in DT40 cells.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 534: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We determined that ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers or ZNT7 homodimers were involved in the activation and/or maturation of all three ectoenzymes, although the transporters were distinctly involved, and their involvement in the activation of these enzymes also differed from their role in TNAP activation. We further showed that in addition to ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers and ZNT7 homodimers, ZNT4 homodimers contributed to the activation of one of these zinc-requiring ectoenzymes (CAIX). Our results describe novel processes by which ZNT transporters facilitate the activation of zinc-requiring ectoenzymes, and these data could also offer new insights into potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer. ATX is a two zinc-centered ectoenzyme, and thus the active site geometry of ATX is similar to that of alkaline phosphatases such as TNAP (16Nishimasu H. Okudaira S. Hama K. Mihara E. Dohmae N. Inoue A. Ishitani R. Takagi J. Aoki J. Nureki O. Crystal structure of autotaxin and insight into GPCR activation by lipid mediators.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2011; 18: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, zinc-dependent activation of ATX is probably mediated by ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers and ZNT7 homodimers. Because the mRNA of atx was not detected in DT40 cells by using RT-PCR analysis (data not shown), we exogenously expressed human ATX in DT40 cells (wild-type (WT) cells) and DT40 cells deficient in znt5, znt6, and/or znt7 (znt5−znt6−/− cells, Δ5Δ6 cells, and znt5−znt6−/−znt7−/− cells, triple knock-out (TKO) cells), and we examined ATX activity by measuring the rate of conversion of LPC to LPA. ATX activity was clearly detected in WT cells (Fig. 1A, left graph), and the activity could be readily distinguished from TNAP activity because the ATX substrate was not hydrolyzed even when human TNAP was overexpressed in the cells (Fig. 1A, right graph). ATX activity was dependent on ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers (re-expression of ZNT5 alone, or ZNT6 alone, failed to activate ATX, data not shown) and ZNT7 homodimers. The activity in DT40 cells lacking Znt5-Znt6 heterodimers was decreased to 30% of that in WT cells and that in TKO cells was decreased to <5%, which paralleled what was observed with Tnap activity in the same cells (Fig. 1B). Similar to what we previously reported regarding TNAP activity (5Suzuki T. Ishihara K. Migaki H. Matsuura W. Kohda A. Okumura K. Nagao M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Kambe T.

However, ATX activity was restored only partially by the simultaneous re-expression of human ZNT5-ZNT6 or ZNT7 (Fig. 1C). The activation of ATX by ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers and ZNT7 homodimers is highly similar to the activation of TNAP, but the stability of ATX and TNAP in the TKO cells was found to differ considerably; although the ATX protein was not degraded (Fig. 1B), TNAP protein was markedly destabilized and was degraded (8Fukunaka A.

We recently reported that the di-proline motif (PP motif) in luminal loop 2 of ZNT5 and ZNT7 plays a pivotal role in the appropriate activation of TNAP (27Fujimoto S. Tsuji T. Fujiwara T. Takeda T.A. Merriman C. Fukunaka A. Nishito Y. Fu D. Hoch E. Sekler I. Fukue K. Miyamae Y. Masuda S. Nagao M. Kambe T. The PP motif in luminal loop 2 of ZnT transporters plays a pivotal role in TNAP activation.Biochem. J. 2016; 473: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and thus we hypothesized that the aforementioned difference might be explained by differences in the contribution of the PP motif. We investigated this point by using an alanine-substituted mutant of the PP motif of ZNT5 (ZNT5PP-AA) (27Fujimoto S. Tsuji T. Fujiwara T. Takeda T.A. Merriman C. Fukunaka A. Nishito Y. Fu D. Hoch E. Sekler I. Fukue K. Miyamae Y. Masuda S. Nagao M. Kambe T. The PP motif in luminal loop 2 of ZnT transporters plays a pivotal role in TNAP activation.Biochem. J. 2016; 473: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ATX activity was partially but not fully restored (∼50% reduction) by the coexpression of ZNT5PP-AA and ZNT6 as compared with the activity following the coexpression of ZNT5 and ZNT6 (Fig. 1E, left graph); by contrast, Tnap activity was reduced to <10% after the coexpression of ZNT5PP-AA and ZNT6 as compared with that after coexpression of ZNT5 and ZNT6 (Fig. 1E, right graph). The ATX protein in TKO cells stably coexpressing ZNT5PP-AA and ZNT6 and in TKO cells stably coexpressing WT ZNT5 and ZNT6 appeared almost identical (Fig. 1E, lower panel), which suggested that the PP motif affects ATX activity less markedly than it affects TNAP activity. Thus, these results indicate that ATX activation requires ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers or ZNT7 homodimers in a manner almost identical to TNAP activation but that certain differences exist in the metalation process. We next investigated whether MMP9 and MMP2 gelatinase activity was also regulated by ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers or ZNT7 homodimers. We expressed human MMP9 or MMP2 in WT and TKO cells and performed gelatin zymography to compare the activity of MMP9 or MMP2 secreted from these cells. The spent media collected from cultures of WT cells stably expressing MMP9 showed a single clear band (∼88 kDa following electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions), but the intensity of this band was substantially diminished in the case of media from cultures of TKO cells stably expressing MMP9 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with MMP9 activity, MMP9 protein level in the spent medium from TKO cells was markedly lower than that from WT cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed in WT or TKO cells stably expressing MMP2. In the gelatin zymograph, the band intensity of MMP2 (seen as an ∼61-kDa single clear band, under non-reducing conditions) and the levels of MMP2 protein in the immunoblot were decreased in the spent media from cultures of TKO cells, compared with those of WT cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, lack of both Znt5-Znt6 heterodimers and Znt7 homodimers did not cause any defect in ATX secretion because ATX levels, both secreted and intracellular, were almost the same in WT and TKO cells stably expressing ATX (Fig. 2C). These results suggested that ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers or ZNT7 homodimers are crucial for both the proper activation and the secretion of MMP9 and MMP2. To further examine this point, we chose to focus on MMP9 because the magnitude of decrease in MMP9 activity and expression in TKO cells was much larger than that seen for MMP2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Re-expression of ZNT5 and ZNT6 together, or re-expression of ZNT7 alone, restored both the decreased activity and protein levels of MMP9 in TKO cells back to a level comparable with that in WT cells. Re-expression of ZNT5 alone, or ZNT6 alone, failed to restore MMP9 activity and expression (data not shown). Similar restoration was seen in the case with Tnap (Fig. 2D, right graph). Interestingly, both the activity and the protein level of MMP9 in the spent medium from TKO cells increased after zinc supplementation and were restored to almost WT levels at 50 μm ZnSO4 (Fig. 2E, upper panel). This contrasts sharply with the cases of ATX (Fig. 1D) and Tnap (Fig. 2E, lower graph), which could not be restored simply by increasing zinc levels. These results suggest that MMP9 can capture zinc independently of ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers or ZNT7 homodimers if zinc is present in excess but that ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers and ZNT7 homodimers play a pivotal role in the proper activation and secretion of MMP9 under normal culture conditions. To investigate in detail how MMP9 activity and expression in the spent medium from TKO cells were impaired, we examined the MMP9 maturation process in the early secretory pathway in TKO cells. Unexpectedly, intracellular MMP9 protein was detected as an ∼80-kDa band in WT cells, whereas it appeared as a major band of ∼90 kDa in TKO cells (after electrophoresis under reducing conditions) (Fig. 2F). However, coexpression of ZNT5 and ZNT6 or re-expression of ZNT7 in the TKO cells shifted the ∼90-kDa band to ∼80 kDa, which indicated that a lack of both ZNT zinc-transport complexes led to an increase in the size of the intracellular MMP9 protein (Fig. 2F). Moreover, treatment of WT cells with bafilomycin A1, but not MG132, led to the intracellular MMP9 protein band shifting from ∼80 to ∼90 kDa (Fig. 2G), a size similar to that in TKO cells. These results indicate that intracellular MMP9 in WT cells, which was detected as an ∼90-kDa band in immunoblotting, was proteolytically cleaved in lysosomal compartments and that this did not occur in the TKO cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that proteolytic cleavage ability of MMP9 is likely associated with MMP9 activation and secretion into the spent medium. Similar to TNAP and ATX, MMP9 requires zinc metalation mediated by ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers or ZNT7 homodimers for its activation, although the processes by which the transporters facilitate the activation differ. Finally, we examined whether ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers and ZNT7 homodimers contribute to the process of CAIX activation. The mRNA of caIX was expressed at a moderate level in DT40 cells (Fig. 3A), but the activity of endogenous CaIX was extremely weak using the ΔpH/Δt assay (see “Experimental Procedures”); no significant difference in CaIX activity was seen in cells treated with or without the CA inhibitor acetazolamide (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, we could not compare the CaIX activity in TKO cells with that in WT cells. Therefore, we established WT and TKO cells stably expressing human CAIX as in the case of the aforementioned ectoenzymes. The activity of exogenously expressed CAIX in WT cells was clearly detected (Fig. 3, B and C), and the activity was completely inhibited by acetazolamide (Fig. 3, B and C), which indicated that this assay was suitable for investigating the features of the CAIX activation process. Our immunoblotting results revealed that CAIX expressed in WT DT40 cells appeared as several bands that included broad upper bands at ∼70 kDa and a comparatively sharper lower band at ∼60 kDa (Fig. 3C), as reported elsewhere (28Závada J. Závadová Z. Zat'ovicová M. Hyrsl L. Kawaciuk I. Soluble form of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) in the serum and urine of renal carcinoma patients.Br. J.

Soluble form of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) in transitional cell carcinoma of urinary tract.Neoplasma. 2009; 56: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under zinc-deficient conditions, the broad upper bands gradually disappeared over time (Fig. 3D, lower panel), and this almost paralleled the reduction in CAIX activity, which was decreased by 30% at 24 h and by 60% at >48 h (Fig. 3D, left graph); this result also indicated that CAIX was less sensitive than Tnap to zinc deficiency (Fig. 3D, right graph). The decrease in CAIX activity was reversed by zinc supplementation as in the case of Tnap (Fig. 3E, upper graphs), and this was accompanied by the restoration of the broad upper bands in immunoblots (Fig. 3E, lower panel). These results suggest that the CAIX protein corresponding to the broad upper bands was zinc-responsive. We then compared CAIX activity between TKO cells and WT cells. Unexpectedly, in TKO cells, CAIX activity was not markedly decreased, and the zinc-responsive broad upper bands in immunoblots did not disappear (Fig. 3F, left graph), although Tnap activity was decreased to <5% in the same cells (Fig. 3F, right graph). These results indicate that CAIX can acquire zinc through an additional pathway that is independent of ZNT5-ZNT6 heterodimers and ZNT7 homodimers even under normal culture conditions. DT40 cells expressed znt4 mRNA at a high level (Fig. 4A), and ZNT4 partially localized to the Golgi apparatus and formed homodimers (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, we examined the possibility that ZNT4 functions as a zinc entry route into the early secretory pathway and supplies zinc to CAIX. To test whether CAIX is redundantly activated by ZNT4 homodimers, we disrupted Znt4 in the TKO cells and established quadruple KO DT40 cells (znt4−/−znt5−znt6−/−znt7−/− cells, QKO cells) (Fig. 4D). The cell surface protein expression was not altered in QKO cells, compared with either WT or TKO cells (Fig. 4E), indicating that the secretory pathway is not significantly impaired in QKO cells. In QKO cells, CAIX activity was decreased substantially (by >60%), and this was accompanied by a loss of the zinc-responsive broad upper bands in immunoblots (Fig. 4F). However, CAIX activity and the zinc-responsive bands of CAIX in znt4−/− (Δ4) cells were almos"

In this study, we used human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and tissue specimens to study the mechanism and herein report several new findings. First, we cloned and characterized the basal promoter region of the human RYBP gene. We found that the decreased RYBP expression in HCC tissues was not due to promoter sequence variation/polymorphisms or CpG dinucleotide methylation. We identified two transcription factors, KLF4 and Sp1, which directly bind the promoter region of RYBP to induce and suppress RYBP transcription, respectively. We mapped the binding sites of KLF4 and Sp1 on the RYBP promoter. Studies in vitro showed that KLF4 suppresses whereas Sp1 promotes HCC cell growth through modulating RYBP expression. Deregulated KLF4 and Sp1 contributed to decreased expression of RYBP in HCC tumor tissues. Our studies of human HCC tissues indicated that a diminished RYBP level in the tumor (in association with altered KLF4 and Sp1 expression) was statistically associated with a larger tumor size, poorer differentiation, and an increased susceptibility to distant metastasis. These findings help to clarify why RYBP is decreased in HCC and indicate that deregulated KLF4, Sp1, and RYBP may lead to a poorer prognosis.

However, little is currently known about the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the down-regulation of RYBP in these tumors, and this has limited the understanding of its regulation and, consequently, the development of an optimal approach for targeting RYBP expression as a therapeutic strategy for human cancers.

We herein report several important results, including the cloning and characterization of the previously uncharacterized promoter region of the human RYBP gene, the discovery of the direct binding of two transcription factors (Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1)) to this region of RYBP as well as the specific binding sites of these transcription factors, and the involvement of RYBP in KLF4- and Sp1-modulated liver cancer cell growth. We also demonstrate that the deregulation of KLF4, Sp1, and RYBP is related to a more malignant phenotype of HCC.

The protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit. 40 μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the targeted proteins were probed with corresponding antibodies. Huh7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 103 cells/well and transfected the next day with the indicated plasmids for 72 h. The viable cells were assayed using the MTS reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. HepG2 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes at a density of 4 × 105/dish. On the next day, cells were transfected with different combinations of the indicated plasmids for 48 h. The cells were collected and fixed in 75% alcohol overnight, and the cell pellets were digested with RNase A at 37 °C for 20 min and stained with propidium iodide. Then the cell cycle distribution was analyzed by Coulter Epics XL Flow Cytometer (Coulter Corp.). Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 300 cells/well and were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-2 or pFLAG-Sp1 together with either shCtrl or shRYBP expression vector for 24 h. The medium was replaced every 3 days. After 2 weeks of culture, the medium was removed, and cell colonies were stained with crystal violet (0.1% in 20% methanol). Pictures were taken using a digital camera. Cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes and cultured to about 90% confluence. The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and the cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine. Cellular lysates were collected, and genomic DNAs were sonicated to lengths around 500 bp. The DNA solution was clarified by centrifugation, and 15 μl of the supernatant was decross-linked by heating at 65 °C for 5 h and used as an input. Equal amounts of the rest of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with control rabbit IgG, anti-KLF4, or anti-Sp1 antibodies and decross-linked by heat. The DNA samples were purified and resuspended in TE buffer. The primers used for ordinary PCR and real-time quantitative PCR were as follows: forward, 5′-CCACGCTCAAGTCCACAA-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTTCGCAGGAATCCAGTG-3′. The GraphPad Prism version 5 software program for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to analyze the promoter activity and mRNA levels. Data were expressed as the means ± S.D. of triplicate samples, and all experiments were repeated at least two times. Pearson's χ2 test was used to compare qualitative variables, and Student's t test was applied to analyze quantitative variables. The IHC results were analyzed utilizing the SPSS version 19.0 software program for Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). All statistical tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previous studies have shown that the expression of RYBP mRNA and protein is reduced in HCC tumor tissues (14Chen D. Zhang J. Li M. Rayburn E.R. Wang H. Zhang R. RYBP stabilizes p53 by modulating MDM2.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Wang W. Cheng J. Qin J.J. Voruganti S. Nag S. Fan J. Gao Q. Zhang R. RYBP expression is associated with better survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and responsiveness to chemotherapy of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 11604-11619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the reduced expression, we first examined the mRNA levels of RYBP in IHHs and five HCC cell lines (Huh7, HepG2, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, and SK-Hep-1), which we intended to use as cellular models. In comparison with the IHHs, three of the HCC cell lines (Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, and SK-Hep-1) showed significantly decreased RYBP mRNA expression, whereas one cell line (HepG2) had highly elevated RYBP mRNA expression (Fig. 1A). Because there was a gap starting from +19 nt downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of the human RYBP gene in the GenBankTM sequence (accession numbers NT_022459, NC_000003, and NC_018914) when we started this project, we first filled the gap (located from +19 to +513 bp; 495 bp in total). After obtaining the complete promoter sequence of the human RYBP gene, we analyzed the area around the TSS (ranging from −3000 to +3000 bp). As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, we could see that there was a large CpG island between −557 and +901 bp predicted by CpGFinder, and this region contained 202 CpG dinucleotides. This had a (G + C) content of 77.0%, and the ratio of observed to expected CpGs was 0.935. In this region, three GC boxes (−145/−125, −123/−102, and −50/−35) and one CAAT box (−83/−70) were predicted to cluster together in close proximity to the TSS, but no TATA box was predicted near the TSS. However, a canonical initiator element exists around the TSS (−2/+5). The above analysis indicated that the RYBP promoter is a GC box-rich but TATA box-less promoter. To determine whether there were variations around the 5′-flanking sequence of RYBP, we first amplified the DNA fragments around the TSS of the gene (−711 to +1040 relative to the IHH sequence), which encompassed the predicted CpG island, using genomic DNA samples from the six liver cell lines as templates. Our results showed that there were no detectable deletion/insertion variations around the TSS sites in any of these cell lines based on an agarose gel electrophoresis assay, suggesting that the differential expression of RYBP among these cells was not due to major sequence variations that led to a difference in length (data not shown). Next, we subcloned these promoter fragments into the pGL3-Basic vector and sequenced them. The sequence alignments showed that although there were several minor variations/polymorphisms, no consistent alterations were present that were associated with the RYBP expression levels in the six cell lines (Fig. 1D), implying that sequence variations/polymorphisms were also unlikely to explain the altered RYBP expression in the HCC cells. Because CpG dinucleotides are rich in the promoter region of RYBP, we explored whether CpG methylation was associated with reduced RYBP expression. Although a number of methylated CpG sites upstream of the predicted CpG island were detected by bisulfite sequencing in all six cell lines, none of these sites were specifically related to altered RYBP expression (Fig. 1E). We subsequently treated Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, and SK-Hep-1 cells with 5-azacytidine, a reagent that inhibits CpG methylation, but no obvious induction of RYBP was observed. Taken together, these results indicated that CpG methylation in the RYBP promoter was not a major contributor to the reduced RYBP expression in HCC cells. We then wondered whether the reduced RYBP level resulted from factors outside the DNA sequence itself. To test this hypot"

Here, we present the structural basis for the substrate specificity, with a preference for polymannuronate, of AkAly30. The crystal structure of AkAly30 at a 1.77 Å resolution and the putative substrate-binding model show that the enzyme adopts a β-jelly roll fold at the core of the structure and that Lys-99, Tyr-140, and Tyr-142 form catalytic residues in the active site. Their arrangements allow the carboxyl group of mannuronate residues at subsite +1 to form ionic bonds with Lys-99. The coupled tyrosine forms a hydrogen bond network with the glycosidic bond, and the hydroxy group of Tyr-140 is located near the C5 atom of the mannuronate residue. These interactions could promote the β-elimination of the mannuronate residue at subsite +1. More interestingly, Gly-118 and the disulfide bond formed by Cys-115 and Cys-124 control the conformation of an active-site loop, which makes the space suitable for substrate entry into subsite −1.

Upon ligand binding, these receptors trigger intracellular signaling cascades that are integrated to elicit changes in gene expression and cellular phenotype. In peripheral naïve T cells, for example, antigen encounter and costimulation in conjunction with exposure to specific cytokines lead to the induction of a gene transcription program that specifies differentiation into a functionally distinct subset of effector, memory, or regulatory cells. The magnitude as well as the nature of receptor-initiated signals contributes to determining the fate and functional capabilities of activated T cells.

The findings from these approaches suggested a role for T cell p38 signaling in thymocyte development, TCR-induced proliferation and apoptosis, IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-17A production, and autoimmune diseases such as collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Other studies that examined mice with T cells lacking p38α alone or both p38α and p38β, however, did not observe substantial effects on IFN-γ and IL-17A production or experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (17Huang G. Wang Y. Vogel P. Kanneganti T.D. Otsu K. Chi H. Signaling via the kinase p38α programs dendritic cells to drive TH17 differentiation and autoimmune inflammation.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The role of p38 signaling in T cells, therefore, remains debatable, its potential as a target for anti-inflammatory therapy yet to be definitely appraised. In this study, we find as-yet-unreported effects of ablating p38α and p38β in T cells: mice with T cells simultaneously deficient in the two p38 isoforms exhibit enhanced regulatory T (Treg) cell induction and attenuated allergic inflammation when challenged with epicutaneous antigen. In vitro differentiation experiments confirm the role of p38 signaling in limiting Treg cell induction, and identify how p38α and p38β cooperate to perform this role. Our findings suggest inhibition of p38 signaling as a novel means to promote Treg cell generation and treat immune-mediated diseases. We previously reported that mice with T cell-specific ablation of p38α (Mapk14fl/fl-LckCre; Δα) showed moderate lymphoid atrophy, and had decreased proportions of CD8+ subsets among lymph node and splenic T cells (16Ritprajak P. Hayakawa M. Sano Y. Otsu K. Park J.M. Cell type-specific targeting dissociates the therapeutic from the adverse effects of protein kinase inhibition in allergic skin disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9089-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Combined, these changes translated to a decline in the absolute number of CD8+ T cells available for antigen-specific immune responses such as contact hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, T cells from these mice, taken individually, remained functionally competent throughout the immune response: in hapten-exposed animals, p38α-deficient T cells were efficiently primed to become cytokine-producing effector cells, and formed a memory population that could transfer hapten sensitivity to naïve mice (16Ritprajak P. Hayakawa M. Sano Y. Otsu K. Park J.M. Cell type-specific targeting dissociates the therapeutic from the adverse effects of protein kinase inhibition in allergic skin disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9089-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This may be due either to a lack of critical cell-autonomous functions of p38α in T cells during immune responses or to functional compensation by other p38 isoforms. Such functional redundancy has been documented for p38α and p38β in various cell types including T cells (22Jirmanova L. Giardino Torchia M.L. Sarma N.D. Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Lack of the T cell-specific alternative p38 activation pathway reduces autoimmunity and inflammation.Blood. 2011; 118: 3280-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33del Barco Barrantes I.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 12764-12769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Of note, p38β expression in mice was prominent in T cells compared with other cell types (Fig. 1A), and further elevated in lymph node and splenic T cells with p38α ablation (Fig. 1B). To examine whether p38α and p38β exert redundant functions in T cells, we crossed Δα mice with p38β-null mice (Mapk11−/−; Δβ) to generate mice with T cells lacking both p38α and p38β (Mapk14fl/fl-LckCre-Mapk11−/−; Δαβ). T cells from Δαβ mice did not express detectable amounts of both p38 isoforms (Fig. 1C). The size and cellularity of the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen of Δαβ mice decreased compared with those of wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 1, D and E). The lymphoid tissues of Δα and Δβ mice tended to be atrophic too, but to lesser extents than Δαβ counterparts. Single and double deficiency of p38α and p38β in T cells did not prevent the thymic development of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or their homing to and maintenance in the lymph nodes and spleen (Fig. 1F). In keeping with our previous report (16Ritprajak P. Hayakawa M. Sano Y. Otsu K. Park J.M. Cell type-specific targeting dissociates the therapeutic from the adverse effects of protein kinase inhibition in allergic skin disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9089-9094Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the proportions of lymph node and splenic CD8+ T cells were lower in Δα mice than in WT mice, but not further reduced by the additional loss of p38β in Δαβ mice (Fig. 1F). We examined the effects of p38 deficiency on TCR-induced intracellular signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells. Compared with T cells lacking only either isoform, T cells from Δαβ mice exhibited a more complete abrogation of p38 phosphorylation after treatment with TCR agonists, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B). Loss of p38 has been shown to potentiate signaling by other MAPK family members, ERK and JNK, in a multitude of cell types (34Caballero-Franco C. Choo M.K. Sano Y. Ritprajak P. Sakurai H. Otsu K. Mizoguchi A. Park J.M. Tuning of protein kinase circuitry by p38α is vital for epithelial tissue homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 23788-23797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, Δαβ T cells showed increased phosphorylation, and thus activation, of ERK and JNK upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 2A). We observed that MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) 2, a protein kinase immediately downstream of p38, was constitutively phosphorylated in cultured T cells independently of TCR stimulation. Nevertheless, MK2 phosphorylation was abolished in Δαβ T cells, but not Δα and Δβ T cells (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that p38 was indispensable for steady-state phosphorylation of MK2. Some previous studies suggested a connection between the p38-MK2 signaling module and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR): p38 was required for stress-induced mTOR signaling in arsenite-exposed fibroblasts, hypoxic-reoxygenated cardiomyocytes, and anisomycin-treated macrophages (35Hernández G.

Anisomycin-induced mTOR activation has been attributed to the ability of MK2 to phosphorylate and inactivate the mTOR inhibitor TSC2 (37Katholnig K. Kaltenecker C.C. Hayakawa H. Rosner M. Lassnig C.

It remained unexplored, however, whether signaling events consistent with this model occurred in T cells during TCR activation. We found that the loss of MK2 activation in Δαβ T cells was accompanied by a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of TSC2 at serine-1254, which is associated with MK2-dependent inactivation (Fig. 2A). In parallel, mTOR pathway activation, as indicated by S6K and S6 phosphorylation, was greatly weakened in Δαβ T cells but persisted in Δα and Δβ T cells, albeit in lower magnitudes than in WT counterparts (Fig. 2, A and B). TCR-induced S6 phosphorylation was also diminished in CD4+ T cells lacking MK2 and the related protein kinase MK3 (Fig. 3, A–E), which served overlapping signaling functions (39Ronkina N. Kotlyarov A. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Hitti E. Milarski K. Askew R. Marusic S. Lin L.L. Gaestel M. Telliez J.B.

The MAPK-activated kinase Rsk controls an acute Toll-like receptor signaling response in dendritic cells and is activated through two distinct pathways.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, TCR-induced S6 phosphorylation remained intact in CD8+ T cells lacking MK2 and MK3 (Fig. 3, F and G). In summary, p38-dependent activation and regulation of intracellular signaling events in naïve CD4+ T cells were abolished by ablation of both p38α and p38β but not either alone. We sought to identify functional defects in T cells that resulted from loss of p38 signaling. First, we isolated total (CD3+) splenic T cells from WT and αβΔ mice and stimulated them with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The proliferation rate of TCR-stimulated CD4+ T cells was substantially reduced by p38α and p38β deficiency (Fig. 4A). These effects could indicate a cell-autonomous role for p38 signaling in TCR-induced proliferation or, alternatively, a contribution of a non-cell-autonomous mechanism that suppressed T cell activation more effectively without the p38 isoforms. Treg cells, contained in the total splenic T cell preparations, might exert the suppressive effect under the latter scenario. To exclude or minimize the possible influence of Treg cells, we performed subsequent experiments using cell preparations devoid of antigen-experienced T cells including Foxp3+ cells. To this end, the CD4+CD62L+ subset was purified from splenic T cells and subjected to TCR stimulation. Naïve T cells thus prepared from Δαβ mice proliferated at only moderately reduced rates (Fig. 4B) compared with the effects seen with total splenic T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cells from WT and Δαβ mice produced comparable amounts of IFN-γ, IL-13, and IL-17A upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 4C), and differentiated into the effector cell subsets specialized for producing these cytokines (Th1, Th2, and Th17) with similar efficiencies (Fig. 4, D and E). Therefore, p38 signaling in T cells seemed largely dispensable for TCR-driven activation and differentiation toward Th effector cells. We examined whether p38 signaling played a role in the induction of Treg cells. Upon TCR stimulation in conjunction with exposure to TGF-β, naïve CD4+ T cells from Δαβ mice differentiated into Treg cells more efficiently than WT counterparts (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistently, T cells from Δαβ mice produced greater amounts of Foxp3 mRNA and protein than WT cells during the course of Treg cell induction (Fig. 5, C and D). TCR-responsive Foxp3 mRNA induction in the absence of a Treg-skewing condition was also higher in naïve CD4+ T cells from Δαβ mice (Fig. 5C), suggesting that p38 signaling served to limit Foxp3 expression even before the Treg phenotype was established. The suppressive function of Treg cells from Δαβ mice, as determined by the ability to inhibit TCR-induced proliferation of naïve CD4+ T cells, was intact, and in fact slightly enhanced compared with that of WT Treg cells (Fig. 5E). We next investigated Treg cell formation in vivo. Notably, Δαβ mice in a steady-state condition exhibited a small but consistent increase in Treg cell frequency: CD4+ T cells from the thymus and spleen of Δαβ mice contained elevated Foxp3+ fractions (Fig. 5, F and G). To examine Treg cell induction during T cell-mediated immune responses, we subjected WT and Δαβ mice to an experimental condition that elicited contact hypersensitivity reactions. In this model of allergic dermatitis, epicutaneous exposure to a small-molecule antigen or hapten establishes T cell immunity and, upon re-encounter with the hapten, induces T cell-mediated inflammation accompanied by skin rashes and swelling. Δαβ mice displayed greatly attenuated responses to the hapten 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB; Fig. 5H) and, simultaneously, a massive expansion of the Treg cell compartment in the skin-draining lymph node (Fig. 5, I and J). Given the observations described above, p38 signaling was not essential for T cell development and steady-state maintenance. Nevertheless, p38 deficiency in T cells produced perceptible effects in Δαβ mice—altered sizes of CD8+ and CD4+Foxp3+ T cell subpopulations. It was conceivable that these effects resulted from impaired p38 signaling in cell types other than T cells, as Δαβ mice had systemic p38β deficiency. To address this possibility, we examined the lymphoid tissues of RAG1-deficient mice that were sublethally irradiated and engrafted with bone marrow from Δαβ mice. These radiation chimeras, in which deficiency of not only p38α but also p38β was restricted to lymphocytes, exhibited decreased CD8+ and increased CD4+Foxp3+ T cell subsets compared with control chimeras engrafted with WT bone marrow (Fig. 6, A and B). Hence, the changes in the frequency of T cell subsets in Δαβ mice were likely attributable to the loss of cell-autonomous p38 function. The influence of Cre recombinase-mediated toxicity, if any, was also ruled out based on the normal ranges of CD8+ and CD4+Foxp3+ T cell abundance in LckCre mice (Fig. 6, C and D). Our analysis of Δαβ mice revealed novel effects of loss of p38 signaling in CD4+ T cells: increased Foxp3 expression and enhanced induction of fully functional Treg cells. We sought to identify the molecular mechanism whereby p38 signaling modulated Tr"

Its initiation occurs rapidly after inactivation of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (or mechanistic target of rapamycin), leading to dephosphorylation of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and autophagosome formation. Recent studies indicate that mTOR can, in parallel, regulate the activity of stress transcription factors, including signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1). The current study addresses the role of STAT1 as a transcriptional suppressor of autophagy genes and autophagic activity. We show that STAT1-deficient human fibrosarcoma cells exhibited enhanced autophagic flux as well as its induction by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR. Consistent with enhanced autophagy initiation, ULK1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in STAT1-deficient cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, STAT1 bound a putative regulatory sequence in the ULK1 5′-flanking region, the mutation of which increased ULK1 promoter activity, and rendered it unresponsive to mTOR inhibition. Consistent with an anti-apoptotic effect of autophagy, rapamycin-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity were blocked in STAT1-deficient cells but restored in cells simultaneously exposed to the autophagy inhibitor ammonium chloride. In vivo, skeletal muscle ULK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as autophagic flux were significantly enhanced in STAT1-deficient mice.

In macroautophagy, the initial step involves formation of a double membrane vesicle (autophagosome) that can incorporate long-lived cytosolic proteins and organelles (e.g. mitochondria, peroxisomes). Upon fusion with the lysosome, autophagosomal contents are degraded, products are release into the cytosol, and lysosomes are regenerated (2Yu L. McPhee C.K. Zheng L. Mardones G.A. Rong Y. Peng J.

During elongation and maturation the protein microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B) is lipidated and incorporated into the autophagosomal membrane.

Initiation and termination of the autophagic cycle are tightly controlled by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also known as mechanistic target of rapamycin, MTOR), a ubiquitous protein kinase that promotes anabolic processes (e.g. protein synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis) and inhibits catabolic processes (e.g. autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis) (8Laplante M.

Under catabolic conditions that inhibit mTORC1 activity (e.g. amino acid, glucose, or mitogen withdrawal) or after pharmacological blockade (e.g. rapamycin, Torin-1), ULK1 is rapidly dephosphorylated permitting the initiation of autophagy (3Jung C.H.

Less is known regarding the regulation of genes encoding proteins in the autophagy initiation complex or mechanisms by which the autophagy transcriptional program is attenuated.

Because recent studies indicate an anti-apoptotic role for autophagy, we hypothesized that STAT1 might function as an endogenous and stress-inducible repressor of autophagy gene transcription and autophagy per se. Here, we use in vitro and in vivo models to show that genomic loss of STAT1 increases autophagic flux, ULK1 mRNA levels, and ULK1 gene promoter activity. Furthermore, although apoptosis induced by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin is attenuated in STAT1-deficient cells, it can be restored by inhibiting autophagic activity. RNAi depletion of ULK1 reduced autophagic flux observed in STAT1-deficient cells. Finally, in an in vivo model of autophagy induction during systemic inflammation, ULK1 expression and autophagy are increased in the diaphragms of STAT1-deficient mice. The results indicate an essential role for STAT1 in dampening the autophagic response in vitro and in vivo. We used three different models of STAT1 genomic loss to demonstrate a requirement for STAT1 in the suppression of autophagic flux and ULK1 expression. STAT1-deficient U3A cells were generated by random DNA mutagenesis in human fibrosarcoma (2fTGH) cells and subsequent clonal selection for absent responses to interferon (21Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Use of a selectable marker regulated by α interferon to obtain mutations in the signaling pathway.Mol. Cell.

For models of STAT1 genomic loss with isogenic controls, we used STAT1 knock-out (−/−) or wild-type (+/+) mice or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (23Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Targeted disruption of the mouse Stat1 gene results in compromised innate immunity to viral disease.Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Autophagic flux in STAT1-deficient cells was assessed by evaluating lysosomal proteolysis of long-lived proteins (long-lived protein degradation (LLPD)). LLPD in STAT1-deficient U3A cells was greater than that in control 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1A, column 5 versus column 1). To demonstrate that changes in autophagic flux in U3A cells are due to loss of STAT1 and not due to epigenetic effects of genomic STAT1 mutations, we assessed U3A cells stably reconstituted with recombinant STAT1α (U3A-R cells). LLPD in U3A-R cells was similar to that observed in wild-type 2fTGH cells. To study the induction of autophagy, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin was used. Rapamycin-induced LLPD was also enhanced in U3A cells, suggesting that loss of STAT1 might sensitize cells to the autophagic protein degradation observed upon inactivation of mTORC1 (column 6 versus column 5). There was no independent effect of rapamycin on STAT1 protein levels. STAT1 levels in U3A-R cells were similar to those in 2fTGH cells, and STAT1 was not detected in U3A cells (Fig. 1A, inset). To derive the component of LLPD due to lysosomal degradation, cells were incubated with the lysosomal acidification inhibitor NH4Cl. In each case (Fig. 1A, column 4 versus 2, 8 versus 6, 12 versus 10), NH4Cl abolished rapamycin-induced LLPD, indicating that the effect of rapamycin was likely on the autophagy-lysosomal pathway per se and not on other proteolytic systems. The NH4Cl-sensitive rate of proteolysis was calculated by subtracting LLPD in the presence of NH4Cl from that in its absence and was significantly greater in STAT1-deficient U3A cells exposed to rapamycin (Fig. 1B, column 4 versus 3). The effect of rapamycin on NH4Cl-sensitive LLPD (autophagy) was summarized by subtracting NH4Cl-sensitive LLPD in cells exposed to rapamycin to that in cells exposed to vehicle (Fig. 1C, column 2 versus 1). These results indicate that the loss of STAT1 enhances basal and rapamycin-induced autophagy. Autophagic flux was also assessed by lipidation of LC3B in the absence or presence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Bafilomycin increased lipidated LC3B (LC3B-II) levels under all conditions, indicating ongoing autophagic flux (Fig. 1D). In the presence of bafilomycin, mean LC3B-II levels were higher in U3A cells than those in 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1E). The mean bafilomycin-induced increase in LC3B-II levels (ΔLC3B-II, flux) was higher in STAT1-deficient U3A cells than that observed in 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1E); this was true for vehicle- or rapamycin-treated cells. The mean flux, as measured by the mean increase in LC3B-II due to bafilomycin, was also higher in U3A cells than in 2fTGH cells; similarly, rapamycin-induced flux was higher in U3A cells than in 2fTGH cells (Fig. 1F). We used an additional kinase inhibitor, Torin-1, to confirm a role for STAT1 in the regulation of autophagic activity by mTORC1. Incubation of 2fTGH cells with 10 nm Torin-1 led to a significant increase in autophagic flux (Fig. 1G, lanes 3 and 4 versus 1 and 2; Fig. 1H, column 2 versus 1). Basal and Torin1-induced autophagic flux were increased in U3A cells (Fig. 1G, lanes 5–8, Fig. 1H columns 3 versus 1 and 4 versus 2). Moreover, the augmenting effects of STAT1 deficiency were reversed in STAT1-reconstituted cells (Fig. 1G, lanes 9–12; Fig. 1H, columns 5 and 6). Consistent with a low dose of Torin-1, the phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target p70 S6K, but not the mTORC2 target Akt, was blocked (Fig. 1G). There were no changes observed in total p70 S6 kinase, S6, or AKT levels across conditions (data not shown). STAT1 protein was absent in U3A cells. The magnitude of Torin1-induced autophagy was similar to that caused by Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS; supplemental Fig. 1A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of STAT1 enhances LC3B lipidation and autophagic flux and that the effect can be reversed by re-expression of STAT1. We next reasoned that STAT1 might suppress genes that encode proteins in the autophagy initiation complex (i.e. ULK1, ATG13, FIP-200). By quantitative PCR, basal ULK1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in STAT1-deficient U3A when compared with control 2fTGH cells (Fig. 2A). The absence of STAT1 did not alter ATG13 or FIP200 mRNA levels. Loss of STAT1 also enhanced the induction of ULK1 by rapamycin (Fig. 2B). In contrast to ULK1, there was no effect of STAT1 deficiency on FIP200 mRNA levels (Fig. 2B); ATG13 mRNA levels were slightly increased by rapamycin in U3A cells. Unlike genes encoding components of the initiation complex, the expression of mRNAs for Beclin-1 or ATG12 was not altered by STAT1 deficiency or rapamycin (data not shown). There was a significant increase in ULK1 mRNA at 4 and 6 h observed in 2fTGH cells after exposure to rapamycin, and this was enhanced in STAT1-deficient U3A cells (Fig. 2C). Like mRNA levels, baseline and rapamycin-induced ULK1 protein levels were greater in STAT1-deficient U3A (Fig. 2D) cells. The rise in ULK1 levels after incubation with rapamycin for 18 h was sustained in U3A but not 2fTGH cells (Fig. 2D). The degradation of ULK1 in U3A cells incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (t½ 8.1 ± 0.8 h) was slightly higher than that observed in 2fTGH cells (t½ 10.8 ± 1.5 h, Fig. 2E). As was the case for autophagic flux (Fig. 1, G and H), incubation with 10 nm Torin1 also increased ULK1 protein levels in 2fTGH cells (Fig. 2F, lane 2 versus 1). Phosphorylation of the mTORC2 target Akt or its substrate FOXO3A, a known inducer of autophagy gene transcription, was unaffected in control or STAT1-deficient cells (Fig. 2F). Consistent with inhibition of mTORC1 by Torin-1, phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 was reduced. ULK1 protein levels were increased in STAT1-deficient U3A cells, and this was reversed by expression of STAT1 (U3A-R). RNAi depletion of ULK1 reduced autophagic flux in 2fTGH (40% decrease) and U3A (60% decrease) cells (Fig. 2G; supplemental Fig. 1B). Therefore, loss of STAT1 leads to increased ULK1 mRNA and protein expression as well as their induction by mTORC1 inhibitors. AKT and FOXO3A likely do not play a significant role in the changes in autophagic flux observed in STAT1-deficient cells, whereas ULK1 is required. We next determined whether mutation of a potential STAT1 response element augments activity of an ULK1 promoter fragment cloned into a luciferase reporter construct. We identified a putative DNA-binding site for STAT1 (−124 → −117) and created T→G mutations at the indicated residues (Fig. 3A). Vectors were expressed in STAT1-deficient U3A or control 2fTGH cells. Basal ULK1 promoter activity was significantly increased in U3A cells compared with that in 2fTGH cells (Fig. 3B, columns 5 versus 1). Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin enhanced ULK1 promoter activity in control 2fTGH cells (Fig. 3B, columns 2 versus 1) but less so in U3A cells (Fig. 3B, column 6 versus 5). Mutation of the putative STAT1 binding sequence (ΔSTAT1) significantly increased ULK1 promoter activity in control 2fTGH cells (Fig. 3B, columns 3 versus 1). As expected, mutation of the STAT1 binding sequence had no effect on promoter activity in STAT1-deficient U3A cells (Fig. 3B, columns 7 versus 5). Blockade of mTORC1 with rapamycin did not further increase ULK1 promoter activity when the STAT1 binding sequence was mutated (Fig. 3B, columns 4 versus 3). We next assessed whether STAT1 could bind the putative STAT1 response element (−124 → −117) in the endogenous ULK1 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation. In 2fTGH cells, STAT1 binding was enriched by 30% (Fig. 3C). Binding was increased upon incubation of cells with the mTOR inhibitors 10 nm Torin-1 (84% enrichment) or 50 nm rapamycin (62% enrichment) for 2 h (Fig. 3C). There was no binding of STAT1 observed when control primers were used to detect a region of genomic DNA that does not bind transcription factors (data not shown). Thus, a STAT1 response element in the ULK1 promoter binds STAT1 and attenuates the induction of ULK1 promoter activity. Because STAT1 is an inhibitor of autophagy and ULK1 gene expression, we reasoned that the suppression of apoptosis in STAT1-deficient cells might require autophagic activity. Caspase-3 (CASP3) cleavage products were measured as a marker of apoptosis. As previously shown (20Fielhaber J.A. Tan J. Joung K.B. Attias O. Huegel S. Bader M. Roux P.P. Kristof A.S. Regulation of Karyopherin-α1 and nuclear import by mTOR.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14325-14335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), cleaved CASP3 levels were reduced in STAT1-deficient U3A cells compared with those in 2fTGH controls (Fig. 4A, columns 5 versus 1); rapamycin significantly increased cleaved CASP3 levels in 2fTGH but not in U3A cells (Fig. 4A, columns 1 and 2 versus columns 5 and 6). In U3A cells, the autophagy inhibitor NH4Cl restored basal or rapamycin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A, column 7 versus 5 or column 8 versus 6). Administration of NH4Cl in 2fTGH cells (i.e. elevated STAT1) levels had no effect on cleaved CASP3 levels (Fig. 4A, columns 3 and 4 versus columns 2 and 1). To determine whether restoration of apoptosis in U3A cells correlates with reduced viability, we assessed crystal violet staining in cells exposed to rapamycin, NH4Cl, or both for 24 h. Consistent with reduced apoptosis and increased autophagy, cell viability was significantly greater in U3A cells lacking STAT1 when compared with control 2fTGH cells (Fig. 4B, columns 5 versus 1). Rapamycin led to a significant decrease in cell viability in 2fTGH cells (columns 2 versus 1 or 3 versus 4); the magnitude of this reduction was attenuated in STAT1-deficient U3A cells (Fig. 4B, columns 6 versus 5). Consistent with restoration of apoptosis (Fig. 4A), blockade of autophagy with NH4Cl reduced cell viability in STAT1-deficient U3A cells but not in control 2fTGH cells (Fig. 4B, columns 5 and 7 versus columns 1 and 3). As was the case for apoptosis (Fig. 4A), the restoration of cytotoxicity was more prominent in cells incubated with rapamycin (Fig. 4B, columns 6 and 8 versus columns 2 and 4). These data indicate that the reduced apoptosis and cell death observed in STAT1-deficient cells correlates with increased levels of ULK1 and autophagic activity. Furthermore, apoptosis and cell death can be restored in STAT1-deficient cells by blocking autophagy. To demonstrate a role for STAT1 in vivo, we used a model of septic inflammation that elicits autophagy and organ dysfunction in mice (24Mofarrahi M. Guo Y. Haspel J.A. Choi A.M. Davis E.C.

Davis E.C. Petrof B. Sandri M. Burelle Y. Hussain S.N. Autophagy and skeletal muscles in sepsis.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47265Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). STAT1−/− mice were exposed to vehicle or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h. As previously shown (25Mofarrahi M. Sigala I. Guo Y. Godin R. Davis E.C. Petrof B. Sandri M. Burelle Y. Hussain S.N. Autophagy and skeletal muscles in sepsis.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e47265Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), LPS administration in mice triggered a significant increase in diaphragm autophagy (i.e. increased ratio of LC3B-II to LC3B-I) (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 versus 1 and right panels) of Stat1+/+ mice. Like in cultured cells, loss of Stat1 was associated with increased basal autophagy as indicated by the rise in LC3B protein lipidation (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 versus 1). Injection of LPS did not further increase LC3B protein lipidation in STAT1−/− mice, perhaps due to already elevated basal autophagy in the muscles of these mice. Autophagic flux was increased in the diaphragms of STAT1-deficient mice (Fig. 5B). As was the case for STAT1-deficient cell lines (Fig. 2), Ulk1, but not Beclin-1 or Atg12 (data not shown) mRNA levels, were higher in the diaphragms of STAT1−/− mice than in those from Stat1+/+ mice (Fig. 5C). Similarly, ULK1 protein levels were increased in the diaphragms of STAT1−/− mice (Fig. 5D). Consistent with induction of autophagy, LPS reduced the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser-757 in wild-type and knock-out mice (Fig. 5D). As was the case for U3A cells, basal and rapamycin-induced ULK1 protein levels and autophagy were also increased in STAT1−/− MEFs (Fig. 5F); Stat1 mRNA and STAT1 protein were absent in STAT1−/− MEFs (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). Changes in autophagy attributed to loss of Stat1 or incubation with rapamycin were reduced in MEFs, perhaps due to high levels of autophagy at baseline; moreover, others have demonstrated weak induction of autophagy by rapamycin in MEFs (26Thoreen C.C. Kang S.A. Chang J.W. Liu Q. Zhang J. Gao Y. Reichling L.J. Sim T. Sabatini D.M. Gray N.S. An ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor reveals rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8023-8032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). These results indicate that STAT1 is an endogenous suppressor of Ulk1 mRNA and protein expression as well as autophagy in vivo. The current study reveals a previously undescribed mechanism by which STAT1 dampens the expression of ULK1 and autophagic flux in cultured cells and in vivo. We used cell and animal models of genomic loss of STAT1 to avoid potential off-target effects of molecular (e.g. RNAi, overexpression systems) or pharmacological inhibitors. STAT1-deficient cells and mice exhibited increased autophagy and ULK1 expression (Figs. 1, 2, and 5). The enhanced autophagy and ULK1 expression observed in STAT1-deficient U3A cells were not due to genetic or epigenetic modifications independent of STAT1, as they were reversed by expression of recombinant STAT1α (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Similar effects of STAT1 loss on ULK1 and autophagy were also observed in MEFs with targeted genomic knock-out of STAT1. Moreover, enhanced autophagy was required for the inhibition of apoptosis observed in STAT1-deficient cells (Fig. 4), and STAT1 was an endogenous suppressor of Ulk1 expression and skeletal muscle autophagy in mice (Fig. 5). Although the transcriptional control of autophagosome nucleation genes (e.g. BECN1, BNIP3, LC3B) has been evaluated (12Pietrocola F. Izzo V. Niso-Santano M. Vacchelli E. Galluzzi L. Maiuri M.C.

The C1P binding site in ACD11 and in human ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) is surrounded by cationic residues. Here, we investigated the functional regulation of ACD11 and CPTP by anionic phosphoglycerides and found that 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidic acid or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (≤15 mol %) in C1P source vesicles depressed C1P intermembrane transfer. By contrast, replacement with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine stimulated C1P transfer by ACD11 and CPTP. Notably, “soluble” phosphatidylserine (dihexanoyl-phosphatidylserine) failed to stimulate C1P transfer. Also, none of the anionic phosphoglycerides affected transfer action by human glycolipid lipid transfer protein (GLTP), which is glycolipid-specific and has few cationic residues near its glycolipid binding site. These findings provide the first evidence for a potential phosphoglyceride headgroup-specific regulatory interaction site(s) existing on the surface of any GLTP-fold and delineate new differences between GLTP superfamily members that are specific for C1P versus glycolipid.

Here, we investigated the functional regulation of ACD11 and CPTP by anionic phosphoglycerides and found that 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidic acid or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (≤15 mol %) in C1P source vesicles depressed C1P intermembrane transfer. By contrast, replacement with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine stimulated C1P transfer by ACD11 and CPTP. Notably, “soluble” phosphatidylserine (dihexanoyl-phosphatidylserine) failed to stimulate C1P transfer. Also, none of the anionic phosphoglycerides affected transfer action by human glycolipid lipid transfer protein (GLTP), which is glycolipid-specific and has few cationic residues near its glycolipid binding site. These findings provide the first evidence for a potential phosphoglyceride headgroup-specific regulatory interaction site(s) existing on the surface of any GLTP-fold and delineate new differences between GLTP superfamily members that are specific for C1P versus glycolipid."

Particular attention has focused on the binding of plasminogen (Plg) to bacterial surfaces, as it has been shown that this interaction contributes to bacterial adhesion to host cells, invasion of host tissues, and evasion of the immune system. Several bacterial proteins are known to serve as receptors for Plg including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cytoplasmic enzyme that appears on the cell surface in this moonlighting role. Although Plg typically binds to these receptors via several lysine-binding domains, the specific interactions that occur have not been documented in all cases. However, identification of the relevant residues could help define strategies for mitigating the virulence of important human pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp). To shed light on this question, we have described a combination of peptide-spot array screening, competition and SPR assays, high-resolution crystallography, and mutational analyses to characterize the interaction between SpGAPDH and Plg. We identified three SpGAPDH lysine residues that were instrumental in defining the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction. Altogether, the integration of the data presented in this work allows us to propose a structural model for the molecular interaction of the SpGAPDH-Plg complex.

Functional studies have provided insights into the binding of ERCC1-XPF to various DNA substrates. However, because no structure for the ERCC1-XPF-DNA complex has been determined, the mechanism of substrate recognition remains elusive. Here we biochemically characterize the substrate preferences of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains of XPF and ERCC-XPF and show that the binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)/dsDNA junctions is dependent on joint binding to the DNA binding domain of ERCC1 and XPF. We reveal that the homodimeric XPF is able to bind various ssDNA sequences but with a clear preference for guanine-containing substrates. NMR titration experiments and in vitro DNA binding assays also show that, within the heterodimeric ERCC1-XPF complex, XPF specifically recognizes ssDNA. On the other hand, the HhH domain of ERCC1 preferentially binds dsDNA through the hairpin region. The two separate non-overlapping DNA binding domains in the ERCC1-XPF heterodimer jointly bind to an ssDNA/dsDNA substrate and, thereby, at least partially dictate the incision position during damage removal. Based on structural models, NMR titrations, DNA-binding studies, site-directed mutagenesis, charge distribution, and sequence conservation, we propose that the HhH domain of ERCC1 binds to dsDNA upstream of the damage, and XPF binds to the non-damaged strand within a repair bubble.

Overexpression of Fgf16 in vivo recapitulated several of our in vitro findings, specifically the significant induction of the Ucp1 gene and UCP1 protein expression in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), a common site for emergent active iBAT. Despite significant UCP1 up-regulation in iWAT and dramatic weight loss, the metabolic improvements observed due to Fgf16 overexpression in vivo were not the result of increased energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetric assessment. Instead, a pattern of reduced food and water intake, combined with feces replete with lipid and bile acid, indicated a phenotype more akin to that of starvation and intestinal malabsorption. Gene expression analysis of the liver and ileum indicated alterations in several steps of bile acid metabolism, including hepatic synthesis and reabsorption. Histological analysis of intestinal tissue revealed profound abnormalities in support of this conclusion.

Two main forms of c-FLIP have been well characterized: c-FLIP short form (c-FLIPS) and long form (c-FLIPL). c-FLIPL is homologous to caspase-8, consisting of two DEDs and a catalytically inactive caspase-like domain (1Irmler M.

C-FLIPL plays an essential role in T-cell proliferation implicated in NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways. However, in c-FLIP-deficient T lymphocytes, activation of NF-κB and ERK appears largely intact (14Chau H. Wong V. Chen N.J. Huang H.L. Lin W.J. Mirtsos C. Elford A.R. Bonnard M. Wakeham A.

Considering c-FLIPL was previously reported in the modulation of Wnt signaling, we speculated on a new role for nuclear c-FLIPL in the transcriptional regulation via interaction with TIP49. In this study, we found that c-FLIPL associated with TIP49 depending on the DEDs domain of c-FLIPL. They also had nuclear localization and were involved in the β-catenin transcriptional complex. The effect of c-FLIPL on β-catenin-mediated activation was inhibited by TIP49 knockdown, as well as the c-FLIPL-driven cell growth. Our results suggested a novel role for nuclear c-FLIPL associated with TIP49 in modulation of the Wnt pathway. To identify new proteins that interact with c-FLIPL, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the full-length cDNA of c-FLIPL as a bait versus a mouse 7.5-day embryo cDNA library. Approximately 2 × 108 transformants were screened to identify 12 cDNA clones, and one is nuclear protein TIP49 and belongs to the AAA+ (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) of ATPases (31Jha S. Dutta A. RVB1/RVB2: running rings around molecular biology.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To verify the result from a yeast two-hybrid screen, we performed a GST pulldown assay to examine the protein-protein interaction between c-FLIPL and TIP49. Two recombinant proteins GST-FLIPL and His6-TIP49 were expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1A). Purified GST-FLIPL fusion protein was able to pull down His6-TIP49 protein in vitro (Fig. 1B). We next validated this interaction in mammalian cells. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assays showed that in 293T cells cotransfected with FLAG-TIP49 and HA-FLIPL, anti-FLAG antibody was able to co-precipitate HA-FLIPL, which was immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C). Then in A549 cells stably expressing c-FLIPL (FLIPL-A549), anti-FLIP antibodies were able to co-precipitate endogenous TIP49 (Fig. 1D). This endogenous interaction was reconfirmed in H1299 cells (supplemental Fig. S1), consistent with the above observation. To map the domain of c-FLIPL required for interaction with TIP49, we generated a series of deletion mutants (Fig. 1E). P20 and ▵DED mutants lacking DED domains were not able to interact with TIP49, indicating that the DED domain of c-FLIPL was required for the association with TIP49 (Fig. 1F). c-FLIPL is known as an apoptotic inhibitory protein in the cytoplasm, whereas c-FLIPL also had the nuclear localization (11Katayama R.

TIP49 was identified in large nuclear complexes, such as chromatin-remodeling complexes and transcription-activating complexes (32Gallant P. Control of transcription by pontin and reptin.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 187-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The nuclear co-localization of c-FLIPL and TIP49 is a possibility for their association. By double immunofluorescence staining in FLIPL-A549 cells, c-FLIPL was observed scattered both in the cytosolic and nuclear space and TIP49 localized mainly in the nuclear space (Fig. 2A). To confirm the nuclear distribution of these two proteins, we fractionated cells into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. c-FLIPL and TIP49 were both detected in the nuclear fractions, where they accumulated as relatively large aggregates, implicating a possibility for them to form a complex in the nucleus. β-Tubulin and lamin B were used as loading controls to differentiate the cytosolic and nuclear proteins (Fig. 2B). To validate the interaction between c-FLIPL and TIP49 in the nucleus, we cotransfected HA-FLIPL and FLAG-TIP49 into 293T cells, and the nuclear fractions were extracted to perform the co-immunoprecipitation. The FLIPL-TIP49 interaction that occurred in the nucleus is shown in Fig. 2C. c-FLIPL was reported to enhance Wnt signaling by inhibiting ubiquitylation of β-catenin (33Naito M. Katayama R. Ishioka T. Suga A. Takubo K. Nanjo M. Hashimoto C. Taira M. Takada S. Takada R. Kitagawa M. Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Tsuruo T.

Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Modulation of Wnt signaling by the nuclear localization of cellular FLIP-L.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine the role of nuclear c-FLIPL on Wnt signaling, we obtained two mutants of c-FLIPL that failed to enter into the nucleus (11Katayama R. Ishioka T. Takada S. Takada R. Fujita N. Tsuruo T.

One is a truncated variant, ▵NLS-FLIPL, lacking the NLS (435RKR) in the C-terminal, another is NES-FLIPL with a nuclear export signal sequence inserted into the N-terminal reported as cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3A). Using the model TCF reporter construct pTOPFLASH, we examined the effect of c-FLIPL and its mutants on the potential of β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. Increasing luciferase activities were observed only in wt c-FLIPL-expressing cells (Fig. 3B), whereas the reporter harboring the mutated LEF/TCF-consensus sites (FOPFLASH) as a negative control was not activated. No significant augment of luciferase activity was observed in the NES-FLIPL or ▵NLS-FLIPL expressing cells (Fig. 3B). To exclude the possibility of changes on β-catenin expression due to overexpression of c-FLIPL, the protein level of β-catenin in the cytosolic or nuclear fractions was detected and no obvious change was found (Fig. 3C). It suggested that nuclear c-FLIPL was a major contributor to the Wnt activation. To investigate the role of c-FLIPL/TIP49 interaction in β-catenin transactivation, we decreased endogenous TIP49 availably with TIP49 siRNA (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of TIP49 did not affect the expression level of c-FLIPL. Using the pTOPFLASH reporter, the luciferase activities induced by c-FLIPL overexpression were greatly suppressed by TIP49 knockdown, and very little changes in cells expressing mock DNA or ΔDED mutant (Fig. 4B). Because the ΔDED mutant cannot interact with TIP49, it had no effect on TOPFLASH reporter activation. Similar results were also obtained from knocking down TIP49 with the Crispr/Cas9 method in H1299 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Further study was performed with TIP49D302N, which is a single missense mutation in the Walker Box of TIP49 with no ATPase activities. A previous study by Fearon and co-workers (30Feng Y. Lee N. Fearon E.R. TIP49 regulates β-catenin-mediated neoplastic transformation and T-cell factor target gene induction via effects on chromatin remodeling.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8726-8734PubMed Google Scholar) showed that analogous mutation TIP49D302N was able to interfere with the effect of β-catenin on TCF-dependent reporter gene activity. We reconfirmed the effect of TIP49D302N on the TOPFLASH reporter (Fig. 4C), and found that the TOPFLASH activities induced by c-FLIPL overexpression were inhibited by TIP49D302N expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). In addition, we found no interaction between c-FLIPL and TIP49D302N (supplemental Fig. S1B), so we think of TIP49D302N mainly as a TIP49 inhibitor involved in transcriptional regulation. To study the role of physiologically expressed c-FLIPL in Wnt signal regulation, we experimentally reduced endogenous c-FLIPL in A549 cells that were responsive to Wnt stimuli with LiCl. Wnt signaling was moderately suppressed by c-FLIP siRNA (35Galligan L. Longley D.B. McEwan M. Wilson T.R. McLaughlin K. Johnston P.G. Chemotherapy and TRAIL-mediated colon cancer cell death: the roles of p53, TRAIL receptors, and c-FLIP.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 2026-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but greatly inhibited where the TIP49 protein level was down-regulated by its siRNA (Fig. 4E). These results indicated that TIP49 with its ATPase activity was required for the β-catenin·TCF transactivation mediated by c-FLIPL. To investigate a possible mechanism of nuclear c-FLIPL to modulate β-catenin·TCF transcription, we carried out ChIP assays on the ITF-2 promoter region. ITF-2 is a β-catenin·TCF-regulated gene that promotes neoplastic transformation, and its output regulated by TIP49 reported previously (30Feng Y. Lee N. Fearon E.R. TIP49 regulates β-catenin-mediated neoplastic transformation and T-cell factor target gene induction via effects on chromatin remodeling.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8726-8734PubMed Google Scholar). Its sequence containing a TCF site in the human ITF-2 promoter region was shown in Fig. 5A. Chromatin collected with 293T cells was subjected to IP with control IgG as negative control or anti-catenin as positive control. The PCR product of the TCF site was observed in the immunoprecipitates with anti-catenin antibody (Fig. 5B). In ChIPs using anti-FLAG antibody to precipitate the complex, PCR products showed that FLAG-TIP49 was weakly binding in the transcriptional complex to TCF site, and this binding was increased by overexpression of HA-FLIPL (Fig. 5B), which was quantitatively assayed by qPCR (Fig. 5C). The result suggested that HA-FLIPL overexpression promoted the accumulation of TIP49 to the TCF binding site. Next ITF-2 mRNA was assessed by a qPCR assay (Fig. 5D), a moderate increase in ITF-2 transcripts was observed in co-transfected cells, which was consistent with ChIP. To verify that c-FLIPL was also involved in the β-catenin transcriptional complex, ChIP assays were performed with anti-HA antibody to precipitate the HA-FLIPL complex. The result showed that c-FLIPL could bind to this site, and the binding was attenuated by TIP49 knockdown with TIP49 siRNA (Fig. 5E), and the corresponding analysis of qPCR as shown in Fig. 5F, indicating that TIP49 might be required for HA-FLIPL to bind the transcriptional complex on the TCF site. To test whether c-FLIPL and TIP49 regulate the expression of ITF-2, ITF-2 mRNA was detected when knocking down c-FLIPL or TIP49, respectively (Fig. 5G and supplemental Fig. S2E), even the ITF-2 protein level (Fig. 5H and supplemental Fig. S2F). The reduced ITF-2 expression was observed faintly in cells with c-FLIP knockdown and obviously in cells with TIP49 knockdown. These observations confirmed that nuclear c-FLIPL associated with TIP49 to take part in the β-catenin·TCF transactivation. The effect of c-FLIPL on cell growth was examined by colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 6A). Stable expression of c-FLIPL in A549 cells greatly enhanced the size and number of colonies. Colonies with a diameter of >250 μm were nearly not observed in mock A549 cells. In the in vivo study, the model of human lung cancer A549 transplanted in nude mice was used to evaluate the oncogenic role of c-FLIPL. Comparing two groups of tumor growth curves, tumor growth was accelerated in the FLIPL-A549 group (Fig. 6B). Using a novel real-time method of RTCA (real-time cell-based assays) to monitor cell growth, there was a faster growth rate observed in FLIPL-A549 stable cells, but this growth was slowed down when treated with TIP49 siRNA (Fig. 6C). To better display the effect of TIP49, the slope of growth within the 8 to 36 h range was shown in Fig. 6D. Cell growth induced by c-FLIPL was clearly suppressed by TIP49 knockdown. Similarly, the time for doubling in FLIPL-A549 cells was shorter than con-A549 cells, and TIP49 reduction also abolished the difference (Fig. 6E). These results were also reconfirmed in H1299 cells (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). To testify the cell growth closely correlated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling, 20 μm FH535 (a small molecule inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin) was used to treat cells. The result showed that cell growth was significantly retarded and the growth mediated by c-FLIPL was completely abolished (Fig. 6F). These data suggested a role of c-FLIPL on cell growth or tumorigenesis related to TIP49. Because aberrant activation of β-catenin plays a major role in human cancer and c-FLIPL-TIP49 association were implicated in regulating the functions of β-catenin, the oncogenic role of their expressions in cancers was further investigated. Oncomine datasets showed that both c-FLIPs/L and TIP49 had higher expression in multiple lung cancers compared with normal lung (Fig. 7, A and B). To confirm c-FLIPs/L and TIP49 expression in lung cancer, six cases of lung cancer specimens were performed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Higher c-FLIPs/L expression was observed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent histologically normal tissues, and elevated expression of TIP49 in the same way (Fig. 7C), suggesting their correlation with tumor progression in lung cancer. TIP49 was recently reported with high expression in lung cancer and correlated with poor prognosis (37Rhodes D.R. Kalyana-Sundaram S. Mahavisno V. Varambally R. Yu J. Briggs B.B. Barrette T.R.

The myxovirus resistance (MX) genes are evolutionarily conserved in nearly all vertebrates. MX gene expression is induced by type I or III interferon, and the corresponding gene products can inhibit a wide range of viruses (1Haller O. Kochs G. Human MxA protein: an interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPase with broad antiviral activity.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011; 31: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Human MxA, for example, can suppress the replication of influenza and Thogoto viruses (both Orthomyxoviridae), vesicular stomatitis virus (a rhabdovirus), and hepatitis B virus (a hepadnavirus), and mouse MX1 inhibits influenza and Thogoto virus replication (2Verhelst J.

These three domains each have specific functions in antiviral activity. The GTPase domain is the most conserved part in the family of large GTPases, and the capacity of MX to bind with GTP determines its antiviral activity (6Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A.

The stalk domain is important for oligomerization and target recognition. It contains three interfaces and a loop region (loop L4), which mediate oligomerization through a crisscross interaction pattern. This ultimately results in the formation of oligomeric rings with the stalk domains pointing inward and the GTPase domains located at the periphery of the ring. Loop L4, present at the tip of this stalk, and directed toward the center of the MxA oligomeric ring, is important for viral target recognition (8Mitchell P.S. Patzina C. Emerman M. Haller O.

A yet unproven model proposes that MX proteins, organized in rings, wrap around their viral targets (e.g. the vRNPs) and cooperatively inhibit or disturb the function of those viral targets. However, this model has recently been challenged by the results of Nigg and Pavlovic (11Nigg P.E. Pavlovic J.

Substantial progress has been made in the last few years in our understanding of the molecular details of the antiviral mechanism of MX proteins. However, it remains unclear how MX proteins interact with influenza A vRNPs and what the molecular consequences are of such an interaction. There is clear evidence that human influenza A viruses are more resistant to human MxA than avian influenza viruses are (12Dittmann J. Stertz S. Grimm D. Steel J. García-Sastre A. Haller O. Kochs G. Influenza A virus strains differ in sensitivity to the antiviral action of Mx-GTPase.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3624-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This difference in sensitivity is associated with amino acid differences in the nucleoprotein (NP) of human and avian influenza A viruses (13Mänz B. Schwemmle M. Brunotte L.

The viral nucleoprotein determines Mx sensitivity of influenza A viruses.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8133-8140Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This suggests that NP is a direct or indirect target of mammalian MX1 proteins. In line with this, we and others previously showed that mouse MX1 can interact with NP. There is also evidence that influenza A PB2 is a target of and binds with mouse MX1 (14Verhelst J. Parthoens E. Schepens B. Fiers W. Saelens X.

Pavlovic J. Function of the mouse Mx1 protein is inhibited by overexpression of the PB2 protein of influenza virus.Virology. 1993; 197: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PB2 and NP are part of the vRNPs, which are the minimal units required for influenza RNA transcription and replication. The vRNPs consist of the viral RNA genome, multiple NP molecules, and one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex containing PB1, PB2, and polymerase acidic protein (PA) (18Engelhardt O.G. Fodor E. Functional association between viral and cellular transcription during influenza virus infection.Rev. Med. Virol. 2006; 16: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We showed that the interaction between NP and PB2 is strongly reduced in the presence of MX1 (10Verhelst J. De Vlieger D. Saelens X. Co-immunoprecipitation of the mouse Mx1 protein with the influenza A virus nucleoprotein.J. Vis. Exp. 2015; 98: e52871Google Scholar, 14Verhelst J. Parthoens E. Schepens B. Fiers W. Saelens X.

Functional comparison of Mx1 from two different mouse species reveals the involvement of loop L4 in the antiviral activity against influenza A viruses.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 10879-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An appealing model is therefore that mouse MX1 prevents or disrupts the PB2-NP interaction and thereby inhibits viral polymerase activity. To elucidate whether mouse MX1 can disrupt pre-existing PB2-NP interactions or rather prevent de novo assembly of these interactions, we developed a dormant MX1 variant that could be activated post-translationally. We showed that the active form of this conditional MX1 variant behaves as the wild type protein based on its antiviral activity, nuclear localization, and interaction with NP. Finally, we used this activatable MX1 variant to show that MX1 can actively disrupt pre-existing PB2-NP interactions. We previously reported that mouse MX1 can prevent the interaction between the influenza A virus vRNP components PB2 and NP, which could explain how this protein suppresses influenza A virus replication (14Verhelst J. Parthoens E. Schepens B. Fiers W. Saelens X. Interferon-inducible protein Mx1 inhibits influenza virus by interfering with functional viral ribonucleoprotein complex assembly.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 13445-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether MX1 prevents vRNP assembly or (also) inactivates pre-existing vRNPs. To address this question, we first have to overcome the problem that mammalian cells that express mouse MX1 are highly resistant to influenza A virus infection. This means that de novo synthesis and assembly of vRNPs are strongly reduced in these cells. We therefore aimed to design a dormant MX1 variant that could be rapidly activated by a small compound stimulus. We took advantage of the FRB*-FKBP-based inducible heterodimerization system to accomplish this (20Bayle J.H. Grimley J.S. Stankunas K. Gestwicki J.E. Wandless T.J. Crabtree G.R. Rapamycin analogs with differential binding specificity permit orthogonal control of protein activity.Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Stankunas K. Bayle J.H. Havranek J.J. Wandless T.J. Baker D. Crabtree G.R. Gestwicki J.E. Rescue of degradation-prone mutants of the FK506-rapamycin binding (FRB) protein with chemical ligands.Chembiochem. 2007; 8: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this system, chimeric constructs are generated whereby one of the proteins of interest is fused to FRB* (i.e. FRB with a T2098L mutation) and a second protein is fused to FKBP. In the presence of a suitable rapamycin analog (rapalog), the FRB* and FKBP domains can rapidly and selectively heterodimerize. Mouse MX1 normally resides in the nucleus, a location that is required for it to suppress influenza A virus replication (22Edwards S.R. Wandless T.J. The rapamycin-binding domain of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin is a destabilizing domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13395-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of mouse MX1 resides in the C-terminal α helix of the bundle signaling element, which is localized close to the N terminus in the three-dimensional structure of MX1 (7Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Structural basis of oligomerization in the stalk region of dynamin-like MxA.Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Our initial plan was to make a cytoplasmic version of MX1 by mutating its NLS, which would abolish its capacity to inhibit influenza A virus replication. This MX1 variant with a non-functional NLS would be genetically fused with an FRB* domain. By co-expressing an NLS-containing FKBP protein, it then becomes possible to conditionally (depending on the presence of rapalog) provide the MX1 variant with an NLS in trans and thereby promote nuclear entry and the capacity to again exert anti-influenza virus activity. For this intended conditional NLS transcomplementation, we generated a construct in which FLAG-tagged FKBP was fused to a heterologous nuclear localization signal, derived from the SV40 large T antigen (Fig. 1A). As a control for our strategy, we generated FRB*-MX1 and MX1-FRB*, i.e. constructs in which MX1 carried its wild type NLS. These two constructs were expected to suppress influenza A virus RNA polymerase activity provided that the fused FRB* domain would not hinder this function. We first evaluated whether FRB*-MX1 and MX1-FRB* had anti-influenza virus activity using a minireplicon system that is based on A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus vRNP components. HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA, and NP as well as a firefly luciferase viral RNA-like reporter together with a wild type MX1, the inactive MX1T69A mutant, FRB*-MX1, MX1-FRB*, FRB*-MX1T69A, or MX1T69A-FRB*. In half of the settings, the F-NLS-FKBP expression plasmid was co-transfected as well. After transfection, cells were treated with rapalog or with vehicle. As expected, wild type MX1 strongly reduced the influenza A polymerase complex activity (Fig. 1B). However, in the absence of F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog, FRB*-MX1 and MX1-FRB* were inactive, suggesting that the N- and C-terminally fused FRB* domains interfered with the antiviral activity of MX1. Remarkably, in the presence of F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog, FRB*-MX1 regained antiviral activity in the PR8 minireplicon system to a degree comparable with that of wild type MX1 (Fig. 1B). This suggests that fusion of FRB* to the N terminus of MX1 interferes with the antiviral activity of mouse MX1 by a mechanism that can be reversed in the presence of F-NLS-FKBP by the addition of rapalog. Thus, coincidently, we obtained a dormant MX1 variant (FRB*-MX1) that could be activated by the addition of an exogenous small molecule (rapalog) without mutating the endogenous NLS sequence. MX1-FRB* failed to suppress the influenza A RNA polymerase activity regardless of the presence or absence of F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog. It has been reported that fusion of FRB* to a protein can have a destabilizing effect and lead to degradation of the fusion protein (21Stankunas K. Bayle J.H. Havranek J.J. Wandless T.J. Baker D. Crabtree G.R. Gestwicki J.E. Rescue of degradation-prone mutants of the FK506-rapamycin binding (FRB) protein with chemical ligands.Chembiochem. 2007; 8: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Edwards S.R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 13395-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To assess whether such a destabilizing effect could explain the lack of antiviral activity of FRB*-MX1 or MX1-FRB*, we determined protein expression levels in lysates from transfected cells by Western blotting analysis. When compared with the other MX1 constructs, MX1-FRB* and MX1T69A-FRB* expression levels in the detergent-extractable cell fraction were strongly reduced (Fig. 1C). Co-expression of F-NLS-FKBP and the addition of rapalog did not increase the expression levels of MX1-FRB* and MX1T69A-FRB*. Therefore, the low expression levels may explain the lack of antiviral activity of the MX1-FRB* variant. In contrast to the C-terminal FRB* fusions, the expression levels of FRB*-MX1 and FRB*-MX1T69A were only slightly reduced when compared with those of MX1 and MX1T69A (Fig. 1C). To gain some insight into how the FRB* domain fused to the N terminus of MX1 disturbed the antiviral activity in a reversible way, we co-expressed FRB*-MX1 (with or without F-NLS-FKBP) with wild type MX1 at different ratios. In the absence of rapalog, the activity of MX1 dropped dose-dependently when FRB*-MX1 was co-expressed, suggesting a dominant negative effect of FRB*-MX1 (Fig. 1D). As a control for dominant negative interference, MX1 was co-expressed with MX1T69A. However, when rapalog and F-NLS-FKBP were present, the dominant negative effect of FRB*-MX1 on MX1 was at least partially reversed (Fig. 1D). This reversible dominant negative effect on MX1 suggests that FRB*-MX1 can still form dimers or even higher order oligomers. To further document the dependence on rapalog addition to activate FRB*-MX1 in the presence of F-NLS-FKBP, we performed a dose range experiment in which different concentrations of this small molecule compound were added to transfected cells. Starting from a concentration of 25 nm rapalog, FRB*-MX1 inhibited the PR8 polymerase activity in a F-NLS-FKBP-dependent way and reached a maximum at 100 nm (Fig. 2). Taken together, this shows that N- or C-terminal fusion of an FRB* domain to mouse MX1 is detrimental for its antiviral activity. However, in the case of FRB*-MX1, the antiviral activity, based on an influenza A minireplicon reporter assay, can be restored in the presence of F-NLS-FKBP by the addition of rapalog in a dose-dependent way. The subcellular localization of MX1, FRB*-MX1, MX1-FRB*, MX1T69A, FRB*-MX1T69A, and F-NLS-FKBP in the absence or presence of rapalog was also visualized. In the absence of F-NLS-FKBP, FRB*-MX1 is expressed mainly in the nucleus and in a punctate pattern and, like MX1, it can also be detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). When F-NLS-FKBP was expressed alone, it was distributed evenly over the whole cell despite its added NLS, presumably because it is small enough to diffuse freely in and out of the nucleus (predicted molecular mass: 14.3 kDa) and because of a masking effect of the NLS by the FLAG tag. When FRB*-MX1 and F-NLS-FKBP were expressed together, F-NLS-FKBP was redistributed to the MX1 nuclear speckles in the presence of rapalog (Fig. 3). This suggests that rapalog induces the dimerization of F-NLS-FKBP and FRB*-MX1. To verify that F-NLS-FKBP and FRB*-MX1 heterodimerize in the presence of rapalog, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. In addition, we estimated how fast this dimerization could occur after adding rapalog to the cells. F-NLS-FKBP was pulled down with an anti-FLAG antibody, and co-immunoprecipitation of FRB*-MX1 was evaluated by Western blotting. This experiment revealed that FRB*-MX1 interacts with F-NLS-FKBP only in the presence of rapalog (Fig. 4). Interestingly, FRB*-MX1 already co-immunoprecipitated with F-NLS-FKBP when rapalog was added just 5 min prior to cell lysis (Fig. 4). MX1 can interact with influenza A virus NP (14Verhelst J. Parthoens E. Schepens B. Fiers W. Saelens X. Interferon-inducible protein Mx1 inhibits influenza virus by interfering with functional viral ribonucleoprotein complex assembly.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 13445-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether FRB*-MX1 could also interact with NP and, if so, whether this interaction was dependent on the presence of F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog. HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding NP and MX1 or FRB*-MX1, and the latter setup was with or without co-transfected F-NLS-FKBP. The cells were treated with rapalog or vehicle starting at 16 h before cell lysis. Subsequently, NP was pulled down, and then the presence of co-immunoprecipitated MX1 or FRB*-MX1 protein was determined. As expected, wild type MX1 formed a complex with NP, irrespective of the presence or absence of rapalog (Fig. 5). FRB*-MX1, however, only interacted with NP when both F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog were present (Fig. 5). Therefore, interaction of FRB*-MX1 with influenza A virus NP correlates with its antiviral configuration. FRB*-MX1 can inhibit influenza A polymerase complex activity in a minireplicon system in the presence of F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog. In a next step, we wanted to verify whether this conditionally activatable MX1 variant could also suppress influenza A virus replication in an infection setting. To investigate this, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for MX1 or FRB*-MX1 and F-NLS-FKBP. Cells transfected with GTPase-deficient MX1T69A were included as a negative control. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were infected with PR8 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At different time points before and after infection, rapalog was added to the cells. Sixteen hours after infection, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of infected (vRNP-positive) cells in the transfected (MX1-positive) population. As expected, the majority of wild type MX1-expressing cells had very low vRNP levels, whereas most of the MX1T69A-expressing cells were infected (Fig. 6). In the absence of rapalog, most of the FRB*-MX1-expressing cells were infected (Fig. 6). However, when rapalog was added 1 h before, at the same time as or 1 h after infection, up to 50% of FRB*-MX1-expressing cells displayed very low vRNP levels, suggesting that in these cells, the virus failed to replicate (Fig. 6). FRB*-MX1 loses its ability to suppress vRNP expression when rapalog is added 4 h after the start of infection (Fig. 6). Taken together, FRB*-MX1, which is activated by rapalog shortly before or after infection, can inhibit influenza A virus replication. We previously reported that mouse MX1 interferes with the interaction of PB2 and NP, which correlates with its antiviral activity (14Verhelst J. Parthoens E. Schepens B. Fiers W. Saelens X. Interferon-inducible protein Mx1 inhibits influenza virus by interfering with functional viral ribonucleoprotein complex assembly.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 13445-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This reduced PB2-NP interaction could be the result of an active disruption of the PB2-NP interaction in pre-existing vRNPs or the result of inhibition of the formation of new vRNPs. It is very difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities, because either way, this implies that MX1 blocks infection at an early step. Either the very small amount of incoming vRNPs is inactivated by MX1, or the incoming vRNPs remain associated and newly produced vRNPs are prevented from being formed by MX1. The conditionally activatable FRB*-MX1 variant described above now allowed vRNP formation to proceed for a certain amount of time before the addition of rapalog, to initiate activation of its antiviral activity. In this way, it is possible to investigate the effect of MX1 on a large enough pool of pre-existing vRNPs. HEK293T cells were transfected with the minireplicon system of PR8 virus, and we co-transfected these cells with MX1 WT, MX1T69A, FRB*-MX1, F-NLS-FKBP, and FRB*-MX1 together with F-NLS-FKBP or FRB*-MX1T69A together with F-NLS-FKBP (Fig. 7). At different time points before cell lysis, rapalog was added to activate FRB*-MX1 in cells that also expressed F-NLS-FKBP. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed in both directions, i.e. PB2V5 was pulled down followed by analysis of co-immunoprecipitated NP, and, vice versa, we pulled down NP and assessed whether PB2V5 was co-immunoprecipitated. As expected, the PB2V5-NP interaction was disrupted by wild type MX1, but not by MX1T69A (Fig. 7). In addition, FRB*-MX1, but not FRB*-MX1T69A, disrupted the NP-PB2V5 interaction, but only when both F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog were present. Interestingly, disruption of the NP-PB2V5 complex in the presence of FRB*-MX1 was apparent even when rapalog was added only 15 min before cell lysis. Taken together, this suggests that activated FRB*-MX1 can disrupt pre-existing viral PB2-NP interactions. Mouse MX1 inhibits influenza virus replication by blocking primary transcription (23Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Human and mouse Mx proteins inhibit different steps of the influenza virus multiplication cycle.J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2564-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, until now the details of the antiviral mechanism of MX1 have remained elusive. We and others previously reported that the presence of mouse MX1 prevents the interaction between the influenza A virus vRNP components PB2 and NP, which could explain how this protein suppresses influenza A virus replication (14Verhelst J. Parthoens E. Schepens B. Fiers W. Saelens X. Interferon-inducible protein Mx1 inhibits influenza virus by interfering with functional viral ribonucleoprotein complex assembly.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 13445-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Human and mouse Mx proteins inhibit different steps of the influenza virus multiplication cycle.J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2564-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is unclear whether MX1 prevents vRNP assembly or (also) inactivates pre-existing vRNP complexes. Mammalian cells that express mouse MX1 suppress influenza A virus replication and are highly resistant to influenza A virus infection, which means that de novo synthesis and assembly of vRNPs are strongly reduced. This makes it technically very difficult to address whether MX1 prevents vRNP assembly or (also) inactivates pre-existing vRNP complexes. We therefore aimed to design an antivirally inactive MX1 variant that could be rapidly activated by a small compound stimulus. To generate such a conditional MX1 variant, we made use of the inducible heterodimerization between FRB* and FKBP in the presence of the cell-permeable small compound rapalog. We explored two conditional MX1 variants, i.e. one with the FRB* domain fused at the N terminus (FRB*-MX1) and one with an FRB* domain at the C terminus (MX1-FRB*). As such, both variants were inactive in a PR8 minireplicon assay, suggesting that the addition of the FRB* domain hinders the antiviral activity of the MX1 protein. However, in the presence of F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog, the variant with the FRB* domain at the N terminus regained antiviral activity almost to a similar level as the wild type MX1 protein. The antiviral activity of FRB*-MX1 was dependent on the presence of both F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog, and positively correlated with the dose of rapalog. The activatable phenotype of the FRB*-MX1 variant was also confirmed in a PR8 infection experiment. Also, during infection, antiviral activity of FRB*-MX1 was dependent on the presence of both F-NLS-FKBP and rapalog. Nevertheless, the resulting antiviral activity appeared to be lower than that of wild type MX1 (Fig. 6). This is not unexpected because newly translated MX1 in pCAXL-Mx1-transfected cells is immediately active. To further corroborate that the activated FRB*-MX1 variant functionally resembles the wild type MX1 protein, we investigated the binding of FRB*-MX1 with a viral target, i.e. the NP protein. For this, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in cells expressing NP and FRB*-MX1 with or without F-NLS-FKBP and in the absence or presence of rapalog. This experiment revealed that FRB*-MX1 could bind to NP, but only in its active form, i.e. in the presence"
https://openalex.org/W2562075379,"The suppression of mitotic Aurora kinases (AURKs) by AURK inhibitors frequently causes cytokinetic failure, leading to polyploidy or aneuploidy, indicating the critical role of AURK-mediated phosphorylation during cytokinesis. We demonstrate the deregulated expression of AKT3 in Aurora kinase inhibitor (AURKi)-resistant cells, which we established from human colorectal cancer HCT 116 cells. The AKT family, which includes AKT1, -2, and -3, plays multiple roles in antiapoptotic functions and drug resistance and is involved in cell growth and survival pathways. We found that an AKT inhibitor, AZD5363, showed synergistic effect with an AURKi, VX-680, on two AKT3-expressing AURKi-resistant cell lines, and AKT3 knockdown sensitized cells to VX-680. Consistent with these activities, AKT3 expression suppressed AURKi-induced apoptosis and conferred resistance to AURKi. Thus, AKT3 expression affects cell sensitivity to AURKi. Moreover, we found that AKT3 expression suppressed AURKi-induced aneuploidy, and inversely AKT3 knockdown enhanced it. In addition, partial co-localization of AKT3 with AURKB was observed during anaphase. Overall, this study suggests that AKT3 could repress the antiproliferative effects of AURKi, with a novel activity particularly suppressing the aneuploidy induction."
