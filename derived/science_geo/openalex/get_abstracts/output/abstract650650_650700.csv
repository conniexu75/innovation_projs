https://openalex.org/W3015190630,"The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China has caused significant public health concerns. Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) spike (S) protein in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), which reveals a hACE2-binding mode similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV. However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These findings shed light on the viral pathogenesis and provide important structural information regarding development of therapeutic countermeasures against the emerging virus."

Gao et al. focused on a complex that plays a key role in the replication and transcription cycle of the virus. They used cryo–electron microscopy to determine a 2.9-angstrom-resolution structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, which catalyzes the synthesis of viral RNA, in complex with two cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8. nsp12 is a target for nucleotide analog antiviral inhibitors such as remdesivir, and the structure may provide a basis for designing new antiviral therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W3015593286,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel, converts the free energy of binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into opening of its central pore. Here we present the first high-resolution structure of the receptor type found in muscle-endplate membrane and in the muscle-derived electric tissues of fish. The native receptor was purified from Torpedo electric tissue and functionally reconstituted in lipids optimal for cryo-electron microscopy. The receptor was stabilized in a closed state by the binding of α-bungarotoxin. The structure reveals the binding of a toxin molecule at each of two subunit interfaces in a manner that would block the binding of acetylcholine. It also reveals a closed gate in the ion-conducting pore, formed by hydrophobic amino acid side chains, located ∼60 Å from the toxin binding sites. The structure provides a framework for understanding gating in ligand-gated channels and how mutations in the acetylcholine receptor cause congenital myasthenic syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W3015580073,"NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, and CUC2) transcription factors are one of the largest transcription factor families found in the plants and are involved in diverse developmental and signalling events. Despite the availability of comprehensive genomic information from diverse plant species, the basic genomic, biochemical, and evolutionary details of NAC TFs have not been established. Therefore, NAC TFs family proteins from 160 plant species were analyzed in the current study. Study revealed, Brassica napus (410) encodes highest number and Klebsormidium flaccidum (3) encodes the lowest number of TFs. The study further revealed the presence of NAC TF in the Charophyte algae K. flaccidum. On average, the monocot plants encode higher number (141.20) of NAC TFs compared to the eudicots (125.04), gymnosperm (75), and bryophytes (22.66). Furthermore, our analysis revealed that several NAC TFs are membrane bound and contain monopartite, bipartite, and multipartite nuclear localization signals. NAC TFs were also found to encode several novel chimeric proteins and regulate a complex interactome network. In addition to the presence of NAC domain, several NAC proteins were found to encode other functional signature motifs as well. Relative expression analysis of NAC TFs in A. thaliana revealed root tissue treated with urea and ammonia showed higher level of expression and leaf tissues treated with urea showed lower level of expression. The synonymous codon usage is absent in the NAC TFs and it appears that they have evolved from orthologous ancestors and undergone vivid duplications to give rise to paralogous NAC TFs. The presence of novel chimeric NAC TFs are of particular interest and the presence of chimeric NAC domain with other functional signature motifs in the NAC TF might encode novel functional properties in the plants."
https://openalex.org/W3015738775,"The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has led to more than seven thousand deaths. Unfortunately, there are no specific drugs available to cure this disease. Type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) may play an important role in host defense mechanisms. Based on the idea of host-directed therapy (HDT), we performed a negative co-expression analysis using big data of 60 000 Affymetrix expression arrays and 5000 TCGA data sets to determine the functions of TAS2R10, which can be activated by numerous bitter substances. Excitingly, we found that the main functions of TAS2R10 involved controlling infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, suggesting that TAS2R10 is a key trigger of host defense pathways. To quickly guide the clinical treatment of 2019-nCoV, we searched currently available drugs that are agonists of TAS2Rs. We identified many cheap, available, and safe medicines, such as diphenidol, quinine, chloroquine, artemisinin, chlorpheniramine, yohimbine, and dextromethorphan, which may target the most common symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV. We suggest that a cocktail-like recipe of existing bitter drugs may help doctors to fight this catastrophic disease and that the general public may drink or eat bitter substances, such as coffee, tea, or bitter vegetables, to reduce the risk of infection."
https://openalex.org/W3015559370,"Heavy metal pollution is a widespread problem and strongly affects human health through the food chain. In this study, the overall pollution situation and source apportionment of heavy metals in soil (Hg, Cd, As, Pb, Ni, Zn, Cu and Cr) were evaluated using various methods including geo-accumulation index (Igeo), potential ecological risk index (RI) and positive matrix factorization combined with Geographical Information System (GIS) to quantify and identify the possible sources to these heavy metals in soils. The results of Igeo showed that this farmland top soil moderate contaminated by Hg, other selected elements with noncontamination level. And the average RI in the top soil was 259.89, indicating a moderate ecological risk, of which Hg and Cd attributed 88.87% of the RI. The results of the PMF model showed that the relative contributions of heavy metals due to atmospheric depositions (18.70%), sewage irrigations (21.17%), soil parent materials (19.11%), industrial and residential coal combustions (17.43%) and agricultural and lithogenic sources (23.59%), respectively. Of these elements, Pb and Cd were came from atmospheric deposition. Cr was attributed to sewage irrigations. As was mainly derived from the soil parent materials. Hg originated from industrial and residential coal combustions, and most of the Cu, Zn and Ni, except for Pb, were predominantly derived from agricultural and lithogenic sources. These results are important in considering management plans to control the aggravation of heavy metal pollution and ultimately to protect soil resources in this region. In addition, this study enhances the understanding of heavy metal contamination occurrence in agroecosystem that helps predicting and limiting the potential of heavy metal exposure to people and ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3015854010,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to alleviate renal fibrosis, however, the role of individual HDAC isoforms in this process is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of HDAC8 in the development of renal fibrosis and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). In a murine model of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), HDAC8 was primarily expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells and time-dependently upregulated. This occurred in parallel with the deacetylation of cortactin, a nonhistone substrate of HDAC8, and increased expression of three fibrotic markers: α-smooth muscle actin, collagen 1, and fibronectin. Administration of PCI34051, a highly selective inhibitor of HDAC8, restored acetylation of contactin and reduced expression of those proteins. PCI34051 treatment also reduced the number of renal tubular epithelial cells arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and suppressed phosphorylation of Smad3, STAT3, β-catenin, and expression of Snail after ureteral obstruction. In contrast, HDAC8 inhibition reversed UUO-induced downregulation of BMP7 and Klotho, two renoprotective proteins. In cultured murine proximal tubular cells, treatment with PCI34051 or specific HDAC8 siRNA was also effective in inhibiting transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)-induced deacetylation of contactin, EMT, phosphorylation of Smad3, STAT3, and β-catenin, upregulation of Snail, and downregulation of BMP7 and Klotho. Collectively, these results suggest that HDAC8 activation is required for the EMT and renal fibrogenesis by activation of multiple profibrotic signaling and transcription factors, and suppression of antifibrotic proteins. Therefore, targeting HDAC8 may be novel therapeutic approach for treatment of renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3016255521,"In the brain, α-synuclein (aSN) partitions between free unbound cytosolic and membrane bound forms modulating both its physiological and pathological role and complicating its study due to structural heterogeneity. Here, we use an interdisciplinary, synergistic approach to characterize the properties of aSN:lipid mixtures, isolated aSN:lipid co-structures, and aSN in mammalian cells. Enabled by the isolation of the membrane-bound state, we show that within the previously described N-terminal membrane anchor, membrane interaction relies both on an N-terminal tail (NTT) head group layer insertion of 14 residues and a folded-upon-binding helix at the membrane surface. Both binding events must be present; if, for example, the NTT insertion is lost, the membrane affinity of aSN is severely compromised and formation of aSN:lipid co-structures hampered. In mammalian cells, compromised cooperativity results in lowered membrane association. Thus, avidity within the N-terminal anchor couples N-terminal insertion and helical surface binding, which is crucial for aSN membrane interaction and cellular localization, and may affect membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W3015298957,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to directly alter the virus life cycle and virus–host interactions, and so are considered promising molecules for controlling virus infection. In the present study, we observed that miR-155 time-dependently downregulated upon dengue virus (DENV) infection. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of miR-155 appeared to limit viral replication in vitro, suggesting that the low levels of miR-155 would be beneficial for DENV replication. In vivo, overexpression of miR-155 protected ICR suckling mice from the life-threatening effects of DENV infection and reduced virus propagation. Further investigation revealed that the anti-DENV activity of miR-155 was due to target Bach1, resulting in the induction of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)-mediated inhibition of DENV NS2B/NS3 protease activity, ultimately leading to induction of antiviral interferon responses, including interferon-induced protein kinase R (PKR), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2, and OAS3 expression, against DENV replication. Collectively, our results provide a promising new strategy to manage DENV infection by modulation of miR-155 expression."
https://openalex.org/W3015541167,"Mitochondrial function, largely regulated by the dynamics of this organelle, is inextricably linked to the oocyte health. In comparison with most somatic cells, mitochondria in oocytes are smaller and rounder in appearance, suggesting limited fusion. The functional implications of this distinct morphology, and how changes in the mitochondrial shape translate to mitochondrial function in oogenesis is little understood. We, therefore, asked whether the pro-fusion proteins mitofusins 1 (MFN1) and 2 (MFN2) are required for the oocyte development. Here we show that oocyte-specific deletion of Mfn1, but not Mfn2, prevents the oocyte growth and ovulation due to a block in folliculogenesis. We pinpoint the loss of oocyte growth and ovulation to impaired PI3K-Akt signaling and disrupted oocyte-somatic cell communication. In support, the double loss of Mfn1 and Mfn2 partially rescues the impaired PI3K-Akt signaling and defects in oocyte development secondary to the single loss of Mfn1. Together, this work demonstrates that the mitochondrial function influences the cellular signaling during the oocyte development, and highlights the importance of distinct, nonredundant roles of MFN1 and MFN2 in oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3016124385,"Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are causing global climate change and decreasing the stability of the climate system. Long-term solutions to climate change will require reduction in GHG emissions as well as the removal of large quantities of GHGs from the atmosphere. Natural climate solutions (NCS), i.e., changes in land management, ecosystem restoration, and avoided conversion of habitats, have substantial potential to meet global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and contribute to the global drawdown of GHGs. However, the relative role of NCS to contribute to GHG reduction at subnational scales is not well known. We examined the potential for 12 NCS activities on natural and working lands in Oregon, USA to reduce GHG emissions in the context of the state’s climate mitigation goals. We evaluated three alternative scenarios wherein NCS implementation increased across the applicable private or public land base, depending on the activity, and estimated the annual GHG reduction in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attributable to NCS from 2020 to 2050. We found that NCS within Oregon could contribute annual GHG emission reductions of 2.7 to 8.3 MMT CO2e by 2035 and 2.9 to 9.8 MMT CO2e by 2050. Changes in forest-based activities including deferred timber harvest, riparian reforestation, and replanting after wildfires contributed most to potential GHG reductions (76 to 94% of the overall annual reductions), followed by changes to agricultural management through no-till, cover crops, and nitrogen management (3 to 15% of overall annual reductions). GHG reduction benefits are relatively high per unit area for avoided conversion of forests (125–400 MT CO2e ha-1). However, the existing land use policy in Oregon limits the current geographic extent of active conversion of natural lands and thus, avoided conversions results in modest overall potential GHG reduction benefits (i.e., less than 5% of the overall annual reductions). Tidal wetland restoration, which has high per unit area carbon sequestration benefits (8.8 MT CO2e ha-1 yr-1), also has limited possible geographic extent resulting in low potential (< 1%) of state-level GHG reduction contributions. However, co-benefits such as improved habitat and water quality delivered by restoration NCS pathways are substantial. Ultimately, reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration to combat climate change will require actions across multiple sectors. We demonstrate that the adoption of alternative land management practices on working lands and avoided conversion and restoration of native habitats can achieve meaningful state-level GHG reductions."
https://openalex.org/W3015641680,"Recent studies have revealed gender differences in cold perception, and pointed to a possible direct action of testosterone (TST) on the cold-activated TRPM8 (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin Member 8) channel. However, the mechanisms by which TST influences TRPM8-mediated sensory functions remain elusive. Here, we show that TST inhibits TRPM8-mediated mild-cold perception through the noncanonical engagement of the Androgen Receptor (AR). Castration of both male rats and mice increases sensitivity to mild cold, and this effect depends on the presence of intact TRPM8 and AR. TST in nanomolar concentrations suppresses whole-cell TRPM8-mediated currents and single-channel activity in native dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and HEK293 cells co-expressing recombinant TRPM8 and AR, but not TRPM8 alone. AR cloned from rat DRGs shows no difference from standard AR. However, biochemical assays and confocal imaging reveal the presence of AR on the cell surface and its interaction with TRPM8 in response to TST, leading to an inhibition of channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W3016008806,"Mitochondrial abnormalities play critical roles in diabetic tubular injury progression. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors are widely used antihyperglycemic agents that exert renal protective and positive effects against mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, their underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, DPP4 upregulation, mitochondrial fragmentation, and altered mitochondrial dynamics-associated protein expression were observed in the tubules of DBA2/J (D2) diabetic mice with unilateral nephrectomy and in albumin-stimulated tubular cells. The inhibition of DPP4 by sitagliptin (Sita) ameliorated these mitochondrial perturbations both in vivo and in vitro, whereas DPP4 overexpression aggravated mitochondrial fusion-fission disorder and tubular cell injury in albumin-treated HK-2 cells. Downstream of DPP4, the SDF-1α/CXCR4 pathway was significantly suppressed in diabetic tubules. After Sita treatment, this signaling pathway was restored, and the mitochondrial dynamics was improved. Furthermore, a direct interaction between STAT3 and OPA1 was found in the mitochondria of tubular cells, and this effect was weakened by overloading albumin and by CXCR4 siRNA treatment, suggesting a possible link between DPP4-mediated SDF-1α/CXCR4/STAT3 signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic tubular cells. The results suggest that a novel mechanism links the DPP4 enzyme to impaired mitochondrial dynamics homeostasis during tubular injury in DKD and highlight that the SDF-1α/CXCR4/STAT3 signaling pathway could become a potential target for managing DKD."
https://openalex.org/W3015226197,"miR-206, miR-1a-1, and miR-1a-2 are induced during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts and promote myogenesis in vitro. miR-206 is required for skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo. Although this miRNA family is hypothesized to play an essential role in differentiation, a triple knock-out (tKO) of the three genes has not been done to test this hypothesis. We report that tKO C2C12 myoblasts generated using CRISPR/Cas9 method differentiate despite the expected derepression of the miRNA targets. Surprisingly, their mitochondrial function is diminished. tKO mice demonstrate partial embryonic lethality, most likely due to the role of miR-1a in cardiac muscle differentiation. Two tKO mice survive and grow normally to adulthood with smaller myofiber diameter, diminished physical performance, and an increase in PAX7 positive satellite cells. Thus, unlike other miRNAs important in other differentiation pathways, the miR-206 family is not absolutely essential for myogenesis and is instead a modulator of optimal differentiation of skeletal myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W3015298571,"The effects of peer tutoring on students’ mathematics self-concepts were examined. The Marsh questionnaire was used to measure students’ mathematics self-concepts before and after implementation of a peer tutoring program. A pretest posttest control group design was employed. Study participants included 376 students from grades 7 to 9 (12 to 15 years old). No statistically significant differences were reported between the pretest and the posttest for any of the control groups. Statistically significant improvements were reported for all grades for the experimental groups. An average increment of 13.4% was reported for students in the experimental group, and the overall effect size was reported to be medium (Hedges’ g = 0.48). No statistically significant differences were reported across grades for the experimental group. The main conclusion of this study is that same-age and reciprocal peer tutoring may be very beneficial for middle school students’ mathematics self-concepts. Several recommendations for field practitioners emanated from the study: use same-age and reciprocal tutoring over cross-age and fixed peer tutoring; schedule tutoring programs for four weeks or less with two to four sessions of 25 minutes or less per week for each tutoring session; and, include a control group in research studies."
https://openalex.org/W3015598247,"Strong tropical cyclone (TC) Ockhi occurred in the southeastern Arabian Sea (AS) in 2017. Ockhi greatly changed the oceanic conditions and induced large variation in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The dynamic mechanisms of the long-term phytoplankton bloom after the passage of the TC were investigated in this study. Prominent surface ocean responses, e.g., decreasing temperature and salinity, were identified from Argo data by comparing the pre- and post-conditions of the TC. A phytoplankton bloom was observed in southeastern AS after the passage of TC Ockhi within the area of (11°N-14°N, 67°E-70°E) and lasted for seven days. Interestingly, there were two weaker cyclonic eddies, with an average vorticity of less than 0.14 s-1, on the TC trajectory from November 28 to December 2. As Ockhi approached, strong vertical mixing occurred on December 3, increasing the eddy vorticity to 0.26 s-1. After the passage of Ockhi, both eddies, with a two-day oscillation period, were substantially enhanced. Especially from December 11 to 16, the vorticity above 70 m was as high as 0.2 s-1 in the thermocline. Because of the high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and low precipitation, the enhanced cyclonic eddies induced upwelling for the entire thermocline for over ten days and uplifted nitrates into the mixed layer. This study offers new insights on the influence of eddies in regulating the impacts of typhoons on Chl-a, and the results can help evaluate typhoon-induced biological responses in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3016008062,"In general, honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) feed on honey produced from collected nectar. In the absence of nectar, during certain times of the year or in monocultural landscapes, honey bees forage on honeydew. Honeydew is excreted by different herbivores of the order Hemiptera that consume phloem sap of plant species. In comparison to nectar, honeydew is composed of a higher variety of sugars and additional sugars with higher molecular weight, like the trisaccharide melezitose that can be a major constituent of honeydew. However, melezitose-containing honey is known to cause malnutrition in overwintering honey bees. Following the hypothesis that melezitose may be the cause for the so called ‘honeydew flow disease’, three independent feeding experiments with caged bees were conducted in consecutive years. Bees fed with melezitose showed increased food uptake, higher gut weights and elevated mortality compared to bees fed a control diet. Moreover, severe disease symptoms, such as swollen abdomen, abdomen tipping and impaired movement were observed in melezitose-fed bees. 16S-amplicon sequencing indicated that the melezitose diet changed the species composition of the lactic acid bacteria community within the gut microbiota. Based on these results, we conclude that melezitose cannot be easily digested by the host and may accumulate in the hindgut. Within cages or during winter, when there is no opportunity for excretion, the accumulated melezitose can cause severe intestinal symptoms and death of the bees, probably as result of poor melezitose metabolism capabilities in the intestinal microbiota. These findings confirm the causal relation between the trisaccharide melezitose and the honeydew flow disease and indicate a possible mechanism of pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3015673713,"Our previous results showed that the specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) Resolvin D1 (RvD1) promotes resolution of inflammation in salivary glands in non-obese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ, a mouse model for Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Additionally, mice lacking the RvD1 receptor ALX/FPR2 show defective innate and adaptive immune responses in salivary glands. Particularly, ALX/FPR2 KO mice exhibit exacerbated inflammation in their salivary glands in response to systemic LPS treatment. Moreover, female ALX/FPR2 KO mice show increased autoantibody production and loss of salivary gland function with age. Together, these studies suggest that an underlying SPM dysregulation could be contributing to SS progression. Therefore, we investigated whether SPM production is altered in NOD/ShiLtJ using metabololipidomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results demonstrate that SPM levels were broadly elevated in plasma collected from NOD/ShiLtJ female mice after disease onset, whereas these drastic changes did not occur in male mice. Moreover, gene expression of enzymes involved in SPM biosynthesis were altered in submandibular glands (SMG) from NOD/ShiLtJ female mice after disease onset, with 5-LOX and 12/15-LOX being downregulated and upregulated, respectively. Despite this dysregulation, the abundances of the SPM products of these enzymes (ie, RvD1 and RvD2) were unaltered in freshly isolated SMG cells suggesting that other cell populations (eg, lymphocytes) may be responsible for the overabundance of SPMs that we observed. The elevation of SPMs noted here appeared to be sex mediated, meaning that it was observed only in one sex (females). Given that SS primarily affects females (roughly 90% of diagnosed cases), these results may provide some insights into the mechanisms underlying the observed sexual dimorphism."
https://openalex.org/W3016236927,"Parasympathetic neurons in the airways control bronchomotor tone. Increased activity of cholinergic neurons are mediators of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma, however, mechanisms are not elucidated. We describe remodeling of the cholinergic neuronal network in asthmatic airways driven by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Human bronchial biopsies were stained for cholinergic marker vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Human lung gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in neuroplasticity-related genes were compared between asthma and healthy patients. Wild-type (WT) and mutated TrkB knock-in mice (Ntrk2tm1Ddg/J) with impaired BDNF signaling were chronically exposed to ovalbumin (OVA). Neuronal VAChT staining and airway narrowing in response to electrical field stimulation in precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were assessed. Increased cholinergic fibers in asthmatic airway biopsies was found, paralleled by increased TrkB gene expression in human lung tissue, and SNPs in the NTRK2 [TrkB] and BDNF genes linked to asthma. Chronic allergen exposure in mice resulted in increased density of cholinergic nerves, which was prevented by inhibiting TrkB. Increased nerve density resulted in AHR in vivo and in increased nerve-dependent airway reactivity in lung slices mediated via TrkB. These findings show cholinergic neuroplasticity in asthma driven by TrkB signaling and suggest that the BDNF-TrkB pathway may be a potential target."
https://openalex.org/W3015675645,"Angiogenesis is a hallmark of tumorigenesis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is hypervascular and therefore very dependent on angiogenesis for tumor development and progression. Findings from previous studies suggest that in HCC cells, hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF1A) and zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) transcription factors functionally interact in the regulation of genes in HCC cells. Here, we report that hypoxia increases the transcription of the ZFHX3 gene and enhances the binding of HIF1A to the ZFHX3 promoter in the HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh-7. Moreover, ZFHX3, in turn, physically associated with and was functionally indispensable for HIF1A to exert its angiogenic activity, as indicated by in vitro migration and tube formation assays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and microvessel formation in xenograft tumors of HCC cells. Mechanistically, ZFHX3 was required for HIF1A to transcriptionally activate the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) gene by binding to its promoter. Functionally, down-regulation of ZFHX3 in HCC cells slowed their tumor growth, and addition of VEGFA to conditioned medium from ZFHX3-silenced HCC cells partially rescued the inhibitory effect of this medium on HUVEC tube formation. In human HCC, ZFHX3 expression was up-regulated, and this up-regulation correlated with both HIF1A up-regulation and worse patient survival, confirming a functional association between ZFHX3 and HIF1A in human HCC. We conclude that ZFHX3 is an angiogenic transcription factor that is integral to the HIF1A/VEGFA signaling axis in HCC cells.

https://openalex.org/W3015930576,"Plant-pollinator interactions are known to vary across time, both in terms of species composition and the associations between partner species. However, less is known about tropical pollination networks, and tropical urban parks provide a unique opportunity to study network stability in an environment where temperature and floral resources are relatively constant due to both the tropical climate as well as park horticulture. The objectives of this study were thus to examine the interactions between flowering plants and their potential pollinators in a large, tropical city (Bangkok, Thailand) across 12 consecutive months, and to assess the stability of network properties over time. We conducted monthly pollinator observations at 9 parks spaced throughout the city, and collected data on temperature, precipitation, floral abundance and floral species richness. We found that neither pollinator abundance nor richness varied significantly across months when all parks were pooled. However, pollinator abundance was significantly influenced by floral abundance, floral richness, and their interaction, and pollinator richness was significantly influenced by floral richness and precipitation. Finally, we found that network properties did not change across months, even as species composition did. We conclude that the year-round constancy of floral resources and climate conditions appear to create a network in dynamic equilibrium, where plant and pollinator species compositions change, but network properties remain stable. The results of this study provide useful information about how tropical pollinators respond to urban environments, which is particularly relevant given that most urban development is predicted to occur in the tropics."

Many of these variants cause complete loss of NHE6 expression, but how subtler missense substitutions or nonsense mutations that partially truncate its C-terminal cytoplasmic regulatory domain impair NHE6 activity and endosomal function are poorly understood. Here, we describe the molecular and cellular consequences of six unique mutations located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic segment (A9S), the membrane ion translocation domain (L188P and G383D), and the C-terminal regulatory domain (E547*, R568Q, and W570*) of human NHE6 that purportedly cause disease. Using a heterologous NHE6-deficient cell expression system, we show that the biochemical, catalytic, and cellular properties of the A9S and R568Q variants were largely indistinguishable from those of the WT transporter, which obscured their disease significance. By contrast, the L188P, G383D, E547*, and W570* mutants exhibited variable deficiencies in biosynthetic post-translational maturation, membrane sorting, pH homeostasis in recycling endosomes, and cargo trafficking, and they also triggered apoptosis.

These findings broaden our understanding of the molecular dysfunctions of distinct NHE6 variants associated with Christianson syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3015565541,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) arises when a truncated form of farnesylated prelamin A accumulates at the nuclear envelope, leading to misshapen nuclei. Previous studies of adult Zmpste24-deficient mice, a mouse model of progeria, have reported a metabolic response involving inhibition of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase and activation of autophagy. However, exactly how mTOR or autophagy is involved in progeria remains unclear. Here, we investigate this question by crossing Zmpste24+/− mice with mice hypomorphic in mTOR (mTOR△/+), or mice heterozygous in autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7+/−). We find that accumulation of prelamin A induces premature aging through mTOR overactivation and impaired autophagy in newborn Zmpste24−/− mice. Zmpste24−/− mice with genetically reduced mTOR activity, but not heterozygosity in Atg7, show extended lifespan. Moreover, mTOR inhibition partially restores autophagy and S6K1 activity. We also show that progerin interacts with the Akt phosphatase to promote full activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Finally, although we find that genetic reduction of mTOR postpones premature aging in Zmpste24 KO mice, frequent embryonic lethality occurs. Together, our findings show that over-activated mTOR contributes to premature aging in Zmpste24−/− mice, and suggest a potential strategy in treating HGPS patients with mTOR inhibitors."

However, systemic toxicity may arise due to the non-specific delivery of the nanoparticles. In addressing the issue, this study deals with the targeting of silver-copper-boron (ACB) nanoparticles to infected osteoblasts, which could decrease systemic toxicity and form the basis of targeting specific markers expressed in bone infections.ACB nanoparticles were synthesized and conjugated to the Cadherin-11 antibody (OBAb). The effect of targeting nanoparticles against extracellular and intracellular S. aureus was determined by enumeration of bacterial growth. The binding of the targeting nanoparticles to infected osteoblasts as well as the visualization of live/dead bacteria due to treatment was carried out using fluorescence microscopy. MTT assay was used to determine the viability of osteoblasts with different concentrations of the nanoparticles.The ACB nanoparticles conjugated to OBAb (ACB-OBAb) were effective against extracellular S. aureus. The ACB-OBAb nanoparticles showed a 1.32 log reduction of intracellular S. aureus at a concentration of 1mg/L. The ACB-OBAb nanoparticles were able to bind to the infected osteoblast and showed toxicity to osteoblasts at levels ≥20mg/L. Also, the percentage of silver, copper, and boron in the nanoparticles determined the effectiveness of their antibacterial activity.The ACB-OBAb nanoparticles were able to target the osteoblasts and demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against intracellular S. aureus. Targeting shows promise as a strategy to target specific markers expressed on infected osteoblasts for efficient nanoparticle delivery, and further animal studies are recommended to test its efficacy in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3015506275,"How species respond to climate change will depend on biological characteristics, species physiological limits, traits (such as dispersal), and interactions with disturbance. We examine multi-decadal shifts in the distribution of trees at the alpine treeline in response to regional warming and repeated disturbance by fire in the Victorian Alps, south-east Australia. Alpine treelines are composed of Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. niphophila (Snow Gum, Myrtaceae) species. The location and basal girth of all trees and saplings were recorded across treelines at four mountains in 2002 and 2018. We quantify changes in treeline position (sapling recruitment above treeline) over time in relation to warming and disturbance by fire, and examine changes in stand structure below treeline (stand density, size class analyses). Short-distance advance of the treeline occurred between 2002 and 2018, but was largely restricted to areas that were unburned during this period. No saplings were seen above treeline after two fires, despite evidence that saplings were common pre-fire. Below treeline, subalpine woodland stands were largely resilient to fire; trees resprouted from lignotubers. However, small trees were reduced in number in woodlands when burned twice within a decade. Population dynamics at the alpine treeline were responsive to recent climate change, but other factors (e.g. disturbance) are crucial to understand recruitment trends. Establishment of saplings above treeline was largely restricted to unburned areas. These results indicate fire is a strong demographic filter on treeline dynamics; there is a clear need to frame alpine treeline establishment processes beyond just being a response to climate warming. Long lag periods in treeline change may be expected where recurrent disturbance is a feature of the landscape."
https://openalex.org/W3015212482,"Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is caused by solar ultraviolet (SUV) exposure and is the most common cancer in the United States. T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a serine-threonine kinase is activated by SUV irradiation and involved in skin carcinogenesis. Strategies with research focusing on the TOPK signaling pathway and targeted therapy in skin carcinogenesis may helpful for the discovery of additional treatments against skin cancer. In this study, we found that TOPK can directly bind to and phosphorylate c-Jun (as one of the core member of AP-1) at Ser63 and Ser73 after SSL exposure in a JNKs-independent manner. TOPK knocking down, or HI-TOPK-032 (TOPK specific inhibitor) attenuated colony formation and cell proliferation of skin cancer cells. Phosphorylated levels of c-Jun were overexpressed in human AK and cSCC compared with normal skin tissues, and HI-TOPK-032 inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun in SCC cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HI-TOPK-032 decreased SSL-induced AP-1 transactivation activity. Moreover, acute SSL-induced inflammation was attenuated by the topical application of HI-TOPK-032 in SKH1 hairless mice. Importantly, HI-TOPK-032 suppressed chronic SSL-induced skin carcinogenesis and c-Jun phosphorylation levels in SKH1 hairless mice. Our results demonstrate that TOPK can phosphorylate and activate c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 in the process of skin carcinogenesis and HI-TOPK-032 could be used as a potential chemopreventive drug against cSCC development."
https://openalex.org/W3015435161,"Exotic species may increase or decrease native biodiversity. However, effects of exotic species are often mixed; and indirect pathways and compensatory changes can mask effects. Context-specific assessments of the indirect impacts of exotic species are also needed across multiple spatial scales. Agarophyton vermiculophyllum (previously Gracilaria vermiculophylla), an exotic, invasive macroalga, has established throughout the western hemisphere with reported positive or neutral impacts on biodiversity. Shorebirds are an important group for conservation in areas invaded by A. vermiculophyllum. We assess the impacts of this invader on shorebirds by measuring behavior and habitat selection at spatial scales ranging from algal patches to the entire study region. Birds were considered either flexible-foragers that used diverse foraging techniques, or specialized-foragers that employed fewer, more specialized foraging techniques. Responses were scale dependent, with patterns varying between spatial scales, and between behavior and habitat selection. However, a general pattern of habitat selection emerged wherein flexible-foraging shorebirds preferred A. vermiculophyllum habitat, and for specialized-foragers, habitat selection of A. vermiculophyllum was mixed. Meanwhile, flexible-foraging birds tended to neutrally use or avoid uninvaded habitat, and specialized-foraging birds mostly preferred uninvaded habitat. Shorebird behavioral response was less clear; with flexible-foragers spending less time on bare sediment than expected, the only significant response. Shorebird response to A. vermiculophyllum differed by foraging mode; likely because flexible, opportunistic species more readily use invaded habitat. Increases in A. vermiculophyllum could result in functional homogenization if the bare habitat preferred by specialized-foragers is reduced too greatly. We hypothesize the effect of scale is driven by differences among tidal flats. Thus, tidal flat properties such as sediment grain size and microtopography would determine whether foraging from A. vermiculophyllum was optimal for a shorebird. Specialization and spatial scale are important when assessing the biodiversity conservation impacts of invasive A. vermiculophyllum."

Clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed to identify the predictors of morbidity (prolonged hospital stay > 5 days) and mortality.Out of 462 patients, there were 264 (57.6%) males and the mean age of the cohort was 50.83 years (range: 20-94 years). DILI was classified as definite or highly probable in 31.1%, probable in 62.5%, and possible in 7.4% of cases. Pattern of liver injury was hepatocellular in 25.1%, cholestatic in 56.17%, and mixed in 18.72% of patients. Anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATDs) were found to be the most common category of drugs causing DILI, in 295 (63.9%) patients. Clinically, encephalopathy was present in 21.6% patients; other presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (57.1%), vomiting (57.1%), jaundice (54.1%) and pruritus (42.3%). In-hospital mortality was 26.5% and prolonged hospital stay (> 5 days) was observed in 35.93% of patients. Mortality was significantly greater in patients with encephalopathy, male gender, hepatocellular pattern of DILI, increased INR and use of ventilator support.In our study, the most frequent cause of DILI in hospitalized patients was ATDs. More than a quarter of patients died during hospital stay. A close control of clinical and biochemical parameters are required to prevent and monitor DILI, especially in patients taking ATDs in our region."
https://openalex.org/W3015802119,"Elucidation of host-pathogen interaction is essential for developing effective strategies to combat bacterial infection. Dual RNA-Seq using cultured cells or tissues/organs as the host of pathogen has emerged as a novel strategy to understand the responses concurrently from both pathogen and host at cellular level. However, bacterial infection mostly causes systematic responses from the host at organism level where the interplay is urgently to be understood but inevitably being neglected by the current practice. Here, we developed an approach that simultaneously monitor the genome-wide infection-linked transcriptional alterations in both pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus and the infection host nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Besides the dynamic alterations in transcriptomes of both C. elegans and V. parahaemolyticus during infection, we identify a two-component system, BarA/UvrY, that is important for virulence in host. BarA/UvrY not only controls the virulence factors in V. parahaemolyticus including Type III and Type VI secretion systems, but also attenuates innate immune responses in C. elegans, including repression on the MAP kinase-mediated cascades. Thus, our study exemplifies the use of dual RNA-Seq at organism level to uncover previously unrecognized interplay between host and pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3015438431,"Ecological theories posit that heterogeneity in environmental conditions greatly affects community structure and function. However, the degree to which ecological theory developed using plant- and animal-dominated systems applies to microbiomes is unclear. Investigating the metabolic strategies found in microbiomes are particularly informative for testing the universality of ecological theories because microorganisms have far wider metabolic capacity than plants and animals. We used metagenomic analyses to explore the relationships between the energy and physicochemical gradients in Lake Fryxell and the metabolic capacity of its benthic microbiome. Statistical analysis of the relative abundance of metabolic marker genes and gene family diversity shows that oxygenic photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and flavin-based electron bifurcation differentiate mats growing in different environmental conditions. The pattern of gene family diversity points to the likely importance of temporal environmental heterogeneity in addition to resource gradients. Overall, we found that the environmental heterogeneity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and oxygen concentration ([O2]) in Lake Fryxell provide the framework by which metabolic diversity and composition of the community is structured, in accordance with its phylogenetic structure. The organization of the resulting microbial ecosystems are consistent with the maximum power principle and the species sorting model."
https://openalex.org/W3016223611,"Subthreshold stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) is thought to enhance vestibular sensitivity and improve balance. However, it is unclear how SVS affects standing and walking when balance is challenged, particularly when the eyes are open. It is also unclear how different methods to determine stimulation intensity influence the effects. We aimed to determine (1) whether SVS affects stability when balance is challenged during eyes-open standing and overground walking tasks, and (2) how the effects differ based on whether optimal stimulation amplitude is derived from sinusoidal or cutaneous threshold techniques. Thirteen healthy adults performed balance-unchallenged and balance-challenged standing and walking tasks with SVS (0–30 Hz zero-mean, white noise electrical stimulus) or sham stimulation. For the balance-challenged condition, participants had inflatable rubber hemispheres attached to the bottom of their shoes to reduce the control provided by moving the center of pressure under their base of support. In different blocks of trials, we set SVS intensity to either 50% of participants’ sinusoidal (motion) threshold or 80% of participants’ cutaneous threshold. SVS reduced medial-lateral trunk velocity root mean square in the balance-challenged (p < 0.05) but not in the balance-unchallenged condition during standing. Regardless of condition, SVS decreased step-width variability and marginally increased gait speed when walking with the eyes open (p < 0.05). SVS intensity had minimal effect on the standing and walking measures. Taken together, our results provide insight into the effectiveness of SVS at improving balance-challenged, eyes-open standing and walking performance in healthy adults."
https://openalex.org/W3016050534,"Contagion in online social networks (OSN) occurs when users are exposed to information disseminated by other users. Studies of contagion are largely devoted to the spread of viral information and to local neighbor-to-neighbor contagion. However, many contagion events can be non-viral in the sense of being unpopular with low reach size, or global in the sense of being exposed to non-adjacent neighbors. This study aims to investigate the differences between local and global contagion and the different contagion patterns of viral vs. non-viral information. We analyzed three datasets and found significant differences between the temporal spreading patterns of local contagion compared to global contagion. Based on our analysis, we can successfully predict whether a user will be infected by either a local or a global contagion. We achieve an F1-score of 0.87 for non-viral information and an F1-score of 0.84 for viral information. We propose a novel method for early detection of the viral potential of an information nugget and investigate the spreading of viral and non-viral information. In addition, we analyze both viral and non-viral contagion of a topic. Differentiating between local versus global contagion, as well as between viral versus non-viral information, provides a novel perspective and better understanding of information diffusion in OSNs."

As a result, our method can avoid various problems due to training complex machine learning models on a small amount of data. We performed numerous types of experiments to test methods designed for predicting the future price of the S&P 500 which is one of the most commonly traded stock indexes.

https://openalex.org/W3015979550,"Vibrio coralliilyticus is a pathogen of coral and mollusk, contributing to dramatic losses worldwide. In our study, we found that V. coralliilyticus challenge could directly affect adult Tridacna crocea survival; there were dead individuals appearing at 6 h post infection, and there were 45.56% and 56.78% mortality rates in challenged groups after 36 h of infection. The apoptosis rate of hemocytes was significantly increased by 1.8-fold at 6 h after V. coralliilyticus injection. To shed light on the mechanistic molecular responses of T. crocea to V. coralliilyticus infection, we used transcriptome sequencing analysis and other relevant techniques to analyze T. crocea hemocytes at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after V. coralliilyticus challenge. Our results revealed that the total numbers of unigenes and DEGs were 195651 and 3446, respectively. Additional details were found by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, where DEGs were significantly enriched in immune-related signaling pathways, such as the TLR signaling pathway, and some were associated with signaling related to apoptosis. Quantitative validation results illustrated that with exposure to V. coralliilyticus, the expression of TLR pathway members, TLR, MyD88, IRAK4, TRAF6, and IкB-α, were significantly upregulated (by 22.9-, 9.6-, 4.0-, 3.6-, and 3.9-fold, respectively) at 6 h. The cytokine-related gene IL-17 exhibited an increase of 6.3-fold and 10.5-fold at 3 h and 6 h, respectively. The apoptosis-related gene IAP1 was dramatically increased by 2.99-fold at 6 h. These results indicate that adult T. crocea could initiate the TLR pathway to resist V. coralliilyticus, which promotes the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-17 and leads to the activation of a series of outcomes, such as apoptosis. The response mechanism is related to the T. crocea immunoreaction stimulated by V. coralliilyticus, providing a theoretical basis for understanding T. crocea immune response mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3016055321,"The mechanisms of epileptic discharge generation and spread are not yet fully known. A recently proposed simple biophysical model of interictal and ictal discharges, Epileptor-2, reproduces well the main features of neuronal excitation and ionic dynamics during discharge generation. In order to distinguish between two hypothesized mechanisms of discharge propagation, we extend the model to the case of two-dimensional propagation along the cortical neural tissue. The first mechanism is based on extracellular potassium diffusion, and the second is the propagation of spikes and postsynaptic signals along axons and dendrites. Our simulations show that potassium diffusion is too slow to reproduce an experimentally observed speed of ictal wavefront propagation (tenths of mm/s). By contrast, the synaptic mechanism predicts well the speed and synchronization of the pre-ictal bursts before the ictal front and the afterdischarges in the ictal core. Though this fact diminishes the role of diffusion and electrodiffusion, the model nevertheless highlights the role of potassium extrusion during neuronal excitation, which provides a positive feedback that changes at the ictal wavefront the balance of excitation versus inhibition in favor of excitation. This finding may help to find a target for a treatment to prevent seizure propagation."

Exploiting genetic variations to create instrumental variables for observed height, we find that while OLS regressions yield that an additional centimeter in height is associated with a 10-13% increase in one's annual earnings, IV estimates reveal only an insubstantial causal effect of height. Further analyses suggest that the observed height premium is likely to pick up the impacts of several cognitive/noncognitive skills on earnings confounded in previous studies, such as mental health, risk preference, and personality factors. Our study is the first empirical study that employs genetic IVs in developing countries, and our results contribute to the recent debate on the mechanism of height premium."

Here, we report on the quasi-periodic movement of cells confined in stripe-shaped microlanes. We observe persistent polarized cell shapes and directed pole-to-pole motion within the microlanes. Cells depolarize at one end of a given microlane, followed by delayed repolarization towards the opposite end. We analyze cell motility via the spatial velocity distribution, the velocity frequency spectrum and the reversal time as a measure for depolarization and spontaneous repolarization of cells at the microlane ends. The frequent encounters of a boundary in the stripe geometry provides a robust framework for quantitative investigations of the cytoskeleton protrusion and repolarization dynamics. In a first advance to rigorously test physical models of cell migration, we find that the statistics of the cell migration is recapitulated by a Cellular Potts model with a minimal description of cytoskeleton dynamics. Using LifeAct-GFP transfected cells and microlanes with differently shaped ends, we show that the local deformation of the leading cell edge in response to the tip geometry can locally either amplify or quench actin polymerization, while leaving the average reversal times unaffected."

Radial alignment of MTs in the spherulites was confirmed by the optical properties of the spherulites observed using polarized optical microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Temperature and concentration of tubulins were found as important parameters to control the spherulite pattern formation of MTs where evaporation plays a significant role. The alignment of MTs was regulated reversibly by temperature induced polymerization and depolymerization of tubulins. The formation of the MTs patterns was also confirmed at the molecular level from the small angle X-ray measurements. This work provides a simple method for obtaining radially aligned arrays of MTs.

Objectives To explore attitudes and opinions about methadone and its potential role and current use in complex end-of-life pain. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 30) with physicians in specialized palliative care, transcribed and analyzed with conventional qualitative content analysis. Results According to the physicians, patients and relatives expressed unexpectedly few negative attitudes, not affecting methadone’s use as an analgesic. Complex pain in bone-metastatic cancer of the prostate, breast and kidney, as well as pancreatic cancer and sarcomas were recurrent suggestions of appropriate indications. Most of the informants stated that they applied a mechanism-based treatment and mainly prescribed low-dose methadone as an add-on to an existing opioid therapy to benefit from methadone´s proposed NMDA-receptor inhibiting properties, e.g. in cases with reduced opioid sensitivity. Despite its complex pharmacokinetics with a long half-life, most informants expressed defined strategies to avoid side-effects such as respiratory depression, especially when initiating treatment in the home-care setting. While many palliative care physicians expressed an overly enthusiastic attitude, others stressed the risks of overconfidence, low precision in use, and overlooked treatment options. Besides the obvious physical pain-relieving effects, they stated that effective pain relief could result in a reduced workload and emotional empowerment, both for physicians and staff. Conclusion Methadone, especially in the form of low-dose add-on to other opioids is widely advocated in Swedish specialized palliative care as a practical and safe method with rapid onset in complex pain situations at the end of life."
https://openalex.org/W3015568174,"A recent study found that approximately 1 in every 6 patients hospitalized for the 1st episode of syncope had an underlying pulmonary embolism (PE). As current guidelines do not strongly emphasize evaluation for PE in the workup of syncope, we hypothesize that there might be a higher rate of 30-day readmission due to untreated venous thromboembolism (VTE). The objective of this study is to measure the 30-day readmission rate due to VTE and identify predictors of 30-day readmission with VTE among syncope patients. We identified patients admitted with syncope with ICD9 diagnoses code 780.2 in the Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD-2013), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The 30-day readmission rate was calculated using methods described by HCUP. Logistic-regression was used to identify predictors of 30-day readmission with VTE. Discharge weights provided by HCUP were used to generate national estimates. In 2013, NRD included 207,339 eligible patients admitted with syncope. The prevalence rates of PE and DVT were 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively. At least one syncope associated condition was present in 60.9% of the patients. Among the patients who were not diagnosed with VTE during index admission for syncope (N = 188,015), 30-day readmission rate with VTE was 0.5% (0.2% with PE and 0.4% with DVT). In conclusion, low prevalence of VTE in patients with syncope and extremely low 30-day readmission rate with VTE argues against missed diagnoses of VTE in index admission for syncope. These results warrant further studies to determine clinical impact of work up for PE in syncope patients without risk factors."

Within the pathosystem, the transmission of infections via infested seed is of major concern. Both downy mildew pathogens of poppy; Peronospora meconopsidis and P. somniferi, are known contaminants of commercial seed stocks. Using seed naturally infested with these pathogens, the effect of physio-chemical seed treatments on seedling health and disease transmission were evaluated. Individual seed treatments were tested to determine optimal treatment parameters for each; including incubation time, temperature and treatment concentration. Optimised physiochemical treatments were then compared. The most effective treatment methods were seed washes in acidified electrolytic water (400 ppm hypochlorous acid for 5 min) and hypochlorite solution (2% NaOCI for 5 min). In seed to seedling transmission assays, these two treatments reduced transmission of P. somniferi by 88.8% and 74.61%, and P. meconopsidis by 93.3% and 100%, respectively. These methods are recommended for seed treatment of commercial opium poppy seed to assist in the control of the downy mildew diseases."

We evaluated the use of multiple pass depletion techniques of the post-emergent exuvia of Pteronarcys californica to estimate larval densities at ten sites in three Colorado rivers. Exuvia density was highly correlated with both final-instar larval density (R2 = 0.90) and total larval density (R2 = 0.88) and the multiple pass removal technique performed well. Exuvia surveys found P. californica at three low density sites where benthic sampling failed to detect it. At moderate and high density sites the exuvia surveys always produced lower density estimates than benthic surveys. Multiple pass depletion estimates of exuvia proved to be an accurate and efficient technique at estimating larval densities and provided an effective alternative for traditional benthic sampling when objectives are detecting and monitoring P. californica, especially at low density sites."
https://openalex.org/W3015764735,"Cell differentiation is a complex process orchestrated by sets of regulators precisely appearing at certain time points, resulting in regulatory cascades that affect the expression of broader sets of genes, ending up in the formation of different tissues and organ parts. The identification of stage-specific master regulators and the mechanism by which they activate each other is a key to understanding and controlling differentiation, particularly in the fields of tissue regeneration and organoid engineering. Here we present a workflow that combines a comprehensive general regulatory network based on binding site predictions with user-provided temporal gene expression data, to generate a a temporally connected series of stage-specific regulatory networks, which we call a temporal regulatory cascade (TRC). A TRC identifies those regulators that are unique for each time point, resulting in a cascade that shows the emergence of these regulators and regulatory interactions across time. The model was implemented in the form of a user-friendly, visual web-tool, that requires no expert knowledge in programming or statistics, making it directly usable for life scientists. In addition to generating TRCs the tool links multiple interactive visual workflows, in which a user can track and investigate further different regulators, target genes, and interactions, directing the tool along the way into biologically sensible results based on the given dataset. We applied the TRC model on two different expression datasets, one based on experiments conducted on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) undergoing differentiation into mature cardiomyocytes and the other based on the differentiation of H1-derived human neuronal precursor cells. The model was successful in identifying previously known and new potential key regulators, in addition to the particular time points with which these regulators are associated, in cardiac and neural development."
https://openalex.org/W3016149120,"Fault localization, a technique to fix and ensure the dependability of software, is rapidly becoming infeasible due to the increasing scale and complexity of multilingual programs. Compared to other fault localization techniques, slicing can directly narrow the range of the code which needed checking by abstracting a program into a reduced one by deleting irrelevant parts. Only minority slicing methods take into account the fact that the probability of different statements leading to failure is different. Moreover, no existing prioritized slicing techniques can work on multilingual programs. In this paper, we propose a new technique called weight prioritized slicing(WP-Slicing), an improved static slicing technique based on constraint logic programming, to help the programmer locate the fault quickly and precisely. WP-Slicing first converts the original program into logic facts. Then it extracts dependences from the facts, computes the static backward slice and calculates the statements' weight. Finally, WP-Slicing provides the slice in a suggested check sequence by weighted-sorting. By comparing it's slice time and locate effort with three pre-exsiting slicing techniques on five real world C projects, we prove that WP-Slicing can locate fault within less time and effort, which means WP-Slicing is more effectively."

One sample T-test, normality test and paired sample T-test methods for NOx concentration variation were conducted to determine the appropriate comparative means of dates under both dark and illuminated conditions. The difference of NOX concentration between dark and illuminated conditions was obtained to evaluate the photocatalytic removal efficiency. The results indicated that NO removal efficiency in laboratory and parking lots were 51.31% and 9.2%, respectively."
