https://openalex.org/W2002150942,"PALB2 interacts with BRCA2, and biallelic mutations in PALB2 (also known as FANCN), similar to biallelic BRCA2 mutations, cause Fanconi anemia. We identified monoallelic truncating PALB2 mutations in 10/923 individuals with familial breast cancer compared with 0/1,084 controls (P = 0.0004) and show that such mutations confer a 2.3-fold higher risk of breast cancer (95% confidence interval (c.i.) = 1.4-3.9, P = 0.0025). The results show that PALB2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene and further demonstrate the close relationship of the Fanconi anemia-DNA repair pathway and breast cancer predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W1964059126,"Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) is an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase that contributes to longevity in yeast. SIRT1, a mammalian Sir2 ortholog, deacetylates histones and various transcription factors, including p53, FOXO proteins, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. We found that its subcellular localization varied in different tissues of the adult mouse. Some subsets of neurons predominantly expressed SIRT1 in the cytoplasm, but ependymal cells expressed it in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. On the other hand, spermatocytes expressed SIRT1 only in the nucleus. Cardiomyocytes in the day 12.5 mouse embryo expressed SIRT1 exclusively in the nucleus, but in the adult heart, they expressed it in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. C2C12 myoblast cells expressed SIRT1 in the nucleus, but it localized to the cytoplasm after differentiation. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-hydroxykinase, strongly inhibited the nuclear localization of SIRT1 in undifferentiated C2C12 cells. In a heterokaryon assay, SIRT1 shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear exportation, inhibited this shuttling. Two nuclear localization signals and two nuclear export signals were identified by deletion and site-directed mutation analyses. Overexpressed nuclear (but not cytoplasmic or dominant-negative) SIRT1 enhanced the deacetylation of histone H3 in C2C12 cells. Moreover, only the nuclear form suppressed the apoptosis of C2C12 cells induced by antimycin A, an oxidative stressor. These findings indicate that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is a novel regulatory mechanism of SIRT1, which may participate in differentiation and in inhibition of cell death."

Maturation and activation of ENaC subunits involves furin-dependent cleavage of the ectodomain at two sites in the α subunit and at a single site within the γ subunit. We now report that the serine protease prostasin further activates ENaC by inducing cleavage of the γ subunit at a site distal to the furin cleavage site. Dual cleavage of the γ subunit is predicted to release a 43-amino acid peptide. Channels with a γ subunit lacking this 43-residue tract have increased activity due to a high open probability. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the fragment cleaved from the γ subunit is a reversible inhibitor of endogenous ENaCs in mouse cortical-collecting duct cells and in primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells. Our results suggest that multiple proteases cleave ENaC γ subunits to fully activate the channel.

These channels are composed of three homologous subunits, termed α, β, and γ. Each subunit has cytosolic amino and carboxyl termini and two membrane-spanning domains separated by a large ectodomain (1Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

We previously proposed that furin-dependent proteolysis of the α subunit activates ENaC by disassociating an inhibitory domain (αAsp-206–Arg-231) from its effector site within the channel complex (10Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

Endogenous proteases other than furin likely have a role in the processing and activation of ENaC. A number of serine proteases, referred to as “channel activating proteases,” have been identified that increase ENaC activity when co-expressed with ENaC in heterologous expression systems (12Rossier B.C.

Because prostasin has been shown to activate ENaC, and we have recently shown that cleavage of the α and γ subunits is necessary for “normal” channel gating, we examined whether prostasin cleaves ENaC subunits. We observed that prostasin activates ENaC by inducing cleavage of the γ subunit at a site distal to the previously identified furin cleavage site, resulting in an increased channel open probability. Channels with γ subunits that lack the 43-residue tract between the furin and prostasin cleavage sites also have a high open probability. A 43-mer peptide is putatively released from the γ subunit by furin- and prostasin-dependent cleavage, and a synthetic peptide (γ-43) representing this track is an inhibitor of Na+ channel activity in cortical collecting duct (CCD) and airway epithelia that express endogenous ENaCs. Vectors and Cell Culture—Wild type, carboxyl-terminal, and double epitope-tagged mouse ENaC subunit cDNAs were previously described (24Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A.

The γ subunit mutations were generated in pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen) using a standard two-step PCR method. A cDNA clone (IMAGE 3600399) encoding full-length mouse prostasin was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (+). MDCK type 1 cells were a gift from Barry M. Gumbiner (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) and were cultured as previously described (26Lavelle J.P. Negrete H.O. Poland P.A. Kinlough C.L. Meyers S.D. Hughey R.P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J.

Cortical collecting duct (CCDs) cells (mpkCCDcl4) cells were a gift from Alain Vandewalle (INSERM, Paris, France) and were cultured as previously described (27Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F.

Human airway epithelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (28Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 461-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Immunoblot Analysis of MDCK Cells—MDCK cells were transiently transfected with mouse ENaC cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The α and β subunits were carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged with Myc and FLAG, respectively. The γ subunit (wild type or mutant) had amino-terminal hemagglutinin and carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tags. Where indicated, mouse prostasin cDNA was co-transfected. The total amount of DNA transfected was held constant by co-transfection of a green fluorescent protein plasmid. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed, and the γ subunit was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted as described previously (24Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L.

Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins in Xenopus Oocytes—Biotinylation was performed essentially as described by Harris et al. (29Harris M. Firsov D. Vuagniaux G. Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All steps were performed on ice using ice-cold solutions. Twenty-four hours post-injection, oocytes (20–40 per group) were placed in an ice-cold modified Barth’s saline (MBS; 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, and 0.82 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) lacking antibiotics. After a 30-min incubation, oocytes were washed 4 times with MBS without antibiotics and two times with biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 9.5). Oocytes were then incubated in biotinylation buffer containing 1 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 15 min. Excess biotin reagent was quenched by two washes with quench buffer (192 mm glycine added to MBS) followed by a 5-min incubation in quench buffer. After two washes with MBS, oocytes were lysed by repeated pipetting in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% (v/v) Protease Inhibitor Mixture III (Pierce). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50μl of immunopure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) with end-over-end rotation. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and immunoblotted as previously described (24Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L.

Wild type α and β along with double-tagged γ mouse ENaC cRNAs (1 ng per subunit) were injected with or without 3 ng of mouse prostasin cRNA. Electrophysiological measurements were performed 24 h post-injection. The difference in measured current at –100 mV in the absence and presence of amiloride (10–20 μm) was used to identify ENaC-mediated currents. Single Channel Studies—Patch clamp experiments were performed as previously described (32Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4393-4401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Single channel currents were acquired at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz by a 4-pole low pass Bessel filter. For display and analysis, single channel currents were further filtered at 100–200 Hz with a Gaussian filter. Single channel experiments in oocytes were performed in the cell-attached configuration of patch clamp with identical bath and pipette solutions containing 110 mm LiCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.54 mm KCl, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The bath electrode consisted of an Ag-AgCl pellet connected to the bathing solution via an agar bridge made up in 200 mm NaCl. Liquid junction potentials were not corrected. Open probabilities were determined from recordings of at least 6 min in duration at an applied pipette potential of 60 mV. To estimate open probabilities, all point histograms were fit with Gaussian functions using pCLAMP 6 (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA). Peptides—Peptides were synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified by the peptide synthesis facility of the University of Pittsburgh’s Molecular Medicine Institute. The sequences of the peptides in single letter amino acid code were: γ cleavage product (γ-43), EAGSMRSTWEGTPPRFLNLIPLLVFNENEKGKARDFFTGRKRK; scrambled peptide, FKGFVGKEALREILTFWLRFNNTEMDSKPLRTRANPPSKGGRE. Both peptides were modified by amino-terminal acetylation and carboxyl-terminal amidation. Short Circuit Current Recordings—Cells cultured on permeable membrane supports and mounted in modified Costar Ussing chambers were continuously short-circuited by a voltage clamp amplifier (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA) as previously described by Butterworth et al. (33Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Significance comparisons between groups were performed with unpaired Student’s t tests unless otherwise indicated. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically different. IC50 data are presented as the mean with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and were estimated from normalized currents plotted as a function of the peptide concentration fitted with the following equation: y=b+(t−b)/(1+10(log IC50−x)n) (Eq. 1) where y is the response variable, x is the log of the concentration of peptide, n is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 is the concentration of peptide that provokes a response half way between base line (b) and maximum response (t). Fitting and statistical comparisons were performed with Sigmaplot 8.02 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), GraphPad 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and Clampfit 9.0 (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). We recently demonstrated that the α subunit of ENaC must be cleaved twice at two furin cleavage consensus sites to activate the channel (8Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q.

The γ subunit is cleaved once by furin at a site that aligns closely to the first α subunit furin site (Fig. 1). Carboxyl-terminal to the single γ subunit furin site is a tetrabasic tract (RKRK186) that does not fit the consensus cleavage sequence for furin (34Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4525-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This sequence may serve as a site for proteolysis by other serine proteases that cleave after basic residues. Prostasin is a serine protease that has been previously shown to activate ENaC when co-expressed in heterologous systems (13Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Gen.

Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether co-expression of ENaC and prostasin altered proteolysis of the γ subunit. ENaCs were expressed in MDCK cells with the γ subunit bearing a carboxyl-terminal V5 epitope tag. After cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and subsequent immunoblotting with an anti-V5 antibody, we observed both full-length (93 kDa) and furin-cleaved (75 kDa) γ subunit (Fig. 2A). When ENaCs were co-expressed with prostasin, an additional γ subunit species of 70 kDa was observed, consistent with cleavage at a site carboxyl-terminal to the furin cleavage site. When the RKRK186 tract in the γ subunit was mutated to QQQQ186 (γmut), only the full-length and 75 kDa fragments were observed both in the absence and presence of prostasin expression. These data suggest that prostasin induces cleavage of the γ subunit at the RKRK186 tract.FIGURE 2Prostasin co-expression activates ENaC by inducing cleavage of the γ subunit. A, extracts of MDCK cells transiently transfected with epitope-tagged ENaC and with (+) or without (–) prostasin were incubated overnight with anti-V5 antibody conjugated to agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for the V5-tagged γ subunit after SDS-PAGE. Note that co-expression of ENaC with prostasin produces a smaller fragment of the γ subunit (see the asterisk) that is absent for the R183Q/K184Q/R185Q/K186Q mutant (γmut). Numbers to the right of the gel represent the mobility of Bio-Rad Precision Plus protein standards in kDa. A representative immunoblot is shown (n = 3). B, Xenopus oocytes were co-injected with cRNAs encoding mouse αβγ or αβγmut ENaC with (+) or without (–) prostasin. Whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents were measured the following day at a clamp potential of –100 mV (n = 28–30). *, p < 0.005 compared withαβγ without prostasin (n = 28–30).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Co-expression of ENaC and prostasin led to a significant, 3-fold increase in whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in Xenopus oocytes compared with oocytes expressing ENaC alone (Fig. 2B). Expression of channels with the γ subunit R183Q/K184Q/R185Q/K186Q mutation led to a significant 45% reduction in whole cell Na+ currents compared with oocytes expressing wild type ENaCs. Furthermore, co-expression of this mutant ENaC with prostasin led to only a modest, but non-significant increase in Na+ currents when compared with oocytes expressing the mutant channels alone (p > 0.05). These results suggest that prostasin-induced cleavage at the RKRK186 site plays a major role in prostasin-dependent activation of ENaC. Previous reports based on a cell surface expression assay in Xenopus oocytes have inferred that prostasin induces activation of ENaC through an increase in single channel open probability (13Vuagniaux G.

In contrast to the observations of Adachi et al. (20Adachi M. Kitamura K. Miyoshi T. Narikiyo T. Iwashita K. Shiraishi N. Nonoguchi H. Tomita K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), channel open probability increased 89% from 0.46 ± 0.05 (n = 11) to 0.87 ± 0.04 (n = 7, p < 0.0001) when ENaC was co-expressed with prostasin (Fig. 3). Prostasin co-expression had no effect on unitary currents at an applied pipette potential of +60 mV (0.41 ± 0.01 pA versus 0.39 ± 0.01 pA, p = 0.33). We have recently reported that cleavage of ENaC at two sites within the α subunit activates the channel by releasing an inhibitory 26-mer peptide (10Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Pilewski J.M.

We, therefore, sought to determine whether the 43-mer tract in the γ subunit (Glu-144–Lys-186), predicted to be excised after co-expression with prostasin, also functions as an inhibitory domain. We first examined whether deletion of the 43-mer tract in the γ subunit would enhance channel activity. In addition to removing the tract, Arg-143 within the γ furin site was mutated to Ala to prevent furin-dependent cleavage. This mutant γR143A,Δ144–186 (γR/AΔ) was not cleaved when co-expressed with α and β subunits in MDCK cells (Fig. 4B). However, when this mutant was co-expressed with α and β subunits in oocytes, whole cell Na+ currents were 3.7-fold greater than currents recorded in oocytes expressing wild type αβγ (Fig. 4A). At a single channel level, the mutant channel was constitutively active, with an open probability of >0.95, compared with wild type channels that had an open probability of 0.37 ± 0.06 (Fig. 5). Unitary currents were not different between mutant (0.39 ± 0.03 pA) and wild type (0.40 ± 0.01) channels at an applied pipette potential of +60 mV (n = 4, p = 0.75).FIGURE 5Deletion of the tract γGlu-144–Lys-186 increases ENaC single channel open probability. Single channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached configuration of patch clamp from oocytes expressing wild type αβγ or αβγR143A,Δ144–186 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative single channel recordings of wild type αβγ (A) or αβγR143A,Δ144–186 (B) channels are shown. Amplitude histograms are presented at the right side of each recording. C indicates the closed state. C, open probabilities were statistically different in oocytes expressing wild type αβγ and αβγR143A,Δ144–186 channels (p < 0.005, unpaired Student’s t test with Welch correction, n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results suggest that cleavage of the γ subunit by furin and prostasin is required to release an inhibitory domain. If this hypothesis is correct, mutation of the γ furin site to block furin cleavage should prevent prostasin-dependent activation of the channel. Indeed, we observed that αβγR143A, a mutant that lacks furin-dependent proteolysis of the γ subunit (8Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P.

We next examined whether a synthetic peptide (γ-43), corresponding to the 43-mer tract excised from the γ subunit, inhibited endogenous ENaC in epithelia. When added to the apical chamber of filter grown mouse CCD cells, γ-43 (3 μm) rapidly inhibited short circuit currents (Fig. 7A). Peptide-dependent inhibition of the channel was reversible as the current was restored after washout of γ-43. This peptide inhibited short circuit currents in mouse CCD cells and in primary cultures of human airway cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 3.2 μm (CI, 2.7–3.8 μm) and 2.0 μm (CI, 1.9–2.2 μm), respectively (Fig. 7, B and C) (n = 8–9). In contrast, a minimal effect on short circuit current was observed upon the addition of a control, scrambled peptide. These data suggest that the 43-mer tract excised by furin- and prostasin-dependent proteolysis functions as an endogenous inhibitor of ENaC activity prior to γ subunit cleavage. We recently reported that the inhibitory 26-mer peptide cleaved from the α subunit does not appear to interact with the amiloride binding site, based on its lack of competiti"
https://openalex.org/W2152221138,"Pluripotent mesenchymal cells form a population of precursors to a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts and adipocytes. Aging tilts the balance in favor of adipocyte differentiation at the expense of osteoblast differentiation, resulting in reduced bone formation and osteopenic disorders, including osteoporosis, in humans and animals. Understanding the mechanisms involved in causing this apparent shift in differentiation and identifying factors that stimulate osteoblast formation while inhibiting adipogenesis are of great therapeutic interest. In this study we report that specific, naturally occurring oxysterols, previously shown to direct pluripotent mesenchymal cells toward an osteoblast lineage, exert their osteoinductive effects through activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway. This was demonstrated by 1) oxysterol-induced expression of the Hh target genes Gli-1 and Patched, 2) oxysterol-induced activation of a luciferase reporter driven by a multimerized Gli-responsive element, 3) inhibition of oxysterol effects by the hedgehog pathway inhibitor, cyclopamine, and 4) unresponsiveness of Smoothened-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts to oxysterols. Using Patched-/- cells that possess high baseline Gli activity, we found that oxysterols did not dramatically shift the IC50 concentration of cyclopamine needed to inhibit Gli activity in these cells. Furthermore, binding studies showed that oxysterols did not compete with fluorescently labeled cyclopamine, BODIPY-cyclopamine, for direct binding to Smoothened. These findings demonstrate that oxysterols stimulate hedgehog pathway activity by indirectly activating the seven-transmembrane pathway component Smoothened. Osteoinductive oxysterols are, therefore, novel activators of the hedgehog pathway in pluripotent mesenchymal cells, and they may be important modulators of this critical signaling pathway that regulates numerous developmental and post-developmental processes."

Herein, we addressed the possibility that TRPC signals RhoA activation and thereby contributes in actinomyosin-mediated endothelial cell contraction and increased endothelial permeability. Transduction of a constitutively active Gαq mutant in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells induced RhoA activity. Preventing the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration by the inhibitor of Gαq or phospholipase C and the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM, abrogated thrombin-induced RhoA activation. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ also inhibited RhoA activation, indicating the requirement of Ca2+ entry in the response. RhoA activation could not be ascribed to storeoperated Ca2+ (SOC) entry because SOC entry induced with thapsigargin or small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of TRPC1 expression, the predominant SOC channel in these endothelial cells, failed to alter RhoA activity. However, activation of receptor-operated Ca2+ entry by oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, the membrane permeable analogue of the Gαq-phospholipase C product diacylglycerol, induced RhoA activity. Receptor-operated Ca2+ activation was mediated by TRPC6 because small interfering RNA-induced TRPC6 knockdown significantly reduced Ca2+ entry. TRPC6 knockdown also prevented RhoA activation, myosin light chain phosphorylation, and actin stress fiber formation as well as inter-endothelial junctional gap formation in response to either oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol or thrombin. TRPC6-mediated RhoA activity was shown to be dependent on PKCα activation.

TRPC6 (M-004192-02-0005 NM_004621), TRPC1 (M-004191-01-0005 NM_003304), and control siRNA (D-001206-13-20) sequences were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Anti-RhoA, anti-TRPC1, anti-TRPC6, anti-Gαq, anti-actin, and anti-PKCα antibodies and siRNA transfection reagent were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA), whereas phospho-PKCα antibody was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Rho activity was determined using GST-rhotekin-Rho binding domain beads from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Anti-phospho-MLC antibody was a gift from Dr. Jerold Turner (University of Chicago).Endothelial Cell Culture—HPAEC were cultured in T-75 flasks coated with 0.1% gelatin in endothelial growth medium 2 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air until confluent. Cells from each primary flask were detached with 0.025% trypsin/EDTA and plated on either 60-mm dishes for the Rho pulldown assay or coverslips for calcium and confocal imaging studies. In all experiments, HPAEC between passages 6 and 8 were used.Transfection of siRNA or cDNA—siRNA or cDNA were transduced into cells by electroporation or using transfection reagents. HPAE cells grown up to 70% confluency were trypsinized, mixed with 2.8 μg of siRNA or 3.0 μg of cDNA along with 100 μl of nucleofector solution. Cells were rapidly electroporated by the Amaxa nucleofector device using the manufacturer’s recommended program (S-05) dedicated for human coronary arterial endothelial cells. The cells were removed, mixed in endothelial growth medium 2, and plated on either 60-mm dishes. HPAE cells plated on coverslips or gold-plated 10-well electrodes were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using transfection reagent following manufacturer’s protocol.Western Blotting—HPAEC monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS sample buffer. Proteins from each lysate was separated by electrophoresis on a 7 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies (17Mehta D.

Ahmmed G.U. Paria B.C. Holinstat M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol.

Cells were washed three to four times with Hank’s balanced salt solution and imaged using an Attofluor Ratio Vision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Inc., Rockville, MD) equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope and F-Fluor ×40 1.3-numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Regions of interests in individual cells were marked and excited at 334 and 380 nm with emission at 520 nm. The 340/380 nm excitation ratio, which increases as a function of intracellular Ca2+, was captured at 5-s intervals.RhoA Activity—RhoA activity was measured using the GST-rhotekin-Rho binding domain that specifically pulls down activated RhoA as described (4Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Mehta D. Ahmmed G.U. Paria B.C. Holinstat M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.

HPAE cell monolayers were stimulated for the indicated times with 50 nm thrombin, 100 μm OAG, or 2 μm thapsigargin. Cells were quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min and equal volumes of cell lysates were incubated with GST-Rho binding domain beads (15 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, and 40 mm NaCl), and bound RhoA was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples from the beads and total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-RhoA antibody.PKCα Translocation—HPAEC monolayer stimulated with 50 nm thrombin for the indicated times were quickly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and cells were scrapped using Tris buffer (pH 7.5 containing in mm; 10 Tris, 1 MgCl2, 5 EDTA, 10 EGTA, 1 Na3VO4) and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were sonicated for 10 s and an aliquot of the lysates was saved for determination of total PKCα. Lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate cytosolic fraction. The pellets were suspended in the above lysis buffer plus 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to separate membrane fractions as described (27Javaid K. Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Frey R.S. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates, cytosol, and membrane fractions were immunoblotted with PKCα antibody to determine PKCα translocation in the membrane fraction following thrombin stimulation.PKCα Activity—We used GST-GDI-1 fusion protein as a substrate to assess PKCα activity (4Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, HPAEC monolayer stimulated with 50 nm thrombin for 5 min was quickly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using immunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C at 14,000 × g for 10 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-rabbit polyclonal PKCα antibody. PKCα immunocomplexes were used to phosphorylate GST-GDI-1 fusion protein.Immunofluorescence—Cells were stimulated with 50 nm thrombin for the indicated times, rinsed quickly with ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Hank’s balanced salt solution followed by incubation for 40 min with 1% ovalbumin. Cells were then incubated with anti-PKCα antibody followed by incubation with Alexa-labeled secondary antibody for another 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with Hank’s balanced salt solution and mounted with anti-fade media. For determining actin stress fiber formation, cells were rinsed and incubated with Alexa-labeled phalloidin to label actin stress fibers. Cells were viewed using a 63× 1.2 NA objective and appropriate filters using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope.MLC Phosphorylation—HPAEC monolayer was stimulated with thrombin for the indicated times. Endothelial cells were scraped off and mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and Western blotted with antibodies for phosphorylated-MLC or pan-MLC antibodies to determine MLC phosphorylation.Transendothelial Resistance Measurement—The time course of endothelial cell retraction in real time, a measure of increased endothelial permeability, was measured according to the procedure described previously (4Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Two-tailed Student’s t test and one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test were used for statistical comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSActivation of Gαq-PLC Pathway Induces RhoA Activity—Stimulation of PAR-1 receptor by thrombin increases intracellular Ca2+ by the Gαq-PLC pathway (11Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Paria B.C. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Ahmmed G.U. Malik A.B. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we sought to determine the contribution of Gαq and the PLC-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ in thrombin-induced RhoA activation. We transduced the constitutively active Gαq mutant in endothelial cells and determined RhoA activity using rhotekin-bound fusion proteins. HPAEC transducing the active mutant of Gαq showed a 3.8 ± 0.4-fold increase in RhoA activity (Fig. 1A)(p < 0.05). To corroborate these findings, we inhibited Gαq function using RGS2, which predominantly increases the intrinsic rate of Gαq to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, thereby inhibiting Gαq function (28Heximer S.P. Knutsen R.H. Sun X. Kaltenbronn K.M. Rhee M.H. Peng N. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Penninger J.M. Muslin A.J. Steinberg T.H. Wyss J.M. Mecham R.P. Blumer K.J. J. Clin.

A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We observed that expression of RGS2 inhibited RhoA activation in response to thrombin (Fig. 1, B and G)(p < 0.05). Next, we pretreated HPAEC with U73122, an inhibitor of PLC (31Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar), to assess the requirement of PLC activity in thrombin-induced activation of RhoA. We observed that U73122 prevented RhoA activation in response to thrombin (Fig. 1, C and G)(p < 0.05). To determine whether the thrombin-activated increase in intracellular Ca2+ and RhoA activity is causally related, intracellular Ca2+ was chelated with the membrane permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-2AM. We observed that thrombin failed to induce RhoA activation in BAPTA-pretreated cells (Fig. 1, D and G) (p < 0.05). Simultaneous measurement of intracellular Ca2+ using Fura 2-AM confirmed that these interventions significantly suppressed thrombin-induced intracellular Ca2+ rise (Fig. 1E). In other studies, we depleted extracellular Ca2+ to assess the contribution of intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry in signaling RhoA activity. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, thrombin-induced increase in RhoA activity was significantly reduced in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (p < 0.05). These findings indicated that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ induced by the Gαq-PLC pathway mediated Ca2+ entry contributed to RhoA activation.Receptor-operated Ca2+ Entry Induces RhoA Activation—Gαq upon activation with thrombin stimulates PLC, which in turn activates Ca2+ entry through SOC and ROC channels (11Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Paria B.C. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 39: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Ahmmed G.U. Malik A.B. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the role of Ca2+ entry mediated by SOC and ROC channels in inducing RhoA activation in response to thrombin. We used thapsigargin because it activates SOC channels independently of ligand-receptor-G protein-coupled receptors (12Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin increased intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2A); however, it failed to induce RhoA activation (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating SOC channels are not sufficient to activate RhoA. To determine the role of ROC channels, we used OAG, a membrane-permeable analogue of DAG, known to activate ROC channels (13Yao X. Garland C.J. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14Ahmmed G.U. Malik A.B. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). OAG in a dose-dependent manner induced sustained Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells (Fig. 3A). We also observed that OAG significantly increased RhoA activity, a response sustained up to 20 min (Fig. 3, B and C). OAG failed to induce Ca2+ entry (Fig. 3A) as well as RhoA activation (Fig. 3D) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that OAG increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and RhoA activity by activating ROC channels and does not require ER store depletion. To address the possibility that OAG effects on Ca2+ entry are the result of PKCα activation by OAG, we overexpressed the dominant negative (dn) mutant of PKCα by infecting endothelia"
https://openalex.org/W1970915918,"Functional interleuin-8 (IL-8) receptors (IL-8RA and IL-8RB: CXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively) have been described in human, monkey, dog, rabbit, and guinea pig. Although three IL-8R homologues have been found in rat, only one of these, rat CXCR2, appears to be functional based on responsiveness to ligands. Similarly, CXC chemokines induce biological responses through the murine homolog of CXCR2, but the identification of functional rodent CXCR1 homologues has remained elusive. We have identified and characterized the mouse CXCR1 homologue (mCXCR1). Murine CXCR1 shares 68 and 88% amino acid identity with its human and rat counterparts, respectively. Similar to the tissue distribution pattern of rat CXCR1, we found murine CXCR1 mRNA expression predominantly in lung, stomach, bone marrow, and leukocyte-rich tissues. In contrast to previous reports, we determined that mCXCR1 is a functional receptor. We show predominant engagement of this receptor by mouse GCP-2/CXCL6, human GCP-2, and IL-8/CXCL8 by binding, stimulation of GTPγS exchange, and chemotaxis of mCXCR1-transfected cells. Furthermore, murine CXCR1 is not responsive to the human CXCR2 ligands ENA-78/CXCL5, NAP-2/CXCL7, GRO-α, -β, -γ/CXCL1–3, or rat CINC-1–3. In addition, we show concomitant elevation of mCXCR1 and its proposed major ligand, GCP-2, positively correlated with paw swelling in murine collagen-induced arthritis. This report represents the first description of a functional CXCR1-like receptor in rodents.

This report represents the first description of a functional CXCR1-like receptor in rodents. Chemokines and chemokine receptors are well preserved through various mammalian species (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nomiyama H. Egami K. Tanase S. Miura R.

However, a few animal chemokines (e.g. regakine-1 and lungkine) (3Struyf S. Proost P. Lenaerts J.P. Stoops G. Wuyts A. Van Damme J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) exist for which a homologue has not yet been identified and might indeed be absent in humans. Reciprocally, homologues of some human chemokines, e.g. IL-8 3The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; IL-8R, IL-8 receptor; CIA, collagen-induced arthritis; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; m, murine; h, human; SPA, scintillation proximity assay; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; MPO, myeloperoxidase; MIP-2, macrophage inflammatory protein-2; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2./CXCL8 and pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL18 are probably missing in specific rodents, e.g. mice. Determination of the contribution of chemokines to pathology using animal models of inflammation is hampered by this fact. Hence, murine models of inflammatory disease have not been considered fully representative or equivalent to human disease with respect to evaluation of neutrophil-mediated inflammation induced by IL-8/CXCL8. However, other potent neutrophil chemoattractants exist in the mouse, such as GCP-2, KC/GROα, MIP-2α/GROβ, and MIP-2β/GROγ. Thus, it is assumed that neutrophil migration in the mouse is mediated by these chemokines in the place of IL-8/CXCL8. Disparity between human and rodent systems is further implied by the presence of two functional human IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2 (4Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 5Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In the human system, IL-8/CXCL8 and GCP-2/CXCL6 signal through both CXCR1 and CXCR2, whereas the other ELR+ CXC chemokines are agonists only for CXCR2 (6Wuyts A. Van Osselaer N. Haelens A. Samson I. Herdewijn P. Ben-Baruch A. Oppenheim J.J. Proost P. Van Damme J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2716-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Absence of IL-8 in the mouse system may suggest a concordant absence of one of the IL-8-specific receptors, e.g. CXCR1 as rodent GCP-2 and GRO-α, -β, and -γ counterparts may still mediate neutrophil chemotactic effects through CXCR2. Rat homologues of both CXCR1- and CXCR2-like receptors have previously been identified by molecular cloning and sequence identity (7Dunstan C.A. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Xia Y. Feng L. Harrison J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32770-32776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Activation of the proposed rat CXCR2 was confirmed by MIP-2-induced Ca2+ flux. However, the lack of detectable response to either MIP-2 or KC/CINC ligand by the second rat IL-8 receptor homologue suggested that it was probably a nonfunctional receptor. To date, only one IL-8 receptor has been identified and functionally characterized in the mouse (8Bozic C.R. Gerard N.P. von Uexkull-Guldenband C. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Conklyn M.J. Breslow R.

Despite its high potency on murine neutrophils, hIL-8/CXCL8 was a poor agonist for the mouse IL-8R. This suggests that this mouse IL-8 type B receptor (8Bozic C.R. Gerard N.P. von Uexkull-Guldenband C. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Conklyn M.J. Breslow R. Showell H.J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29355-29358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was likely the mouse homologue of CXCR2, and another functional murine CXCR1 (mCXCR1) remained to be found. Conflicting evidence surrounded the potential existence of a second, as yet undefined mIL-8R that would represent mCXCR1. Speculation around such a receptor comes from detection of a second, albeit weaker band by Southern blot analysis when probing with the murine IL-8R sequence (8Bozic C.R. Gerard N.P. von Uexkull-Guldenband C. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Conklyn M.J. Breslow R. Showell H.J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29355-29358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a second report suggested that only one mIL-8R exists, as based on Southern analysis with mouse genomic DNA (10Harada A. Kuno K. Nomura H. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Matsushima K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, targeted gene disruption of mouse IL-8RB resulted in loss of neutrophil chemotactic response and intracellular calcium flux to mMIP-2 and hIL-8/CXCL8 (11Cacalano G. Lee J. Kikly K. Ryan A.M. Pitts-Meek S. Hultgren B. Wood W.I. Moore M.W. Science. 1994; 265: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Cacalano G. Camerato T. Toy K. Moore M.W. Wood W.I. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2158-2164PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that mCXCR2 is the primary (or only) chemokine receptor for these ligands on mouse neutrophils. Recently, two different groups described the cloning and characterization of mCXCR1 (13Fu W. Zhang Y. Zhang J. Chen W.F. Cytokine. 2005; 31: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Moepps B. Nuesseler E. Braun M. Gierschik P. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 897-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The studies established that mCXCR1 mRNA was expressed in bone marrow, peripheral mononuclear cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and certain lymphoid cell lines. However, neither group successfully identified cognate ligand(s) for mCXCR1, although many of the known CXCR1/CXCR2 ligands were tested. As a result, it was proposed that mCXCR1 was activated by a hitherto unknown CXC chemokine (14Moepps B. Nuesseler E. Braun M. Gierschik P. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 897-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine definitively whether the CXCR1 homologue, encoded in the murine genome, is a functional receptor, as determined by responsiveness to autologous and heterologous IL-8R ligands. The studies presented herein identify and characterize the murine homologue of CXCR1 using ligand binding assays, GTPγS exchange, and chemotaxis assays with BaF3 cells transfected to express mCXCR1. In contrast to what has been described with murine CXCR1, mCXCR1 is a functional receptor, specifically activated by mGCP-2, hGCP-2/CXCL6, and hIL-8/CXCL8. Furthermore, we show elevated expression of mCXCR1 and corresponding murine ligands GCP-2, KC, and MIP-2 during chronic inflammation in murine collagen induced arthritis (mCIA). We propose that this receptor is the functional murine homologue of hCXCR1. Chemical Reagents—Chemokines were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN).

Cloning of Mouse CXCR1 Gene—A BLASTN search of murine expressed sequence tags was conducted using the cDNA sequence of human CXCR1. A murine cDNA sequence corresponding to human CXCR1 was identified. The predicted murine mRNA sequence was derived from the genomic DNA sequence. Using this sequence, we designed PCR primers spanning the whole length of the open reading frame, forward 5′-ATG GCC GAG GCT GAA TAT TTC-3′, and reverse 5′-TTA ATA AAT AGC GGT GAG AGA-3′, that were used to amplify the full-length cDNA from a mouse BALB/c lung cDNA library.

The unique ScaI site in the plasmid backbone was used to linearize the vector. Mouse CXCR2 was PCR-amplified from NIH 3T3 cell genomic DNA using primers GCA TGG TAC CTC AAA GAT GGG AGA ATT C and CGA TCT CGA GGG GCC ACC GTT TAG G. The product was cut with KpnI (5′) and XhoI (3′) and ligated into pBS SK+. The cDNA were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pME18Sneo, a derivative of the SRα expression vector (17Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells were transfected by electroporation and a stable population selected by resistance to G418 (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen). Clonal cell lines expressing mCXCR1 were then established by limiting dilution of stable transfectants. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Surface mCXCR1 and mCXCR2 Expression—Expression of surface receptor expression was measured by flow cytometry. Cells were collected and centrifuged at 400 × g 5 min at 4 °C. Following blocking with normal mouse serum (Sigma), cells were stained with 10 ng of biotinylated M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) followed by strepavidin-PE (BD Pharmingen). Cells were then analyzed on the BD-FACScan (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain View, CA) using CellQuest software. Cell Membrane Preparation—Ba/F3-mCXCR1 and Ba/F3-mCXCR2 membranes were prepared as previously described (18Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, incubated in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.6) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice. The cells were then lysed with a Dounce homogenizer using stirrer type RZR3 Polytron homogenizer (Caframo, Wiarton, Ontario, Canada) with 12 strokes at 900 rpm. The intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell membranes in the supernatant were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were then resuspended in glygly buffer (20 mm glycylglycine, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.2), aliquoted, quick frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration in membrane preparations was determined using the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS Exchange Assay—Guanosine 5′-[γ-35S]triphospate ([35S]GTPγS, triethylammonium salt, specific activity = 1250 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) exchange was measured using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) as previously described (20Cox M.A. Jenh C.H.

For each assay point, 2–4 μg of membrane was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 300 μg of wheat germ agglutinin-coated SPA beads (WGA-SPA, Amersham Biosciences) in SPA binding buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.002% NaN3, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). The beads and membranes were transferred to a 96-well Isoplate (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) and incubated with 1 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate in the presence or absence of various chemokines for 60 min at room temperature. The incubation was continued for another 60 min following the addition of 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS. Membrane-bound [35S]GTPγS was measured using a 1450 Microbeta Trilux counter (Wallac). Radioligand Binding Assay—Carrier-free 125I-Il-8/hCXCL8 (specific activity = 2200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Radioligand competition and saturation binding assays were done using SPA technology (as described above). Membranes (10 μg per assay point) in SPA binding buffer were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 800 μg of WGA-SPA, transferred to a 96-well Isoplate, and further incubated at room temperature with the indicated concentrations of 125I-hIL8/CXCL8 and chemokines for 1–6 h. Ligand affinities from competition bindings were calculated from binding IC50 using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (21Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12360) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis—The assays were performed as previously described (22Chou C.C. Fine J.S. Pugliese-Sivo C. Gonsiorek W.

Cells were allowed to migrate toward the indicated concentrations of chemokines for 1.5 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) chamber. Cell numbers were quantitated using a CellTiter-Glo Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemotaxis is expressed as a percentage of total cells. Quantitative PCR Analysis—RNA from various tissues and immune cells were extracted using the TRI reagent RNA isolation kit from MRC, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH) following specifications from the manufacturer. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using random hexamers (Promega) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR analysis (TaqMan) was performed on an ABI 7700 (Applied Biosystems) sequence detection instrument following the manufacturer's instructions. For TaqMan analysis, 25 ng of cDNA was used together with primers at 0.9 μm final concentration, and a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled diagnostic probe at a final concentration of 0.25 μm. Primers/probes sequences were designed using the Primers Express software version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems) as shown in Table 1. Ribosomal RNA primers/probe (PE Applied Biosystems) were used as an internal control. Quantitative PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min. A plasmid containing the mouse CXCR1 gene was used as a standard, ranging from 100 pg to 0.1 fg.

Each 20-μl reaction contained 2× SYBR Green mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 50 ng of cDNA, and 500 nm of each primer. Ubiquitin was used as an internal control. Two independent primer sets were used to confirm specificity (Table 1). CIA—Murine CIA was established as previously described (23Campbell I.K. Hamilton J.A. Wicks I.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1568-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12-week-old male B10.RIII mice (Jackson Laboratories) were immunized intradermally at five sites with bovine type II collagen (Elastin Products, Owensville, MO) emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant. Complete Freund's adjuvant was comprised of a mixture of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Difco) and heat-killed, freeze-dried Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food, Surrey, England). Each mouse received 300 μg/ml bovine type II collagen and 0.5 mg/ml complete Freund's adjuvant. Mice were boosted intraperitoneally with 100 μg of bovine type II collagen on day 21. Disease incidence and disease score were monitored for 43 days. Mice were euthanized at time points as indicated. RNA was isolated from whole individual paws using Tri reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of CXCR1 and CXCR2 mRNA was determined as described above. Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression analysis of the data and calculation of EC50 and Ki was performed using Prism 2.0c (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA.). Analysis of CXCR1 and CXCR2 mRNA expression was conducted using Student's t test. Results were considered significant where p < 0.05. Identification of the Mouse Homologue of the Human CXCR1 Gene—The mouse CXCR1 gene was cloned from a BALB/c lung cDNA library. The gene has an open reading frame of 1056 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 352 amino acids (Fig. 1). Sequencing analysis showed that the cloned murine CXCR1 gene matched the predicted sequence. As summarized in Table 2, the murine CXCR1 gene is 88 and 68% homologous to the rat (accession P70612) and human (accession P25024) CXCR1 genes, respectively. The sequence isolated herein matched 100% mouse genomic sequence on chromosome 1 position from 75759265 to 75760320. Fig. 1 shows the comparison between mouse, rat, and human CXCR1 proteins. Boxed regions indicate areas of amino acid identity. The seven putative transmembrane domains common to this class of receptors are conserved in the murine sequence, as indicated by hatched lines. Similar to human and rat CXCR1, murine CXCR1 protein shows conservation of nine cysteine residues, and an abundance of acidic residues at the N-terminal, features common to many chemokine receptors.TABLE 2Sequence alignment of the mCXCR1 gene sequence with that of rat and human CXCR1 and CXCR2% IdentityRat CXCR1Human CXCR1Rat CXCR2Human CXCR2Mouse CXCR2%Mouse CXCR18868676966Rat CXCR170688267Human CXCR1728068Rat CXCR27186Human CXCR271 Open table in a new tab Ligand Identification—Chemokine activation of mCXCR1 was initially assessed using GTPγS exchange in membranes from a stable clonal Ba/F3-mCXCR1 cell line. Membranes were incubated with 1 μm GDP, 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, and up to 1 μm of various human and rodent chemokines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only mGCP-2, hGCP-2/CXCL6, and hIL-8/CXCL8 stimulated [35S]GTPγS exchange (Fig. 2). The CXC chemokines lungkine, mBRAK, hGRO-α/CXCL1 (data not shown), hGRO-β/CXCL2, GRO-β-(39–107), hGRO-γ/CXCL3, hENA-78/CXCL5, hNAP-2/CXCL7, rCINC-3, and rCINC-1 had no measurable affect. Interestingly, the mCXCR2 ligands, mKC and mMIP-2, were also inactive in stimulating [35S]GTPγS exchange in mCXCR1 membranes (data not shown), although both of these chemokines were potent agonists in parallel [35S]GTPγS assays with Ba/F3 cells transfected to express mCXCR2 (Ba/F3-mCXCR2, Fig. 3). Based on these data, we assessed the potency of hIL-8/CXCL8 (77 and 72 amino acids), mGCP-2, hGCP-2/CXCL6, and their truncated isoforms, mGCP-2-(9–78) and hGCP-2-(9–77). As shown in Fig. 4, mGCP-2 was less potent than was mGCP-2-(9–78), whereas hGCP-2-(9–77) was more potent than both forms of hIL-8/CXCL8 or mGCP-2.FIGURE 3Effect of mMIP-2, mKC, and mGCP-2 on [35S]GTPγS exchange in Ba/F-mCXCR2 membranes. Membranes (2 μg/well) from Ba/F-mCXCR2 cells were incubated in binding buffer containing 1 μm GDP with 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS with the indicated concentrations of mGCP2, mMIP-2, or mKC. After 60 min at room temperature, the incubations were continued for another 60 min following the addition of 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS.

As can be seen in Fig. 5, the cells migrated toward mGCP-2-(9–78) with a typical bell-shaped chemotaxis dose curve. Parental Ba/F3 cells were unresponsive while both parental and transfected cells migrated toward hSDF-1α/CXCL12 through mCXCR4, which is endogenously expressed in Ba/F3 cells (inset, Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished the chemotaxis of transfectants to mGCP-2-(9–78) (Fig. 5B) or parental Ba/F3 cells to hSDF-1α/CXCL12 (Fig. 5B, inset). Taken together, these data show that mCXCR1 is a functional receptor for mGCP-2 via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. To facilitate more extensive study of mCXCR1 functionality, we selected higher expressing clonal cell lines from the non-clonal Ba/F-mCXCR1 cells based on surface expression of the FLAG-tagged receptor. Of the higher expressing lines (data not shown), clone #9 was selected to assess the chemotactic activity of the chemokines identified as mCXCR1 agonists in GTPγS exchange assays (Fig. 4). As can be seen in the representative experiments shown in Fig. 6, Ba/F-mCXCR1(#9) cells migrated most efficiently to the naturally occurring truncated variants hGCP-2-(9–77) and hGCP-2-(3–77). Full-length hGCP-2-(1–77) and hIL-8/CXCL8-(6–77) were as efficacious as the trun-cated hGCP-2/CXCL6 ligands but somewhat less potent. Interestingly, all the aforementioned human chemokines were more potent than full-length mouse GCP-2. However, consistent with the hGCP-2 data, mGCP-2-(9–78) was more potent than full-length mGCP-2. In agreement with the [35S]GTPγS data (Fig. 4), hGCP-2-(3–77) and hGCP-2-(9–77) were both more potent than mGCP-2-(9–78) (Fig. 6B). Chemokine Binding Affinity for mCXCR1—Saturation binding analysis showed that mCXCR1 bound 125I-hIL-8/CXCL8 with relatively low affinity (Kd ∼ 10 nm, data not shown). We measured the chemokine affinity by competition binding analyses in Ba/F-mCXCR1 membranes using 200 pm 125I-hIL-8/CXCL8 and SPA-WGA beads (Fig. 7 and Table 3). The affinity of the chemokines for mCXCR1 reflected their potency in chemotaxis and GTPγS exchange such that hGCP-2-(9–77) bound with the highest affinity while mMIP-2 and mKC bound with the lowest affinity.TABLE 3Effect of chemokines on 125I-IL-8/CXCL8 binding in Ba/F3-mCXCR1 membranesChemokineKiaKi ± S.E.

Cytokine. 2005; 31: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we found mCXCR1 was highly expressed (>300 RNA molecules/25 ng of cDNA) in lung (Fig. 8). Mouse CXCR1 mRNA was also relatively high in placenta, bone marrow, and testes, whereas weaker expression (>50 RNA molecules/25 ng of cDNA) was observed in mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes (Fig. 8, MLN and PLN), spleen, and stomach. No detectable expression was found in total brain, small intestine, liver, and pituitary gland. We next quantified mCXCR1 and mCXCR2 mRNA expression in various mouse hemopoietic cell lines, including T cell lymphomas (BW5147, 32D, and EL4), B cell lymphomas (L1.2 and A20), mouse monocytic RAW cells, and bone marrow-derived immature dendritic JAWSII cells (Fig. 8B). Spleen (mostly lymphocytes and some neutrophils) and bone marrow (undifferentiated myeloid cells and neutrophils) were used as an internal positive control for receptor message. Of the T cell lines tested, only EL4 cells expressed appreciable amounts of both mCXCR1 and mCXCR2 mRNA (30–35 RNA molecules/25 ng of cDNA), although mCXCR2 mRNA was readily detectable in BW5147 cells (∼900 RNA molecules/25 ng"

We have investigated the hypothesis that selective degradation of anti-apoptotic regulatory protein(s) is responsible for apoptosis resulting from translation inhibition. Induction of apoptosis by cycloheximide was detected within 2–4 h and blocked by proteasome inhibitors, indicating that degradation of short-lived protein(s) was required. Caspase inhibition and overexpression of Bcl-xL blocked cycloheximide-induced apoptosis. In addition, cycloheximide induced rapid activation of Bak and Bax, which required proteasome activity. Mcl-1 was degraded by the proteasome with a half-life of ∼30 min following inhibition of protein synthesis, preceding Bak/Bax activation and the onset of apoptosis. Overexpression of Mcl-1 blocked apoptosis induced by cycloheximide, whereas RNA interference knockdown of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis. Knockdown of Bim and Bak, downstream targets of Mcl-1, inhibited cycloheximide-induced apoptosis, as did knockdown of Bax. Apoptosis resulting from inhibition of translation thus involves the rapid degradation of Mcl-1, leading to activation of Bim, Bak, and Bax. Because of its rapid turnover, Mcl-1 may serve as a convergence point for signals that affect global translation, coupling translation to cell survival and the apoptotic machinery.

Because of its rapid turnover, Mcl-1 may serve as a convergence point for signals that affect global translation, coupling translation to cell survival and the apoptotic machinery. Most signals that control survival of mammalian cells modulate the activity of Bcl-2 family members, which regulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3991) Google Scholar, 2Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, maintain cell survival by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bak and Bax through protein-protein interactions. Bak and Bax are typically activated by a second set of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins called BH3-only proteins that associate with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins through interactions that displace and activate Bak and Bax. Once activated, Bak and Bax permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors that induce caspase activation and cell death.Signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis can directly modify Bcl-2 family proteins, as well as alter the expression of Bcl-2 family members at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Many signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis target specific BH3-only proteins. For example, p53-mediated apoptosis involves transcriptional induction of the BH3-only proteins PUMA (3Nakano K.

A variety of stimuli that induce cell stress inhibit translation via phosphorylation of eIF2, which brings the initiating methionyl-tRNA to the ribosome. Inhibition of eIF2 is mediated by four eIF2α kinases that are activated in response to different stress stimuli: the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR, which is activated during viral infection; GCN2, which is activated under conditions of amino acid starvation; PERK, which is activated by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; and HRI, which couples globin synthesis to heme availability in reticulocytes. Although inhibition of translation can promote cell survival under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress or amino acid starvation, the phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR plays a pro-apoptotic role in response to viral infection. Activation of PKR plays a central role in the antiviral response, which includes induction of apoptosis in response to interferon and double-stranded RNA (12Barber G.N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The best characterized substrate of PKR is eIF2α, and its phosphorylation leads to inhibition of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. This inhibition of global translation is critical to induction of apoptosis by PKR, because expression of mutant nonphosphorylatable S51A-eIF2α blocks apoptosis induced by PKR overexpression (13Gil J. Alcamí J. Esteban M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as apoptosis induced by several stress stimuli that activate PKR, including double-stranded RNA, interferon, tumor necrosis factor α, serum deprivation, and lipopolysaccharide (14Hsu L.-C.

The substrates of GSK-3β include eIF2B, which is inhibited as a result of GSK-3β phosphorylation (22Pavitt G.D. Biochem. Soc.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Growth factor deprivation and inhibition of PI 3-kinase leads to activation of GSK-3β, which then phosphorylates and inhibits eIF2B, resulting in inhibition of translation initiation. Expression of nonphosphorylatable eIF2B mutants suppresses apoptosis induced by GSK-3β overexpression, PI 3-kinase inhibition, or growth factor deprivation, indicating that inhibition of eIF2B contributes to apoptosis resulting from inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling (17Pap M. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling also activates mTOR, which promotes the activity of multiple proteins involved in translation (25Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). mTOR regulates the activity of eIF4E (which binds to the 5′ cap of mRNAs) by phosphorylating eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). In the absence of mTOR signaling, 4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E and inhibits translation initiation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR prevents its interaction with eIF4E, coupling PI 3-kinase/Akt and mTOR signaling to translation of capped mRNAs. Overexpression of eIF4E has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by several stimuli (26Li S. Takasu T. Perlman D.M. Peterson M.S. Burrichter D. Avdulov S. Bitterman P.B. Polunovsky V.A. J. Biol.

Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin also induces apoptosis of some tumor cells (31Huang S. Houghton P.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although recent studies suggest that this may result from inhibition of Akt activation rather than from direct effects of mTOR on translation (32Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S. Sheen J.-H. Hsu P.P. Bagley A.F. Markhard A.L. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). mTOR also stimulates translation by phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (25Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) and regulation of eEF2 kinase (33Browne G.J. Proud C.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2986-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), thereby maintaining activity of the elongation factor eEF2. Although roles for the S6 kinases and eEF2 in apoptosis have not been established, the regulation of these additional factors by mTOR demonstrates the complexity of translation regulation by this pathway.Despite its role in apoptosis induced by several stimuli, the mechanism by which translation inhibition contributes to apoptosis has not been established. One effect of inhibition of translation initiation factors is a selective increase in the translation of some mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry sites or upstream open reading frames (9Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 10Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Many proteins that are selectively induced by this mechanism during cell stress either inhibit apoptosis, such as caspase inhibitors XIAP (35Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and HIAP2 (36Warnakulasuriyarachchi D. Cerquozzi S. Cheung H.H. Holcík M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17148-17157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or initiate an adaptive program to the cellular stress, such as the transcription factor ATF4 in response to oxidative stress (37Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). In addition, some pro-apoptotic proteins have been reported to be induced during translation inhibition, such as Fas and Bax during translation inhibition mediated by PKR (38Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.-C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), suggesting that selective translation of pro-apoptotic proteins may be one mechanism by which global translation inhibition promotes apoptosis.However, apoptosis is also induced by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide in a variety of cells (17Pap M. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Alessenko A.V. Boikov P.Y. Filippova G.N. Khrenov A.V. Loginov A.S. Makarieva E.D.

Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because protein synthesis is completely inhibited by cycloheximide, increased translation of pro-apoptotic proteins cannot be responsible for cell death under these conditions. One possibility is that translation inhibition could induce apoptosis by activating a cell stress pathway. Another possibility is that general turnover of cell constituents might lead to deterioration of the cell in an apoptosis-like manner. Alternatively, apoptosis could result from the selective loss of rapidly degraded anti-apoptotic regulatory protein(s).In the present study, we have focused on induction of apoptosis by cycloheximide to analyze the events responsible for apoptosis resulting from inhibition of protein synthesis. We show that translation inhibition activates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis because of the loss of a regulatory protein(s) via proteasome-mediated degradation and identify the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 as a key regulatory protein that couples cell survival to translational regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. T98G human glioblastoma cells were grown in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. U937 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Apoptosis Assay by DNA Fragmentation—Rat-1, PC12, and T98G cells (5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were plated and U937 cells (3 × 106 cells/10 ml) suspended 24 h before treatment with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and other inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cytosolic nucleic acids isolated as previously described (43Hockenbery D. Nuñez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). The resulting nucleic acids were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The gels were treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A for 3 h at 37 °C prior to visualization by UV transillumination.Apoptosis Assay by Sub-G1 Analysis—Following treatment, the cells were harvested (adherent cells were trypsinized to provide a single cell suspension) and centrifuged. The cell pellets were washed twice in 1 ml of PBS and fixed in 1 ml of prechilled 70% ethanol (in PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of PBS and suspended in 0.5 ml of propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 40 μg/ml RNase A in PBS). The cell suspensions were incubated 30 min at 37 °C in the dark, followed by DNA content analysis by flow cytometry.Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies included anti-Bak NT (06-536; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Bax (2772; Cell Signaling), anti-Mcl-1 (554103; PharMingen), anti-Bcl-2 (610538; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Bcl-x (610746; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Bcl-xL (2762; Cell Signaling), anti-Bim (4582; Cell Signaling), anti-PARP (9542; Cell Signaling), and anti-β-actin (A5441; Sigma). Western blots were developed using a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Bak and Bax Activation Assays—U937 cells (20 × 106/50 ml) were suspended in growth medium 24 h before treatment. Following treatment with cycloheximide, the cells were washed once in PBS, suspended in 1 ml of hypotonic RSB buffer (10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were ruptured with 20–30 strokes with a tight fitting pestle in a Dounce homogenizer, 0.8 ml of 2.5× MS buffer (525 mm mannitol, 175 mm sucrose, 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) was added, and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. The samples were centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, and centrifugation was repeated twice. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was washed once with 0.5 ml of 1× MS buffer and recentrifuged. Cross-linking reactions were then performed on mitochondrial pellets suspended in 675 μl of PBS by treatment with 10 mm bismaleimidohexane (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature (44Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria were pelleted and suspended in sample buffer supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol to quench the cross-linking reaction. The samples were then subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect oligomeric Bak and Bax.Transient Transfections and TUNEL Assays—HeLa cells (5 × 105/60-mm plate) were plated 24 h before transfection. The transfections were performed using 6 μl of TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus)/60-mm plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3 or the indicated Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, or Bcl-2 expression construct plus 1 μg of pCMV-DsRed (BD Biosciences), which expresses a red fluorescent protein. The cells were treated with cycloheximide 24–48 h after transfection, and TUNEL assays were performed using the Fluorescein FragEL DNA fragmentation detection kit (Calbiochem; catalog number QIA39). The cells were trypsinized and processed according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for “Fluorescein-FragEL of cell suspensions for flow cytometry.” Transfected cells were identified by expression of the DsRed protein with a flow cytometer using the FL2 channel, and the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells were quantified using the FL1 channel.RNA Interference—RNA interference transfections were conducted using HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen) and indicated pre-designed siRNAs (final concentration, 10 nm) from Ambion, Inc. For Mcl-1 RNA interference experiments, the transfection mixtures were prepared in 400 μl of total volume by adding 24 μl of HiPerfect and either nonspecific siRNA (Ambion negative control siRNA 1, catalog number 4611) or indicated Mcl-1 siRNA (Ambion siRNA I. D. numbers 6126, 6314, and 42844) to serum-free medium, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The transfection mixtures were then transferred to 60-mm plates and overlaid with 4.6 ml of a 105/ml cell suspension in serum-containing medium. The cells were then placed at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated times before harvest for immunoblot analysis, DNA fragmentation assays, or sub-G1 analysis. For Bim, Bax, and Bak RNA interference experiments, transfections were conducted as described above, using 200-μl total volumes and 12 or 24 μl of HiPerfect reagent for the transfection mixtures, which were overlaid with 2.3 ml of a 105/ml cell suspension on 35-mm plates.All of the siRNAs were purchased from Ambion. Each siRNA consisted of 19-nucleotide double-stranded RNA with two 3′-dT overhangs on each strand. siRNA sense sequences and Ambion ID numbers were as follows: Mcl-1 ID 6126, 5′-GGACACAAAGCCAAUGGGCTT-3′; Mcl-1 ID 6314, 5′-GGACUUUUAGAUUUAGUGATT-3′; Mcl-1 ID 42844, 5′-GGAGGCCUCGGCCCGGCGATT-3′; Bim ID 262307, 5′CCUUCUGAUGUAAGUUCUGTT-3′; Bak ID 120199, 5′-CCCAGAGAUGGUCACCUUATT; Bak ID 120201, 5′-GCUUUAGCAAGUGUGCACUTT-3′; and Bax ID 213259, 5′-GAGGUCUUUUUCCGAGUGGTT-3′.RESULTSApoptosis Induced by Translation Inhibition Requires Proteasome Activity—If apoptosis in response to translation inhibition occurs because of either the degradation of a specific regulatory protein(s) or nonspecific degradation of cellular constituents, then inhibition of proteolysis should block apoptosis. Because the proteasome is responsible for degradation of most proteins within the cell, the effect of proteasome inhibition on apoptosis resulting from inhibition of protein synthesis was examined in four cell lines: Rat-1 fibroblasts, PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, U937 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, and T98G human glioblastoma cells. Rat-1, PC12, and T98G cells were studied as models of growth factor-dependent rodent and human cells (45Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 46Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar), whereas U937 cells were used because they rapidly undergo apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli and are therefore advantageous for biochemical analysis (47Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was inhibited by treatment with cycloheximide at a concentration (10 μg/ml) that inhibited [35S]methionine incorporation >95% (data not shown). The cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 30 min prior to treatment with cycloheximide for 0–6 h, after which fragmented cytosolic DNA was isolated and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cycloheximide treatment resulted in rapid and time-dependent apoptosis, detected as early as 2 h after cycloheximide addition, which was blocked by proteasome inhibition with MG132 in all cell lines tested (Fig. 1A).DNA content analysis was performed on U937 cells by flow cytometry to quantify the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), cycloheximide treatment resulted in 25 and 53% cells within the sub-G1 population at 2 and 4 h, respectively. However, pretreatment with MG132 largely blocked apoptosis, because only 5 and 10% cells were in the sub-G1 population at 2 and 4 h, respectively.To ensure that the effects of MG132 were due to its inhibition of the proteasome, U937 cells were pretreated with two other proteasome inhibitors, MG115 and proteasome inhibitor I prior to cycloheximide, both of which also blocked apoptosis through 6 h (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these studies show that apoptosis induced by cycloheximide requires proteasome activity, indicating that the loss of one or more proteins via proteasome-mediated degradation is responsible for apoptosis induced by translation inhibition.Translation Inhibition Activates the Mitochondrial Pathway of Apoptosis—Protein degradation upon translation inhibition could cause cell death because of a nonspecific global loss of protein, resulting in deterioration of the cell in an apoptosis-like manner. Alternatively, cell death could occur through caspase-dependent apoptosis because of the loss of a specific protein, or set of proteins, whose activity normally maintains cell survival by blocking caspase activation directly or indirectly. Treatment of U937 cells with cycloheximide for 6 h resulted in cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP, which was blocked by the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. 2A), indicating that translation inhibition induces caspase activation. To test whether cell death is dependent on caspase activity, the effect of zVAD-fmk on cycloheximide-induced DNA fragmentation was examined. Pretreatment of Rat-1, U937, and T98G cells with zVAD-fmk blocked apoptosis through 4 h of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating that translation inhibition activates an apoptotic program leading to caspase-dependent cell death.FIGURE 2Apoptosis induced by translation inhibition is dependent on caspase activity and blocked by Bcl-xL overexpression. A, U937 cells were left untreated or treated with 10 μm zVAD-fmk for 30 min prior to treatment with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 6 h. The cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis to detect PARP. B, cells were treated with zVAD-fmk (Rat-1 and T98G cells, 100 μm; U937 cells, 10 μm) or left untreated for 30 min prior to treatment with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 4 h. Cytosolic nucleic acids were isolated, and DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis. C, HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-DsRed expression construct and 1 μg of pcDNA3 empty vector or pSG5-Bcl-xL expression construct. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 18 h and trypsinized, and apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL analysis. Transfected cells were identified by flow cytometry, and the data are presented as the percentages of transfected cells that were TUNEL-positive.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2006: 91-106Google Scholar). The resulting two-subunit membrane-bound enzyme TF·VIIa activates the plasma zymogen factors IX (fIX) and X (fX) by limited proteolysis. Erwin Chargaff (of nucleic acids fame) demonstrated in the 1940s that TF procoagulant activity requires it to be associated with phospholipids, and research over the ensuing decades has demonstrated that TF is a membrane-spanning protein that must be incorporated into bilayers containing anionic phospholipids for optimal activity (reviewed by Bach (2Bach R.R. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)). Despite this extensive history, we still have an indistinct picture of how anionic phospholipids contribute so profoundly to the enzymatic activity of membrane-bound protease complexes involved in blood clotting (3Morrissey J.H. Neuenschwander P.F. Huang Q. McCallum C.D. Su B. Johnson A.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Membranes composed of mixed phospholipids (and other lipids) can form membrane microdomains with locally different surface properties. A noted example is the formation of cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich lipid rafts and caveolae on cell surfaces (4Lagerholm B.C. Weinreb G.E. Jacobson K. Thompson N.L. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2005; 56: 309-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Mouritsen O.G. Zuckermann M.J. Lipids. 2004; 39: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Experiments using giant unilamellar vesicles have shown that even liposomes containing simple binary mixtures of neutral and anionic phospholipids spontaneously form anionic phospholipid-rich membrane microdomains in the presence of plasma concentrations of Ca2+, which is even more pronounced in the presence of membrane-binding proteins (6Haverstick D.M. Glaser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4475-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Yang L. Glaser M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13966-13974Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, anionic phospholipids were shown to coalesce, via lateral diffusion over relatively large distances, into subdomains several micrometers in size. These and other studies have demonstrated that local membrane microenvironments can differ dramatically from the average composition of the membrane even in relatively “simple” model membranes.Most clotting proteins bind reversibly and in a Ca2+-dependent manner to bilayers containing anionic phospholipids, with phosphatidylserine (PS) being most active. Local differences in membrane microdomain properties mean that specific proteins may tend to partition into or out of such microdomains, and so the lipid composition in the immediate vicinity of membrane-bound protease co-factor complexes may be expected to profoundly influence their enzymatic activities. For example, TF-bearing microparticles have been reported to arise from lipid rafts (8Del Conde I. Shrimpton C.N. Thiagarajan P. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 106: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), and depletion of cholesterol from cell membranes impairs functional TF expression in fibroblasts (9Mandal S.K. Iakhiaev A.

Physiol. 1990; 145: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which specific plasma membrane domains may regulate the rate of clotting reactions are largely unknown, however. Membrane-binding protein substrates such as fX are known to partition between the solution phase and the membrane surface, and most likely they also partition into specific membrane microdomains. We therefore hypothesize that blood clotting reactions, such as the activation of fX by the TF·VIIa complex, occur preferentially or at least with greatest efficiency within membrane microdomains that have locally very high PS content.fX molecules bound to the membrane may translate on the membrane via lateral diffusion, effectively skating or hopping along the surface. This leads to at least two different possible mechanisms by which protein substrates such as fX can encounter the TF·VIIa complex. In one mechanism, solution phase fX binds directly to the membrane-bound TF·VIIa complex, whereupon it is activated to fXa via limited proteolysis. In another mechanism, membrane-bound fX molecules that are translating along the membrane surface (via lateral diffusion or hopping) encounter the TF·VIIa complex. Several studies have addressed the relative importance of these two modes of substrate delivery to the TF·VIIa complex, typically by incorporating TF into liposomes of defined phospholipid composition, assembling the TF·VIIa complex and then quantifying rates of fX activation. These approaches have allowed somewhat indirect inferences to be made regarding the choice of solution phase versus membrane-bound fX as the preferred substrate in which the investigators systematically vary the liposome concentration and also use competing membrane-binding proteins. Using such approaches, some investigators have concluded that the membrane-bound pool of fX is the preferred substrate (13Krishnaswamy S. Field K.A. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26110-26120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others have concluded the opposite, that solution phase fX is the preferred substrate for the TF·VIIa complex (14Forman S.D. Nemerson Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4675-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Bom V.J. Bertina R.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).In this study, we have tested the concept that the local membrane nanoenvironment surrounding coagulation protease·cofactor complexes controls both their assembly and catalytic efficiencies toward membrane-bound protein substrates. We approached this by incorporating TF into nanoscale phospholipid bilayers that allow rigorous control of the local membrane microenvironment. This was accomplished using a unique system of stable nanoscale phospholipid bilayers, termed Nanodiscs (16Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 853-856Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar), as a platform for studying membrane-protein interactions. Water-soluble Nanodiscs are produced by a self-assembly process resulting in a nanoscale lipid bilayer (∼8 nm in diameter) encircled and stabilized by two copies of an amphipathic helical protein termed membrane scaffold protein (MSP). This self-assembly is reproducible and efficient, yielding monodisperse preparations of supported lipid bilayers that are extremely stable and that exhibit lipid fluidity comparable with liposomes (17Shaw A.W. McLean M.A. Sligar S.G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Denisov I.G. McLean M.A. Shaw A.W. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B. Condens. Matter Mater. Surf. Interfaces. Biophys. 2005; 109: 15580-15588Google Scholar). Moreover, heterologous membrane-spanning proteins can also be incorporated efficiently into these supported nanobilayers during self-assembly (19Leitz A.J. Bayburt T.H. Barnakov A.N. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. BioTechniques. 2006; 40 (604, 606, passim): 601-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Bayburt T.H. Sligar S.G. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2476-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). By embedding TF into nanoscale lipid bilayers, we can preclude long distance (μm scale) recruitment of PS molecules into membrane domains with locally high or low PS content. Instead, the composition of the membrane nanodomain immediately surrounding the TF·VIIa complex is under tight experimental control. Using this system, we report that full TF·VIIa proteolytic activity required extremely high local concentrations of anionic phospholipids and further that a large pool of membrane-bound fX was not required to support efficient catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Phosphatidylcholine (PC; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and phosphatidylserine (PS; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), fVIIa was from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and fX was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Recombinant human TF (21Smith S.A. Morrissey J.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and MSP (16Bayburt T.H. Grinkova Y.V. Sligar S.G. Nano Lett. 2002; 2: 853-856Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar) were expressed in Esherichia coli and purified as described.Reconstitution of Recombinant TF into Liposomes and Nanodiscs—TF was incorporated into liposomes as described previously (21Smith S.A. Morrissey J.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using 15 mm sodium deoxycholate as the detergent. TF was incorporated into Nanodiscs as described for the incorporation of β2-adrenergic receptors into Nanodiscs (19Leitz A.J. Bayburt T.H. Barnakov A.N. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. BioTechniques. 2006; 40 (604, 606, passim): 601-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: PC and PS (5.2 mm total phospholipid) were dissolved in 10.4 mm sodium deoxycholate in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), after which MSP and TF were added to yield phospholipid:MSP molar ratios ranging from 65:1 to 70:1 and MSP:TF molar ratios of 20:1. Because each Nanodisc contains two MSP proteins, this large excess of MSP to TF results in an average of 1 TF molecule/10 Nanodiscs to minimize the occurrence of >1 TF molecule/Nanodisc. As previously described (19Leitz A.J. Bayburt T.H. Barnakov A.N. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. BioTechniques. 2006; 40 (604, 606, passim): 601-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), detergent was removed using Bio-Beads® SM-2 (Bio-Rad), and self-assembled Nanodiscs were isolated using size exclusion chromatography. TF-free Nanodiscs were also prepared using essentially the same methods but omitting TF.Characterization of Nanodiscs—The phospholipid content of purified Nanodisc preparations was quantified by incorporating traces of 3H-PS during self-assembly and then determining the 3H-PS content by scintillation counting and the total phospholipid content by inorganic phosphate analyses following complete oxidation. Total TF concentrations in liposomes and Nanodiscs were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after detergent solubilization (21Smith S.A. Morrissey J.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Concentrations of functional (available) TF in TF-liposomes and TF-Nanodiscs were determined enzymatically by titration with a fixed concentration of fVIIa (22Neuenschwander P.F. Fiore M.M. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21489-21492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With TF-Nanodiscs, TF concentrations measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay agreed with the results of fVIIa titrations within experimental error (not shown), indicating that essentially 100% of the TF molecules in TF-Nanodiscs were functional. With TF-liposomes, ∼50–60% of the TF molecules measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were available by fVIIa titration (not shown), attributable to some TF molecules facing the lumen of the liposomes. TF concentrations are given throughout as the concentration of available TF. To demonstrate the presence of only 1 TF molecule/TF-Nanodisc, TF-Nanodiscs were first purified from TF-free Nanodiscs by affinity chromatography using immobilized HPC4 antibody directed against an epitope tag at the N terminus of TF as previously described (23Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) but omitting the 1 m NaCl wash step. The stoichiometries of TF and MSP protein in preparations of TF-Nanodiscs were then assessed via quantitative SDS-PAGE.Assessment of Nanodisc Aggregation in the Presence of Ca2+—TF-free Nanodiscs containing 0–100% PS were diluted in TBS with or without 2.5 mm CaCl2 and incubated for a minimum of 20 min. This process was also performed on TF-Nanodiscs containing 70% PS. The samples were then resolved by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) monitored by A280; no evidence of aggregation was obtained for any of the TF-free or TF-containing Nanodisc preparations (not shown). TF-free Nanodiscs were also analyzed by dynamic light scattering in which intensity autocorrelation functions of micromolar quantities of TF-free Nanodiscs in TBS with or without 2.5 mm CaCl2 were quantified at ambient temperature using a Brookhaven Instruments BI-200 SM goniometer with a Lexel model 95 argon ion laser (514 nm) at a scattering angle of 90°. A photomultiplier tube was used to measure light intensity with signal processing by a BI-9000AT digital correlator. Using the Siegert relationship, the intermediate scattering function, g, was determined from the measured intensity autocorrelation function, G(τ) = B(1 + f 2 [g(τ)]2), where B is the background intensity, f is an optical constant based on the measuring instrument, and τ is the decay time (24Ford Jr., N.C. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering: Applications of Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1985: 7-58Crossref Google Scholar).Measuring the Binding of fVIIa to TF-Nanodiscs and Rates of fX Activation—Binding affinities of fVIIa for TF in liposomes or Nanodiscs were quantified using the TF-dependent increase in fVIIa enzymatic activity as described previously (25Waters E.K. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3769-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Initial rates of fX activation by the TF·VIIa complex (assembled either on TF-liposomes or TF-Nanodiscs) were quantified using a continuous fX activation assay as previously described (25Waters E.K. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3769-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rates of fXa generation were measured over a 20-min period and in all cases were linear over the entire time course. In all kinetic experiments, the final TF concentration was 5 pm in both the TF-Nanodisc and TF-liposome systems. For TF-Nanodisc experiments, a molar ratio of 1 TF-Nanodisc:9 TF-free Nanodiscs was used, yielding final concentrations of 50 pm Nanodiscs and 6.7 nm phospholipid. For TF-liposome experiments, the final phospholipid concentration was 65 nm. Km and kcat values were calculated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the rate data using nonlinear regression.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analyses—Binding of fX to Nanodiscs containing varying mol % of PS was quantified by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 3000 instrument. NTA Biacore sensor chips were charged with Ni2+ according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, after which Nanodiscs were immobilized on the NTA-Ni2+ chip surface via the oligohistidine tag located on MSP. An empty NTA-Ni2+ channel was used to subtract changes in resonance units (RU) due to the refractive index of the protein solution and any nonspecific binding. Running buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) was flowed at 5 μl/min. Nanodiscs were loaded onto each channel in calcium-free running buffer until a signal of 800 RU was achieved, after which a steady base line was established in running buffer. Increasing concentrations of fX were injected in the running buffer, and the maximal response above the base line upon reaching steady state was recorded for each injected concentration. The maximal RU values achieved at each fX concentration were then used to evaluate the affinity (Kd) of fX for the nanoscale bilayers. This approach avoids potential limitations from analyzing association and dissociation rate data due to mass transport-limited rates of analyte association and analyte rebinding during the dissociation phase. At the end of each run, NTA chips were regenerated using a buffer containing 0.3 m EDTA, which successfully removed the Nanodiscs and all bound proteins. NTA sensor chips were reused for multiple binding experiments with no observed loss of function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this study, we examined how changes in the local composition of the membrane immediately surrounding the TF·VIIa complex modulated its ability to proteolytically activate its membrane-binding substrate, fX. We approached this by embedding TF into supported nanoscale lipid bilayers (Nanodiscs) to preclude long distance recruitment of PS molecules into membrane subdomains with locally high or low PS contents. As presented below, we then measured the ability of the TF·VIIa complex to assemble and function within these nanoscale bilayers as the local PS content was altered over a very broad range (0–90% PS). To show the general trends observed with conventional liposome-based approaches, we obtained data with the TF·VIIa complex assembled on TF-liposomes of varying phospholipid composition (from 0 to 40% PS). For the reasons outlined in the Introduction, however, it is not really possible to compare directly the results obtained using these two forms of TF, because we have no experimental control over the local PS content surrounding the TF·VIIa complex assembled on TF-liposomes. Furthermore, because conventional liposomes containing extremely high PS contents undergo vesicle fusion and collapse when exposed to mm concentrations of Ca2+ (26Wilschut J. Duzgunes N. Hoekstra D. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is likewise not possible to study the effects of high total PS content in conventional TF-liposomes.Size Considerations—To successfully investigate the activation of blood coagulation using the Nanodisc system, it was essential to demonstrate that the enclosed nanobilayer has sufficient room to assemble the TF·VIIa complex and also to productively bind at least one substrate (fX) molecule. The cross-sectional area of the membrane-binding domain of fVIIa (the Gla domain) is ∼3.9 nm2 (27Banner D.W. D’Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), and the surface area of a phospholipid headgroup is ∼0.7 nm2 (28Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 551-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the Gla domain covers roughly six phospholipid molecules. The nanobilayers in these Nanodiscs, which contain 67 ± 1 phospholipid molecules/leaflet (see below), should therefore have room to bind as many as 10 Gla domains/leaflet. But the cross-sectional area of the widest part of the TF·VIIa complex (near the globular fVIIa protease domain) is 16–18 nm2 (27Banner D.W. D’Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) or enough to cover 23–26 phospholipid molecules. The relative sizes of these structures are displayed graphically in Fig. 1A, in which the crystal structure of the TF·VIIa complex is placed, to scale, on a schematic of the 8-nm supported bilayer contained within a Nanodisc. Although the widest part of the TF·VIIa complex is around the globular protease domain of fVIIa, the two points of membrane contact in the TF·VIIa complex are considerably smaller. Furthermore, because the supported bilayer in Nanodiscs has a boundary, portions of the TF·VIIa complex located near the protease domain could project beyond the edge of the bilayer. This is demonstrated graphically in Fig. 1, B and C, in which a top view of the crystal structure of the TF·VIIa complex is placed, to scale, on an 8-nm-diameter circle representing the size of the supported nanobilayer (29Denisov I.G. Grinkova Y.V. Lazarides A.A. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In this case, >60% of the surface of the leaflet remains available for binding fX molecules. The three-dimensional structure of zymogen fX is not known with certainty, but fX is highly homologous to fVII (including its Gla domain) and likely has a similar cross-sectional area. With 60% or more of the disc surface still available on discs containing the TF·VIIa complex, as many as six fX molecules could also possibly bind to the remaining leaflet. However, factors such as the mobility of TF·VIIa in the lipid bilayer and the need for fX to bind in a specific orientation relative to TF·VIIa might reduce the available area somewhat. Thus, the lipid bilayer in a Nanodisc is large enough to assemble the TF·VIIa complex and also bind at least one fX molecule and perhaps as many as five or six.Preparation and Characterization of TF-Nanodiscs—Nanodiscs and TF-Nanodiscs were prepared using varying proportions of PC and PS ranging from 0 to 100% PS. They were monodisperse as assessed by gel filtration and light scattering and contained 1 TF molecule/disc (for TF-Nanodiscs) (Fig. 2A). These Nanodisc preparations contained a mean of 67 ± 1 phospholipid molecules/leaflet and had final proportions of PC and PS that faithfully reflected the input PC/PS content (Fig. 2B). To test the hypothesis that locally high PS content enhances TF function, we needed to prepare Nanodiscs containing very high mol % of PS. This can be highly problematical when preparing liposomes, because exposing liposomes with very high PS content to plasma concentrations of Ca2+ leads to liposome aggregation, fusion, and/or collapse (26Wilschut J. Duzgunes N. Hoekstra D. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated the aggregation state of Nanodiscs containing 0–100% PS. In buffered solutions containing 150 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2, Nanodiscs containing 0–90 mol % of PS were monodisperse, as assessed by dynamic light scattering (Fig. 3, A and B) and gel filtration (not shown). On the other hand, only Nanodiscs containing 100% PS showed limited but detectable aggregation in the presence of Ca2+ but not in its absence (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 2Nanodisc composition. A, number of TF molecules/Nanodisc. A standard curve was prepared by resolving samples, in duplicate, containing known quantities of purified TF and MSP (first eight lanes) on SDS-PAGE, staining the gel with Coomassie Blue and digitizing using a scanning densitometer (analyzed using Scion Image software, Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Purified TF-Nanodiscs were resolved on the same gel (rightmost two lanes) and quantified in parallel with the standards, yielding a determination of 0.51 TF/MSP molecule, or 1.02 TF molecules/TF-Nanodisc. B, PS content of Nanodiscs. Nanodiscs of varying PS compositions were prepared, to which trace amounts of [3H]PS were added during self-assembly. Scintillation counting was used to determine PS recovery. The line is a plot of y = x, showing that the percentage of PS in Nanodiscs is essentially identical to that of the initial lipid mixture. Inorganic phosphate analyses following complete oxidation of the samples demonstrated that the mean molar ratio of phospholipid to MSP was 67(±1):1. Because each Nanodisc contains two MSP molecules, the mean phospholipid content was therefore 134 ± 2 phospholipid molecules/Nanodisc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Intermediate scattering functions for TF-free Nanodiscs of varying PS content. Dynamic light scattering for solutions of Nanodiscs with three representative PS compositions are shown: A, 0%; B, 90%; or C, 100% PS, analyzed in the presence (solid symbols) or absence (open symbols) of 2.5 mm CaCl2. The coincidence of the curves ±Ca2+ (when the Nanodiscs contained from 0 to 90% PS, as seen in A and B) indicates lack of detectable aggregation induced by Ca2+. Dynamic light scattering analyses of Nanodiscs with contents between 0 and 90% PS likewise exhibited no evidence of aggregation (not shown). Some evidence of aggregation was observed, however, when the Nanodiscs contained 100% PS, as evidenced by the shifted curve in the presence of Ca2+ (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of fX to Nanoscale Bilayers—Incorporating PS into TF-liposomes of mixed phospholipid content enhances TF·VIIa proteolytic activity, with maximal rates of fX activation generally achieved at 10–40% PS (30Neuenschwander P.F.

https://openalex.org/W2169660182,"Expression of surface immunoglobulin appears critical for the growth and survival of B-cell lymphomas. In follicular lymphoma, we found previously that the Ig variable (V) regions in the B-cell receptor express a strikingly high incidence of N-glycosylation sequons, NX(S/T). These potential glycosylation sites are introduced by somatic mutation and are lymphoma-specific, pointing to their involvement in tumor pathogenesis. Analysis of the V region sugars from lymphoma-derived IgG/IgM reveals that they are mostly oligomannose and, remarkably, are located in the antigen-binding site, possibly precluding conventional antigen binding. The Fc region contains complex glycans, confirming that the normal glycan processing pathway is intact. Binding studies indicate that the oligomannose glycans occupying the V regions are accessible to mannose-binding lectin. These findings suggest a potential contribution to lymphoma pathogenesis involving antigen-independent interaction of surface immunoglobulin of the B-cell receptor with mannose-binding molecules of innate immunity in the germinal center.

Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), indicating that a stimulatory surface Ig-mediated signal, independent of antigen, is required (2Smith S.H. Reth M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 696-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The majority of malignancies derived from mature human B-cells may also require such a signal, since sIg-negative tumors are rare. In FL, sIg retention is remarkable, since in most tumors, one Ig allele is compromised by the characteristic t(14;18) chromosomal translocation. (3Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C.M. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 4Yunis J.J. Frizzera G. Oken M.M. McKenna J. Theologides A. Arnesen M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) In terms of pathogenesis, the translocation that up-regulates expression of the BCL-2 oncoprotein appears necessary, but not sufficient, for tumor development, since it can also occur in B-cells of healthy individuals (5Limpens J. Stad R. Vos C. de Vlaam C. de Jong D. van Ommen G.J. Schuuring E. Kluin P.M. Blood. 1995; 85: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other factors must be required for survival in the hostile germinal center (GC), where normal B-cells that fail to be selected by antigen usually die. FL occurs in the GC of lymph nodes, where tumor cells maintain many features of normal GC B-cells. A nodular or nodular/diffuse growth pattern is characteristic, with conservation of the microenvironment of follicular dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells. In normal B-cells, the Ig V region genes undergo somatic mutation in the GC. B-cells expressing Ig sequences that can bind antigen are rescued from the default death pathway, allowing further differentiation and subsequent exit as plasma cells or memory B-cells (6Liu Y.J. Arpin C. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 156: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Manser T. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3369-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Somatic mutation is also activated in FL cells, with evidence of ongoing mutational activity in tumor clones (8Zelenetz A.D. Chen T.T. Levy R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although Ig expression is retained, it has been difficult to envisage a role for multiple potential antigens in supporting the growth of neoplastic B-cells. Interestingly, we observed a striking difference in the B-cell receptor of lymphoma cells as compared with normal B-cells, which might provide an alternative stimulatory pathway. In normal B-cells, N-glycosylation is mainly confined to conserved sites in the Ig constant regions, although a few germ line encoded V regions do carry potential N-glycosylation sites. In FLIg, the number of potential sites increases dramatically during the somatic mutation process. By analyzing VH sequences, we previously found that 55 of 70 (79%) cases of FL contained these sequons. Sites were also present in VL (9Zhu D. McCarthy H. Ottensmeier C.H. Johnson P. Hamblin T.J. Stevenson F.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2562-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This high incidence has been confirmed in 24 of 24 cases (10Zabalegui N. de Cerio A.L. Inoges S. Rodriguez-Calvillo M. Perez-Calvo J. Hernandez M. Garcia-Foncillas J. Martin-Algarra S. Rocha E. Bendandi M. Haematologica. 2004; 89: 541-546PubMed Google Scholar). Since glycosylation sites do not accumulate significantly in somatically mutated normal B-cells, the positive selection of B-cells in FL that express B-cell receptor containing N-linked glycans suggested a potential role for the oligosaccharides in tumorigenesis. Sites generated by somatic mutation are frequent and possibly mandatory in FL, but they also exist in other GC-associated lymphomas (11Zhu D. Ottensmeier C.H. Du M.Q. McCarthy H. Stevenson F.K. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 120: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The incidence of potential N-glycosylation sites in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is high (82%), although sporadic BL and diffuse large cell lymphoma have lower levels, 43 and 41%, respectively (9Zhu D. McCarthy H. Ottensmeier C.H. Johnson P. Hamblin T.J. Stevenson F.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2562-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting the known heterogeneity of these tumors. In contrast to GC-associated B-cell malignancies, sites are found at insignificant levels in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (9Zhu D. McCarthy H. Ottensmeier C.H. Johnson P. Hamblin T.J. Stevenson F.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2562-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The process of N-linked glycosylation is initiated in the ER by the transfer of the dolichol phosphate oligosaccharide precursor, N-acetylglucosamine2-mannose9-glucose3, to suitable asparagine residues in the glycosylation sequons of nascent proteins (12Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2844) Google Scholar). Following the removal of glucose and mannose residues, the fully folded protein is transported to the Golgi, where enzymes further process the glycans to hybrid and complex-type. The exact processing of the glycans depends on factors such as the cell in which the glycoprotein is expressed and the three-dimensional structure of the protein around the glycosylation site (13Parekh R.B. Tse A.G. Dwek R.A. Williams A.F. Rademacher T.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 1-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). When enzyme access is restricted, oligomannose sugars may not be fully processed. We have now characterized the glycosylation of the Fab region of FLIgs that results from somatic mutation and probed the accessibility of the glycans to C-type lectins. We have analyzed V region-associated sugars in tumor-specific Ig derived from six cases of FL. We focused first on IgG-expressing cases, since there are no conserved sites in the IgG Fab constant regions, analyzing heavy chain (HC), light chain (LC), and Fab fragments. Interestingly, the Fab glycans are mostly unprocessed oligomannose. FLIgM HC, which has a conserved glycosylation site in the constant region at Asn171 occupied by complex glycans, was also analyzed and showed a significant increase in oligomannose sugars when compared with normal human serum IgM (NIgM) (15Wormald M.R.

Studies with MBL, a C-type lectin, with both immobilized FLIgG and sIg, which is part of the B-cell receptor, have revealed that the terminal mannose residues on the Fab glycans are accessible for binding. Molecular modeling based on amino acid substitution of the Fab region has been used to ascertain the location of N-linked glycosylation sites. Idiotypic Ig Production and Identification of Tumor-derived Gene Sequences—Six patients with Stage IVA FL had surgical biopsy at first relapse following chemotherapy; five expressed sIgG, and one expressed sIgM. The control patient had IgG+ CLL, which expressed IgG without a potential V region N-glycosylation site. Ig protein was generated from tumor cells isolated from blood by producing heterohybridomas with the K6H6/B5 cell line (ATCC: CRL1823) as previously described (17Kwak L.W. Campbell M.J.

Resulting hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the production of Ig matching the isotype of the tumor. The identities of fusions and tumor were determined by comparing Ig VH CDR3 sequences. Ig was purified from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography (IgG, Protein A (Amersham Biosciences); IgM, anti-IgM antibody columns). Protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and in each case was >95%. All Ig proteins were adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. VH and VL gene sequences were determined as previously described (9Zhu D. McCarthy H. Ottensmeier C.H. Johnson P. Hamblin T.J. Stevenson F.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2562-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). N-linked Glycan Analysis—15 μg of five FLIgG samples (FL2, -4, -11, -31, and -32), one FLIgM (FL3), CLL1, normal human serum NIgG, and NIgM were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (20Radcliffe C.M.

HC and LC protein bands migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 53–58 and 24–30 kDa, respectively, for IgG and 75–90 and 29 kDa, respectively, for IgM were excised, cut into ∼1 mm3, frozen for ∼2 h at -20 °C, and washed with alternating 1 ml of acetonitrile and 1 ml of 20 mm NaHCO3 pH 7 (five washes, 30 min each). N-Linked glycans were released in situ with peptide-N-glycanase F (PNGase F; Roche Applied Science) (20Radcliffe C.M. Diedrich G. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Cresswell P. Rudd P.M. J. Biol.

Neutral, monosialylated, and disialylated fractions were also collected from weak anion exchange HPLC and processed by NP-HPLC for further analysis and confirmation of NIgG, FL2, NIgM, and FL3 peak assignments. Exoglycosidase digestions were carried out on 2AB-labeled glycan pools of N-linked glycans (23Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra of unlabeled glycans were recorded as described previously (20Radcliffe C.M. Diedrich G. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A.

Papain Digestion of IgG and Fab/Fc Separation—Digestion of IgG samples FL2, FL4, FL31, and NIgG (100 μg) was performed with 1 μg of papain (Sigma) in 250 μl of 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 12 mm cysteine (pH 7) for 16 h. To test the completion of the digestion, aliquots (4 μl) were treated with 50 mm iodoacetamide at 4 °C for 30 min to inactivate papain, added to nonreducing SDS-sample buffer pre-heated to 100 °C, and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. The samples were analyzed by 8.5% SDS-PAGE. The papain digests were dialyzed against 0.01 m phosphate buffer (pH 8) overnight and applied to DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, Kent, UK) that was equilibrated with the same buffer and packed into microcolumns (∼100–150-μl bed volume). Undigested IgG, Fab, and papain were eluted in flow-through fractions. Fc was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The separation of Fab and Fc was confirmed by Western blotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated versions of goat anti-human κ chains, goat anti-human λ chains, and mouse anti-human IgG-Fc (Serotec). Glycans from Fab and Fc fractions were released from in-gel bands and analyzed. PNGase F Digestion in Solution of FL2 Fab—8 μl of FL2 Fab were treated as above to inactivate the papain. 4 μl were incubated with PNGase F in solution for 36 h (24Goodarzi M.T. Turner G.A. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nonreduced sample was run on 8.5% SDS-PAGE together with an undigested aliquot. MBL Purification and Binding Assay—Rabbit anti-MBL polyclonal antiserum was depleted of any anti-mannan antibodies on a mannan-agarose resin (catalog number M9917; Sigma) and then pre-equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5 mm EDTA (25Arnold J.N.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (NUNC-Maxisorp) wells were coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml FLIgG. CLL1 was used as a negative control. The binding assay was performed as described previously (25Arnold J.N. Radcliffe C.M. Wormald M.R. Royle L. Harvey D.J. Crispin M. Dwek R.A. Sim R.B. Rudd P.M. J.

Preparation of MBL Biotinylated with NHS-Biotin Bound to Streptavadin-FITC—Purified MBL (500 μg) in 10 mm Hepes, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was made up to 20 mm CaCl2 and concentrated on a 0.5 ml column of d-mannose immobilized on cross-linked 4% beaded agarose (catalog number M-6400; Sigma) which was washed with 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. MBL was eluted with 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 200-μl fractions were collected. The MBL-containing fractions (∼400 μl) were made up to 500 μl with wash buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min with a 25-fold molar excess over MBL (molecular mass taken as 300 kDa) of biotin 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma), from 1 mg/ml stock freshly made up in wash buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 7.8, and incubating on ice for 10 min. The material was run as before on 0.5 ml of mannose-agarose resin. Eluted MBL was cross-linked using 1.3 μl of streptavidin-FITC (1 mg/ml, 60 kDa) (Sigma) to 50 μg of biotinylated MBL (4-fold molar excess), allowing 2-h intervals at 4 °C in the dark between each streptavidin-FITC addition. MBL Cell Binding Assay—A telomerase-immortalized human HK cell line, derived from a follicular dendritic cell, and the EBV-ve BL cell line L3055 were obtained from Dr. Y. S. Choi (Cellular Immunology, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA). L3055 cells that express surface IgMλ with a known N-glycosylation site (27Chapman C.J. Zhou J.X. Gregory C. Rickinson A.B. Stevenson F.K. Blood. 1996; 88: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown on HK feeder cells as previously described (28Choe J. Li L. Zhang X. Gregory C.D. Choi Y.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation of HK cells at 5 × 105/well (in 3 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin, all from Invitrogen), 7 × 104 L3055 cells were added per well and harvested after 2–3 days of incubation. BL-2 is an EBV-ve BL cell line (gift from Dr. A. Rickinson, University of Birmingham Medical School, Birmingham, UK). It expresses surface IgMλ with no N-glycosylation sites (27Chapman C.J. Zhou J.X. Gregory C. Rickinson A.B. Stevenson F.K. Blood. 1996; 88: 3562-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BL-2 cells were grown as previously described (27Chapman C.J. Zhou J.X. Gregory C. Rickinson A.B.

For each assay, 1 × 106 cells (L3055 or BL-2) were pelleted in 5-ml fluorescence-activated cell sorting tubes (1500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of either HBSS (Sigma) supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA to demonstrate Ca2+-dependent binding. The cells were centrifuged as before and resuspended in 250 μl of appropriate buffer and incubated with 5 μg (20 μg/ml) of FITC-conjugated MBL or 5 μg of goat anti-human IgM (μ chain-specific) for 30 min on ice prior to analysis on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. The effect of apoptosis on MBL binding to L3055 cells was investigated by dual staining with MBL-FITC followed by Annexin V-PE (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. L3055 and BL-2 cells were labeled with mouse anti-human Igλ FITC (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to determine surface immunoglobulin expression. To mediate endocytosis of sIg, L3055 cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with goat F(ab′)2 anti-IgM (μ chain-specific) (Southern Biotech) at 10 μg/ml. Loss of sIg was monitored by staining with anti-human Igλ FITC, and the cells were then tested for MBL binding. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was performed as described previously (25Arnold J.N. Radcliffe C.M. Wormald M.R. Royle L. Harvey D.J. Crispin M. Dwek R.A. Sim R.B. Rudd P.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6831-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, sequence alignment was performed using Align (29Pearson W.R. Wood T. Zhang Z. Miller W. Genomics. 1997; 46: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) on the equivalent domains of IgG (Swiss-Prot: P01857) together with appropriate amino acid substitutions. Crystal structures used as the basis of the modeling were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (30Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27537) Google Scholar). The structure of FL2 was based on the crystal structure of murine N1G9 antibody (31Mizutani R. Miura K. Nakayama T. Shimada I. Arata Y. Satow Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 208-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The models of FL3, FL4, and FL31 were based on the crystal structure of the Fab domain of the monoclonal antibody against HIV-1 GP41 (32He X.M. Ruker F. Casale E. Carter D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). N-Glycans were generated using the data base of glycosidic linkage conformations and in vacuo (33Petrescu A.J. Petrescu S.M.

V Gene Analysis—Analysis of gene segment sequences encoding V regions of FL cases (Table 1) show that a range of VH and VL genes were used, all of which were somatically mutated. In all cases, potential N-glycosylation sites NX(S/T) were identified. All contained sites in VH; FL32 (IgG+) and FL3 (IgM+) each had an additional site in VL. The position of sites varied; FL2 contained two in CDRH2, at Asn52 and Asn52c, and one in CDRH3 at Asn95. In FL2, both CDRH2 sites resulted from codon insertions, with a Gly residue inserted between Asn and Ser and an Asn residue inserted prior to TS. The other four patient IgG samples each had a single site in VH: FL4 at Asn95, FL11 at Asn96, FL31 at Asn95, all in CDRH3, and FL32 at Asn50 in CDRH2. FL32 also had a potential site in VL within CDRL2 at Asn50. FL3 had two potential sites at Asn21 in framework region H1 and Asn50 in CDRH2 and a potential site in VL within framework region L4 at Asn103. The Ig derived from CLL1 as a hybridoma control had none.TABLE 1HC and LC gene segment usage and glycosylation sites V(D)J gene segment usage was determined by aligning nucleotide sequences to germ line sequences in V-BASE using MacVector 6.5.3 sequence analysis software (Accelerys, Cambridge, UK).

Five patient-derived IgG samples and one IgM sample were analyzed together with three controls, CLL1, NIgG, and NIgM. The gel (Fig. 1a) shows that the HC of CLL1 and NIgG migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa, whereas all of the patient samples were ∼58 kDa, which is consistent with the glycosylation of the Fab region. Glycosylation was also indicated for FL3 HC, since it migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig. 1b), whereas NIgM HC migrated at 75 kDa. The LC of FLIgG migrated between 24 and 30 kDa. The LC of both NIgM and FL3 had an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa, suggesting a lack of glycosylation of the FL3 LC although it has a potential site. Complete NP-HPLC glycan profiles were obtained for the 2AB-labeled HC glycans of all patient-derived samples and controls (Fig. 1, c and d). The system was calibrated using an external standard of hydrolyzed and 2AB-labeled glucose oligomers to create a standard curve. The retention times for the individual glycans were converted to glucose unit (GU) values using this curve. Preliminary peak assignments were made by comparing the GU values with the Oxford Glycobiology data base of experimental values, and the assignments were confirmed by exoglycosidase array digestions (23Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). These were carried out to remove the monosaccharides sequentially to elucidate the structures. Weak anion exchange HPLC data were used to facilitate the assignments of neutral and sialylated peaks of FL2 that coeluted (data not shown). All of the FLIgG samples contained the characteristic profile of complex glycans seen in NIgG (peaks 3, 11, 12, 20; Table 2 and supplemental Table S1), but there was unexpectedly also an oligomannose (M) series, M5–M9 (peaks 5, 15, 24, 31, and 36), with both types of glycan in varying proportions (Fig. 1, Table 2, and supplemental Table S1). The complex glycans were consistent with previous analyses of serum IgG Fc (35Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Sutton B.J. Fernandes D.L. Leung A. Stanworth D. Rademacher T.W. Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), confirming that the normal glycan processing pathway was intact. CLL1 showed a characteristic IgG HC glycan NP-HPLC profile with 30% fucosylated (F; for assignment nomenclature, see Tables 2 and 3), agalactosylated, and monogalactosylated (G1) glycans with only 1% sialylation (S) but lacking glycans with bisecting (B) GlcNAc seen in human NIgG, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1c. Structural representations of the biantennary (A2) glycan FA2BG1 and M6 are shown in Fig. 1e. A small percentage (∼3%) of glycans terminating in α-galactose (Ga) was also found (Table 2 and supplemental Table S1). The presence of α-galactose (peaks 24, 27, 32, 35, 36, and 41) and the absence of bisected glycans in both control and patient samples indicated that the mouse glycosylation machinery is operative in all of these heterohybridomas, as shown elsewhere (37Tandai M. Endo T. Sasaki S. Masuho Y. Kochibe N. Kobata A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of M5–M9 suggested that these glycans were in positions inaccessible to mannosidase I and GlcNAc transferase I, the actions of which are required prior to processing to complex-type sugars. Together with the oligomannose-type, FL2 contained higher molecular mass glycans (e.g. biantennary structures, FA2G2S2 (7%), and FA2G2Ga1S2 (1%)) either absent in the other samples and controls or present in very small quantities (∼1%) (Fig. 1c, Table 2, and supplemental Table S1). The production of more processed glycans is consistent with the more usual pattern of glycosylation that occurs in the ∼10% of NIgG Fab where there is an N-glycosylation site due to somatic mutation that is fully accessible (38Kabat E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2055939934,"Biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) is linked to the development of hereditary and sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the absence of VHL, the α subunits of heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) are stabilized. Reactive oxygen species, generated by NAD(P)H oxidases, are involved in signaling cascades of malignant growth. We show that in VHL-deficient cells p22phox, Nox4 protein levels and NADPH-dependent superoxide generation are increased. Reintroduction of VHL into the VHL-deficient cells down-regulates the expression of p22phox and NADPH-dependent superoxide generation. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome in VHL-expressing cells increased p22phox protein levels, which correlated with an increase of NADPH-dependent superoxide generation. We also show that p22phox co-immunoprecipitates with VHL in vivo. Moreover, p22phox is a target of ubiquitination. Importantly, in VHL-deficient cells, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of Nox oxidases, decreased the expression of HIF-2α. Down-regulation of Nox1, Nox4, and p22phox expression by small interfering RNA also decreased HIF-2α protein expression and inhibited Akt and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, suggesting that a translational mechanism is involved in maintaining HIF-2α in VHL-deficient cells. Colony formation by RCC 786-O in soft agar was markedly inhibited by DPI. Moreover, DPI significantly inhibited RCC 786-O tumor formation in athymic mice. Collectively, the data demonstrate that VHL protein exerts its tumor suppressor action, at least partially, via inhibition of p22phox-based Nox4/Nox1 NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species generation.

We also show that p22phox co-immunoprecipitates with VHL in vivo. Moreover, p22phox is a target of ubiquitination. Importantly, in VHL-deficient cells, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of Nox oxidases, decreased the expression of HIF-2α. Down-regulation of Nox1, Nox4, and p22phox expression by small interfering RNA also decreased HIF-2α protein expression and inhibited Akt and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, suggesting that a translational mechanism is involved in maintaining HIF-2α in VHL-deficient cells. Colony formation by RCC 786-O in soft agar was markedly inhibited by DPI. Moreover, DPI significantly inhibited RCC 786-O tumor formation in athymic mice. Collectively, the data demonstrate that VHL protein exerts its tumor suppressor action, at least partially, via inhibition of p22phox-based Nox4/Nox1 NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species generation.

The Nox family of NAD(P)H oxidases have a core structure consisting of six transmembrane domains, including two heme-binding regions located at the N terminus and a cytoplasmic C terminus containing FAD- and NADPH-binding regions. There are five NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms in mammalian cells. Recent evidence indicates an important role for redox-regulated signaling in neoplastic growth. Nox1 overexpression transforms normal fibroblasts and creates a cell that is tumorigenic in athymic mice (9Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K.

In this study, we provide the first evidence that VHL regulates NADPH-dependent ROS generation by regulating the protein expression of p22phox, a key component in the activation of NAD(P)H oxidases. In addition, we show that generation of ROS activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-dependent translational pathway mediating HIF-2α protein accumulation in VHL-deficient cells. Furthermore, specific inhibition of ROS generation via flavoprotein enzymes down-regulates HIF-2α protein expression, cell growth in vitro, and tumor formation in vivo. Materials—Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), rotenone, antimycin, l-NAME, MG132, wortmannin, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were all purchased from Sigma. LY29004 and epoxomicin were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture, Transfection, Adenovirus Infection, and Preparation of Cell Lysates—Human renal proximal tubular cells (HK2). VHL-deficient cells (RCC 786-O), and VHL-expressing ACHN cells (from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (HK2 cells) or in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (RCC 786-O and ACHN) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Dominant-negative Akt pCMV6-HA-Akt (K179M) was kindly provided by G. G. Choudhury. RCC 786-O cells were infected with adenovirus vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection. As a control for the effects of adenovirus infection alone, Ad GFP, containing green fluorescence protein, was used. NADPH-dependent superoxide anion generation in cell homogenates was measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously (14Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For transient transfection assays, HK2 or RCC 786-O cells were transiently transfected with p22phox, pVP-FLAG (empty vector), or VHL-FLAG (generous gift from W. G. Kaelin) using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h post-transfection, cell homogenates were prepared for lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence as described below. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), designed by Dharmacon, were transfected at 200 nm in a double transfection using X-treme Gene. Briefly, RCC 786-O cells were plated in antibiotic-free medium to obtain ∼40% confluency on the day of transfection. 200 nm scrambled control or specific siRNA was added to the cells. 24 h later, the medium was aspirated, and fresh medium minus antibiotics was added to the cells. The transfection was repeated, and 48 h later the cells were harvested for Western blot analysis. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Anti-Nox4 antibody was generated as described previously (15Gorin Y.

Anti-HIF-2α and GAPDH were from Novus Biologicals, and anti-actin, anti-FLAG (M2), and β-tubulin were from Sigma. Nox1 and p22phox were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, pAkt and p4E-BP1 from Cell Signaling, and anti-HA from Roche Applied Science. Between 25 and 70 μg of total protein was typically analyzed by immunoblotting. After exposure with the indicated primary antibody, the immunoblots were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit/mouse-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) followed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation-Western—Assays were conducted using whole cell lysates generated with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. For immunoprecipitations, the amount of lysate used was normalized to an equal amount of total protein, as determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad) or direct Western blot of the protein of interest, and ranged between 200 and 500 μg depending on expression levels. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using 8.8 μg of FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or 2 μg of HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). The immunoprecipitates were bound to protein A- or G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed on the immunoprecipitated material or on 30 μg of total cell lysate per gel lane. Measurement of Intracellular ROS Production—Intracellular ROS were measured as described previously (16Kim N.H. Rincon-Choles H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G. Ghosh Abboud H.E. Gorin Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F741-F751Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution without phenol red and then incubated for 15 min in the dark at 37 °C with the same solution containing the peroxide-sensitive fluorophore 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Molecular Probes) at 5 μmol/liter. DCF-DA fluorescence was detected at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 520 nm, respectively, as measured with a multiwell fluorescence plate reader (Wallac 1420 Victor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). NADPH Oxidase Assay—NADPH oxidase activity was measured by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method as described (14Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells or tumor tissue was homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) by using a Dounce homogenizer (100 strokes on ice). Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove the unbroken cells and debris, and aliquots were used immediately. To start the assay, 100-μl aliquots of homogenates were added to 900 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, 5 μm lucigenin, and 100 μm NADPH. Photon emission in terms of relative light units was measured in a luminometer every 30 s for 5 min. There was no measurable activity in the absence of NADPH. Superoxide anion production was expressed as relative chemiluminescence (light) units (RLU)/mg protein. Protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. S.E. was calculated for each set of samples. RT-PCR—Primers were designed as described previously (17Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D.

Total RNA was isolated from the indicated cell cultures, and the RT-PCR reaction was carried out using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 15 min; 95 °C for 1.5 min; 28 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 45 s; 72 °C for 5 min, 4 °C. End products were resolved on a 2.0% agarose gel. Soft Agar Growth Assays—Anchorage-independent growth was determined by the ability of cells to form colonies in soft agar. RCC 786-O cells were treated for 24 h in buffer alone (Me2SO) or DPI (10 μm). After 24 h treatment, viable cells of both buffer- and DPI-treated (11,000 cells/plate) were grown in 0.3% agar on a cushion of 0.6% agar containing Me2SO (buffer) or DPI (10 μm) in 6-well plates. RCC 786-O cell growth was allowed to proceed for ∼25 days. Colonies were stained using a cell stain solution (Chemicon). Tumorigenesis Assays—Nude mouse xenograft assays were performed as described (18Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 439-444Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, six-week-old male athymic nude (BALB/c, nu/nu) mice were injected with RCC 786-O cells. The cells, (1 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and injected subcutaneously. Tumors were allowed to grow for 10 weeks after which treatment with DPI (1 mg/kg body weight/day) or vehicle alone was initiated. Tumor volume (mm3) was monitored every week for 3 weeks using calipers. Mice were then euthanized and the tumors excised and snap-frozen. All experiments using mice were approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. ROS Generation Is Increased in VHL-deficient RCC 786-O Cells as Compared with HK2 Renal Proximal Tubule Cells—Superoxide anion (O¯2) production in renal cancer cell lines was measured as lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence using NADPH as the substrate. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that the rate of superoxide formation in the VHL negative renal carcinoma cell line RCC 786-O is higher than in the HK2 cells or VHL positive renal carcinoma ACHN cells. The increased ROS generation in RCC 786-O cells was confirmed using the peroxide-sensitive fluorescence probe DCF-DA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that VHL deficiency is associated with increased NADPH-dependent superoxide generation. To confirm a role for VHL in the regulation of ROS production, wild-type VHL-FLAG or empty vector were introduced into the VHL-deficient RCC 786-O cells. Anti-FLAG immunoblotting of cell lysates showed significant expression of VHL protein in VHL-transfected cells (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 1). ROS generation was measured in parallel by NADPH-dependent lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. NADPH-dependent superoxide generation was suppressed in RCC 786-O cells transiently transfected with VHL-FLAG as compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1E). RCC 786-O cells constitutively express HIF-2α but do not express HIF-1α (19Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4179) Google Scholar). We analyzed HIF-2α protein expression in lysates from 786-O cells transfected with VHL-FLAG or control vector-transfected cells. Fig. 1F shows a marked decrease in HIF-2α protein expression in VHL-FLAG-transfected RCC 786-O cells compared with the vector-transfected cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that VHL inhibits NADPH-dependent ROS generation and down-regulates HIF-2α protein expression. ROS Generated by Flavoprotein Oxidase(s) Maintain HIF-2α Protein Expression, an Effect of Diphenyleneiodonium—To analyze the effect of NADPH-dependent ROS generation on HIF-2α protein, we used DPI, an inhibitor of flavoprotein-containing oxidases. Fig. 2A shows that DPI decreases HIF-2α protein expression in a time-dependent manner. HK2 cells were used as a negative control for HIF-2α protein expression. These data indicate that ROS maintain HIF-2α protein expression. DPI inhibits electron transport by NAD(P)H oxidases as well as other flavin-containing enzymes. Major contributors to ROS generation that are NADPH-dependent and contain a flavoprotein domain include respiratory complexes of the mitochondria, nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), and the Nox family members. To confirm the source of intracellular ROS that are involved in HIF-2α protein expression, we used pharmacologic inhibitors to block other sources of ROS: rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; antimycin, an inhibitor of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; l-NAME, an inhibitor of NOS; and DPI, a flavoprotein inhibitor. Fig. 2B shows that inhibitors of mitochondria, rotenone and antimycin, and the NOS inhibitor l-NAME did not affect HIF-2α protein expression after a 24-h incubation in RCC 786-O cells. On the other hand, DPI did cause downregulation of HIF-2α protein expression. These data indicate that the activity of NAD(P)H oxidase(s) is required for HIF-2α protein expression in VHL-deficient cells. VHL Deficiency Is Associated with Up-regulation of NAD(P)H Oxidases—To determine which NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms are expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells and RCC cells, mRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR, and the end products were resolved on an agarose gel. Both Nox1 and Nox4 mRNAs are expressed in HK2 cells as well as in RCC 786-O cells, whereas Nox2, Nox3, and Nox5 mRNAs were not detected (Fig. 3A). Expression of Nox1 mRNA is comparable in RCC 786-O and HK2 cells. However, Nox4 mRNA levels were higher in RCC 786-O cells compared with HK2 cells (Fig. 3A, lower panel versus upper panel). The steady state protein levels of these oxidases were also determined by Western analysis. Consistent with the RT-PCR results, Nox4 protein expression is higher in VHL-deficient RCC 786-O cells than in HK2 cells (Fig. 3B, Nox4). We did not detect any difference in protein expression of Nox1 in HK2 versus RCC 786-O cells by Western analysis (data not shown). We next analyzed the expression of p22phox, the membrane-bound subunit that binds to and potentiates the activities of both Nox1 and Nox4. Strikingly, p22phox levels were higher in the RCC 786-O VHL-deficient cell line compared with HK2 cells (Fig. 3B). It is likely that the increased ROS generation in VHL-deficient cells is due to the increased expression of p22phox subunit required for activation of Nox1 and Nox4. To examine the involvement of VHL in regulation of p22phox, VHL was transfected into VHL-deficient cells. Introduction of VHL resulted in a decrease in p22phox levels compared with vector-transfected RCC 786-O cells (Fig. 3C). Proteasome Inhibitors Increase NADPH Oxidase Activity and Increase the Expression of p22phox—VHL is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates protein degradation via the 26 S proteasome. We next determined whether p22phox protein expression was regulated through the 26 S proteasome. VHL-expressing HK2 cells were treated with proteasomal inhibitors. In the presence of MG132, NADPH-dependent superoxide generation was increased (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin and MG132 increased the expression of p22phox (Fig. 4, B and C). We did not observe changes in the steady state protein levels of Nox1 and Nox4 (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that a proteasomal pathway regulates p22phox expression. p22phox Interacts with VHL in Vivo—To examine whether p22phox and VHL can interact in vivo, 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged p22phox (p22phox-HA) and FLAG-tagged VHL (VHL-FLAG) followed by immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies and immunoblot analysis with FLAG antibodies. The data show that VHL-FLAG co-precipitate with p22phox-HA (Fig. 5A). Importantly, when the same blot was probed for p22phox, an immunoreactive band was detected at ∼23 kDa, representing p22phox-HA. In addition, several higher molecular mass species of p22phox were observed (Fig. 5B). This suggested a post-translational modification of p22phox. To examine whether the higher molecular mass species could be an ubiquitinated form of p22phox, we probed the blot for ubiquitin. Fig. 5C shows that anti-ubiquitin immunoreacts with the higher molecular mass species, which matches the pattern observed with anti-p22phox. This suggests that p22phox is modified by ubiquitin in vivo. In the reciprocal experiment, antibodies against FLAG were used for immunoprecipitation of VHL followed by immunoblot analysis for p22phox. Western analysis of the immunoprecipitate from the transfected cell lysates indicates a p22phox-immunoreactive band representing HA-tagged p22phox (Fig. 5D). These data demonstrate that p22phox and VHL interact in vivo. p22phox and Nox Oxidases Regulate HIF-2α Protein Accumulation—To examine the contribution of Nox oxidase components to HIF-2α expression, we employed knockdown strategy. siRNAs to hNox1, hNox4, and hp22phox were transiently transfected into RCC 786-O cells. Successful knock-down of Nox1 and Nox4 (Fig. 6A) and p22phox (Fig. 6C) was evaluated by Western analysis. HIF-2α protein levels were decreased in siNox1 as well as in siNox4 knockdown cell lysates compared with scrambled control cell lysates. In cells transfected with both siNox1 and siNox4, we also observed a decrease in HIF-2α protein levels (Fig. 6B). Importantly, knock-down of p22phox alone significantly decreased HIF-2α protein levels (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that Nox oxidases, including the subunit p22phox, are important mediators that contribute to HIF-2α protein expression in VHL-deficient cells. Nox Oxidases Increase HIF-2a Protein Accumulation through a Translational Mechanism—We determined the potential mechanisms of Nox-dependent HIF-2α protein accumulation in VHL-deficient cells. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein translation, but not actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription, decreased HIF-2α protein (Fig. 7A). To further investigate a translational pathway in HIF-2α protein regulation, we evaluated a known pathway linked to translational regulation often activated in cancer, the PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling pathway culminates in phosphorylation of components essential for the cap-dependent translational machinery such as 4E-BP1. Incubation of RCC 786-O cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY29004 blocks HIF-2α protein accumulation (Fig. 7A, left panel), indicating that PI3K activity is required for HIF-2α protein expression. Inhibition of PI3K was also associated with decreased phosphorylation of Akt and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 7B). The role of Akt in HIF-2α expression was examined by infecting RCC 786-O cells with an adenovirus vector expressing a dominant-negative mutant of Akt (Ad DN-Akt). GFP adenovirus was infected as a control. Expression of Ad DN-Akt inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and blocked HIF-2α protein accumulation similar to the effect of inhibition of PI3K and protein synthesis (Fig. 7, A and B, CHX). Cycloheximide, LY29004, and wortmannin had no effect on NADPH oxidase activity, suggesting that ROS generation is upstream of the translational pathway (data not shown). To elucidate the role of Akt as a potential mechanism by which p22phox-based Nox oxidases regulate HIF-2α protein accumulation, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p22phox, Nox1, and Nox4 was performed in RCC 786-O cells, and the phosphorylation of Akt was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Knock-down of p22phox was as efficient as either Nox alone or in combination (siNox1 + siNox4) in decreasing the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 7C). Importantly, the phosphorylation of the downstream target of PI3K/Akt pathway, 4E-BP1, was also efficiently inhibited by the down-regulation of p22phox (Fig. 7D). These data suggest that p22phox is a pivotal component of the Nox oxidase that regulate the PI3K/Akt/4E-BP1 signaling cascade leading to enhanced translation of HIF-2α protein expression in VHL-deficient cells. However, other mechanisms of HIF-2α regulation cannot be excluded. DPI Blocks RCC 786-O Colony Formation in Soft Agar—Because HIF-2α expression is maintained in cells with increased flavoprotein oxidase-dependent ROS generation, we determined the effect of inhibition of ROS generation on tumor cell growth in vitro. Colony formation in agar gel was used as an in vitro assay for anchorage-independent growth. Colony formation by RCC 786-O cells in soft agar medium was assessed in the presence or absence of DPI. Fig. 8A shows RCC 786-O cells forming colonies in soft agar (left panel), which was inhibited in the presence of DPI (right panel). The number of colonies were counted and normalized as percent of control (Fig. 8B). Moreover, we found that cellular proliferation was markedly decreased in DPI-treated cells compared with cells treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of ROS generation results in down-regulation of HIF-2α protein expression in RCC cells in the absence of VHL and is associated with a decrease in the growth of tumor cells. DPI Blocks RCC 786-O Tumor Growth in Vivo—We next examined the ability of DPI to block tumor formation in an in vivo model. RCC 786-O cells were administered subcutaneously into nude mice. After 10 weeks of growth, tumor size was measured, and DPI or vehicle was injected subcutaneously at 1 mg/kg body weight/day. Animals were followed for an additional 3 weeks, and the tumor size was measured each week. Tumor enlargement was measured as -fold increase from the start of treatment (10 weeks) until sacrifice (13 weeks). There was a significant decrease in tumor mass in the DPI-treated animals Fig. 9A. Fig. 9B confirms that DPI did block NADPH-dependent oxidase activity in the tumors. Therefore, blocking ROS generation by NAD(P)H-dependent oxidases, most likely Nox1 and Nox4, inhibits tumor growth in athymic mice. This study demonstrates that VHL deficiency increases the expression and activity of NAD(P)H oxidases. ROS generation through p22phox and activation of Nox1 and Nox4 help maintain HIF-2α expression and thereby contribute to renal carcinogenesis. Nox oxidases represent targets for treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Different approaches were used to detect ROS generation in normal renal epithelial cells (HK2), VHL(+/+) renal carcinoma cells (ACHN), and VHL(–/–) RCC 786-O cell lines. NAD(P)H oxidase activity and ROS production in the VHL-deficient renal cancer cell line RCC 786-O is much higher than in normal renal epithelial HK2 cells or VHL (+/+) ACHN cells. Importantly, we have shown that reintroducing VHL into the VHL-deficient cells reduces ROS production and decreases p22phox protein levels. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that VHL regulates NADPH-dependent ROS generation. VHL is mutated in 80% of sporadic renal carcinomas, and as a result, HIF transcription factors are constitutively expressed in an oxygen-independent manner. HIF expression in VHL-deficient cells leads to the up-regulation of genes involved in renal carcinogenesis. In nude mice, down-regulation of HIF-2α is sufficient to impair the growth of tumors (18Kondo K. Kim W.Y. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Because HIF-2α is a critical downstream target of VHL with respect to suppression of renal carcinogenesis, it is important to identify the pathways involved in the regulation of HIF-2α protein expression. VHL-deficient cells provide a unique opportunity to discover and evaluate these upstream mediators. The increased ROS generation in VHL-deficient cells, maintains the expression of HIF-2α protein levels, because inhibition of ROS generation by the flavoprotein inhibitor, DPI, results in a decrease of HIF-2α protein levels in RCC 786-O cells. Similar results were obtained in another VHL-deficient cell line that expresses HIF-2α (A498; data not shown). Taken together, our data suggest a novel association between NADPH-dependent ROS generation and HIF-2α protein expression. We have extensively characterized the source of enzymatic activity involved in the expression of HIF-2α. Flavoprotein-containing ROS-generating enzymes include NOS, complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and the NAD(P)H oxidases of the Nox family. Previous studies have implicated the generation of ROS by mitochondria or NAD(P)H oxidases as mediators of HIF-1α protein stabilization and activation (8Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E.

Our data strongly support a role for the Nox proteins in maintaining HIF-2α expression based on several observations. Inhibitors of complex I and III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain or inhibition of NOS had no effect on HIF-2α protein expression. DPI is often used to delineate the role of the Nox family of flavoproteins. Indeed, DPI elicited a marked decrease of HIF-2α expression in RCC 786-O cells. We have identified Nox1 and Nox4 as the major Nox catalytic sources of superoxide anion production. Nox4 and p22phox (a known interacting protein with Nox1 and Nox4) are highly expressed in VHL-deficient cells compared with the HK2 cells. The levels of Nox4 and p22phox are also elevated in another VHL-deficient cell line (A498; data not shown). It has been shown previously that a subset of brain tumor cell lines derived from human glioblastomas aberrantly express Nox4 (17Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that VHL is often mutated in glioblastomas (22Kanno H. Shuin T. Kondo K. Yamamoto I. Ito S. Shinonaga M. Yoshida M. Yao M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1035-1038PubMed Google Scholar). p22phox is an integral membrane protein that directly binds to and is required for the activation of both Nox1 and Nox4 (23Ambasta R.K. Kumar P.

In particular, Nox1 activity is dependent on a stable complex formation with p22phox and other regulatory subunits (23Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K. Schmidt H.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P. J. Biol.

Nox4, on the other hand, produces a significant amount of superoxide in a constitutive manner; this production is increased upon its association with p22phox. Knockdown of endogenous p22phox by RNAi results in reduced Nox4 activity (23Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K. Schmidt H.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45935-45941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 29Martyn K.D. Frederick L.M. von Loehneysen K. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Our data show a decrease in p22phox protein levels and NADPH-dependent ROS generation upon reintroduction of VHL into VHL-deficient cells. The regulation of p22phox is currently unknown. We show a role for the 26 S proteasome in p22phox regulation, because proteasomal inhibitors increase p22phox protein levels and NADPH-dependent superoxide generation. We also show for the first time that p22phox binds VHL in vivo. Moreover, we provide evidence that p22phox is a target for ubiquitination, providing a potential mechanism of p22phox regulation in VHL-deficient cells. We hypothesize that VHL binding to p22phox inhibits the activation of the Nox oxidase complex and leads to destabilization of p22phox protein. The data also demonstrate an important role for specific Nox oxidases in downstream HIF-2α protein accumulation. In RCC 786-O cells transiently transfected with siRNA to Nox4, we observed a small but significant decrease in HIF-2α protein levels. Knockdown of Nox1 produces a clear inhibition of HIF-2α protein levels. Interestingly, it has been shown that up-regulation of Nox1 activity by hypoxia enhances HIF-1α-dependent gene expression via increased ROS (21Goyal P. Weissmann N. Grimminger F. Hegel C. Bader L. Rose F. Fink L. Ghofrani H.A. Schermuly R.T. Schmidt H.H. Seeger W. Hanze J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, our data show that even down-regulation of p22phox alone can markedly decrease the protein expression of HIF-2α. The mechanism by which ROS generation maintains HIF-2α protein expression in VHL-deficient cells requires p22phox-based Nox1 and Nox4 regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, culminating in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 for ongoing protein translation. Similar regulation of HIF-1α has been demonstrated. For example, attenuation of PI3K/Akt decreased HIF-1α protein in VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC4) without altering the steady state of HIF-1α mRNA (30Zhou J. Schmid T. Frank R. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13506-13513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that maintenance of the nonhypoxic ROS-dependent increase of HIF-1α protein expression by angiotensin II relies on ongoing protein translation in a p22phox/PI3K-dependent manner (31Page E.L. Robitaille G.A. Pouyssegur J. Richard D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48403-48409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We determined the functional consequences of inhibition of ROS generation. Colony formation by RCC 786-O in soft agar was markedly inhibited by DPI. To determine the relevance of our in vitro observations to tumor growth in vivo, athymic mice harboring RCC 786-O tumors were treated with DPI or vehicle. DPI-treated animals had a significant decrease in tumor size. Our data indicate that increased expression and activation of NAD(P)H oxidases result in enhanced ROS generation in VHL-deficient cells. Specific catalytic NAD(P)H oxidases Nox1 and Nox4 and their regulatory subunit p22phox are up-regulated and activated by VHL deficiency, leading to increased HIF-2α expression and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of flavoprotein oxidases, and in particular the blockade of p22phox binding to these oxidases, represents an alternative approach to the down-regulation of HIF-2α expression and its target pathways involved in renal carcinogenesis.

IRAK mediates the activation of TAK1 by bringing TRAF6 to form a complex with TAK1-TAB1-TAB2-TAB3, which are shown to be preassociated on the membrane. This membrane-bound IRAK-TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2-TAB3 complex has been designated as Complex II (Fig. 1). Through an unknown mechanism, TRAF6-TAK1-TAB1-TAB2-TAB3 (Fig. 1, Complex II) is dissociated from IRAK and translocated from the membrane to the cytosol, where TAK1 is activated.

TRAF6, a Ring domain protein, has been shown recently to function as a ubiquitin protein ligase E3, and TRAF6 itself is the target of ubiquitination, which has been shown to activate TAK1 through an unknown mechanism. Once activated, TAK1 leads to the phosphorylation of IKKβ and MKK6, resulting in the activation of both the JNK and NFκB signaling pathways. In addition to TAK1, MEKK2 and MEKK3 have also been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPK, leading to the activation of NFκB and JNK (25Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E.

Intriguingly, although IL-1-induced JNK activation was completely abolished, NFκB activation was only partially impaired in TAK1-deficient cells, implicating an additional NFκB activation mechanism for the IL-1 pathway. Here, through the study of IRAK modification, we uncovered two parallel IL-1-mediated signaling pathways for NFκB activation, TAK1-dependent and MEKK3-dependent pathways, respectively (Fig. 1). These two pathways bifurcate at the level of IRAK modification. The TAK1-dependent pathway leads to IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKβ activation, resulting in classical NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The TAK1-independent MEKK3-dependent pathway involves IKKγ phosphorylation and IKKα activation, resulting in NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation from NFκB but without IκBα degradation.

TAK1 Inhibitor Treatment—The TAK1 inhibitor (5Z-7-oxozeaenol) was purchased from AnalytiCon Discovery GmbH (catalog number NP-009245). Stock solutions were made up at 10 mm in Me2SO. To block the TAK1 activity, wild type, MEKK3–/–, or IKKα–/– MEFs were pretreated with 600 nm of TAK1 inhibitor for 3 h prior to IL-1β treatment. Virus Infections—MEFs were infected with adenovirus (provided by Frank Mercurio at Celgene (San Diego)) expressing either green fluorescent protein (control), IKKβ, or kinase-inactive IKKβ. The titer of each adenovirus stock used for infection was as follows: green fluorescent protein = 3 × 108, IKKβ = 5 × 108, and kinase-inactive IKKβ = 1 × 109 virus particles/ml. After 18 h, the infected cells were stimulated with IL-1 or were unstimulated. The production of retrovirus and infection has been described previously (35Li X. Commane M. Nie H. Hua X.

IRAK-deficient cells have been used effectively to study the function of IRAK in IL-1-dependent signaling (11Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell.

NFκB and JNK activation were greatly reduced in IL-1-treated IRAK-deficient cells, but these responses are restored in IRAK-deficient cells transfected with IRAK, indicating that IRAK is required for both. Analysis of IRAK deletion mutants showed that the truncated IRAK protein DD + UD + C1 (containing the DD, UD, and C1 domains) is sufficient to restore IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK activation in IRAK-deficient cells. Like the full-length IRAK, DD + UD + C1 is phosphorylated after it is recruited to the receptor, subsequently ubiquitinated, and eventually degraded upon IL-1 stimulation (11Li X. Commane M. Burns C.

Treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase leads to loss of several IL-1-induced shifted IRAK bands, confirming that they are phosphorylated forms (11Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-IRAK antibody followed by Western analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (39Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of IRAK modification in IL-1 signaling, much effort has been devoted to map IRAK phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites. Because protein ubiquitination occurs on lysine residues, we mutated all three lysines in DD + UD + C1 (Fig. 2A, lysines at 32, 134, and 179) individually and in combinations. These mutants were then transfected into IRAK-deficient cells and tested for their modification and degradation in response to IL-1 stimulation. Although DD + UD + C1 was phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded (degradation is complete 6 h after stimulation (data not shown)), a point mutation changing lysine 134 to arginine completely abolished IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, the K134R mutant was still phosphorylated upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2D). We have shown previously that the kinase-inactive mutant of IRAK is still phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded upon IL-1 stimulation (11Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We mutated lysine 134 to arginine in the kinase-inactive full-length IRAK in order to mimic DD + UD + C1 (which does not contain the kinase domain), eliminating modification initiated by IRAK autophosphorylation. The full-length ubiquitination mutant (IRAK1 KD ubmt) was modified upon IL-1 stimulation but with greatly reduced degradation as compared with the full-length IRAK (IRAK1 KD mt) (Fig. 2E). Treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase leads to loss of IL-1-induced shifted IRAK bands of the full-length ubiquitination mutant (IRAK1 KD ubmt), confirming that they are phosphorylated forms (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that the full-length ubiquitination mutant (IRAK1 KD ubmt) is probably still phosphorylated but deficient in ubiquitination in response to IL-1 stimulation, indicating that lysine 134 is an important site for IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Protein ubiquitination occurs on conserved lysine residues near the phosphoacceptor serines or threonines, and protein phosphorylation precedes ubiquitination (40Ciechanover A. Gonen H. Bercovich B.

Rosette C. Wu-Li J. SuYang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies indeed suggested that phosphorylation of IRAK is probably required for its ubiquitination and degradation (42Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To identify the phosphorylation sites, we mutated serines and threonines adjacent to K134R to alanines ((S/T)A (131–144), Ser131, Ser137, Ser138, Ser140, Thr141 and Ser144) in the truncated form of IRAK (DD + UD + C1) (Fig. 2, B and D). The mutation of these sites reduced IL-1-induced IRAK phosphorylation (Fig. 2D) and abolished IRAK ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 2B). We then mutated the same sites in the kinase-inactive full-length IRAK. The full-length phosphorylation mutant (IRAK1 KD pmt) altered the modification pattern of the full-length IRAK and greatly reduced its ubiquitination and degradation in response to IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2G). The Impact of IRAK Modification on IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK Activation—To investigate the role of IRAK modification in IL-1 signaling, the above IRAK mutants defective in IRAK modification were examined for their ability to restore IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK activation in IRAK-deficient cells. For all of the following experiments, pools of IRAK-deficient cells stably transfected with IRAK modification mutants were used and the expression levels of the IRAK mutants were shown in Fig. 3A. Both ubiquitination (K134R) and phosphorylation ((S/T)A (131–144)) mutants in the truncated form (DD + UD + C1) or the full-length IRAK fully restored IL-1-induced NFκB activation in IRAK-deficient cells, as measured by NFκB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3B), IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), and NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter assay (data not shown). However, IL-1-induced IκBα degradation was greatly reduced in IRAK-deficient cells transfected with these IRAK modification mutants (Fig. 3C), implicating a specific role of IRAK modification in the NFκB activation pathway. Because IκBα expression is induced upon IL-1 stimulation, we used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to inhibit the new synthesis of IκBα so that IL-1-induced IκBα degradation can be more easily detected. We confirmed the lack of IL-1-induced IκBα degradation in the presence of protein synthesis inhibition in IRAK-deficient cells transfected with the IRAK modification mutants (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, these IRAK mutants only partially restored IL-1-induced JNK activation in IRAK-deficient cells, indicating the importance of IRAK modification in IL-1 signaling (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3The impact of mutation in IRAK modification on IL-1-induced NFκB and JNK activation. A, Western analysis. Cell lysates from wild type 293, IRAK-deficient (IRAK-null), or IRAK-deficient cells stably transfected with truncated IRAK constructs (DD + UD + C1, (S/T)A (131–144) and K134R) and full-length kinase-inactive IRAK constructs (IRAK KD, IRAK KDubmt, IRAK KD pmt) were analyzed by Western blot with anti-IRAK and anti-actin antibodies.

Wild type 293, IRAK-deficient (IRAK-null), and IRAK-deficient cells stably transfected with truncated IRAK constructs (DD + UD + C1, (S/T)A (131–144), and K134R) and IRAK kinase-inactive full-length constructs (IRAK KD mt, IRAK KD ubmt, and IRAK KD pmt) were either untreated or treated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a NFκB-specific probe. C–E, Western analyses. 293 wild type cells, IRAK-deficient cells, and IRAK-deficient cells stably transfected with IRAK modification mutants in the truncated IRAK (DD + UD + C1, (S/T)A (131–144) and K134R) or kinase-inactive full length (IRAK KD mt, IRAK KD pmt, and IRAK KD ubmt) were either untreated or treated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blots with anti-pIκBα, anti-IκBα, anti-pJNK, anti-JNK, or anti-actin. D, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) (20 μg/ml) for 2 h before stimulation with IL-1.

As shown in Fig. 4A, whereas modified IRAK forms a complex with TAK1 upon IL-1 stimulation in wild type 293 cells and IRAK-deficient cells transfected with the truncated IRAK (DD + UD + C1), IL-1-induced interaction between IRAK and TAK1 was abolished in IRAK-deficient cells transfected with IRAK phosphorylation and ubiquitination mutants, indicating that IRAK modification is required for the interaction of IRAK with TAK1. Previous studies showed that IL-1 stimulation leads to TAK1 phosphorylation and TAK1 activation in an IRAK-dependent manner (22Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the IRAK mutants failed to interact with TAK1 upon IL-1 stimulation, we suspect that these mutants have also lost the ability to activate TAK1. As shown in Fig. 4, B–D, the IRAK modification mutants indeed failed to activate the TAK1 in response to IL-1 stimulation, including TAK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) and TAK1 kinase activity (Fig. 4D). IL-1-induced TAK1 phosphorylation was confirmed by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that IRAK modification is required for the interaction of IRAK with TAK1, thereby mediating the activation of TAK1. IRAK Modification Mutants Formed Complex with TRAF6 and ME"
https://openalex.org/W2023223864,"The potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida is a serious pest of potato crops. Nematode FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) are one of the most diverse neuropeptide families known, and modulate sensory and motor functions. As neuromuscular function is a well-established target for parasite control, parasitic nematode FLP signaling has significant potential in novel control strategies. In the absence of transgenic parasitic nematodes and the reported ineffectiveness of neuronal gene RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans, nothing is known about flp function in nematode parasites. In attempts to evaluate flp function in G. pallida, we have discovered that, unlike in C. elegans, these genes are readily susceptible to RNAi. Silencing any of the five characterized G. pallida flp genes (Gp-flp-1, -6, -12, -14, or -18) incurred distinct aberrant behavioral phenotypes consistent with key roles in motor function. Further delineation of these effects revealed that double-stranded RNA exposure time (> or = 18 h) and concentration (> or = 0.1 microg/ml) were critical to the observed effects, which were reversible. G. pallida flp genes are essential to coordinated locomotory activities, do not display redundancy, and are susceptible to RNAi, paving the way for the investigation of RNAi-mediated flp gene silencing as a novel plant parasite control strategy."

The bioluminescence color of firefly luciferases is determined by the luciferase structure and assay conditions. Among different beetle luciferases, those from Phrixothrix railroad worm emit either yellow or red bioluminescence colors. Sequence alignment analysis shows that the red-emitter luciferase from Phrixothrix hirtus has an additional Arg residue at 353, which is absent in firefly luciferases. We report here the construction and purification of a mutant at residue Arg356, which is not conserved in beetle luciferases. By insertion of an additional residue (Arg356) using site-specific insertion mutagenesis in a green-emitter luciferase (Lampyris turkestanicus) the color of emitted light was changed to red and the optimum temperature of activity was also increased. Insertion of this Arg in an important flexible loop showed changes of the bioluminescence color and the luciferase reaction took place with relatively retention of its basic kinetic properties such as Km and relative activity. Comparison of native and mutant luciferases using homology modeling reveals a significant conformational change of the flexible loop in the red mutant. Movement of flexible loop brought about a new ionic interaction concomitant with a change in polarity of the emitter site, thereby leading to red emission.

Luciferases are the enzymes that catalyze the light-emitting reactions in bioluminescent organisms. In beetles they catalyze a two-step oxidation of luciferin in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and molecular oxygen to produce light, oxyluciferin, CO2, and AMP (1White E.H. Rapaport E. Seliger H.H.

Although chemical reaction catalyzed by all beetle luciferases and the substrate (luciferin) are identical, these variations in color of emission are still observed (8Ugarova N.N. Brovko L.Y. Russ. Chem. Bull. Int. Ed. 2001; 50: 1752-1761Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One of the main basis for differences in the luciferases bioluminescence color is the property of the emitter in the microenvironment localized in the enzyme active site. The observed bioluminescence color of pH-sensitive luciferases (but not in click beetle and railroad worm luciferases) shifts to a red region in acidic medium (9Viviani V.R. Bechara E.J.H. Photochem.

Differences in bioluminescence color are also attributed to the luciferase structure (11Wood K.V. Lam A.Y. Seliger H.H. McElroy W.D.

Des.

Given these results, four mechanisms have been proposed to explain color variations in beetle luciferases. 1) The interaction between solvent and emitter (solvent effect) molecules that influences the difference of the energies between the ground and excited states and therefore maximum luminescence (16DeLuca M. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The interaction energy depends on the dynamic characteristics of the interaction such as the rate of reorientation of the solvent molecules around the excited emitter molecules (8Ugarova N.N. Brovko L.Y. Russ. Chem. Bull. Int. Ed. 2001; 50: 1752-1761Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 2) The interaction of basic residues of luciferase with oxyluciferin assist in oxyluciferin tautomerization (keto and enol). This implies that the BL spectra of beetle luciferases are determined by the ratios between enol (green-yellow emitter) and keto (red emitter) forms of excited oxyluciferin. The change in color under the acidic pH medium (red shift) in pH-sensitive luciferases can be explained by this mechanism (9Viviani V.R. Bechara E.J.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 490-495Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17White E.H. Branchini B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 3) The active site conformation, which could have an effect on the freedom of rotation of the oxyluciferin thiozolinic rings (18McCapra F. Gilfoyle D.J. Young D.W. Church N.J. Spencer P. Cambell A.K. Kricka L.J. Stanley P.E. Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Fundamentals and Applied Aspects.

John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1996: 7-15Google Scholar). On the other hand, it affects the rotation of excited oxyluciferin along the C2-C2′ bond. 4) According to a recently proposed mechanism, luciferase modulates emission color by controlling the resonance-based charge delocalization of the anionic keto form of the oxyluciferin-excited state (20Branchini B.R.

The crystal structure of luciferase without substrates from the North American firefly (Photinus pyralis) has been resolved (21Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism for the bioluminescence color change is still unclear.

Crystallographic data indicated that the degree of molecular rigidity of the excited oxyluciferin, which is controlled by a transient movement of Ile288 (in L. cruciata) determines the color of bioluminescence during the emission reaction (22Nakatsu T. Ichiyama S. Hiratake J. Saldanha A. Kobashi N. Sakata K. Kato H. Nature. 2006; 440: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Among all beetle luciferases, the Phrixotrix railroad worm luciferase is the only luciferase that naturally emits red light through two cephalic lanterns (λmax = 628 nm) in addition to the yellow-green bioluminescence (λmax = 542 nm) emitted through 11 pairs of lateral lanterns along the body. Phrixothrix hirtus red (PhRE) luciferase shows 46–49% identity with firefly luciferases. PhRE luciferase with a naturally red-emitting ability is a unique model to investigate the relationship of luciferase structure with BL color (14Viviani V.R. da Silva Neto A.J. Ohmiya Y. Protein Eng.

The sequence of multiple alignments of primary structure of PhRE with other firefly luciferases, which emit green light, showed the presence of Arg353 in PhRE luciferase, corresponding to a missed residue in other firefly luciferases. To identify the effect of this residue (Arg353) on bioluminescence color, we have inserted it in the corresponding position (Arg356) using site-specific mutagenesis in the Iranian firefly luciferase (Lampyris turkestanicus) (24Alipour B.S. Hosseinkhani S. Nikkhah M. Naderi-Manesh H. Chaichi M.J. Kazempour S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the effect of this residue on the BL spectra, kinetic properties, and structure were analyzed. BL spectra and molecular modeling results show that Arg356 has a critical role in determining BL color. The following reagents and kits were used: isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, kanamycin, and ATP (Roche), d-luciferin potassium salt (Sigma), restriction enzyme (Fermentase), Pfu polymerase, plasmid extraction kit, gel purification kit, and the PCR purification kit (Bioneer Co.), Ni-NTA spin kit (Qiagen Inc.), and the pET28a vector (Novagen). Insertion mutagenesis was performed using splicing overlap extension-PCR (25Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). Two pairs of primers were used for this purpose: F-Cloning containing the BamHI restriction site (5′-CGTTGGATCCATGGAAGATGCAAAAAATATTATG-3′), R-Cloning containing the HindIII restriction site (5′-CAGCAAGCTTTTACAATTTAGATTTTTTTCCCATC-3′). The overlapping primers, F-Mutant and R-Mutant, containing the Arg codon insertion, respectively, are: 5′-CACCCGAAGGGAGAGATGATAAACCAGGAGCATGTG-3′ and 5′-GTTTATCATCTCTCCCTTCGGGTGTAATTATAATTGC-3′. The cDNA for L. turkestanicus had been previously cloned in pQE30 plasmid (24Alipour B.S. Hosseinkhani S. Nikkhah M. Naderi-Manesh H. Chaichi M.J. Kazempour S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It was subcloned in pET28a plasmid in this study. The plasmid including the native luciferase was used as template. Two PCRs to perform primary amplification of the two DNA fragments to be spliced were carried out using F-Mutant, R-Cloning and F-Cloning, and R-Mutant by Pfu polymerase under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, a 25 cycle (94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1:30 min), and a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. Subsequently, primary PCRs products were purified using a clean up kit to remove redundant primers. The resulting fragments from primary PCRs were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio so that the amount of DNA added to a second PCR was around 100 ng. PCR conditions were the same as primary PCRs except that it was carried out for 10 cycles without primers. Finally, F- and R-cloning primers were added to each tube and the next step of PCR was performed. The mutagenesis products digested by BamHI/HindIII were inserted into the BamHI/HindIII restriction sites of digested/dephosphorylated pET28a high expression vector and ligated mixtures were transformed into competent cells of Escherchia coli BL21 by electroporation. Multiple sequence alignments were performed by utility ClustalW program of amino acid sequences of firefly luciferases and red-emitting railroad worm luciferase. Ten ml of 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin with a fresh bacterial colony harboring the expression plasmid was inoculated and grown at 37 °C overnight. Then 300 ml of medium with 500-μl overnight cultures was inoculated and grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until the A600 reaches 0.6. After which, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mm to the solution and incubated at 22 °C overnight with vigorous shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazol, pH 8) and stored at –70 °C for the next step. Purification of His6-tagged fusion protein was performed by the Ni-NTA spin column as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The color of emitted light of firefly luciferase reaction was obvious by luciferin addition to purified luciferases. Pictures of glowing colonies on LB-Agar plate and the mixture containing luciferases were taken by Konica 400 ASA film. P. pyralis luciferase was also purified under the same condition. pET28a containing native and mutant luciferase were sequenced using an automatic sequencer (MWG, Germany) by the T7 promoter and T7 terminator universal primers. ATP and luciferin kinetic parameters were measured at 25 °C. To estimate LH2 Km, 100 μl of assay reagent containing 20 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP in 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, was mixed with 50 μl of various concentrations of luciferin (from 0.01 to 2 mm) in a well of a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated with injection of 50 μl of diluted enzyme and light emission was recorded over 5 s (Orion microplate Luminometer, Berthold Detection System, Germany). The estimation of ATP kinetic constant was performed in a similar way but various concentrations of ATP were mixed with assay reagent including 20 mm MgSO4, 2 mm luciferin in 50 mm Tricine, pH 7.8. Apparent kinetic parameters were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The decay times of native and mutant luciferase were measured in 20 min and compared with luciferase from P. pyralis. The residual activity for each enzyme was reported as a percentage of the original activity. Approximate protein concentrations were calculated using a Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) and relative specific activities (enzyme activity/protein concentration) were also calculated. BL spectra were recorded using a Cary-Eclipse luminescence spectrophotometer (Varian) from 400 to 700-nm wavelengths. A volume of 300 μl of Tricine buffer, pH 7.8 and 5.5, including 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm luciferin, was added to 100 μl of purified luciferase solution (around 50 pg) in a quartz cell. The spectra were automatically corrected for photosensitivity of the equipment. The purified luciferases (10 μg/ml) were incubated at 22, 27, 32, and 37 °C for 10 min. Enzyme activities were measured at room temperature (25 °C) and the remaining activity were recorded as percentage of the original activity. To obtain optimum temperature of activity for native and mutant luciferase, activities were measured in the 20–37 °C range. Moreover, optimum pH of activity for both enzymes was measured by incubation of enzyme in a mixed buffer at the pH 5.5–9.5 range, respectively. Intrinsic Fluorescence—The purified luciferases were dialyzed in dialysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. Intrinsic fluorescence (0.01 μg/ml purified and dialyzed enzyme) was assayed. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the enzyme was performed in a Cary-Eclipse luminescence spectrophotometer (Varian). The fluorescence emission was scanned between 290 and 440 nm with an excitation wavelength of 296 nm. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter (Japan) using solutions with purified and dialyzed 0.2 mg/ml protein concentrations (far UV). Protein buffer was the same as fluorescence measurements. The results were expressed as molar ellipticity, [θ] (degree cm2 dmol–1), based on a mean amino acid residue weight (MRW) assuming its average weight for firefly luciferase. The molar ellipticity was determined as [θ] = (θ × 100 MRW)/(cl), where c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, l is the light path length in centimeters, and θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees at wavelength λ. The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid, assuming [θ]291 = 7820 degree cm2 dmol–1 (27Schippers P.H. Dekkers H.P.J.M. Anal. Chem. 1981; 53: 778-788Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and with JASCO standard nonhydroscopic ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate, assuming [θ]290.5 = 7910 degree cm2 dmol–1 (28Takakuwa T. Konno T. Meguro H.A. Anal. Sci. 1985; 1: 215-225Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Noise in the data was smoothed using JASCO J-715 software, including the fast Fourier transform noise reduction routine that allows enhancement of most noisy spectra without distorting their peak shapes (29Protasevich I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) search against the Protein Data Bank was used to obtain L. turkestanicus luciferase (Q5UFR2) homologues. P. pyralis firefly luciferase (PDB code 1LCI) shows 84% identity and 91% similarity with Q5UFR2 and therefore is useful as the PDB template in the SwissModel Alignment Interface protein modeling server (31Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar). With submission of multiple sequence alignment of luciferase sequence family and template, three-dimensional structure models of native and mutant luciferase were obtained. The fit between the three-dimensional structure of PDB 1LCI and models were evaluated in the SWISS-PDB Viewer by calculating the root mean square deviation after iterative fitting. The spatial position of ligand (5′-O-[n-(dehydroluciferyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine) was made by superposition of model structures with red-emitter Japanese firefly (L. cruciata) luciferase (S286N mutant) complexed with a high-energy intermediate analogue (PDB code 2D1T). Accessible surface areas of native and mutant proteins were also calculated by the GETAREA program (32Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar) and salt bridges were calculated by WHAT IF Web server (33Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of the Native and Mutant Luciferases—To identify the residue involved in the determination of BL color in luciferases, a multiple sequence alignment among firefly luciferases and the red-emitting railroad worm luciferase was performed (Fig. 1). Multiple sequence alignment showed the presence of Arg353 in PhRE luciferase, which corresponds to the deleted residue in firefly luciferases. As indicated in Fig. 1, Arg356 is missing in L. turkestanicus, as all the other green emitting luciferases. Therefore, we inserted this residue in the same position in luciferase from L. turkestanicus using PCR insertion mutagenesis. After cloning and transformation, the presence of Arg356 was confirmed by sequencing. Upon addition of d-luciferin, the photographs of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bright bacteria cells containing native and mutant luciferases were taken in a dark room at pH 7.8 and 5.5. For further purification and characterization of native and mutant forms, overexpressions of luciferases were carried out in the BL21 host. The purification of the His tag fusion luciferases was also performed by affinity (Ni-NTA-Sepharose) chromatography. The purified native and mutant luciferases had purities of more than 95% based on analyses by SDS-PAGE in which luciferase was present as a band of about 62 kDa. The color of the reaction upon addition of substrate to purified luciferase could be seen with the naked eye in the dark room (Fig. 2). Bioluminescence Emission Spectra—The in vitro bioluminescence spectra of native and mutant luciferases are indicated in Fig. 2. It is evident that rLuc(Arg) displays a bimodal spectrum with a maximum in the red region (at 615 nm) and a smaller shoulder at 560 nm in the green region, whereas the native luciferase exhibits a spectrum with the peak at 555 nm. The mutant form bioluminescence spectrum at the lower pH (pH 5.5) also has a shoulder in the green region, as indicated in Fig. 2; however, the shoulder in the green region was smaller at acidic pH. The emission spectrum for native luciferase was slightly changed under acidic condition. Influence of the Arg Insertion on the Kinetic Constants, Decay, and Thermostability—Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to estimate the apparent Km values for luciferin and ATP. The results (relative activity, optimum pH, and optimum temperature of activity in addition to Km toward LH2 and ATP) are shown in Table 1. The mutation has affected the performance of the enzyme, and whereas the Km value for ATP is approximately similar to native, that for LH2 is around 1.5 times higher in rLuc(Arg). The decay time of light emission for mutant luciferase was somewhat faster than the native form and is compared with P. pyralis (Fig. 3). A clear improvement in thermostability was also observed for mutant luciferase compared with the native form as indicated in Fig. 4. However, as indicated in Table 1, the astonishing finding was that the optimum temperature for the activity of the mutant enzyme is increased to 34 °C, which is 10 °C higher than native luciferase. In addition, optimum pH of the mutant also was slightly higher.TABLE 1Comparison of the rLuc and rLuc(Arg) kinetic propertiesMutantsLuciferin KmATP KmRelative specific activityλmax(nm)OptimumpH 7.8pH 5.5TemperaturepHμm%°CrLuc16135100555560248rLuc(Arg)2414281.6616, 555aIdentify of minor peaks.618, 560aIdentify of minor peaks.348.5a Identify of minor peaks.

The far UV CD spectra of the native and mutant forms of luciferase show subtle changes in the secondary structure of the protein. The content of the secondary structure elements of the native and mutant forms are also indicated in Fig. 5. An apparent increase of helical structure has occurred in luciferase upon addition of Arg356 to the primary structure. However, change of the helical structure is accompanied by a small decrease of unordered structures. On the other hand, as indicated in Fig. 6 an increase of fluorescence intensity has been observed for mutant (rLuc(Arg)) luciferase. Even small changes in the enzyme conformation have proven to affect the tryptophan fluorescence of proteins (34Riahi Madvar S. Hosseinkhani S. Khajeh K. Asoodeh A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4701-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).FIGURE 6Intrinsic fluorescence spectra for native (rLuc) and mutant (rLuc(Arg)) luciferase.

For further details see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Molecular Modeling—The crystal structure of P. pyralis firefly luciferase was used as template to elucidate the structure of the mutant L. turkestanicus luciferase. The sequence identity and sequence similarity were 84 and 91%, respectively. Superposition of the three-dimensional structures of native and mutant luciferase revealed quite similar structures, with an exception in the flexible loop conformation that was clearly changed (Fig. 7). Moreover, the insertion of this residue has disrupted some interactions and brought new ionic and hydrogen bonds as revealed by calculation of the geometry of ionic bonds. Emission of red bioluminescence is unusual among beetle luciferases. Generally, differences in bioluminescence color are caused by natural species variations in the luciferase structure (23Viviani V.R. Bechara E.J.H. Ohmiya Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8271-8279Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); amino acid substitutions introduced by mutagenesis techniques (8Ugarova N.N. Brovko L.Y. Russ. Chem. Bull. Int.

Optics. 2005; 10: 041210-1041210-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding of luciferase from the glowworm L. turkestanicus has been isolated using reverse transcriptase-PCR and functionally expressed in E. coli (24Alipour B.S. Hosseinkhani S. Nikkhah M. Naderi-Manesh H. Chaichi M.J. Kazempour S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 1, Arg356 in L. turkestanicus luciferase is absent as well as other luciferases. Bioluminescence catalyzed by L. turkestanicus as in P. pyralis luciferase in vivo and at pH 7.8 in vitro is yellow-green with an emission maximum of about 555 nm. The insertion of an additional residue (Arg356) in a critical region in L. turkestanicus luciferase brought about changes in both kinetic and structural properties of the enzyme. It is noteworthy that the native (rLuc) and mutant (rLuc(Arg)) luciferases catalyzed the emission of yellow-green and red light, respectively, and the corresponding emission spectra were approximately similar to those at pH values of 7.8 and 5.0 for native luciferase (Fig. 2). Apparently, insertion of an additional residue is responsible for changes of bioluminescence color. The mutant luciferase displays an asymmetric spectrum with a shoulder in the green region. The comparison of emission spectra of native and mutant luciferase revealed that the insertion of an additional Arg is responsible for the bimodal spectrum of mutant luciferase. The orange appearance of glowing colonies can be interpreted through bimodal emission spectra of mutant forms also (Fig. 2). Therefore, it may be suggested that the bioluminescence color is determined by the relative contribution of yellow-green and red wavelengths of emission peaks, each of which corresponds to different forms of excited oxyluciferin (enol-keto tatumerization or two forms of resonance hybrids) that is ultimately controlled by the protein structure. As indicated in Fig. 2 the presence of an additional Arg made the L. turkestanicus luciferase more sensitive to pH changes compared with the native form. Arg356 has been added in a region containing a flexible loop, 352TPEGDDKP359. Structural and molecular modeling studies show that the flexible loop is engaged in a network of many intermolecular hydrogen and ionic bonds with other residues in the backbone. As shown in Fig. 7, insertion of Arg356 in this flexible loop changes the peptide backbone conformation. On the other hand, calculation of geometry of ionic bonds revealed induction of a new ionic bond between Glu354 and Arg334 in the mutant luciferase. Therefore, it may be suggested that insertion of a new Arg and induction of a new ionic bond displaces the flexible loop exposing the active site to water and therefore resulting in red light emission, thereby opening the active site to the pH will be made. A similar result has been reported for another single mutant of firefly luciferase (38Viviani V.R. Oehlmeyer T.L. Arnoldi F.G. Brochetto-Braga M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). According to a recently suggested alternative mechanism for interpreting bioluminescence color in firefly luciferases, the green light is produced by minimizing charge delocalization and fixing the charge on the phenolate ion of oxyluciferin (20Branchini B.R. Southworth T.L. Murtiashaw M.H. Magyar R.A. Golzales S.A. Ruggiero M.C. Stroh J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7255-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the key luciferase residues for the luciferin binding site are absolutely conserved among the luciferases and therefore have major roles in this mechanism. It is also reported that the natural red bioluminescence of P. hirtus has been found intriguing because this luciferase also contains all of the essential proposed residues for green light emission (20Branchini B.R. Southworth T.L. Murtiashaw M.H. Magyar R.A. Golzales S.A. Ruggiero M.C. Stroh J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7255-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Apparently, the results obtained in this investigation may explain the effect of additional Arg in P. hirtus luciferase as well as the mutant form of L. turkestanicus in production of the red color through long-range effects and altering the local polarity of the emitter site (39Orlova G. Goddard J.D. Brovko L.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6962-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, this mutation has affected other kinetic properties of luciferase. The time course of the light emitted by both luciferases was also measured that shows relatively faster decay of bioluminescence signal for mutant luciferase (Fig. 3). Therefore, it may be concluded that insertion of an Arg in the polypeptide backbone could cause faster decomposition of the intermediate state in the firefly luciferase reaction. Change in rate of luminescence decay was also observed for a single mutant of bacterial luciferase (40Hosseinkhani S. Szittner R. Meighen E.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 3, the glow-type luminescence signal of the native and mutant forms of L. turkestanicus is more stable than the flashing pattern of P. pyralis luciferase. The optimum temperature of activity for mutant luciferase (34 °C) was much higher than the native form (24 °C). This finding is very intriguing as mutant luciferase indicates a brighter and more stable signal at physiological temperature in the case of using the red-emitter luciferase (rLuc(Arg)) as a reporter for bioluminescence imaging and also in vivo diagnostic applications. Luciferase is a useful reporter gene in vivo and has been used for non-invasive imaging of tumor growth (41Rehemtulla A. Stegman L.D. Cardozo S.J. Gupta S. Hall D.E. Contag C.H. Ross B.D. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), metastasis (42Wetterwald A. Vander P.G. Oue I. Sijmons B. Buijs J. Karperien M. Lowik C.W. Gautschi E. Thalmann G.N.

It should be noted that increased light production and sensitivity have been observed in the tumors bearing thermostable luciferase (36Baggett B. Roy R. Momen S. Morgan M. Tisi L. Morse D. Gillies R.J. Mol. Imaging. 2004; 3: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The other basic kinetic properties of the mutant enzyme were relatively similar to the native form. The Km values for ATP and luciferin were slightly increased, indicating lower affinity of the substrates to the mutant enzyme. Lower affinity was concomitant with lower relative activity (81%). It is worthwhile to note that the expression of an active mutant luciferase under the same condition as the native form suggests formation and refolding of a properly folded luciferase without aggregation, which has been confirmed by different spectroscopic techniques. Moreover, the far UV CD spectra of the native and mutant forms of luciferase show subtle changes in secondary structure of the protein upon insertion of an additional Arg356 in the protein backbone (Fig. 5). As indicated in Fig. 6 an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed for the mutant luciferase. Any changes in the enzyme conformation and oxidation states usually affect the tryptophan fluorescence of protein (34Riahi Madvar S. Hosseinkhani S. Khajeh K. Asoodeh A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4701-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, insertion of an Arg residue may bring about alteration of the microenvironment of tryptophan residues of the enzyme, resulting in a fluorescence intensity change. As shown in Fig. 6 a considerable increase in emission intensity was observed in the mutant, suggesting substantial alteration in its conformation, which indicates displacement of Trp(s) to a more hydrophobic environment. The enhancement of emission under this condition is a result of the decreased local freedom of rotation of tryptophan molecules due to the location in the interior hydrophobic core of the enzyme molecule. That is to say, insertion of an Arg moiety (Arg356) would result in a different pattern of structural changes. Moreover, the quenching effect of the positive charge of an additional residue on Trp(s) fluorescence may also occur. It may be proposed that, if it had not been for such a quenching effect of positive charge, higher fluorescence intensities for the mutant form would have been obtained. It is therefore suggested that an increase of intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 6) occurs as a result of protein rigidity due to partial compactness of the mutant enzyme compared with the native enzyme in the same condition. And so, the higher optimum temperature of activity of mutant luciferase may be interpreted through higher rigidity of its structure. However, changes in the luciferase structure upon mutation were confirmed by spectroscopic evidence, which show that changes in a remote area exert long-range effects through the alteration of polypeptide packing that in turn could modify the structure of the luciferase active site and may alter stabilization of the luciferin phenolate ion as proposed by Branchini et al. (20Branchini B.R. Southworth T.L. Murtiashaw M.H. Magyar R.A. Golzales S.A. Ruggiero M.C. Stroh J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7255-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the result presented in this article indicates that insertion of Arg356 in the central cavity of L. turkestanicus luciferase, similar to the native form of Phrixothrix railroad worms red-emitter luciferase (PhRE), plays a critical role in determination of the color of emitted light. Insertion of this additional residue increased the polarity of the emitter site. Moreover, expression of an active refolded mutant luciferase may explain the effect of this position on diversion of firefly luciferases into two distinct groups of red and green emitters.

This helix presents a steric barrier to formation of the active enzyme and generates a surface that may be exploitable in the design of specific inhibitors that selectively target the inactive state. Comparison of this “auto-inhibitory” conformation with similar arrangements in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor kinase suggests a role for dimerization-dependent allosteric regulation that combines with autophosphorylation and protein phosphatase 1c phosphatase activity to generate the precise spatial and temporal control required for Nek2 function in centrosomal maturation. The dimeric Ser/Thr kinase Nek2 regulates centrosome cohesion and separation through phosphorylation of structural components of the centrosome, and aberrant regulation of Nek2 activity can lead to aneuploid defects characteristic of cancer cells.

Protein kinase activity is crucial for the precise regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Although cyclin-dependent kinases remain the master regulators of cell cycle progression, it is clear that a variety of other proteins kinases also play important roles. Nek2 is a member of the NIMA 6The abbreviations used are: NIMA, never in mitosis A; MARK, microtubule-associated regulatory kinase; CDK2, cyclin-dependent kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor.-related kinase (or Nek) family of serine/threonine protein kinases, so named because all are related to the NIMA kinase of Aspergillus nidulans (for review, see Ref. 1O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In Aspergillus, NIMA is essential for mitotic entry with temperature-sensitive nimA mutations leading to cells that are “never in mitosis” (2Morris N.R. Osmani S.A. Engle D.B. Doonan J.H. BioEssays. 1989; 10: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Like Aspergillus, other fungi also express a single NIMA-related kinase, e.g. Kin3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fin1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Although the yeast Neks do not appear to be essential for cell cycle progression, elegant studies on Fin1 have revealed key functions in chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (3Grallert A. Hagan I.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3096-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Grallert A. Krapp A. Bagley S. Simanis V. Hagan I.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, higher eukaryotes express multiple Neks with 11 genes (Nek1 to Nek11) encoded within the human genome (1O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). With the exception of human Nek6 and Nek7 and Nek10, all Neks have an N-terminal kinase domain followed by a C-terminal non-catalytic regulatory domain. However, the length and composition of motifs present within these C-terminal extensions vary considerably, reflecting diverse roles in cell regulation. Of the human proteins, Nek2 is the most closely related to the fungal kinases, being 47% identical to NIMA within the amino acid sequence of their catalytic domains. Nek2 localizes to centrosomes. Here, it contributes to spindle pole formation during mitosis (5Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) through phosphorylation of proteins involved in centriolar cohesion, including C-Nap1 and rootletin, to allow spindle pole separation (6Fry A.M.

Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. Fry A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1309-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nek2 homologues in Drosophila and Dictyostelium as well as both NIMA and Fin1 localize to the microtubule-organizing center, and functional studies support roles in centrosome organization (4Grallert A. Krapp A. Bagley S. Simanis V. Hagan I.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Prigent C. Glover D.M. Giet R. Exp.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that other mammalian Nek family kinases may have microtubule-related functions in cell cycle progression or cilia formation (13Roig J. Groen A. Caldwell J. Avruch J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4827-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Quarmby L.M. Mahjoub M.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to acting at the centrosome, there is some evidence that Nek2 may contribute to other aspects of mitotic progression including chromatin condensation and spindle checkpoint signaling (15Chen Y. Riley D.J. Zheng L. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49408-49416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H.

Sette C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In line with functions in mitotic entry, Nek2 is a cell cycleregulated kinase with activity low in G1, increased in S and G2, and diminished after mitotic onset (18Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12899-12905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At the G1/S transition vertebrates express two major splice variants, Nek2A and Nek2B (19Hames R.S. Fry A.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Uto K. Nakajo N. Sagata N. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These variants differ in their extreme C termini, which has important implications for their regulation, as the C terminus of Nek2A, but not Nek2B, contains both a binding site for protein phosphatase 1 and motifs that target the protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation after mitotic entry (21Hames R.S. Wattam S.L. Yamano H. Bacchieri R. Fry A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Hayes M.J.Y.K. Wattam S.L. Lindon C. Mao G. Yamano H. Fry A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Like many protein kinases, Nek2 activity is also subject to control through its phosphorylation. Downstream of the kinase domain is an unusual leucine zipper motif that mediates dimerization as a prerequisite for efficient autophosphorylation and, thus, full Nek2 activity on exogenous substrates (24Fry A.M. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16304-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interaction of Nek2A with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) can lead to dephosphorylation and inhibition of Nek2, suggesting that Nek2 may only become fully activated once PP1 is inactivated at the onset of mitosis (22Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Eto M. Elliott E. Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44013-44020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Besides autophosphorylation, Nek2 may be regulated by upstream kinases. Indeed, the catalytic domain of Nek2 is phosphorylated in vitro by p90Rsk2, an interesting observation as the activation of chromatin condensation by Nek2 in mouse spermatocytes is under the control of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/p90Rsk2 pathway (26Di Agostino S. Rossi P. Geremia R. Sette C. Development. 2002; 129: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the importance of Nek2 in cell cycle control, its regulation by phosphorylation remains poorly understood. Indeed, no structural information on any Nek kinase family has been reported despite the fact that together they constitute ∼2% of the entire human kinome. Here we report the structure of the kinase domain of human Nek2 in complex with a pyrrole-indolinone inhibitor SU11652 together with an analysis of the role of autophosphorylation in Nek2 regulation. Given that Nek2 is up-regulated in a number of human cancers and that down-regulation can inhibit cell proliferation (27Hayward D.G. Fry A.M. Cancer Lett. 2006; 237: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), our observations have clear significance for the design of Nek2 inhibitors as potential anticancer agents and now provide a structural and mechanistic framework for understanding how this important cell cycle kinase is regulated, with implications for the control of Nek-family kinases as a whole. Nek2 Kinase Domain Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—For expression of Nek2 constructs, DNA sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET22b, and the resulting plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.7, the temperature was adjusted to 18 °C, and expression was induced for 4 h using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, and lysed by sonication. Clarified lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with lysis buffer and washed with the same buffer supplemented with 1 m NaCl. Bound Nek2 eluted in buffer A plus 150 mm imidazole. The protein sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration and fractionated on a S75 Superdex column equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol. Eluted fractions were 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. For crystallization, phosphates were removed by treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and λ-phosphatase for 12 h at 4 °C. Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystals were obtained at 4 °C using vapor diffusion sitting drops at a protein concentration of 7.5 mg/ml containing 1 mm of a pyrrole-indolinone compound (5-[(Z)-(5-chloro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)methyl]-N-[2-(diethylamino) ethyl]-2,4 dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide). The complex was crystallized by mixing with precipitant (10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 200 mm MgCl2) at a ratio of 3:1. Monoclinic plates grew over 3-4 weeks to a maximum size of 75 × 75 × 10 μm3. Crystals were vitrified in mother liquor supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol, and diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline X10A (λ = 0.95 Ä) at the Swiss Light Source. Data were integrated, merged, and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (28Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) using Aurora-A kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1OL7) as a search model. The C-terminal lobe was well resolved in the initial electron density maps, but density for the N-terminal lobe was poor due to conformational changes between the search and target structures. Attempts to place the isolated N-terminal lobe using PHASER failed. Instead, the domain was manually placed in the density, and its position was optimized using rigid-body refinement. Rounds of model building interspersed with restrained refinement incorporating TLS were carried out using REFMAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and COOT (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). The coordinates are available in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 2JAV). Autophosphorylation Site Mapping—For identification of autophosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry, an enriched subset of phosphorylated peptides was generated using gallium-chelated immobilized metal affinity chromatography spin columns (Pierce). The phosphorylated protein to be studied was first digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) at 1:10 (trypsin:target w/w). The digestion was carried out in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at room temperature. The tryptic digest was diluted 1:1 with 20% acetic acid and incubated on the gallium resin for 30 min at room temperature. The resin was washed with 10% acetic acid followed by 10% acetic acid plus 20% acetonitrile. The resin was then equilibrated with water followed by elution in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, plus 10% acetonitrile. Identification of phosphorylated sites was achieved using a combination of electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy, and tandem MS-MS methods (supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis of the pET22b-Nek2A, pGEM-Nek2A, or pRcCMV-myc-Nek2A plasmids using the Gene Tailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Kinase Assays—Myc-tagged Nek2 proteins were synthesized from the appropriate pGEM or pRcCMV constructs using coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions according to manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibodies (0.4 μg/ml; Cell Signaling) and a fraction of the immune complexes used for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-Nek2 antibody (1 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc. (24Fry A.M. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16304-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). The remaining immune complexes were used for kinase assays. Specifically, 5-10 μl of washed immune complex beads were incubated with 5 μg of β-casein or the C-terminal domain of C-Nap1 and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as substrates in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 5mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 4 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 50 μl of protein sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Western blots were quantified using NIH image software, and substrate phosphorylation was quantified by scintillation counting of proteins excised from dried gels. Cell Culture and Transfection—U2OS osteosarcoma and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed with either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (31Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were anti-γ-tubulin (0.15 μg/ml; Sigma) and anti-Myc (0.4 μg/ml) antibodies. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgGs (1 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were captured on a TE300 inverted microscope (Nikon) using an ORCA ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu) using Openlab 3.5.1 software (Improvision, Coventry, UK) and processed using Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). Bacterial Expression of Nek2 Constructs and Phosphorylation Site Mapping—Initial attempts to overexpress full-length human Nek2A or a 271-residue fragment encompassing just the predicted kinase domain in E. coli were unsuccessful due to apparent toxicity of the recombinant enzymes. However, we were able to circumvent these problems by constructing mutant kinase domains with substitutions at the highly conserved catalytic Asp-141 (D141A) or Lys-37 (K37R) that could be expressed and purified in high yield. In contrast to the D141A protein, which showed no autophosphorylation at all, electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy analysis of the K37R domain showed autophosphorylation at an average of four sites (supplemental Fig. S1A). Of these, one site, Thr-175 within the “activation” or T-loop of Nek2, was unambiguously identified by tandem mass spectroscopy analysis. Expression of fulllength K37R Nek2A yields an unstable product, but a fulllength construct containing a T175A substitution showed both low toxicity and increased stability. Purified protein showed phosphorylation on an average of 13 sites. Two sites (Thr-170 or Ser-171, Thr-179) map to the Nek2 T-loop region, and a third, Ser-241, is located within the kinase C-lobe (see below). A further six phosphorylation sites were assigned within the C-terminal regulatory region (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1B). Four occur around the KEN-box, suggesting a potential autoregulatory role at the level of Nek2 stability. In addition, Ser-356 and Ser-428 lie within predicted regions of coiledcoil and may, therefore, be involved in modulating Nek2A dimerization and localization. These ideas are currently under investigation. Structural Analysis of the Nek2 Kinase Domain—To maximize yields of recombinant protein and minimize structural perturbations around the ATP-binding site, crystallization efforts were focused on the T175A mutant of the Nek2 kinase domain. The purified recombinant protein is heterogeneously phosphorylated, and crystallization required prior dephosphorylation by alkaline and λ phosphatase. Crystallization of complexes with non-hydrolysable ATP analogues was unsuccessful. However, diffracting crystals were obtained of a complex with a single inhibitor, SU11652, identified using temperature shift assays (supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Aurora-A kinase structure as a search model and refined against diffraction data extending to 2.1 Ä of resolution. The final model comprises the entire kinase domain (residues 3-271), the C-terminal hexahistidine tag, 107 water molecules, and the pyrrole-indolinone ligand. Residues within the loop N-terminal to αC (Thr-45-Met-51), the loop connecting the two strands β4 and β5 (Arg-77-Thr-81), the region C-terminal to helix αE (Asp-132-Arg-140), and the activation segment residues between Asn-167 and Val-177 are not visible in the electron density and are presumably disordered. The N-terminal lobe (Ser-3-Met-86) and the αC helix in particular exhibits significant disorder, presumably due to mobility within the crystal, which is reflected by a high average temperature factor of 75 Ä2. In comparison, the C-terminal domain (Glu-87-His-279) is well ordered with an average temperature factor of 33 Ä2. Data and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1, and electron density for the inhibitor is shown in Fig. 1B.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP21Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Ä)41.63, 56.92, 66.01α, β, γ (°)90, 95.98, 90Resolution65-2.2Unique observations15,620Completeness (%)99.7 (98.1)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.Redundancy8.2 (6.3)Rmerge0.088 (0.475)I/σI16.8 (3.4)RefinementResolution (Ä)3-2.1Reflections used (free R set)14,833 (796)Rwork/Rfree (%)21.4/27.7No. atoms (protein/ligand/water)2053/23/107B-factors (protein/ligand/water) (Ä2)46/29/35Root mean square deviations (bonds, Ä; angles, °)0.010/1.225Ramachandran (favorable/allowed) (%)98.4/1.6a Values in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The Nek2 catalytic domain exhibits a typical bilobal protein kinase fold (Fig. 1C). As a family, the Nek kinases form a subclade with pairwise sequence identities of 35-42% within the catalytic domains (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2). Their closest homologues in the human kinome are microtubule-associated regulatory kinases (MARK) along with the Polo-like kinases and Aurora-family kinases that are centrosome-associated and known to play important roles in mitotic regulation. Of kinases with known structure, Nek2 is most similar at the sequence level to Aurora-A (31% identity) and MARK2 (31% identity), and a structural overlap of the Nek2 complex with that of the inactive but ATP-bound Aurora-A (Protein Data Bank code 1OL6) is shown in Fig. 2A. As expected for kinases that require phosphorylation of specific residues in the activation segment, these regions are not completely ordered in both cases. The overall structures are similar and superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.8 Ä for 202 matched Cα positions. The two structures differ mainly in the length and location of secondary structural elements, particularly in the C-lobes. For example, αG is extended by one helical turn in Nek2 (residues Gly-101-Glu-105), and the helix inserted between sheet β3 and αC in Aurora-A is not well defined in Nek2, which shows only half a helical turn before the chain becomes disordered. Perhaps the most notable difference occurs around the highly conserved DFG motif that lies at the N-terminal end of the T-loop. Functionally, this motif serves to both anchor the N-terminal end of the T-loop and supply the aspartate as a ligand for a bound divalent metal ion. In the ATP-bound Aurora-A structure, the DFG motif adopts an extended conformation as is generally observed in other inactive kinases. However, in Nek2 the DFG motif and the following five residues constitute an extended motif (DFGLARIL) that is largely conserved in Nek-family members and which folds into a short region of α-helix that we refer to as αT. As a consequence of this arrangement the short sheet structure after the DFG motif is missing in Nek2, resulting in disorder of the region at the end of helix αE. Intriguingly, this additional element of secondary structure is wedged between αC, which contains the catalytically important Glu-55, and the ATP-binding site (Fig. 2B). In this conformation Glu-55 projects away from the active site and is held by a salt-bridging interaction with Arg-164 from αT. Clearly, this conformation is incompatible with catalytic activity, and the helix must, therefore, move or be disrupted in the activated form. Although unusual, a helical structure after the DFG motif is not unique to Nek-family kinases and is structurally related to a similar helical “insert” observed previously in structures of cyclin-free CDK2 bound to ATP (32Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Lawrie A.M. Morris M.C. Tunnah P. Divita G. Johnson L.N. Endicott J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8746-8756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, upper panel) and in inactive forms of both the EGFR kinase (33Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, lower panel) and Src/Hck (Ref. 34Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar and references therein). The remarkable similarity in the structure, location, and sequence of Nek2 αT to equivalent motifs found in these kinases strongly suggest that αT is a feature of the Nek2 inactive conformation, which is selected for, rather than induced by inhibitor binding. In the case of CDK2 activation, binding of an activating cyclin to the characteristic PSTAIRE portion of αC pushes it toward the ATP/substrate binding cleft with concomitant disruption of the inhibitory helix. This allows Glu-51CDK2 access to the active site and Arg-150 (equivalent to Arg-164 in Nek2) to contact Thr(P)-160 within the T-loop. The latter interaction is common in kinases activated by T-loop phosphorylation to the extent that the presence of an arginine at a position equivalent to 164 in Nek2 is considered predictive of this mode of activation (35Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). The fact that Nek2 appears to be activated by T-loop phosphorylation at Thr-175 (see below) strongly suggests that αT unfolds into a more extended conformation in the active form. Pyrrole-indolinone Inhibitor Binding to an Inactive-like Conformation of Nek2—Nek2 expression has been reported to be significantly elevated in a number of tumor cells including Ewing tumor (pediatric osteosarcoma) (36Wai D.H. Schaefer K.L. Schramm A. Korsching E. Van Valen F. Ozaki T. Boecker W. Schweigerer L. Dockhorn-Dworniczak B. Poremba C. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 441-451PubMed Google Scholar) and primary breast cancer tissues (37Hayward D.G. Clarke R.B. Faragher A.J. Pillai M.R. Hagan I.M. Fry A.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7370-7376Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high expression levels of Nek2 have been strongly associated with disease progression in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (38de Vos S. Hofmann W.K. Grogan T.M. Krug U. Schrage M. Miller T.P. Braun J.G. Wachsman W. Koeffler H.P. Said J.W. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 271-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, deregulation of Nek2 has been linked to centrosome abnormalities and aneuploidy. These hallmarks of tumor progression are generally associated with poor prognostic outcome since the lack of control over chromosome segregation leads to chromosomal instability, a general mechanism by which tumors select for cells with more malignant phenotypes. The strong link of Nek2 to cellular events critical for tumor progression and a recent report demonstrating that depletion of Nek2 leads to an apparent arrest in HeLa cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis suggest that Nek2 may be a viable target for the development of novel anticancer drugs (39Fletcher L. Cerniglia G.J. Yen T.J. Muschel R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 40Fletcher L. Cerniglia G.J. Nigg E.A. Yend T.J. Muschel R.J. Radiat.

Binding of this compound was discovered during screens of a panel of generic kinase inhibitors for their ability to structurally stabilize the Nek2 T175A kinase domain (data not shown). The structure of the Nek2 complex shows the inhibitor bound at the back of the ATP binding cleft, forming two hydrogen bonds with main chain atoms from Glu-87 and Cys-89 within the hinge region between the N and C lobes and making hydrophobic interactions with the active site residues Met-86, Val-68, Phe-148, Cys-89, and Leu-162 (Fig. 3). In this position it forms two hydrogen bonds with main-chain atoms from Glu-87 and Cys-89 within the hinge. These interactions are common in kinase-inhibitor complexes and mimic the contacts formed by main-chain atoms from hinge residues with the N1 and N6 atoms of the adenine base in ATP-bound complexes. An intramolecular hydrogen bond is also formed between the indole oxygen and the pyrrole ring that stabilizes the overall planarity of the extended ring system. SU11652 has been described as a cell-permeable compound that acts as a potent and ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase receptor and angiogenic inhibitor that exhibits activity for platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, vascular endotheli"
https://openalex.org/W2003445853,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)/fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) is a paracrine- and epithelium-specific growth factor produced by cells of mesenchymal origin. It acts exclusively through FGF-7 receptor (FGFR2/IIIb), which is expressed predominantly by epithelial cells, but not by fibroblasts, suggesting that it might function as a paracrine mediator of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. KGF/FGF-7 plays an essential role in the growth of epithelial cells and is frequently overexpressed in cancers of epithelial origin such as pancreatic cancer, switching paracrine stimulation of KGF/FGF-7 to an autocrine loop. Less is known, however, about the signaling pathways by which KGF/FGF-7 regulates the response of epithelial cells. To delineate the signaling pathways activated by KGF/FGF-7 and examine cellular response to KGF/FGF-7 stimulation, we performed functional analysis of KGF/FGF-7 action. In this report, we show that KGF/FGF-7 activated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which in turn induced expression of VEGF, MMP-9, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator and increased migration and invasion of KGF/FGF-7-stimulated human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Expression of phosphorylation-defective IκBα (IκBαS32A,S36A), which blocked NF-κB activation, inhibited KGF/FGF-7-induced gene expression and cell migration and invasion. Our results demonstrate for the first time that KGF/FGF-7 induces NF-κB activation and that NF-κB plays an essential role in regulation of KGF/FGF-7-inducible gene expression and KGF/FGF-7-initiated cellular responses. Thus, these findings identify one signaling pathway for KGF/FGF-7-regulated cell migration and invasion and suggest that paracrine sources of KGF/FGF-7 are one of the malignancy-contributing factors from tumor stroma.

KGF/FGF-7 is a heparin-binding growth factor that acts exclusively through a splicing variant of FGF receptor 2, FGFR2-IIIb, which is expressed predominantly by epithelial cells (5Miki T.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Functional assays in organ and cell cultures and in vivo analysis show that KGF/FGF-7 is mitogenically active only on epithelial cells derived from a variety of tissues (8auf demKeller U. Krampert M. Kumin A. Braun S. Werner S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Many studies show that KGF/FGF-7 is up-regulated after epithelial injury and plays an important role in tissue repair (9Ray P. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2005; 2: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, recombinant human KGF/FGF-7 induces proliferation of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells in adult rats after daily systemic administration for 1 to 2 weeks, indicating that KGF/FGF-7 is a potent in vivo mitogen for pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (10Yi E.S. Bedoya A.A. Lee H. Kim S. Housley R.M. Aukerman S.L. Tarpley J.E. Starnes C. Yin S. Pierce G.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1015-1022PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of KGF/FGF-7 are attributed in part to the mechanisms that act collectively to stimulate cell proliferation, migration, and survival; DNA repair; and induction of enzymes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (11Werner S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The mitogenic property of KGF also has been implicated in the growth of cancer cells. For instance, KGF/FGF-7 and FGFR2-IIIb have been shown to be overexpressed in both pancreatic cancer cells and the acinar and ductal cells adjacent to cancer cells (12Siddiqi I. Funatomi H. Kobrin M.S. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Ishiwata T. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lopez M.E. Korc M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that KGF/FGF-7 acts as a unique stromal mediator of epithelial cell proliferation in a paracrine manner to stimulate pancreatic cancer cell growth in vivo (12Siddiqi I.

Tumor-associated fibroblasts may play important roles in tumor progression through paracrine mechanisms. KGF may be one of the molecules secreted by these fibroblasts, which could stimulate the adjacent tumor cells. A number of studies show that pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and especially IL-1 are potent inducers of KGF expression, suggesting that infiltrating inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils produce inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, which induce KGF/FGF-7 expression from local mesenchymal cells to promote epithelial proliferation (3Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10753-10757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brauchle M. Angermeyer K. Hubner G. Werner S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3199-3204PubMed Google Scholar). KGF/FGF-7 is one of the AP-1-regulated genes induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokines (14Florin L. Hummerich L. Dittrich B.T. Kokocinski F. Wrobel G. Gack S. Schorpp-Kistner M. Werner S. Hahn M. Lichter P. Szabowski A. Angel P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7005-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, KGF/FGF-7-mediated downstream signaling pathways are still unclear. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a family of pleiotropic transcription factors that control the expression of numerous genes involved in growth, tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, differentiation, embryonic development, apoptosis, and inflammation (15Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1367-1378PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S.

Interaction of c-Rel, RelA, and RelB with their inhibitors, the IκBs, results in inactive complexes in the cytoplasm by masking the nuclear localization signal (19Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 20Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). In most cell types, NF-κB proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor IκB in an inactive form (16Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 19Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 20Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). On stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinase (IKK) and polyubiquitinated, which triggers its rapid degradation by proteasome (21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 22Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Consequently, NF-κB proteins are released and translocated into the nucleus, where they activate the expression of target genes (15Gilmore T.D. Koedood M. Piffat K.A. White D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1367-1378PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 17Ghosh S. Karin M.

One of the key target genes regulated by NF-κB is its inhibitor IκBα. A feedback inhibition pathway for control of IκBα gene transcription and down-regulation of transient activation of NF-κB activity has been described previously (25Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Members of the NF-κB family are involved in the development of cancer. Many tumors have acquired genetic alterations in the signaling pathways that regulate NF-κB activation. In one study, for example, defective IκBα led to constitutive nuclear NF-κB activity, which in turn conferred a growth advantage to Hodgkin disease tumor cells (28Emmerich F. Meiser M. Hummel M. Demel G. Foss H.D. Jundt F. Mathas S. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Stein H. Dorken B. Blood. 1999; 94: 3129-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated IKK activities also were found in some of the tumor cells, suggesting that IKK is activated by as yet unidentified aberrant upstream signaling cascades (28Emmerich F. Meiser M. Hummel M. Demel G. Foss H.D. Jundt F. Mathas S. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Stein H. Dorken B. Blood. 1999; 94: 3129-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that RelA, the p65 subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor, is constitutively activated in most pancreatic cancer tissues and human pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in normal pancreatic tissues or immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (29Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dong Q.G. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Peng B. Wu T. Tsao M.S. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. McDonnell T.J. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6510-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Constitutive RelA activity plays a key role in pancreatic cancer metastasis and tumor progression (31Fujioka S. Sclabas G.M. Schmidt C. Niu J. Frederick W.A. Dong Q.G. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Baker C. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Fujioka S. Sclabas G.M. Schmidt C. Frederick W.A. Dong Q.G. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Baker C. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 346-354PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that IL-1 autocrine stimulation is involved in constitutive NF-κB activity in pancreatic cancer. Key features of pancreatic cancer are marked proliferation of stromal fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix components such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and collagens, suggesting that microenvironmental cellular interactions are important in the pathogenesis of this disease. The role of tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis remains unclear. In the study reported here, we show that NF-κB activation and NF-κB-regulated genes are induced in response to stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and KGF/FGF-7 in immortalized/nontumorigenic human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells (33Furukawa T. Duguid W.P. Rosenberg L. Viallet J. Galloway D.A. Tsao M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1763-1770PubMed Google Scholar) and that Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt are involved in these pathways. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by a phosphorylation-defective IκBα (IκBαS32A,S36A) blocked KGF/FGF-7-induced gene expression and cell migration and invasion. Our findings suggest that NF-κB plays an essential role in the regulation of KGF/FGF-7-inducible gene expression and KGF/FGF-7-initiated cellular responses, and that paracrine stimulation of KGF/FGF-7 might be one of the factors contributing to growth of malignancies from tumor stroma. Cell Lines and Reagents—Human papillomavirus type 16 early gene 6 and 7-immortalized/nontumorigenic HPDE cells have been described elsewhere (33Furukawa T. Duguid W.P. Rosenberg L. Viallet J. Galloway D.A. Tsao M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1763-1770PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, which contained 4.5 g/liter glucose, glutamine, and nonessential amino acids, and was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human KGFR cDNA was obtained from Dr. T. Miki (NCI, National Institutes of Health). EGF and KGF were obtained from R&D Systems. HPDE cells were cultured in keratinocyte-SFM (serum-free medium, Invitrogen). Anti-phospho-IκBα (Ser-32), anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-IκBα antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-Ras antibody was obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-Paxillin antibody was obtained from NeoMarkers, Inc. Anti-β-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-uPA antibody was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. Anti-human MMP9 was obtained from Binding Site Inc., and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), anti-p65/NF-κB, anti-Akt, and anti-MEKK3 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Growth Curve and Cell Cycle Analysis—HPDE cells were kept in keratinocyte-SFM without growth factors for 48 h and were stimulated or not stimulated with KGF/FGF-7 or EGF for various periods. Cells were counted every 24 h in triplicates, and cell cycle profiles of HPDE cells unstimulated or stimulated with KGF (100 ng/ml) or EGF (100 ng/ml) at different time intervals were analyzed by flow cytometry. Each experiment was performed independently at least three times with similar results each time. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. All of the statistical analyses were performed using StatView 5.0 (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HPDE cells were starved for 48 h, then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) or KGF (100 ng/ml) for different time intervals or TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 30 min as control. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed as previously described by Schmidt et al. (34Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1287-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (35Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays for NF-κB proteins were performed with nuclear extracts (10 μg) as described by Wang et al. (29Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-CTCAACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGCCAT-3′) containing the κB site found in the HIV long terminal repeat were used as probes. The mutant κB site for HIV long terminal repeat (5′-CTCAACAGAGTTGACTTTTCGAGAGGCCAT-3′) was used for competition studies. The competition was performed with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant κB oligonucleotides. The supershift experiments were performed with anti-RelA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reactions were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25× Tris/borate/EDTA buffer. Western Blot Analysis—HPDE cells were starved for 48 h, then treated with EGF or KGF (100 ng/ml) for various time periods, or with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 30 min as a positive control. Cell cytoplasmic extracts were used for detection of phosphor-IκBα, IκBα, Paxillin, and β-actin protein levels. Cell nuclear extracts were used to detect RelA/NF-κB and Paxillin protein levels. For detection of uPA, MMP9, and VEGF levels in conditioned medium, the conditioned media from unstimulated and growth factor-stimulated HPDE cells were harvested at the same ratio of medium volume to cell number and subjected to dialysis for 24 h; dialyzed medium (6 ml) was then dried to a volume of 40–80 μl. The concentrated medium or 100 μg of protein extracts was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and probed with antibodies. The subsequent Western blot analysis was carried out with Lumi-light Western blot substrate (Roche Applied Science). Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—HPDE cells and wild-type MEFs at 70% confluence in growth factor-free medium were transfected with either 1.0 μgof κB-Luc promoter-reporter construct alone or co-transfected with various expression vectors using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science); pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase was co-transfected as a control reporter vector. After 24–48 h, the cells were treated or not treated with EGF or KGF (100 ng/ml) for 1–4 h. At the end of treatment, reporter activity was determined using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The results are shown as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The RNA was then subjected to reverse transcription into cDNA. The primers used for PCR amplification of the KGFR were 5′-CTCAAGCACTCGGGGATAAA-3′ and 5′-CTGTTTTGGCAGGACAGTGA-3′; the 150-bp product corresponded to nucleotides 1352–1501 of human KGFR cDNA, which are located in the IgIIIb exon of human KGFR cDNA (29Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and finally extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a positive control. Cell Migration and Invasion Assay—Invasion assay was performed in 24-well plates by using a BD Biocoat growth factor-reduced Matrigel invasion chamber (BD Biosciences) with an 8.0-μm pore size PET membrane. Each membrane had a thin layer of GFR Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix, which serves as a reconstituted basement membrane in vitro. The inserts were rehydrated by adding 0.5 ml of warm culture medium at 37 °C to the inserts for 2 h. Invasion of KGF/FGF-7-stimulated HPDE/IκBαM cells was determined, and HPDE/puromycin (HPDE/CTL) cells were used as the control. These HPDE cells, kept in SFM without growth factors for 24 h, were seeded (5 × 104 cells in 0.5 ml of SFM) to the invasion chambers with or without KGF (100 ng/ml) and heparin (29.4 μg/ml), and 750 μl of complete keratinocyte-SFM was added to the lower well of the invasion plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 48 h. Noninvading cells from the interior of the inserts were removed by using cotton-tipped swabs. Invading cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed by 10% formaldehyde for 10 min, and then stained with 1% crystal violet, and at least three random fields per insert were counted under an Olympus microscope. A representative field of each experiment was photographed with 4× lens and 2.5× magnification. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Migration assay was performed in 24-well plates by using Falcon cell culture inserts, which have a PET membrane with 1 × 105 8.0-μm pores per cm2 (BD Biosciences Labware). Before the assay was run, HPDE cells were starved for 24 h, and 700 μl of complete keratinocyte-SFM was added to the lower well of the migration plate. The cells (5 × 104 cells/0.3 ml) were seeded to the insert in keratinocyte-SFM with or without KGF (100 ng/ml) and heparin (29 μg/ml). The incubation, staining, counting, and photographing procedures were the same as for the invasion assay. The representative fields of each experiment are shown. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. KGF/FGF-7 Induces Proliferation, Invasion, and Migration in Immortalized HPDE Cells—KGF/FGF-7 is a potent mitogenic factor for epithelial cells derived from a variety of tissues and plays an important role in tissue repair (8auf demKeller U. Krampert M. Kumin A. Braun S. Werner S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Ray P. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2005; 2: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether KGF/FGF-7 has any effects on immortalized/nontumorigenic HPDE cells, we stimulated HPDE cells with KGF/FGF-7 using EGF-treated cells as a positive control. Our results show that KGF/FGF-7 induced the HPDE cells to proliferate as determined by cell counting and flow cytometry analysis for cell cycle profile (Fig. 1, A and B). Cell migration and invasion assays were performed as described in “Experimental Procedures.” The representative fields of cell migration and invasion experiment are shown (Fig. 1, C and E). Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments (Fig. 1, D and F). These results show that KGF/FGF-7 stimulated the invasion and migration of the HPDE cells (Fig. 1, C–F), suggesting that exogenous KGF/FGF-7 mimics paracrine stimulation. KGF/FGF-7 Induces NF-κB Activation in Immortalized HPDE Cells—To test whether KGF/FGF-7-mediated pathways could activate NF-κB, HPDE cells were kept in growth factor-free medium for 48 h, and then stimulated with KGF/FGF-7 (100 ng/ml) or EGF (100 ng/ml, as a positive control) at various time intervals. Our results show that both KGF/FGF-7 and EGF induced activation of NF-κB, and a comparable amount of nuclear extracts was used as determined by Oct-1 EMSA for loading controls (Fig. 2A). KGF/FGF-7-induced NF-κB activation was time-dependent, and the activity peaked at 2 h (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, to confirm the specificity of the KGF/FGF-7- and EGF-induced κB DNA binding activity, competition and supershift assays were performed by using the same nuclear extracts for NF-κB EMSA in Fig. 2A. The unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild-type κB binding sites completely blocked NF-κB DNA binding activity, whereas the unlabeled oligonucleotides with mutant κB binding sites had no effect on NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 2B). In supershift experiments, the mobility of the NF-κB binding activities was further retarded after incubation with p65 antibody as indicated by an arrow (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the NF-κB DNA binding activity was specific and that one of the subunits of the DNA binding complex was p65 (RelA). As shown in Fig. 2C, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation were induced by KGF/FGF-7 and EGF in a time-dependent manner as determined by Western blot analysis using the cytoplasmic extracts, isolated for the experiments described in Fig. 2A, with anti-phospho-IκBα and anti-IκBα antibodies. Because IκBα phosphorylation by IKK, polyubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation are the necessary steps for NF-κB activation (16Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar), these results further indicate that KGF/FGF-7 and EGF induced NF-κB activation. Interestingly, the degradation patterns of IκBα varied slightly between EGF and KGF/FGF-7 stimulation (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 7). Because IκBα is one of the genes transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB, the expression levels of IκBα may oscillate depending on the nature of the stimulation (25Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 26Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that KGF/FGF-7 induces NF-κB activation as observed in NF-κB EMSA and IκBα immunoblots, the levels of nuclear RelA/NF-κB were determined in the nuclear extracts from the HPDE cells stimulated with EGF and KGF/FGF-7 at various time intervals. The results show that the levels of RelA/NF-κB were increased in the nuclear fractions in the EGF and KGF/FGF-7 time course stimulation (Fig. 2C). The relative protein loading was shown by the use of anti-β-actin antibody, and the quality of the nuclear extracts was determined by probing both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts with an antibody against Paxillin, a cytoplasmic protein. As shown in Fig. 2C, the findings show that NF-κB activation was induced by KGF/FGF-7. To determine the expression of NF-κB-regulated genes that are induced by KGF/FGF-7, the NF-κB reporter gene assays were performed in HPDE cells. The results showed that KGF/FGF-7 induced NF-κB-dependent promoter activity similar to that induced by EGF and TNFα, further indicating that KGF/FGF-7 induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results show for the first time that KGF/FGF-7 activates NF-κB. KGF/FGF-7 Induces Expression of NF-κB Downstream Target Genes—To determine whether expression of NF-κB downstream target genes was induced by KGF/FGF-7, levels of uPA, MMP9, and VEGF expression in HPDE cells were examined (Fig. 3). The HPDE cells were kept in growth factor-free medium for 48 h, and then stimulated with KGF/FGF-7 (50 ng/ml) for various time intervals (Fig. 3). The conditioned media from these cells were harvested at the same volume/cell number ratios at each time point and were subjected to dialysis and concentration prior to Western blot analysis. The loading control for the concentrated conditioned media was shown by the use of Coomassie Blue staining of the identical gels. The results show that KGF/FGF-7 induced the expression of NF-κB downstream target genes uPA, MMP9, and VEGF and that these inductions were dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 3A). However, the patterns of uPA, MMP9, and VEGF expression induced by KGF/FGF-7 were different. At 24- and 48-h time points, only uPA expression was increased without KGF/FGF-7 stimulation and possibly by other stimuli in the media. To further demonstrate the expression of uPA, MMP9 and VEGF were induced by KGF/FGF-7 through NF-κB activation, time- and dose-dependent phosph"

These mice generate abnormal immature myeloid cells exhibiting characteristics of both macrophages and granulocytes. Furthermore, Gfi-1(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Interestingly, Gfi-1(-/-) myeloid cells overexpress target genes of the PU.1 transcription factor such as the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor and PU.1 itself. We therefore determined whether GFI-1 modulates the transcriptional activity of PU.1. Our data demonstrate that GFI-1 physically interacts with PU.1, repressing PU.1-dependent transcription. This repression is functionally significant, as GFI-1 blocked PU.1-induced macrophage differentiation of a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell line. Retroviral expression of GFI-1 in primary murine hematopoietic progenitors increased granulocyte differentiation at the expense of macrophage differentiation. We interbred Gfi-1(+/-) and PU.1(+/-) mice and observed that heterozygosity at the PU.1 locus partially rescued the Gfi-1(-/-) mixed myeloid lineage phenotype, but failed to restore granulocyte differentiation. Our data demonstrate that GFI-1 represses PU.1 activity and that lack of this repression in Gfi-1(-/-) myeloid cells contributes to the observed mixed lineage phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2078015812,"The importance of PP2A in the regulation of Akt/PKB activity has long been recognized but the nature of the holoenzyme involved and the mechanisms controlling dephosphorylation are not yet known. We identified IEX-1, an early gene product with proliferative and survival activities, as a specific inhibitor of B56 regulatory subunit-containing PP2A. IEX-1 inhibits B56-PP2A activity by allowing the phosphorylation of B56 by ERK. This leads to sustained ERK activation. IEX-1 has no effect on PP2A containing other B family subunits. Thus, studying IEX-1 contribution to signaling should help the discovery of new pathways controlled by B56-PP2A. By using overexpression and RNA interference, we show here that IEX-1 increases Akt/PKB activity in response to various growth factors by preventing Akt dephosphorylation on both Thr308 and Ser473 residues. PP2A-B56β and γ subunits have the opposite effect and reverse IEX-1-mediated Akt activation. The effect of IEX-1 on Akt is ERK-dependent. Indeed: (i) a IEX-1 mutant deficient in ERK binding had no effect on Akt; (ii) ERK dominant-negative mutants reduced IEX-1-mediated increase in pAkt; (iii) a B56β mutant that cannot be phosphorylated in the ERK·IEX-1 complex showed an enhanced ability to compete with IEX-1. These results identify B56-containing PP2A holoenzymes as Akt phosphatases. They suggest that IEX-1 behaves as a general inhibitor of B56 activity, enabling the control of both ERK and Akt signaling downstream of ERK.

Protein phosphorylation is central to signal transduction by growth factors and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by controlling many cellular processes such as growth, survival, and differentiation. Deregulation of this activity is a key cause of cancer development. The net activation of a signaling pathway depends on the balance of enzymatic activities between kinases and phosphatases, suggesting that both activation and inactivation signals must be tightly controlled.Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) 2The abbreviations used are: PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; IEX-1, immediate early response gene X-1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TPO, thrombopoietin; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EPO, erythropoietin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCS, fetal calf serum; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. 2The abbreviations used are: PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; IEX-1, immediate early response gene X-1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TPO, thrombopoietin; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EPO, erythropoietin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCS, fetal calf serum; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. accounts for the majority of serine/threonine phosphatase activity in the cell (reviewed in Refs. 1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar and 2Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar)). The predominant form of PP2A is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme, composed of a scaffolding subunit (A), a catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit. The B subunits fall into three major unrelated families, B (PR55), B′ (B56/PR61), and B′′ (PR72). Each family comprises several isoforms that exhibit significant homology between them. With five different genes, generating at least 8 isoforms named B56 α, β, γ, δ, and ɛ, the B56 family is the most diverse. Many if not most of the components of signaling cascades are PP2A substrates. However, the function of the individual PP2A subunits in these pathways is only beginning to emerge. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that different PP2A holoenzymes regulate positively or negatively signaling by acting at different levels in a cascade. The best example of this type of regulation is the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Indeed, Adams et al. (3Adams D.G. Coffee Jr., R.L. Zhang H. Pelech S. Strack S. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42644-42654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that PP2As containing Bα and Bδ are required for activation of the MAPK kinase kinase Raf-1, whereas we demonstrated that the B56 family members shut down the signal by dephosphorylating ERK1 and ERK2 (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Wnt pathway has been shown to be differently regulated by B56-containing PP2As, which binds to axin and APC (5Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and also by PP2As containing the B′′ subunit acting at the level of Naked cuticle (6Creyghton M.P. Roel G. Eichhorn P.J. Hijmans E.M. Maurer I. Destree O. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unraveling the specific contribution of the various PP2A holoenzymes to signaling pathways, as well as the mechanisms regulating their function, is an important step to understand how kinase cascades are regulated and to find new tools to modulate their activities.The kinase Akt/PKB, a critical component of a pathway controlling growth and survival, is one of the major targets of PP2A enzymes. Akt exerts its function by phosphorylating several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including p21Cip/WAF1, BAD, the Forkhead family of transcription factors and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) (reviewed in Ref. 7Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt occurs upon recruitment to the plasma membrane through binding of its plekstrin homology domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphates, which are produced by growth factor-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This allows phosphorylation of Akt at two key regulatory residues: Thr308 in the activation loop and Ser473 in a C-terminal hydrophobic motif. Phosphorylation of Thr308 is catalyzed by PDK1 (8Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). Turn-off of Akt activity can be mediated by the tumor suppressor phosphatase tensin homologue, which dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphates. Although the importance of PP2A in the regulation of Akt activity has long been recognized (11Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Conflicting data have been reported concerning the role of IEX-1 in apoptosis. Indeed, IEX-1 was found to increase apoptosis in response to UV radiation or upon serum deprivation (17Arlt A. Grobe O. Sieke A. Kruse M.L. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Schafer H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Schilling D. Pittelkow M.R. Kumar R.

These differential effects might be due to the fact that IEX-1 acquires its pro-survival function upon phosphorylation by ERK (19Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Shen L. Guo J. Santos-Berrios C. Wu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15304-15311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to this function, we have demonstrated that IEX-1 behaves as an inhibitor of B56-containing PP2A enzymes (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). IEX-1 binds to both B56 family members and to active ERKs, enhances the phosphorylation of B56 by ERK in this complex and triggers the dissociation of the A/C core from the B56 subunit. Inhibition of PP2A-B56 activity by IEX-1 was found to increase ERK signaling in response to various growth factors (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic cell line UT7, the specific induction of the IEX-1 protein by thrombopoietin (TPO), correlates with the unique capacity of this cytokine to sustain the ERK signal and is required for this effect (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F.

Blood. 2006; 107: 3106-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). IEX-1 has no effect on other B family of PP2As. Thus, studying IEX-1 contribution to signaling cascades should lead to the discovery of new pathways controlled by B56-containing PP2As. The functions of IEX-1 and its induction by various growth factors prompted us to analyze whether it can affect Akt activation. We show here that IEX-1 and PP2A-B56 regulate Akt activity in an opposite manner by controlling the phosphorylation state of both Thr308 and Ser473. These data add to our understanding of both PP2A and Akt regulatory pathways.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—Plasmids encoding IEX-1, WT, or deleted of its ERK binding site (IEX-1-ΔBD), were described previously (19Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). IEX-1 was inserted downstream of HA or His tags. pcDNA expression vectors for HA-B55α and 4xHA-B56β were generously provided by Dr. D. Virshup (University of Utah). pcDNA encoding HA-tagged B56γ was given by Dr. N. Nojima (Osaka university). B56β-S368A and B56γ1-S327A were previously characterized (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The insert was cloned downstream of HA4. Mouse ERK1 cDNA was cloned from reverse transcription of NIH3T3 mRNA. Mouse cDNA for ERK2 was a gift from Dr. M. Weber (University of Virginia Cancer Center). ERK1 and ERK2 dominant negative mutants were generated by mutating their Mg2+ binding pockets (consensus DFG in all kinases). The coding sequences were inserted into pcDNA3 to create plasmids pcDNA3-ERK1-D185A and pcDNA-ERK2-D165A. pcDNA-HA-Elk1 was a gift of R. Hipskind (Montpellier, France). For RNA interference, the target nucleotide sequences and the vectors that drive the expression of small hairpin shRNA for human IEX-1, B56β, or B56γ were described previously (4Letourneux C.

Two shRNA targeting different nucleotides of human B56β sequence were used: pSM2c-shB56β-1 and pSM2c-shB56β-2 (Open Biosystems); pMKO-1-shB56γ was a gift of Dr. W. Hahn (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). The controls used were either sh0 (nucleotides 398–418 in the IEX-1 sequence), which was found to be ineffective at down-regulating IEX-1 expression, or shGFP (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The cassette encoding the H1 promoter-shIEX-1 or shRNA-control was introduced in a self-inactivating lentiviral/human immunodeficiency virus vector (TRIPΔU3). This vector also expresses GFP under the EF1α promoter. Production and titration of infectious particles were done as described (24Hamelin V. Letourneux C. Romeo P.H. Porteu F. Gaudry M. Blood. 2006; 107: 3106-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Cell Cultures—Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (CHO-ER) cells were described previously (19Garcia J.

Stable clones of HeLa cells expressing the shRNAs targeting B56γ and B56β were previously described (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the vectors carrying shRNA were transiently introduced in HeLa cells and the cells were harvested 48 h later. HEK-293 and UT7 cells were incubated with TRIPΔU3-H1-shIEX-1 or control lentiviruses over a period of 36 h. The transduction efficiency, determined by the percentage of GFP positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, usually reached 98%.Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Kinase Assays— Akt activation was assessed in total lysates by Western blotting with anti-pAkt-Ser473 or pAkt-Thr308 antibodies (Cell Signaling). To follow the kinetics of Akt inactivation, 24 h post-transfection the cells were either treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with serum-free medium. The cells were returned to 37 °C and harvested at various times. In some experiments, the cells were deprived of serum overnight, and stimulated with EPO or FCS for various times before lysis. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation were carried out as previously described (4Letourneux C. Rocher G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In vitro Akt kinase activity was assessed with the non-radioactive Akt kinase kit (Cell Signaling). The other antibodies used in this study were: anti-phospho: pERK, pGSK3, pFoxo3a, pan-Akt substrate, and pElk1 (Cell Signaling); anti-Akt (sc-9312), anti-ERK1 (sc-94), anti-ERK2 (sc-154), and anti-B56β from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HA (Roche). Anti-IEX-1 antiserum was as previously described (19Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

To determine whether IEX-1 could affect other growth factor-induced signaling pathways in addition to ERK, we measured Akt activity in cells expressing IEX-1. Maximal Akt activation requires phosphorylation at the two activating residues Ser473 and Thr308 (8Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, CHO cells were transiently transfected with HA-IEX-1 or empty vector and the cells were maintained in serum to activate Akt. Endogenous Akt activation was assessed both by Western blotting with Ser473 and Thr308 phosphospecific Akt antibodies and by immunoprecipitation kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, Akt phosphorylation was greatly enhanced at both Ser473 and Thr308 in cells expressing IEX-1. To determine whether IEX-1 could affect Akt activation in response to growth factors, CHO cells expressing the EPO receptor (CHO-ER, (19Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)) were transfected with IEX-1 and analyzed after 3 h starvation in a serum-free medium and stimulation with EPO, under conditions leading to increased ERK activation in the presence of IEX-1 (Ref. 19Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, B and C). No phosphorylation of Akt could be detected in non-stimulated starved cells whether they expressed IEX-1 or not. However, IEX-1 expression resulted in a great increase in EPO-induced Akt phosphorylation on both Ser473 and Thr308, at all time points and doses tested (Fig. 1, B and C). Endogenous Akt phosphorylation was also enhanced and prolonged in UT7 cells stably transfected with IEX-1, as compared with control cells (neo), upon stimulation with TPO (Fig. 1D).To examine IEX-1-dependent Akt activation further, we measured Akt kinase activity, by using an in vitro kinase assay on its substrate GSK3. Fig. 1E shows that the Akt kinase activity that could be immunoprecipitated from CHO cells expressing IEX-1 was increased, as compared with cells transfected with an empty vector. An increased and sustained in vivo GSK3 phosphorylation that paralleled pAkt levels was also detected in IEX-1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, the phosphorylation levels of several Akt substrates, detected using an anti-pan phospho-Akt substrate antibody, were greatly increased in the presence of IEX-1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, expression of IEX-1 increases Akt activity and Akt downstream signaling.IEX-1 is an early response gene product that is induced by various growth factors. Thus Akt activity should be more sustained in response to growth factors triggering IEX-1 expression. To test this, we made use of the UT7 cell line. Indeed, whereas both EPO and TPO stimulate Akt activation in this cell line, only TPO can induce IEX-1 protein expression (Ref. 24Hamelin V. Letourneux C. Romeo P.H. Porteu F. Gaudry M. Blood. 2006; 107: 3106-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A, Akt phosphorylation on both Ser473 and Thr308 was much higher and more sustained in cells stimulated with optimal doses of TPO, as compared with EPO. This increase in Akt phosphorylation translated into an increased Akt activity, as shown by the higher levels of phosphorylation of the Akt substrates GSK3 and Foxo3a observed upon TPO stimulation. Likewise, Western blotting with a pan-Akt substrate phospho-antibody shows that in TPO-treated, IEX-1 expressing cells, the global Akt-mediated phosphorylation is greatly increased, as compared with cells treated with EPO. Thus, the specific induction of the IEX-1 protein by TPO in UT7 cells correlates with the unique capacity of this cytokine to sustain Akt phosphorylation and Akt downstream signaling.FIGURE 2Endogenous IEX-1 expression is involved in sustained Akt activation induced by various growth factors. A, UT7 cells were starved overnight and stimulated for various times with either EPO (10 units/ml) or TPO (3 nm). IEX-1 expression and phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream substrates were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. B, UT7 cells were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding IEX-1 shRNA (shIEX-1) or control shRNA (shGFP and sh0). The effect of shRNA on endogenous IEX-1 expression was assessed on maximally induced IEX-1 after stimulation with 10 nm TPO in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinol-l-norleucinol for 2 h (left panel). Akt phosphorylation was analyzed upon stimulation with TPO alone for various times (right panel). C, HEK-293 cells expressing shGFP or shIEX-1 constructs were starved of serum overnight before being stimulated for various times with 2% serum. pAkt levels were quantified and normalized to total Akt levels and expressed relative to the levels of phosphorylation at the zero time point of control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm the above results, we examined Akt activation in cells in which TPO-induced IEX-1 expression was impeded by the presence of IEX-1-specific shRNA. Thus, we generated UT7 cell lines expressing shRNA for IEX-1. Expression of endogenous IEX-1 upon TPO stimulation was severely inhibited in the presence of this shRNA (Fig. 2B, left panel). As a control, we used cell lines expressing either a shRNA designed from the IEX-1 nucleotide sequence (sh0, see “Materials and Methods”) but that was found unable to down-regulate endogenous IEX-1 levels (Fig. 2B), or a shRNA targeting GFP. As shown in Fig. 2B (right panel), TPO-mediated phosphorylation of both Akt and its downstream substrate GSK3 was greatly reduced in shRNA-IEX-1 expressing cells, as compared with control cells. This effect was particularly striking after 1.5 and 3 h TPO treatments, time points at which IEX-1 is maximally induced by the cytokine. The decreased Akt activation upon down-regulation of IEX-1 expression is not specific to TPO signaling or to the particular cell context of UT7 cells, as shown by the impaired serum-induced Akt phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308 in HEK293 expressing IEX-1-shRNA (Fig. 2C). In these cells, basal expression of IEX-1 was observed but its level increased following serum stimulation. These results show that the induction of IEX-1 by various growth factors plays an important role in their capacity to control Akt activity.IEX-1 Prevents Akt Dephosphorylation—We next determined by which mechanism IEX-1 increased Akt activity. The marked ability of IEX-1 to sustain Akt signal at long stimulation time points (Fig. 1) suggested that IEX-1 may prevent Akt inactivation rather than activate upstream kinases. To test this possibility, CHO-ER cells, transfected or not with IEX-1, were first subjected to a growth factor pulse with an optimal dose of Epo (10 units/ml) to activate Akt before suppression of upstream activating signals by adding the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. pAkt levels were measured at different time points after inhibition. In agreement with previous reports (30Kim A.H. Sasaki T. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29830-29836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Li L. Ren C.H. Tahir S.A. Ren C. Thompson T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9389-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), blocking PI3K activity after growth factor exposure led to a rapid decrease in Akt phosphorylation, as shown by the rapid drop of reactivity with both anti-pAkt-Ser473 and anti-pAkt-Thr308 5 min after addition of the inhibitor. This shows that Akt is rapidly dephosphorylated at its two activating residues by endogenous active phosphatases. By contrast, in cells expressing IEX-1, although the basal Akt activation after optimal EPO stimulation was unchanged, the rate of disappearance of pAkt upon addition of LY294002 was greatly delayed (Fig. 3A). This suggests that IEX-1 reduces the rate of Akt dephosphorylation rather than increases its activation.FIGURE 3IEX-1 inhibits Akt dephosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308. CHO-ER cells were transfected with either empty or HA-IEX-1 encoding plasmids. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were either stimulated for 7 min with 10 units/ml EPO prior to addition of 30 μm LY294002 (A) or with 10% FCS for 10 min and then starved for various times in serum-free medium (B). Akt phosphorylation and IEX-1 expression were analyzed by Western blotting of total lysates. Quantification of pAkt levels in control or IEX-1 expressing cells, normalized to total ERK (A) or Akt (B) levels, is expressed relative to the levels of phosphorylation at their zero time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm these results, CHO cells were stimulated with FCS and Akt phosphorylation was measured after various times following arrest of Akt activation induced by FCS starvation.

https://openalex.org/W2070434290,"The Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase Sortase A (SrtA) anchors virulence and colonization-associated surface proteins to the cell wall. SrtA selectively recognizes a C-terminal LPXTG motif, whereas the related transpeptidase Sortase B (SrtB) recognizes a C-terminal NPQTN motif. In both enzymes, cleavage occurs after the conserved threonine, followed by amide bond formation between threonine and the pentaglycine cross-bridge of cell wall peptidoglycan. Genetic and biochemical studies strongly suggest that SrtA and SrtB exhibit exquisite specificity for their recognition motifs. To better understand the origins of substrate specificity within these two isoforms, we used sequence and structural analysis to predict residues and domains likely to be involved in conferring substrate specificity. Mutational analyses and domain swapping experiments were conducted to test their function in substrate recognition and specificity. Marked changes in the specificity profile of SrtA were obtained by replacing the β6/β7 loop in SrtA with the corresponding domain from SrtB. The chimeric β6/β7 loop swap enzyme (SrtLS) conferred the ability to acylate NPQTN-containing substrates, with a kcat/Kmapp of 0.0062 ± 0.003 m-1 s-1. This enzyme was unable to perform the transpeptidation stage of the reaction, suggesting that additional domains are required for transpeptidation to occur. The overall catalytic specificity profile (kcat/Kmapp(NPQTN)/kcat/Kmapp(LPETG)) of SrtLS was altered 700,000-fold from SrtA.

Recently, much attention has been focused on the role of surface protein virulence factors in the pathogenesis of Gram-positive bacteria (1Paterson G.K. Mitchell T.J.

These covalently anchored proteins mediate such diverse processes as adherence to and invasion of host endothelial tissues, immune system evasion, and iron acquisition (4Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 5Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. Biometals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inhibition of surface protein anchoring has thus emerged as a possible new therapeutic strategy for treatment of Gram-positive infections (6Cazzola M. Page C.P. Matera M.G. Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2004; 10: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Sortases are a family of transpeptidases that catalyze the covalent attachment of these surface proteins to the peptidoglycan layer of the Gram-positive cell wall (4Marraffini L.A. Dedent A.C. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support a role for sortases in the pathogenicity of infections. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus in which srtA was genetically deleted are unable to anchor surface proteins in vivo and show a reduced ability to form renal abscesses in mice (7Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Jensen E.R. Lenoy E. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The srtA knock-out in Listeria monocytogenes has been shown to be less invasive in vitro, fails to anchor internalin to the cell wall in vivo, and is reduced in its ability to colonize the liver and spleen in a mouse model of infection (8Garandeau C.

Dehoux P. Jansch L. Garcia-del Portillo F. Schneewind O. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In Streptococcus gordonii, srtA inactivation leads to decreased surface protein display, reduced fibronectin binding in vitro, and a reduced ability to colonize the oral mucosa of mice (10Bolken T.C. Franke C.A. Jones K.F. Zeller G.O. Jones C.H. Dutton E.K. Hruby D.E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Likewise, srtA knockouts from Streptococcus family members S. mutans (11Lee S.F. Boran T.L. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), S. pneumonia (12Paterson G.K.

Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 2791-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and S. agalactiae (16Lalioui L. Pellegrini E. Dramsi S. Baptista M. Bourgeois N. Doucet-Populaire F. Rusniok C. Zouine M. Glaser P. Kunst F. Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have been shown to have attenuated pathogenicity. Most Gram-positive bacterial species whose genomes have been sequenced to date contain at least one sortase homolog, and many species contain multiple sortase genes (17Pallen M.J. Lam A.C. Antonio M. Dunbar K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 97-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In many cases, putative sortase genes are located within operons that contain genes encoding potential sortase substrates (proteins with C-terminal LPXTG motifs). This raises the possibility that many of these additional sortase genes are co-expressed along with their substrates, suggesting that they might play discrete functional roles by anchoring different subsets of surface proteins (17Pallen M.J. Lam A.C. Antonio M. Dunbar K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 97-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Within the genome of S. aureus, there are two sortase isoforms, termed Sortase A (SrtA) and Sortase B (SrtB). SrtA is responsible for anchoring proteins containing a C-terminal tripartite sorting signal, which consists of 1) an LPXTG pentapeptide followed by 2) a less well conserved hydrophobic domain and 3) a basic charged tail (18Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1603-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 19Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Both the hydrophobic domain and the charged tail help to retain the putative surface protein in the membrane prior to sortase-catalyzed anchoring. SrtA cleaves the LPXTG sequence between the threonine and glycine residues by use of a nucleophilic active site cysteine (Cys184) (20Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed, which is then resolved by nucleophilic attack from an amino group on the Gly5 cross-bridge of branched Lipid II. This leads to covalent attachment of the N-terminal portion of the surface protein to Lipid II, from which it is incorporated into the bacterial cell wall (21Perry A.M. Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16241-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). SrtB functions analogously to SrtA with two key differences. First, SrtB has a specificity profile different from that of SrtA. It selectively anchors the NPQTN-containing protein IsdC, and it does not anchor LPXTG-containing proteins (22Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Second, the anchor structure for SrtB is not Lipid II (a peptidoglycan biosynthetic precursor) but is the Gly5 cross-bridge of mature peptidoglycan from the staphylococcal cell wall (23Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16263-16271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the gene for SrtB is located along with its substrate in an iron-responsive operon, which is only transcribed under conditions of iron starvation (22Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Since the acquisition of iron is an essential process for bacterial colonization of mammalian host tissues (24Bullen J.J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1981; 3: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), it is likely that SrtB carries out an essential function for virulence by anchoring a protein with a specific role in iron acquisition to a unique anchor motif in the cell wall (25Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Although SrtA and SrtB are highly specific for their unique recognition motifs, to date little is known about how these enzymes discriminate between their substrates. Herein we report the application of mutagenesis, domain swapping, and kinetic analysis to identify specificity-determining regions of SrtA and SrtB. Materials—Buffer salts were purchased from Sigma.

Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and used without further purification. Protein purification was performed on an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system with a fraction collector (Amersham Biosciences). Chelating Sepharose fast flow chromatography resin (Amersham Biosciences) and a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 high resolution gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) were used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. HPLC was performed using an Agilent 1200 series system equipped with an autosampler, fraction collector, diode array UV detector, fluorimeter, and either a semipreparative Jupiter™ octadecyl silica column (Phenomenex) or a fast analytical (4.6 × 50 mm, 3 μm) octadecyl silica column (Vydac). MALDI-MS was performed on a Voyager™ MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD ion trap electrospray mass spectrometer. Expression and Purification of SrtAΔN24—N-terminally His6-tagged SrtAΔN24 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pET15bSrtAΔN24 (26Kruger R.G. Otvos B. Frankel B.A. Bentley M. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce expression of SrtAΔN24, and cells were harvested by centrifugation after 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and lysed with an EmulsiFlex-C5 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Inc.). Lysate was clarified by centrifugation and then applied to a chelating Sepharose fast flow column. The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole for 30 min, SrtAΔN24 was eluted using a linear gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole over 1 h, and fractions were collected. SrtA-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight into 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. Purified SrtAΔN24 was concentrated to 683 μm using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Centriplus centrifugal filters (Amicon, Inc.). SrtAΔN24 concentration was determined using a calculated extinction coefficient (ε280 = 17,420 m-1 cm-1). Protein molecular weight was confirmed by MALDI-MS. Mutagenesis of SrtA—The plasmid pET15bSrtAΔN24 was used as a template for introduction of single amino acid substitutions by PCR, using the QuikChange® method (Stratagene, Inc.). All PCRs contained 5% Me2SO. The mutant I182S was amplified using the primers 5′-CAATTAACATTAAGTACTTGTGATGATTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAATCATCACAAGTACTTAATGTTAATTG-3′. Mutant A118Y was amplified using primers 5′-CAAAATATTTCAATTTATGGACACACTTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAAGTGTGTCCATAAATTGAAATATTTTG-3′. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of SrtBΔN21—SrtBΔ21 was amplified from the genomic DNA of S. aureus strain N315, using the primers SrtBΔ21fwd (5′-CCCGAATTCCATATGGGTTACAAAATTGTTCAAACATATATT-3′) and SrtBΔ21rev (5′-CATTAGCGTGGATCCCTCGAGTTAACTTACCTTAATTATTTTTGC-3′). The resulting DNA fragment was doubly digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase into the subcloning vector pUC19, which had previously been digested with EcoRI and BamHI, to generate the plasmid pUC19SrtBΔN21. This plasmid was transformed into DH5α cells and isolated with a QIAprep™ spin miniprep kit, and the desired sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. BamHI and NdeI were used to liberate the gene from the plasmid, and it was then cloned into a similarly treated pET15b expression vector to generate the plasmid pET15bSrtBΔN21. This construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and cells were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7, and then 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce expression of SrtBΔN21; cells were grown overnight at 25 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in the same buffer, and protein was purified in the same manner as for SrtAΔN24. Purified SrtBΔN21 was concentrated to 948 μm using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Centriplus centrifugal filters (Amicon). SrtBΔN21 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using the extinction coefficient ε280 = 26,360 m-1 cm-1. Protein molecular weight was confirmed by MALDI-MS. Sequence and MEME Analysis of Sortase Family Members—The sequences of S. aureus SrtA and SrtB were used as starting points for a bioinformatic analysis. PSI-BLAST (NCBI) (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) searches were performed on each to identify similar sequences. Five iterations of PSI-BLAST identified 214 similar sequences to SrtA, whereas two iterations of PSI-BLAST produced 42 sequences with similarity to SrtB. Combining these and removing all proteins with E values of greater than 3.0 × 10-5 left 175 hits. Further analysis reduced this number to 135 sequences that showed conservative identities with either SrtA or SrtB. ClustalW (EMBL-EBI) (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

MEME analysis was performed on a small scale alignment of 25 sequences (17 SrtA homologs, 8 SrtB homologs). Discovered motifs were mapped onto a T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment using GeneDoc (31Nicholas K.B. Nicholas H.B.J. Deerfield D.W.I. EMBNEW News. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar) and then onto the existing structures of SrtA (Protein Data Bank code 1T2W) and SrtB (Protein Data Bank code 1NG5) (Fig. 1). In light of previous sortase activity studies (26Kruger R.G. Otvos B. Frankel B.A. Bentley M. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), this sequence-structural analysis helped identify putative sequence motifs and residues likely to be involved in substrate binding, recognition, and catalysis. Generation of a Chimeric β6/β7 Loop Swap (SrtLS)—To generate the novel sequence of SrtLSΔN24, the technique of splicing by overlap extension was used (32Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The plasmids pET15bSrtAΔN24 (26Kruger R.G. Otvos B. Frankel B.A. Bentley M. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and pET15bSrtBΔN21 were used as starting templates for PCR. Two rounds of this technique were needed to generate SrtLSΔN24, which contains the sequence of SrtAΔN24 from the 5′ end to the β6/β7 loop, the sequence of SrtBΔN21 for the loop, and then the sequence of SrtAΔN24 from the loop end to the 3′ end of the gene. Splicing by overlap extension-PCR was performed according to the method of Horton et al. (32Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Reaction products were gel-purified following each successful amplification and used as templates for the next rounds of PCR. The following primers were used (underlined sequences are those derived from srtB): Primer a, 5′-CCCGCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′; Primer b, 5′-CTTTAGTAGTAGTTTTATCTCTTATACTTG-3′; Primer c, 5′-CAAGTATAAGAGATAAAACTACTACTAAAG-3′; Primer d/g, 5′-CCGTTTAGAGGCCCCAAGGGGTTATGC-3′; Primer e, 5′-GTAATTAATGTTAATTGTTTATCTTTTACCG-3′; Primer f, 5′-CGGTAAAAGATAAACAATTAACATTAATTAC-3′. The final PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI, ligated into pET15b vector that had previously been digested with NdeI and BamHI, and then transformed into DH5α cells. DNA sequencing confirmed generation of the vector pET15bSrtLSΔN24. Expression and Purification of SrtLSΔN24—pET15bSrtLSΔN24 (26Kruger R.G. Otvos B. Frankel B.A. Bentley M. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells, which were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then grown overnight at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and lysed with an EmulsiFlex-C5 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Inc.). The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation and applied to a chelating Sepharose fast flow column. The column was washed with 5 mm imidazole, and SrtLSΔN24 was eluted using a linear gradient of 5–500 mm imidazole. SrtLSΔN24-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (previously equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). SrtLSΔN24-containing fractions were collected and concentrated to 490 μm using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Centriplus centrifugal filters (Amicon). SrtLSΔN24 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using the extinction coefficient ε280 = 18,490 m-1 cm-1. Mutagenesis of SrtLS—Single point mutations A118Y and I208S and the double mutant A118Y/I208S were introduced into the plasmid pET15bSrtLSΔN24 by PCR, using the same methods and primers used for mutagenesis of SrtA. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Aliquots (300 μl) of SrtAΔN24, SrtBΔN21, and SrtLSΔN24 were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 30 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. Samples were diluted in the same buffer until final protein concentrations were ∼10 μm. Protein concentrations of the final solutions were obtained spectrophotometrically (SrtAΔN24 ε280 = 17,420 m-1 cm-1, SrtBΔN21 ε280 = 26,360 m-1 cm-1, SrtLSΔN24 ε280 = 18,490 m-1 cm-1). For each protein, 400 μl was transferred to a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length for CD data collection. CD spectra were measured on an Aviv Instruments model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer. Data were collected at 25 °C, from 260 to 190 nm in 1-nm steps, with a scanning speed of 4 s/nm. Three scans were taken for each sample and were averaged and corrected for background absorbance. The observed CD signal (millidegrees) was converted to mean residue ellipticity (θm, degrees cm2 dmol-1 residue-1) using Equation 1, θm=θobs/10(cdn) (Eq. 1) where θobs represents the observed ellipticity in degrees, c is the protein concentration (m), d is the optical path length in cm, and n is the number of amino acid residues in the protein (202 for SrtAΔN24, 244 for SrtBΔN21, and 228 for SrtLSΔN24). Solid Phase Synthesis of Peptide Substrates—Substrates Abz-LPETG-Dap(DNP)-NH2 and Abz-KVENPQTNAGT-Dap-(DNP)-NH2 were synthesized by the Fmoc/piperidine strategy on PAL resin on a 0.25-mmol scale using an Applied Biosystems 433A synthesizer. Peptides were cleaved from the resin via incubation with a 95:2.5:2.5 trifluoroacetic acid/water/triisopropylsilane mixture for 2.5 h. The peptides were precipitated using cold diethyl ether following the removal of excess trifluoroacetic acid via rotary evaporation. After filtration, the precipitate was dissolved in a 50:50 water/acetonitrile mixture and lyophilized to yield crude peptide. A semipreparative C18 Jupiter™ column was used to purify the peptides to ≥98% purity via reverse phase HPLC. MALDI-time-of-flight MS was used to verify the identities of the purified products (Abz-LPETG-Dap-(DNP)-NH2, m/z = 885.3; Abz-KVENPQTNAGT-Dap(DNP)-NH2, m/z = 1527.7). HPLC Assays for Sortase Activity—The assay procedure of Kruger et al. (33Kruger R.G. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for SrtA was employed to measure SrtB activity, with the modifications indicated (see Fig. 3). For SrtB, initial activity assays were performed with varying concentrations of enzyme (1, 10, 50, or 94.8 μm) and the peptide substrates Abz-KVENPQTNAGT-Dap(DNP)-NH2 (2.4 mm) and NH2-Gly5-OH (2 mm). Reactions were performed in a 100-μl volume in standard assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 300 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) at 37 °C, and the enzyme volume added to each assay was kept under one-tenth of the final assay volume. Assays were initiated by the addition of the enzyme; were incubated for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h; and were quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 1.2 n HCl. 50 μl of the quenched reaction mixture was then injected onto a Vydac reverse phase fast analytical C18 column (4 ml/min) and separated using a linear gradient from 0 to 45% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 5 min. Peaks corresponding to elution of the substrate (Abz-KVENPQTNAGT-Dap(DNP)-NH2) and product (NH2-G-Dap(DNP)-NH2) were monitored at 355 nm. At the same time, peaks corresponding to elution of the substrate and the transpeptidation product (Abz-KVENPQTGGGGG-OH) were monitored by fluorescence, with excitation at 318 nm and emission at 420 nm. Integration of the areas of the substrate and product peaks at 355 nm allowed for determination of the percentage of substrate converted to product. Linearity of SrtB was confirmed by plotting product formation as a function of time over the 4-h assay period. For determination of the kinetic parameters of SrtB, 94.8 μm enzyme was used in a 3-h assay, since these conditions were expected to give product conversions of 1–5% during the assay. The substrate Abz-KVENPQTNAGT-Dap(DNP)-NH2 was varied from 74.8 μm to 21.9 mm, whereas NH2-Gly5-OH was held constant at 2 mm. GraFit version 4.0 (Erithacus Software) was used to fit the raw data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, producing estimates of the kinetic parameters kcat and Km. Initial assays for comparison of SrtA, SrtB, and SrtLS activity with Abz-KVENPQTNAGT-Dap(DNP)-NH2 were conducted using a 94.8 μm concentration of each enzyme and 2.7 mm substrate. Assays were incubated for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, and the amount of product was quantitated as described above for SrtB. Estimates of the second order parameter kcat/Kmapp were obtained using the relation, kcat/Kmapp=vo/([E]·[S]) (Eq. 2) where vo is the initial velocity, [E] is the concentration of enzyme, and [S] is the concentration of substrate. Initial activity assays for each enzyme with Abz-LPETG-Dap(DNP)-NH2 were performed and analyzed similarly. Mass Spectrometry of Reaction Products—To confirm the identity of reaction products, individual product peaks from the HPLC assay were collected with a fraction collector and concentrated using a speed vacuum system. Dried, concentrated products were resuspended in 100 μl of 50% CH3CN in H2O and injected onto an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD ion trap electrospray mass spectrometer. MS data were collected in positive ion mode, and ions corresponding to putative reaction products were selected, fractionated, and analyzed by MS/MS. Despite carrying out similar biological functions, SrtA and SrtB have different specificity profiles. SrtA anchors LPXTG-containing proteins, whereas SrtB is specific for NPQTN-containing proteins (22Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Kruger R.G. Otvos B. Frankel B.A. Bentley M. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In order to better understand the basis for this specific recognition, we used sequence analysis to look at SrtA and SrtB isoforms from various Gram-positive bacteria. We looked for sequence positions that were highly conserved among SrtA and SrtB sequences but were isoform-specific. We then performed global analysis of the structures of S. aureus SrtA (Protein Data Bank code 1T2W) and SrtB (Protein Data Bank code 1NG5) to identify larger domains that differed structurally between the two enzymes (34Zong Y.

Narayana S.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 105-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and domain-swapping were then used to explore the effect of each identified region on SrtA specificity. Bioinformatic and MEME Analysis of Sortase A and B Isoforms—A large scale multiple sequence alignment of 135 sequences of Sortase A and B isoforms from different Gram-positive species was performed using the program ClustalW. Analysis of this alignment highlighted the presence of several conserved residues and domains. The active site cysteine (Cys184 in SrtA) was conserved among all sortase homologs, as were the nearby histidine and arginine residues (His120 and Arg197 in SrtA). These three conserved residues are located within two conserved domains along the β4, β7, and β8 strands, which make up the sortase active site. MEME analysis of a smaller alignment of 25 sequences revealed the presence of seven conserved motifs (Table 1). Four of these motifs were common to both SrtA and SrtB isoforms. When these motifs were mapped onto the existing crystal structures of SrtA and SrtB from S. aureus, they corresponded to distinct structural features. Motifs 1 and 3 corresponded to the β4 and β7 strands, respectively, which make up the floor of the sortase active site. Motif 2 maps onto the β1 and β2 strands of both proteins, where it forms part of the unde"

Using a sequential-mixing stopped-flow approach, we were also able to show that the observed multiphasic binding kinetics is the result of sequential events as opposed to the existence of multiple enzyme populations in dynamic equilibrium that interact with ligands at different rates. We propose a three-step minimal model for inhibitor binding, developed with kinetic simulations, consistent with our previously reported model for the binding of substrates, although it is possible that even more steps are involved.

A. 2006; 103: 13565-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently we utilized transient-state kinetic methods as well as equilibrium binding studies to study the steps involved in substrate binding by P450 3A4 and demonstrated that binding is a complex process involving multiple-sequential steps for five substrates, testosterone, midazolam, bromocriptine, flavone, and α-naphthoflavone (39Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This complexity is in contrast with the simple single-step enzyme-ligand binding interactions commonly observed for other P450s (40Griffin B.W. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4740-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present work we extended our studies to the binding of inhibitors to P450 3A4 using the structurally diverse drug molecules ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, and indinavir plus the synthetic peptide morphiceptin (YPFP-NH2) (Fig. 1) (29Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our transient kinetic experiments show that inhibitor binding by P450 3A4 is even more complex than substrate binding. Kinetic modeling yielded a minimal binding model consistent with our previous three-step model for substrate binding (39Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow fluorescence studies using morphiceptin yielded evidence for this “silent” step, providing further confirmation for our previous observations with bromocriptine and α-naphthoflavone. Sequential-mixing stopped-flow experiments were used to eliminate an alternate multiple enzyme populations model (42Koley A.P. Robinson R.C. Friedman F.K. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43Koley A.P. Buters J.T.M. Robinson R.C. Markowitz A. Friedman F.K. J. Biol.

Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) for binding of ligands by P450 3A4. Chemicals—Indinavir was kindly provided by J. H. Lin (Merck). Itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and morphiceptin (the peptide YPFP-NH2) were purchased from Sigma. Itraconazole and ketoconazole were used as racemates. Testosterone was obtained from Steraloids (Newport, RI). All other reagents and solvents were obtained from general commercial suppliers. All chemicals were used without further purification. Enzymes—Recombinant P450 3A4 with a C-terminal His5 tag (46Gillam E.M.J. Baba T. Kim B.-R. Ohmori S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (29Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—An Aminco DW2a/OLIS or a Cary 14/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA) was used to collect steady-state absorbance spectra. Most stopped-flow experiments were done with an OLIS RSM-1000 instrument using a 4 × 20-mm cell for absorbance measurements and a 4 × 4-mm cell for fluorescence measurements. Sequential mixing stopped-flow experiments were conducted using an SX-18MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a 20-μl observation cell (10-mm path length). For all sequential mixing experiments, a non-return valve was fitted before the inlet port on the stop valve, and the pressure-held option was selected during the data collection to minimize pressure artifacts. Spectral Binding Titrations—Spectrophotometric equilibrium binding experiments were carried out by titrating P450 3A4 (1 μm) with the ligand (at 23 °C) in a total volume of 1.0 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Final CH3OH concentrations were ≤2% (v/v). The reference cuvette, containing an equal concentration of enzyme in buffer, was titrated with an equal volume of the vehicle solvent. UV-visible spectra (350-500 nm) were recorded after each addition, and the absorbance differences (at the wavelength maximum and minimum) were plotted against the added ligand concentrations. Spectral dissociation constants (Ks, indicates a spectrally estimated dissociation constant) were estimated as described previously (39Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA) or DynaFit (47Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) simulation software (Biokin, Pullman, WA). Because of the high affinities of the ligands (Ks within 5-fold of the P450 concentration), a nonlinear regression analysis using a quadratic equation was applied to determine the Ks for all the ligands reported in this study: ΔA = A0 + (Bmax/2[E]){(Ks + [E] + [L]) - {(Ks + [E] + [L])2 - 4[E][L]}1/2}, where A is the absorbance difference, Bmax is the maximum absorbance difference extrapolated to infinite ligand concentration, L is the ligand concentration, and E is the total enzyme concentration (A0 is a coefficient in each analysis and not relevant here). In all cases reported in this study, the quadratic equation proved to result in more satisfactory fits compared with the hyperbolic equation (ΔA = Bmax[L]/(Ks + [L])). With ketoconazole, the best fit was obtained with the Hill equation ΔA = Bmax[L]n/(Kns + [L]n), where n is a measure of cooperativity. Single-mixing Stopped-flow Experiments—Binding kinetics of ligands to P450 3A4 was monitored at 23 °C using the OLIS RSM-1000 stopped-flow instrument by observing the changes in heme Soret spectra as a function of time (in the absorbance mode) or the fluorescence quenching of ligands (in the fluorescence mode). One of the drive syringes contained purified P450 3A4, diluted to 2-6 μm in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The second drive syringe contained the ligand solution (indinavir, dissolved in H2O, was diluted in buffer to the desired concentration, and the stock solutions of all other ligands, dissolved in CH3OH, were diluted in buffer to ≤2% (v/v) final CH3OH concentration). Immediately after mixing equal amounts (150 μl) of reagent from both syringes, UV-visible spectra (350-500 nm) were collected in the rapid-scanning mode with a 16 × 1-mm scan disk, which is a component of the instrument and is used to acquire spectra rapidly. Depending on the data collection time, between 10 and 1000 scans s-1 were acquired. Time-resolved spectra were collected with at least five ligand concentrations for each ligand. Kinetic traces were extracted from the acquired spectra utilizing either ΔA390 or ΔA390-A418 (or ΔA390-A420) measurements and were analyzed using the manufacturer’s software (OLIS), GraphPad Prism, or DynaFit. In the fluorescence experiments, after mixing the contents of the drive syringes, emission spectra were collected as a function of time with a mid-plane photomultiplier accessory and using the 16 × 1-mm scan disk. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm for morphiceptin. In general, an excitation monochromator slit of 1.24 mm was used, corresponding to an 8-nm bandpass. A 0.6-mm slit was used before the chamber housing the scan disk and mid-plane photomultiplier for the time-resolved scans. Time-resolved scans were analyzed and deconvoluted using the OLIS SVD global fitting software (48Golub G.H. Reinsch C. Numerische Mathematik 1. 1970; 4: 403-420Crossref Scopus (1913) Google Scholar, 49Chan T.F.

Alternatively, data were collected using a >285-nm long-pass filter in the single-wavelength mode. Generally, averages of the results of four to eight individual experiments were used in the subsequent data analyses, and S.E. indicate the goodness of the fit to the average of the multiple experiments. Sequential-mixing Stopped-flow Experiments—In the sequential mixing experiments (done in the Applied Photophysics SX-18MV instrument), P450 3A4 (8 μm, 110 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of the first ligand, and the mixture was “aged” in the delay loop. After a pre-determined amount of time, the contents of the delay loop were pushed into the mixing chamber using 90 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and combined with the second ligand (90 μl). The changes in the Soret spectrum were monitored as ΔA390 in the single-wavelength mode. ITC—ITC titrations were carried out at 25 °C using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) as described previously (39Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, before the titration, P450 3A4 was dialyzed twice against 100 volumes of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 4 h. The clotrimazole solution (5 μm in dialysis buffer) in the ITC cell was titrated with P450 3A4 (32 μm) loaded into the ITC syringe. The first injection (2 μl, omitted from analysis) was followed by 4 injections of 5 μl and 23 injections of 10 μl with 8-min intervals between injections. The cell contents were stirred at 450 rpm to provide immediate mixing. The thermal power (heat per unit time) required to keep the cell temperature constant was monitored with time. The peaks observed in the power versus time plots (thermograms, not shown) were integrated using the ORIGIN software (MicroCal). The heats of dilution were obtained from the saturating part of the thermograms and subtracted from each integrated peak. The total heat change was plotted versus the concentration of P450 added to give a titration curve (binding isotherm), expressed in units of kJ mol-1. Kinetic Modeling of Data—Kinetic binding data were fit to various proposed models using DynaFit software (47Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Rate constants were estimated by globally fitting the raw kinetic data obtained at five different ligand concentrations to the proposed models. The initial ligand concentrations were allowed to float within 10% of the starting value in the system, and in most cases the concentration adjustment was <5%. Sample scripts and some of the pertinent results are included in the supplemental. Spectral Equilibrium Binding Titrations—Spectrophotometric titrations were first carried out to estimate the binding affinities of various ligands to P450 3A4, and spectral dissociation constants (Ks) were obtained from the titration curves as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The P450 3A4 inhibitors indinavir, clotrimazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and morphiceptin (the peptide YPFP-NH2) all showed a “type II” shift in the heme Soret spectra (Fig. 2A), typical of a ligand (nitrogen atom) coordinating to the heme iron (1Palmer G. Reedijk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 665-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. DeVoss J.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Estimated Ks values are summarized in Table 1. The amplitudes of the changes varied due to the specific interactions of the various inhibitors with the heme iron (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Binding rates and affinities of ligands to P450 3A4LigandConcentration used for initial analysisSoret shiftKskaaFrom initial analysis.

Open table in a new tab All of the inhibitors except morphiceptin showed tight binding to P450 3A4 (Table 1), clotrimazole being the highest affinity ligand with an estimated Ks of 30 nm. The results obtained for the azole inhibitors are consistent with the previously obtained inhibition potencies for these compounds (57Wanchana S. Yamashita F. Hashida M. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 20: 1401-1408Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 58Stresser D.M. Blanchard A.P. Turner S.D. Erve J.C.L. Dandeneau A.A. Miller V.P. Crespi C.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 1440-1448PubMed Google Scholar). The titration plot obtained for ketoconazole binding displayed some sigmoidicity, and a fit to the Hill equation was more satisfactory compared with a hyperbolic (results not shown) or quadratic equation (which did not consider cooperative behavior) (Fig. 2B). Binding Kinetic Experiments—The kinetics of binding of type II ligands to P450 3A4 were studied using stopped-flow absorbance by monitoring the changes in the heme Soret spectra over time. Spectra collected over time showed a decrease in absorbance at ∼390 nm and an increase in absorbance at ∼420 nm for all the ligands, consistent with coordination to the heme iron (Fig. 3A). Kinetic traces extracted at these wavelengths were used to describe the kinetics of ligand binding (Fig. 3B). In all cases, a single-exponential fit (results not shown) applied to the kinetic data (ΔA390-A420) was not adequate to describe the binding kinetics, suggesting a complex multi-step binding event. Therefore, bi-exponential fitting was used in an attempt to describe the binding kinetics of these ligands with P450 3A4 (Fig. 4, A, C, E, and G). Although reasonable fits were obtained, visual inspection of the residuals plots (Fig. 4, A, C, E, and G, top panels) suggests that the binding events are probably even more complex than can be defined by a classical bi-exponential binding fit. This deviation from a bi-exponential fit became more apparent at increasing ligand concentrations. The data were also fit to a tri-exponential equation (Fig. 4, B, D, F, and H), resulting in more evenly distributed residuals plots (Fig. 4, B, D, F, and H, top panels).FIGURE 4Binding kinetics of ligands to P450 3A4. A and B, the kinetic trace (ΔA428-A390) obtained for clotrimazole (10 μm) binding to P450 3A4 was fit to a bi-exponential plot with rates of 0.72 and 0.05 s-1 (A) and to a tri-exponential fit with rates of 2.3, 0.22, and 0.03 s-1 (B). C and D, the kinetic trace (ΔA433-A405) obtained for ketoconazole (5 μm) binding to P450 3A4 was fit to a bi-exponential plot with rates of 7.7 and 0.75 s-1 (C) and to a tri-exponential fit with rates of 14.3, 3.0, and 0.46 s-1 (D).

Two adjacent homologous genes (alpA and alpB), which encode H. pylori outer membrane proteins, are thought to be associated with adhesion and cytokine induction. We co-cultured gastric epithelial cells with wild type H. pylori strains and their corresponding alpA/alpB-deleted mutants (ΔalpAB). Results were confirmed by complementation. Flow cytometry confirmed that AlpAB was involved in cellular adhesion. Deletion of alpAB reduced interleukin (IL)-6 induction in gastric epithelial cells. Deletion of alpAB reduced IL-8 induction with East Asian but not with Western strains. All AlpAB-positive strains tested activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Fos, and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. Activation of the Jun-N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, and NF-κB was exclusive to AlpAB from East Asian strains. ΔalpAB mutants poorly colonized the stomachs of C57BL/6 mice and were associated with lower mucosal levels of KC and IL-6. Our results suggest that AlpAB may induce gastric injury by mediating adherence to gastric epithelial cells and by modulating proinflammatory intracellular signaling cascades.

Knock-out of alpAB or alpA also decreased adherence to epithelial cells in paraffin-embedded tissues, consistent with the notion that the alpA and alpB gene products are involved in the adherence phenotype (8Odenbreit S.

In the present study, we constructed precise deletions of the entire alpA and alpB genes (ΔalpAB mutants) and ΔalpAB complementation mutants to exclude the effects of secondary mutations. These mutants were used to examine H. pylori adherence to gastric epithelial cells. We also investigated the effects of alpAB on induction of IL-6 and IL-8 as well as effects the AlpAB-induced signaling cascade on different transcription factors involved in IL-6 or IL-8 promoter activation. Finally, we examined the role of alpAB in colonization and gastric inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. H. pylori Mutants—We constructed precise whole alpA and alpB-deleted mutants (ΔalpAB) using gene replacement mutagenesis (13Fischer W. Puls J. Buhrdorf R. Gebert B. Odenbreit S. Haas R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). PCR fragments containing the upstream (hp0911; hp number and location from H. pylori strain 26695, GenBank™ accession number AE000511) and downstream (hp0914) sequences of the alpA-alpB genes were amplified and cloned into to the T7Blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), resulting in pTHP911 and pTHP914, respectively. We used template DNA from strain TN2GF4 (denoted TN) to construct mutants from East Asian strains and strain ATCC43504 (denoted 43504) to construct mutants from Western strains. A chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette (cat) was inserted at the BamHI site of pTHP911, resulting in pTHP911::cat. Finally, the blunt fragment of pTHP911::cat was inserted at the HincII site of pTHP914, resulting in pTHP911/914::cat. The purified plasmid was used to inactivate chromosomal genes by natural transformation as previously described (14Heuermann D. Haas R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Chromosome-based systems were used for complementation assays (15McDaniel T.K. Dewalt K.C. Salama N.R. Falkow S. Helicobacter. 2001; 6: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We selected hp0796 as a target gene, since our previous study confirmed that isogenic hp0796 mutants induced IL-8 from gastric epithelial cells and bound to the cells similar to wild type (WT) strains (6Yamaoka Y. Kwon D.H. Graham D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7533-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). PCR fragments containing the whole alpA-alpB gene with its promoter were amplified and cloned into the pBluescript II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in pBalpAB. We used template DNA from strain TN and 43504. A kanamycin resistance gene cassette (aph-A3) was inserted at the BamHI site of pBalpAB, resulting in pB[alpAB-aph-A3]. PCR fragments containing the whole hp0796 were amplified and cloned into the pBluescript II vector (Stratagene), resulting in pBhp0796. Finally, the blunt fragment of pB[alpAB-aph-A3] was inserted at the Eco47III site of pBhp0796, resulting in pBhp0796::alpAB-aph-A3. The purified plasmid was used to complement ΔalpAB mutants by natural transformation using cat and ahp-A3 as double selectable markers. PCR and immunoblot for AlpA and AlpB were performed to confirm the absence or presence of the genes and gene products. The previously described isogenic hopZ mutant (ΔhopZ), whole cag pathogenicity island (PAI)-deleted mutants (Δcag PAI), and hp0796 mutants (Δhp0796) were used as controls for reduced adherence, for reduced ability to induce IL-6 and IL-8, and to compare the effect of complemented mutants, respectively (6Yamaoka Y.

Cell Lines and Co-culturing—The human gastric epithelial cancer cell lines MKN28 and MKN45 (Riken Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) and AGS (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured according to standard procedures. H. pylori were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the epithelial cell cultures at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for the indicated periods of time.

Anti-CagA and anti-VacA antibodies (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) were used at a 1:3,000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (1:3,000) (Bio-Rad) was used as secondary antibody. Blots were developed with the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The tyrosine phosphorylation status of CagA in infected AGS cells was examined as previously described (10Odenbreit S. Kavermann H. Puls J. Haas R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine cellular signaling, we used phosphospecific antibodies and control total antibodies for the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and ATF-2 at a 1:1,000 dilution (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000) (Bio-Rad) was used as second antibody. IL-6 and IL-8 ELISA—IL-6 and IL-8 protein levels produced from human cell lines co-cultured with H. pylori were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described (6Yamaoka Y. Kwon D.H. Graham D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7533-7538Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 20Lu H. Wu J.Y. Kudo T. Ohno T. Graham D.Y. Yamaoka Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4954-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Phenotypes of Infected Cells—The presence of the hummingbird phenotype in AGS cells co-cultured with H. pylori for 10 h was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. When more than 40% of the cells were elongated, the hummingbird phenotype was considered to have been induced. H. pylori Binding Assays—H. pylori were stained with the red fluorochrome PKH26 (Sigma), as described previously (21Beswick E.J. Bland D.A. Suarez G. Barrera C.A. Fan X. Reyes V.E. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2736-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After washing with culture medium, samples were incubated with gastric cells for 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). Luciferase Plasmids—Human IL-8 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmids p162hu.IL8-luc+ and site-directed mutant plasmids with mutations in four sites (interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE)-like element, activator protein-1 (AP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), or NF-κB) were described previously (17Yamaoka Y. Kudo T. Lu H. Casola A. Brasier A.R. Graham D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1030-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Full-length human IL-6 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid p1168hu.IL6-luc+ and site-directed mutant plasmids with mutations in four sites (i.e. AP-1, CRE, C/EBP, or NF-κB) were described previously (20Lu H. Wu J.Y. Kudo T. Ohno T. Graham D.Y. Yamaoka Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4954-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The PathDetect cis-reporting and the PathDetect trans-reporting systems were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Cell Transfection—Each luciferase reporter vector (2 μg) was transiently transfected into MKN28 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Nine hours after H. pylori treatment, the cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Normalized luciferase activity is presented as firefly luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity. The results are presented as -fold increase of luciferase activity in infected cells relative to uninfected controls. Binding of Transcription Factors—Nuclear extracts of MKN28 cells (uninfected or infected for 90 min) were prepared using hypotonic/nonionic detergent lysis (22Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Casola A. Duan W. Shen Q. Garofalo R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3551-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay with duplex oligonucleotides for the consensus NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB binding sites (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as previously described (17Yamaoka Y. Kudo T. Lu H. Casola A. Brasier A.R. Graham D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1030-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Lu H. Wu J.Y. Kudo T. Ohno T. Graham D.Y. Yamaoka Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4954-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For semiquantitation, density was measured by scanning using Image J 1.36 software from the National Institutes of Health (available on the World Wide Web at rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). We compared the amount of radioactive probe in the protein-DNA complexes after standardization with free probe. Density is presented as -fold induction compared with uninfected control. In the gel mobility supershift assays, commercial antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the binding reactions before adding the probes. The same nuclear extracts were tested by ELISA using commercially available kits (TransAM™ NF-κB kit for p65 and TransAM™ AP-1 family kit for c-Jun and c-Fos; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. c-fos and c-jun mRNA Expression by Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA extracted from infected and uninfected cells for 1 h using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was converted to cDNA and then was analyzed by real time RT-PCR. The levels of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs were measured by SYBR green I-based quantitative real time RT-PCR and, following normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, were expressed as -fold induction relative to the uninfected control, as previously described (23Wu J.Y. Lu H. Sun Y. Graham D.Y. Cheung H.S. Yamaoka Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5111-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Gan L. Doroudi R. Hagg U. Johansson A. Selin-Sjogren L. Jern S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Animal Studies—Six-week-old, specific pathogen-free male C57BL/6 mice were used. They were maintained in an air-conditioned room designed for infected animals with a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle and free access to food and water. No specific pretreatments were used before orogastric H. pylori inoculation or before the animals were sacrificed. Mice were orogastrically inoculated three times (days 0, 1, and 2) with 0.5 ml of the H. pylori inoculum preparation (∼3 × 108 colony-forming units/ml) or sterile brain heat infusion broth (as an uninfected control) through a feeding needle. Eight weeks after inoculation, colonization efficiency and inflammation were measured. At necropsy, the glandular stomach and first part of the duodenum were removed and opened along the greater curvature. Stomachs were divided longitudinally into two parts, and then one-half was bisected longitudinally into two parts. One-half was transferred to 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline to quantitate H. pylori and measure cytokine protein levels, one-quarter was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological examination, and one-quarter was placed into TriZol Reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at –80 °C for cytokine mRNA analysis. The gastric mucosa was separated as much as possible from the underlying muscle by sharp dissection. All experimental protocols were approved by the local Ethical Committee specializing in animal experiments. The number of bacteria on the gastric mucosa was assessed as previously described (16Yamaoka Y. Kita M. Kodama T. Imamura S. Ohno T. Sawai N. Ishimaru A. Imanishi J. Graham D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1992-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Sawai N. Kita M. Kodama T. Tanahashi T. Yamaoka Y. Tagawa Y. Iwakura Y. Imanishi J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 279-285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of colonies per plate was counted and calculated as the colony-forming units per stomach. We also measured mucosal KC and IL-6 levels. Since mice do not possess the IL-8 gene, we selected KC, which is a CXC chemokine whose promoter activity is regulated by binding to CRE and NF-κB binding sites. Mucosal KC levels were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) as previously described (16Yamaoka Y. Kita M. Kodama T. Imamura S. Ohno T. Sawai N. Ishimaru A. Imanishi J. Graham D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1992-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since mucosal IL-6 levels in infected mice were below the level of detection of the ELISA kit (3.1 pg/ml) irrespective of H. pylori infection, we measured mucosal IL-6 mRNA levels by RT-PCR as previously described (16Yamaoka Y. Kita M. Kodama T. Imamura S. Ohno T. Sawai N. Ishimaru A. Imanishi J. Graham D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1992-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). IL-6 mRNA levels were presented as a ratio of 10× IL-6 mRNA to β-actin mRNA. Statistical Methods—Data are presented as mean and S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test, nonpaired t test, and Fisher’s exact test, depending on the data set of concern. A p value of less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Characterization of ΔalpAB Mutants—We used 11 H. pylori strains (TN, JK51, JK34, JK35, CPY2052 (denoted CPY), CA23, RD26, GI2766, 26695, J99, and 43504). TN, JK51, JK34, JK35, and CPY were isolated in Japan; CA23 in Korea; RD26, GI2766, and J99 in the United States; 26695 in the United Kingdom; and 43504 in Australia. Strains JK51, JK34, 26695, and GI2766 were isolated from patients with gastritis; TN, JK35, CPY, RD26, and J99 from patients with peptic ulcers; and CA23 from a patient with gastric cancer. All are cag PAI-positive, vacA s1 (producing vacuolating cytotoxin), and contain functional BabA and OipA. After natural transformation, we picked eight clones of each ΔalpAB mutant from the 11 parental strains. Gene inactivation was confirmed by PCR and immunoblot for AlpA and AlpB (Fig. 1). We confirmed that all ΔalpAB clones produced CagA, VacA, BabA, and OipA (Fig. 1). Since all clones retained the ability to translocate/phosphorylate CagA (Fig. 1) and to induce the hummingbird phenotype (data not shown), there was no possibility that secondary mutations in the cag PAI influenced cytokine induction, which was observed in a previous study (12Selbach M. Moese S. Meyer T.F. Backert S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Effect of AlpAB on IL-6 and IL-8 Induction—The amount of IL-6 and IL-8 secreted into the gastric epithelial cell culture supernatant reached maximal levels at 24 h after H. pylori infection irrespective of the strain and cell types used (data not shown). Since the levels were similar among clones, we used one clone of each mutant in subsequent experiments. ΔalpAB mutants varied in their ability to induce IL-8 production by gastric epithelial cells in a strain-dependent manner (Fig. 2 for MKN28 cells and supplemental Fig. 1S for MKN45 cells and AGS cells). ΔalpAB mutants from strains isolated in East Asia had ∼50% less IL-8 than their respective parental WT strains. In contrast, the ability to induce IL-8 was similar among parental strains isolated in Western countries and their ΔalpAB mutants. To exclude the possibility of polar effects and secondary mutations, complementation of alpAB genes was constructed. alpAB genes from strains TN and 43504 are designated alpABTN and alpAB43504, respectively. As expected, expression of alpABTN in TNΔalpAB restored the ability to induce IL-8 to levels observed in the WT strain (Figs. 2 and 1S). Complementation of 43504ΔalpAB with alpAB43504 did not change its ability to induce IL-8, whereas complementation of 43504ΔalpAB with alpABTN increased the ability to induce IL-8. Complementation of TNΔalpAB with alpAB43504 only partially restored the ability to induce IL-8. Interestingly, all ΔalpAB clones showed decreased levels of IL-6 induction from MKN28 cells irrespective of the parental strain (Fig. 2). In MKN45 cells and AGS cells, IL-6 levels were below detection irrespective of H. pylori infection. Complementation of ΔalpAB mutants with intact alpAB genes restored the ability to induce IL-6 in strains TN and 43504 (Fig. 2), confirming that AlpAB is involved in IL-6 induction. Effect of AlpAB on Adherence—Adherence to gastric epithelial cells was decreased with all ΔalpAB mutants irrespective of their other characteristics (Fig. 2 for MKN28 cells and supplemental Fig. 2S for AGS cells and MKN45 cells). The degree of reduction by ΔalpAB mutants was even greater than with ΔhopZ mutants. Complementation of ΔalpAB mutants with intact alpAB genes restored the ability to adhere to the cells (Figs. 2 and 2S), confirming that AlpAB is involved in adherence to epithelial cells. Effect of AlpAB on Activation of IL-6 and IL-8 Promoters—Luciferase reporter activity of the plasmid containing a –162/+44 fragment of the IL-8 promoter was induced by WT H. pylori strains in MKN28 cells (Fig. 3). The activity decreased when using ΔalpAB mutants from East Asian strains. However, the activity was not changed when using ΔalpAB mutants from Western strains. As expected, the decreased activity associated with TNΔalpAB was restored by complementation with alpABTN but not with alpAB43504. Luciferase reporter activity of the plasmid containing the full-length human IL-6 promoter was also induced by WT H. pylori infection, and ΔalpAB mutants significantly reduced the activity irrespective of the origin of the strain (Fig. 3). Luciferase activity was restored by complementing ΔalpAB mutants with intact alpAB genes for both TN2GF4 and 43504. Functions of the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters were examined further by mutating each binding site and testing strains TN and 43504 and their respective mutants (Fig. 4). We used site-directed mutant plasmids of the IL-8–162/+44 fragment with mutations in four sites (ISRE-like element, AP-1, C/EBP, or NF-κB) and site-directed mutant plasmids of full-length human IL-6 promoter with mutations in four sites (i.e. AP-1, CRE, C/EBP, or NF-κB). In agreement with previous studies (17Yamaoka Y. Kudo T. Lu H. Casola A. Brasier A.R. Graham D.Y. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 1030-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), mutation of the ISRE-like element, AP-1, and NF-κB binding sites in the IL-8 promoter significantly reduced the luciferase activity induced by WT H. pylori (Fig. 4). Mutation of the C/EBP binding site did not affect the luciferase activity irrespective of H. pylori infection. Also in agreement with previous studies (20Lu H. Wu J.Y. Kudo T. Ohno T. Graham D.Y. Yamaoka Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4954-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), mutation of each binding site in the IL-6 promoter significantly reduced the luciferase activity induced by WT H. pylori (Fig. 4). C/EBP had a clearly different effect on the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters during H. pylori infection, since only the C/EBP binding site in the IL-6 promoter was H. pylori-inducible. Mutation of the NF-κB binding sites in the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters almost completely abolished luciferase activity even when induced by WT H. pylori infection, making it difficult to evaluate the roles of AlpAB in NF-κB activation from this experiment. Similar levels of luciferase activity of were observed when plasmids containing mutations of the AP-1 site in the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters were analyzed in WT strains, ΔalpAB mutants, and complemented ΔalpAB mutants using both parental strains TN and 43504. However, since mutation of the AP-1 binding site in the IL-6 and IL-8 promoters reduced the luciferase activity induced by TNΔalpAB or by 43504ΔalpAB, a primary role of AlpAB on AP-1 activation was not confirmed from this experiment. In contrast, mutation of the CRE binding site in the IL-6 promoter affected the luciferase activity induced by WT strains, but not by TNΔalpAB or by 43504ΔalpAB, consistent with AlpAB having a role in activation of CRE binding. To further examine the effects of ΔalpAB on NF-κB, AP-1, and CRE signal transduction, we used the PathDetect cis-reporting plasmids pNF-κBluc, pAP-1luc, and pCREluc, which contain the luciferase reporter with multiple repeats of the NF-κB, AP-1, and CRE consensus binding sequences (Fig. 5). Luciferase activities of the NF-κB-, AP-1-, and CRE-responsive reporters were induced by each WT H. pylori strain in MKN28 cells. Importantly, NF-κB activity was significantly higher in East Asian WT H. pylori than in Western WT strains ("

The FK506-binding protein (FKBP) is an important regulator of channel activity, and disruption of the RyR2-FKBP12.6 association has been implicated in cardiac disease. In the present study, we investigated whether the RyR-FKBP association is redox-regulated. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays of solubilized native RyR2 from cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) with recombinant [35S]FKBP12.6, we found that the sulfydryl-oxidizing agents, H2O2 and diamide, result in diminished RyR2-FKBP12.6 binding. Co-sedimentation experiments of cardiac SR vesicles with [35S]FKBP12.6 also demonstrated that oxidizing reagents decreased FKBP binding. Matching results were obtained with skeletal muscle SR. Notably, H2O2 and diamide differentially affected the RyR2-FKBP12.6 interaction, decreasing binding to ∼75 and ∼50% of control, respectively. In addition, the effect of H2O2 was negligible when the channel was in its closed state or when applied after FKBP binding had occurred, whereas diamide was always effective. A cysteine-null mutant FKBP12.6 retained redox-sensitive interaction with RyR2, suggesting that the effect of the redox reagents is exclusively via sites on the ryanodine receptor. K201 (or JTV519), a drug that has been proposed to prevent FKBP12.6 dissociation from the RyR2 channel complex, did not restore normal FKBP binding under oxidizing conditions. Our results indicate that the redox state of the RyR is intimately connected with FKBP binding affinity.

Copello J. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Three genes coding for mammalian RyRs have been identified: RyR1 in skeletal muscle, RyR2 in heart and brain, and RyR3 in a number of tissues. The deduced primary structure of all RyRs suggests a hydrophobic C terminus forming the channel pore, with the remaining ∼80% being cytoplasmic. RyR channel activity is regulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, phosphorylation and redox status, and a number of accessory proteins.The immunophilin, FK506-binding protein (FKBP), a receptor protein for the immunosuppressants, FK506 and rapamycin, is an essential component of the RyR-Ca2+ release channel complex in both skeletal and cardiac muscle (2Jayaraman T.

This effect was reversed by reducing reagents, such as dithiothreitol (DTT), and reduced glutathione.

In this study, we present evidence that the critical interaction of the native skeletal and cardiac muscle RyR with FKBP12/12.6 is redox-sensitive.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Radioactive sulfur was obtained from Amersham Biosciences in the form of Pro-Mix containing ∼70% l-[35S]methionine and 30% l-[35S]cysteine. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. CHAPS and rapamycin were obtained from Calbiochem, whereas all other reagents were from Sigma. Redox reagents were prepared at 100× stock solutions (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4), aliquoted, and stored frozen at –80 °C. H2O2 was always added fresh from 30% aqueous solution (stored at 4 °C). K201 (46Kaneko N. Drug Dev. Res. 1994; 33: 429-438Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), obtained from Aetas Pharma Co. Ltd. (Japan), was prepared at 1 mm stock solution (10% Me2SO in 10 mm Na2-Pipes, pH 7.4), aliquoted, and kept frozen at –20 °C.Plasmid Construction—Preparation of plasmids expressing human FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, has been described previously (11Zissimopoulos S. Lai F. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 43: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A double cysteine FKBP12.6 mutant (C23S/C77I) was generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First, the C77I mutation was introduced using complementary oligonucleotide primers (forward, AGAGGGCGAAGCTGACCATCACCCCTGATGTGGCAT; reverse, ATGCCACATCAGGGGTGATGGTCAGCTTCGCCCTCT) and then the C23S mutation (forward, CCAAGAAGGGCCAAACGTCTGTGGTGCACTACACAG; reverse, CTGTGTAGTGCACCACAG-ACGTTTGGCCCTTCTTGG). Single and double mutant constructs were verified by direct DNA sequencing (BigDye; PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Cell-free Protein Expression—In vitro cell-free protein expression was carried out using the TNT T7 quick coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). Reactions were carried out in 10-μl volumes by adding the TNT mix with 1 μg of plasmid DNA together with 1 μl (0.53 MBq or 14 μCi) of [35S]methionine (Pro-Mix; Amersham Biosciences). Reaction samples were incubated in a 30 °C water bath for 90 min and terminated by placing on ice. Hemoglobin was removed from the TNT reactions using one bed volume of Ni2+-nitriloacetate resin (Qiagen).Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cardiac heavy SR vesicles (1 mg), prepared as described previously (12Zissimopoulos S. Lai F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5475-5485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), were solubilized in 200 μl of IP buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, pH 7.4, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) by overnight incubation at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The insoluble material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was withdrawn and treated with an appropriate redox reagent (2 mm DTT, 1 mm H2O2, 200 μm diamide) for 30 min at room temperature. In vitro synthesized, hemoglobin-free, radiolabeled FKBP12.6 was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The RyR2-specific Ab1093 was added at a 1:40 dilution, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein G Dynabeads (Dynal) and incubation for a further 2 h with continuous mixing. Protein immunocomplexes were isolated with the use of a magnetic particle concentrator (MPC-S; Dynal), and beads were washed three times with IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.For the experiments to test the effect of K201, the drug (10 μm) was added to the IP samples before mixing with [35S]FKBP12.6. For the experiments to test whether oxidizing conditions induce FKBP12.6 dissociation, redox reagents were applied for 30 min at room temperature or for 6 h at 4°C at the end of the IP protocol, once RyR2-FKBP12.6 immunocomplexes had formed following overnight incubation.Co-sedimentation Assays—Cardiac (200 μg) or skeletal muscle (100 μg) heavy SR vesicles were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer (10 mm Na2-Pipes, 120 mm KCl, pH 7.4, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and treated with an appropriate redox reagent (2 mm DTT, 5 mm GSH, 2 mm GSSG, 1 mm H2O2, 200 μm diamide) for 30 min at room temperature. In vitro synthesized, hemoglobin-free, radiolabeled FKBP was added and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. SR vesicles were recovered at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed once, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Autoradiography of [35S]FKBP12.6—Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was fixed (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min. The fixing solution was removed, and the gel was incubated with a fluorographic enhancer (Amplify; Amersham Biosciences) for a further 30 min and subsequently dried. The dried gel was exposed to an x-ray film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Biosciences) for variable periods of time. Densitometric analysis was performed using a GS-700 scanner (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heated at 85 °C for 5 min, and proteins were separated through a 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, strengthened with 0.5% agarose (47Tatsumi R. Hattori A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) using a semidry transfer system (Trans-Blot SD; Bio-Rad) in buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS) at 22 V for 4 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk protein in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C: RyR1-specific antibody at 1:1000 dilution (Ab2142, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to unique RyR1 residues 830–845), RyR2-specific antibody at 1:1000 dilution (Ab1093, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to unique RyR2 residues 4454–4474). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSGlutathione-induced Aggregation of RyR and FKBP—Initially, we tested the effect of redox reagents (i.e. 2 mm DTT, 5 mm GSH, 2 mm GSSG, 1 mm H2O2, 200 μm diamide) on the solubilization of the RyR. Heavy SR vesicles were treated with redox reagents for 1 h at room temperature, pelleted to remove reagents, and then incubated overnight in IP buffer followed by a centrifugation step to remove the insoluble material. We estimate that under our conditions, ∼50% of the RyR is solubilized in control or DTT-treated samples. As shown in Fig. 1A, the sulfydryl-oxidizing reagents H2O2 and diamide reduces RyR solubilization from both skeletal and cardiac SR. This could be due to increased protein aggregation, since such oxidants have been shown to induce intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds within RyR (37Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S. Zhang J. Liu S. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48Aghdasi B. Reid M. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25462-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and with the SR integral protein triadin (38Liu G. Abramson J. Zable A. Pessah I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 39Liu G. Pessah I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, RyR could not be solubilized from SR samples that had been treated with glutathione. No soluble RyR1 was detected from skeletal muscle SR treated with either reduced or oxidized glutathione or soluble RyR2 treated with GSH, whereas there was modest solubilization of RyR2 from cardiac SR treated with GSSG (Fig. 1A). We subsequently examined the effect of redox reagents on RyR, postsolubilization. Solubilized RyR remained soluble following treatment with DTT, H2O2, or diamide but became insoluble with GSH or GSSG (Fig. 1B). Some soluble RyR2 remained after treatment with GSSG.We also tested for any glutathione effects on FKBP12/12.6. In vitro synthesized [35S]FKBP12.6 was incubated with 5 mm GSH or 2 mm GSSG in the presence or absence of 10 μm rapamycin, followed by a centrifugation step. As shown in Fig. 1C, FKBP12.6 became insoluble following treatment with GSH. Interestingly, this effect was prevented by rapamycin, suggesting that the glutathione effect involves the FK506- and rapamycin-binding pocket. Treatment with GSSG occasionally resulted in partial insolubility that was again prevented by rapamycin, whereas DTT, H2O2, and diamide had no effect (data not shown). Identical results were obtained for FKBP12 (data not shown).The above results suggest that solubilized RyR as well as FKBP form protein aggregates in the presence of glutathione, and therefore the effect of the latter on RyR-FKBP association cannot be investigated. Also, in subsequent IP experiments, DTT, H2O2, and diamide were added once SR vesicles had been solubilized, in order to ensure that identical amounts of soluble RyR are processed in all IP samples examined.Sulfydryl-oxidizing Reagents Weaken the RyR-FKBP Interaction—The redox sensitivity of the RyR2-FKBP12.6 interaction was tested by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Solubilized cardiac heavy SR was treated with an appropriate redox reagent (2 mm DTT, 1 mm H2O2, 200 μm diamide) for 30 min at room temperature followed by incubation with exogenous [35S]FKBP12.6. RyR2 was immunoprecipitated with the isoform-specific Ab1093 and the presence of co-precipitated FKBP12.6 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was less FKBP12.6 recovered in the RyR2 immunoprecipitate when cardiac SR was treated with the sulfydryl-oxidizing reagents H2O2 and diamide compared with control or DTT-treated SR. On average, H2O2 decreased FKBP12.6 binding by ∼25% and diamide by ∼50%, whereas DTT had no effect (Table 1). This result suggests that diamide reacts with different or additional RyR2 cysteine(s) compared with H2O2.FIGURE 2Redox-sensitive co-immunoprecipitation of RyR2 with FKBP12.6. Solubilized cardiac heavy SR was treated with redox reagent (2 mm DTT, 1 mm H2O2, 200 μm diamide) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with in vitro synthesized, hemoglobin-free [35S]FKBP12.6, either wild-type (A) or C23S/C77I mutant (B). RyR2 was immunoprecipitated with Ab1093, and the presence of co-precipitated [35S]FKBP12.6 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% gels) and autoradiography. Aliquots of the TNT reactions, 10 and 1% of the volume processed in co-IP assays, were included in the first two lanes of the autoradiogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Redox-sensitive co-immunoprecipitation of RyR2 with FKBP12.6ControlDTTH2O2Diamide%%%%Ambient (n = 5)100105.9 ± 8.677.1 ± 10.551.1 ± 7.12 mm EGTA (n = 3)100106 ± 8.492.9 ± 9.554.9 ± 6.8100 μm CaCl2 (n = 4)100102.5 ± 5.175.1 ± 7.849.4 ± 5.82 mm MgCl2 (n = 4)100106.7 ± 6.392.2 ± 9.852.7 ± 4.1 Open table in a new tab The effects of H2O2 and diamide on the binding interaction could be due to cysteine(s) modification of the RyR2 and/or FKBP12.6. In order to test whether the two FKBP12.6 cysteine residues are involved, we generated the double mutant protein, FKBP12.6C23S/C77I. Cys77 was replaced by Ile, the corresponding residue present in FKBP12, whereas Ser was substituted for Cys23 to preserve the size and polarity of the side chain at that position. Both cysteines are located on the outer surface of the protein, away from the FK506-binding pocket, and they have not been previously implicated in the interaction with the RyR. Using co-IP assays, we found that the C23S/C77I double mutant FKBP12.6 retains binding to the RyR2 and that binding is weakened by H2O2 and diamide (Fig. 2B). FKBP12.6C23S/C77I binding to RyR2 was 102.2 ± 7.8% for DTT, 74.7 ± 6.3% for H2O2, and 47.5 ± 7.1% for diamide compared with control (n = 5). These data with FKBP12.6C23S/C77I are identical to data obtained for the wild-type protein (Table 1), suggesting that FKBP12.6 cysteine modification is not directly involved in the interaction with RyR.The redox sensitivity of the RyR2 interaction with wild-type FKBP12.6 was also tested by co-sedimentation assays. The centrifugation-based binding assay is conducted in a detergent-free environment with the RyR resident in the SR membrane. Thus, the effect of redox reagents on RyR2 in its native conformation can be studied, as opposed to with solubilized RyR2, where normally inaccessible cysteine residue(s) may be exposed to redox reagents. Intact cardiac heavy SR was treated with an appropriate redox reagent (2 mm DTT, 1 mm H2O2, 200 μm diamide) for 30 min at room temperature followed by incubation with exogenous [35S]FKBP12.6. SR vesicles were pelleted, and the presence of co-sedimenting FKBP12.6 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We observed less FKBP12.6 co-sedimenting with cardiac SR treated with H2O2 and diamide compared with control or DTT-treated SR (Fig. 3A). Cumulative data demonstrate that H2O2 decreased FKBP12.6 binding by ∼10% and diamide by ∼35% (Table 2). These values are lower than those obtained by co-IP assays, which could be due to increased accessibility of cysteine(s) or modification of additional residue(s) in detergent-solubilized RyR2.FIGURE 3Redox-sensitive co-sedimentation of RyR1/2 with FKBP12/12.6.

https://openalex.org/W2076888509,"It is now well established that exposure of cells and tissues to nitric oxide leads to the formation of a dinitrosyl-iron complex bound to intracellular proteins, but little is known about how the complex is formed, the identity of the proteins, and the physiological role of this process. By using EPR spectroscopy and enzyme activity measurements to study the mechanism in hepatocytes, we here identify the complex as a dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC) bound to Alpha class glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) with extraordinary high affinity (KD = 10-10 m). This complex is formed spontaneously through NO-mediated extraction of iron from ferritin and transferrin, in a reaction that requires only glutathione. In hepatocytes, DNDGIC may reach concentrations of 0.19 mm, apparently entirely bound to Alpha class GSTs, present in the cytosol at a concentration of about 0.3 mm. Surprisingly, about 20% of the dinitrosyl-glutathionyl-iron complex-GST is found to be associated with subcellular components, mainly the nucleus, as demonstrated in the accompanying paper (Stella, L., Pallottini, V., Moreno, S., Leoni, S., De Maria, F., Turella, P., Federici, G., Fabrini, R., Dawood, K. F., Lo Bello, M., Pedersen, J. Z., and Ricci, G. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 6372–6379). DNDGIC is a potent irreversible inhibitor of glutathione reductase, but the strong complex-GST interaction ensures full protection of glutathione reductase activity in the cells, and in vitro experiments show that damage to the reductase only occurs when the DNDGIC concentration exceeds the binding capacity of the intracellular GST pool. Because Pi class GSTs may exert a similar role in other cell types, we suggest that specific sequestering of DNDGIC by GSTs is a physiological protective mechanism operating in conditions of excessive levels of nitric oxide.

More than 30 years ago it was discovered that paramagnetic dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) 2The abbreviations used are: DNIC, dinitrosyl-iron complex; DNDGIC, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex; DNGIC, dinitrosyl-glutathionyl-iron complex; GR, glutathione reductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione.2The abbreviations used are: DNIC, dinitrosyl-iron complex; DNDGIC, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex; DNGIC, dinitrosyl-glutathionyl-iron complex; GR, glutathione reductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione. can be formed in biological systems (1Ueno T.

Such complexes, in which ferrous ion coordinates two nitric oxide molecules together with two other ligands, with characteristic EPR spectra centered at about g = 2.03 made possible their discovery in cells or tissues. Actually this is the only way in which NO can be observed directly in living systems. Although the natural occurrence of DNICs has been demonstrated unequivocally, their chemical identity in vivo is still ambiguous. In fact, even if DNICs exist as free low molecular mass complexes of the general formula (NO)2(RS)2Fe, e.g. the dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl iron complex (DNDGIC) and dinitrosyl-dicysteinyl iron complex, the existence of such free complexes in vivo has never been demonstrated; they always appear bound to unknown proteins (1Ueno T. Yoshimura T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding to proteins is possible after replacing one thiol ligand of the free complex with a protein serine, tyrosine, or cysteine to complete the coordination shell of the iron. All these paramagnetic species show very similar EPR spectra centered around g = 2.03, and this technique is unable to define their precise chemical composition (6Vanin A.F. Serezhenkov V.A. Mikoyan V.D. Genkin M.V. Nitric Oxide. 1998; 2: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Also the physiological role of DNICs is controversial; it has been suggested that they function as more stable natural NO carriers, but they are also known to have toxic effects in biological systems (1Ueno T. Yoshimura T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 82: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In particular, DNDGIC at micromolar concentrations is a potent and irreversible inhibitor of glutathione reductase (7Boese M. Keese M.A. Becker K. Büsse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol.

GSTs represent a group of enzymes ubiquitously distributed in all organisms and devoted to the cell defense. The mammalian GSTs have been grouped in at least eight classes termed Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Omega, Pi, Sigma, Theta, and Zeta (12Mannervik B. Ålin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M.

These enzymes catalyze the conjugation of GSH to the electrophilic center of many toxic compounds and also promote GSH-mediated reduction of organic hydroperoxides. In addition, GSTs may act as ligandins for xenobiotics (20Mannervik B. Chem. Scr. 1986; 26: 281-284Google Scholar) and also as antiapoptotic proteins through protein-protein interaction with Jun kinase (21Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R.

Recently, we demonstrated that Alpha, Pi, and Mu class GSTs, which represent 90–95% of all mammalian GSTs, bind the dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl iron complex with extraordinary high affinity, showing KD values of 10-10–10-9 m (9Lo Bello M.

The association of DNDGIC to GSTs has been thoroughly investigated, revealing that one of the glutathiones in the iron complex binds to the enzyme G-site, whereas the other GSH molecule is lost and is replaced by a tyrosine phenolate in the coordination of the ferrous ion (11De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, strictly speaking, the bound complex is a monoglutathionyl species (DNGIC). The x-ray crystallographic structure of DNGIC bound to GSTP1-1 has been solved recently, confirming the structure proposed on the basis of molecular modeling studies (22Cesareo E. Parker L.J. Pedersen J.Z. Nuccetelli M. Mazzetti A.P. Pastore A. Federici G. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. Julian J. Adams J.J. Parker M.W. Lo Bello M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42172-42180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Binding of DNGIC to the first subunit of the dimeric Alpha, Pi, and Mu GSTs also triggers a peculiar intersubunit communication, which lowers the affinity of the second subunit (11De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We found evidence that in crude liver homogenates one target of DNICs could be the pool of GSTs (10Turella P. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. De Maria F. Mastroberardino P. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42294-42299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which thus could represent a significant part of the “unknown” proteins that apparently bind DNICs. However, no previous studies have assessed the occurrence of such a complex-enzyme association in living cells nor has any physiological role of this phenomenon been defined. Furthermore, the intracellular iron source for DNIC formation has never been determined. This study demonstrates that DNDGIC is formed spontaneously in intact rat hepatocytes after exposure to GSNO; this complex is never detected as free species but always bound to GSTs. The preferential binding proteins in rat hepatocytes are the Alpha class GSTs, which stabilize the complex for many hours. Ferritin is the likely iron source for DNDGIC, but the amount of complex formed never exceeds the buffer capacity of the endogenous pool of GSTs. Evidence is also given that this highly specific interaction is essential to protect glutathione reductase against irreversible inactivation by DNDGIC. Materials—DNDGIC was prepared essentially as described previously (9Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizi F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, GSTP1-1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (23Board P.G. Pierce K. Biochem.

MGST1, the microsomal GST, was a generous gift of Prof. R. Morgenstern. The enzyme concentrations reported in the text for all GSTs refer to the single subunit. Horse spleen ferritin (16% iron) was a Fluka product (Buchs, Switzerland). S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was prepared as described previously (9Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Mozzi A.F. Federici G. Polizi F. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42138-42145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Preparation of Rat Liver Homogenate—Rat liver homogenate was prepared starting from 10 g of Sprague-Dawley male rat liver washed twice with 200 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The tissue was homogenized in 100 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove the nuclear fraction. The estimated concentration of the GST pool was 18 μm. Alternatively, the rat liver was homogenized in 30 ml of 0.25 m sucrose to obtain a more concentrated GST medium (56 μm). Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats (2 months old, 100–120 g) as reported previously (26Incerpi S. Spagnuolo S. Terenzi F. Leoni S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C841-C847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight, injected intraperitoneally) before rapid killing by cervical dislocation and subsequent liver dissection. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines for animal research (Italian Ministry of Health). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—After perfusion with 0.25 m sucrose and heparin to remove blood, livers from male rats (about 10 g) were excised, minced, and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem in 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (50 ml per 5 g of liver). After a brief centrifugation to remove unbroken cells, the homogenate was incubated with 1 mm GSNO for 2 h and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to isolate the nuclear fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with 20 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The collected supernatants were centrifuged at 3,300 × g for 10 min to isolate the mitochondrial fraction. With similar procedures the lysosomal fraction (16,300 × g for 20 min) and the microsomal pellet (105,000 × g for 30 min) were isolated. Each fraction was washed three times with 10 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Each fraction was tested for purity through measurement of the activities of several marker enzymes, typically located in separate cellular compartments as follows: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for the cytosol, cytochrome oxidase for mitochondria, acid lipase for lysosomes, and glucose-6-phosphatase for microsomes. In addition, the quality of isolated nuclei was examined using electron microscopy (not shown). Cross-contamination in each fraction was below 10%. The nuclear fraction showed less than 2% of cytosol contamination; the mitochondrial fraction contained less than 1% of nuclei as judged by DNA content. GST Activity—GST activity was assayed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, in the presence of 10 mm GSH and 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at 25 °C. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm where the GSH-2,4-dinitrobenzene adduct absorbs (ε = 9,600 m-1 cm-1). Glutathione Reductase Activity—Glutathione reductase activity was assayed at 25 °C using a solution of 1 mm GSSG and 0.1 mm NADPH in 1 ml (final volume) of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The activity was followed spectrophoto-metrically at 340 nm. EPR Analysis—Samples for EPR experiments were usually prepared using hepatocytes in phosphate-buffered saline or rat liver homogenate in 0.25 m sucrose with DNDGIC added from a freshly made stock solution. EPR measurements were carried out at room temperature with a Bruker ESP300 X-band instrument (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a high sensitivity TM110-mode cavity. To optimize instrument sensitivity, spectra were recorded using samples of 80 μl contained in flat glass capillaries (inner cross-section 5 × 0.3 mm) (27Pedersen J.Z. Cox R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1988; 77: 369-371Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, spectra were measured over a 200-G range using 20 milliwatts power, 2.0 G modulation, and a scan time of 42 s; typically 4–40 single scans were accumulated to improve the signal to noise ratio. The EPR signal was quantified by comparison with standard samples containing known concentrations of DNDGIC and GST, as described previously (11De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The limit of detection was ∼2 μm, and the range was linear up to at least 50 μm DNGIC-GST. Calculation of Intracellular DNIC Concentrations—DNDGIC and DNGIC-GST were determined on the basis of EPR spectra. Calculations of the cytosolic concentration of both DNGIC-GST and GSTs in rat hepatocytes and in rat liver homogenates were made assuming a hepatocyte volume of 8 × 10-12 liters and a cytosol volume corresponding to 56% of the cell volume. The volume of the cytosol is 0.28 ml per g of fresh liver (28Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The concentration of the cytosolic GSTs was 0.7 mm. Theoretical Inhibition of the Cytosolic GSTs Because of DNDGIC Binding—An inhibition simulation algorithm has been developed based on the following assumptions. (a) In the male rat liver, Alpha and Mu GSTs are 43 and 56%, respectively (29Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Rouimi P. Debrauwer L. Tulliez J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These values were confirmed for our male rat liver preparations by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (31Stella L. Pallottini V. Moreno S. Leoni S. De Maria F. Turella P. Federici G. Fabrini R. Dawood K.F. Lo Bello M. Pedersen J.Z. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6372-6379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). (b) Specific activities of Alpha and Mu GSTs are 16 and 22 units/mg, respectively. These values are the weighted average of the specific activities of the three major Alpha isoenzymes, i.e. GSTA1-1 (18 units/mg), GSTA2-2 (18 units/mg), and GSTA3-3 (14 units/mg), and of the two major Mu isoenzymes, i.e. GSTM1-1 (29 units/mg) and GSTM2-2 (15 units/mg) (32Adang A.E.P. Brussee J. van der Gen A. Mulder G. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). (c) KD values for the high and low affinity binding sites of Alpha and Mu GSTs were reported previously (11De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). (d) Half-site inhibition is operative for the Alpha GSTs, i.e. 95% inhibition when the enzyme is half-saturated (11De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Statistics—Results are shown as the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. DNDGIC-GST Interaction in Rat Liver Homogenate—In a first approach, we verified that in rat liver GST represents almost exclusively the binding protein for DNDGIC among all the cytosolic protein components present. Kinetics and EPR experiments were used for this purpose. Incubation of variable amounts of DNDGIC in a liver homogenate (56 μm total GSTs) caused instantaneous and concentration-dependent loss of GST activity. By considering the relative levels of Alpha and Mu GSTs, their different affinities for the complex (KD = 10-10 and 10-9 m for Alpha and Mu GSTs, respectively (11De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), and their different specific activities (see “Experimental Procedures”), it is possible to calculate the extent of this inhibition in case DNDGIC binds stoichiometrically and exclusively to GSTs, assuming that the isoenzyme with higher affinity (Alpha GST) is involved first. As shown in Fig. 1a, the inhibition calculated corresponds well to that found experimentally. The inhibition pattern of the purified pool of liver GSTs is also very similar (Fig. 1a). Somewhat less inhibition can be observed using more diluted samples (5 μm GSTs; data not shown), probably because of incomplete saturation of the low affinity sites of GSTs and to the instability of free DNDGIC at very low concentrations (10Turella P. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. De Maria F. Mastroberardino P. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42294-42299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The inhibition pattern observed using Alpha class specific co-substrates, like cumene hydroperoxide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, gave further indication that Alpha GST but not Mu GST is primarily involved in DNDGIC interaction (data not shown). As expected, the EPR analysis of the homogenate after reaction with substoichiometric DNDGIC confirmed that all complex is bound to protein (Fig. 2). It should be remembered that in rat liver homogenate the GST-DNGIC signal is stable for many hours, whereas DNDGIC in a GST-depleted homogenate appears as a free species and is highly unstable, with a t½ of 10 min (10Turella P. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. De Maria F. Mastroberardino P. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol.

This is followed by a second phase with a very slow increase that ends only after 14–16 h, at a concentration of ∼26 μm DNIC (not shown). The EPR spectra showed that the iron complex does not exist as a free species but is entirely bound to proteins (Fig. 3), and the spectrum is identical to that obtained after addition of authentic DNDGIC to the homogenate. The identity of DNGIC-GST is confirmed by the GST inhibition pattern that is close to that expected assuming GSTs to be the sole target of this complex (Fig. 1b). Increasing the final concentration of GSH in the homogenate up to the physiological levels in rat hepatocytes (10 mm) results in faster kinetics of the first phase for DNDGIC formation, but the final amount of complex formed is the same (not shown). The kinetics of DNDGIC formation also depends on GSNO concentration (in the range from 0.2 to 5 mm), but the final concentration of DNGIC-GST does not change appreciably (Fig. 1c). Thus it appears that iron availability is the limiting factor for the final level of the complex. In our experimental conditions, DNDGIC never exceeds the amount of the endogenous GST pool, which is 56 μm. Only by adding 50 μm of exogenous ferrous ions to the homogenate can the typical EPR signal of unbound DNICs be seen, superimposed on a large GST-DNGIC signal (Fig. 3). In that case, the GST activity almost disappears, and the amount of the bound DNIC corresponds to the concentration of the entire pool of cytosolic GSTs. DNDGIC Formation in Intact Hepatocytes—Exposure of rat hepatocytes to GSNO causes a time-dependent intracellular accumulation of a paramagnetic species with an EPR spectrum centered at g = 2.03, very similar to that obtained in the crude homogenate after incubation with GSNO and reasonably because of a DNGIC-GST complex (Fig. 3). Also in this case, the kinetics of DNIC formation is proportional to the GSNO concentration (within 0.5 and 2 mm), whereas the final level of the complex is almost independent (data not shown). After 2 h of incubation with 1 mm GSNO, DNGIC-GST reaches a plateau of 12 μm in the sample, corresponding to an intracellular concentration of about 0.19 mm (Fig. 1d). As in the homogenate, the EPR signal was stable for several hours; this stability might be due to a steady-state equilibrium between decomposition and re-synthesis of the complex in the presence of an excess of GSNO. However, after repeated washing of the cells, the EPR signal was still stable for hours, thus suggesting that true stabilization occurs in the cell. At fixed times, hepatocytes were sonicated and centrifuged at 105,000 × g. The cytosolic DNGIC-GST was measured by EPR spectroscopy and compared with the degree of GST inhibition. As observed in the homogenate, the inhibition pattern parallels DNDGIC formation, and it also approaches the inhibition curve calculated for exclusive binding of DNDGIC to the endogenous GSTs (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, DNGIC-GST never exceeds the concentration of the intracellular GSTs pool; it actually becomes similar to the concentration of the high affinity binding sites of Alpha GST (0.15 mm). We noticed that the concentration of DNIC measured in the cytosol (0.16 mm) is about 20% lower than that observed in intact cells, suggesting that a not negligible amount is retained by intracellular organelles or cell membranes. In fact, the 105,000 × g pellet showed the presence of a bound DNIC with an EPR spectrum very similar to that of the DNGIC-GST complex (Fig. 3). Further details were obtained by isolating nuclear, mitochondrial, lysosomal, and microsomal fractions after 1 h of incubation of a rat liver homogenate with 1 mm GSNO. All subcellular fractions contain detectable amounts of the bound DNIC, but it is mainly localized in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4). An identical distribution of bound DNICs was found by incubating separately each subcellular component with DNDGIC, indicating that the protein counterpart is constitutively bound to these fractions and not associated as a consequence of DNDGIC binding. As Alpha and Mu GSTs are considered cytosolic enzymes and the peculiar membrane-bound microsomal MGST1 is found to have scarce affinity for DNDGIC, 3G. Ricci and J. Z.

Here, by using a combination of tandem affinity purification and coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrate, for the first time, that USF and SREBP-1 interact in vitro and in vivo. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments with various USF and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) deletion constructs indicate that the basic helix-loop-helix domain of USF interacts directly with the basic helix-loop-helix and an N-terminal region of SREBP-1c. Furthermore, cotransfection of USF and SREBP-1c with an FAS promoter-luciferase reporter construct in Drosophila SL2 cells results in highly synergistic activation of the FAS promoter. We also show similar cooperative activation of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase promoter by USF and SREBP-1c. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of mouse liver demonstrates that USF binds constitutively to the mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase promoter during fasting/refeeding in vivo, whereas binding of SREBP-1 is observed only during refeeding, in a manner identical to that of the FAS promoter. In addition, we show that the synergy we have observed depends on the activation domains of both proteins and that mutated USF or SREBP lacking the N-terminal activation domain could inhibit the transactivation of the other. Closely positioned E-boxes and sterol regulatory elements found in the promoters of several lipogenic genes suggest a common mechanism of induction by feeding/insulin.

FAS is not known to be regulated by allosteric effectors or covalent modification; rather, its regulation occurs mainly at the transcriptional level. In this regard, other enzymes in the lipid synthesis pathway, such as mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (mGPAT), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and ATP-citrate lyase, are also coordinately regulated during fasting/feeding (5Hillgartner F.B.

Transcription of the FAS and mGPAT genes is not detectable in the lipogenic tissues of fasted mice, whereas feeding a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet increases transcription dramatically, concomitant with a rise in circulating insulin/glucose and a decrease in glucagon levels (7Soncini M.

By using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we originally reported that the -65 E-box present in the FAS promoter, which binds the ubiquitous upstream stimulatory factors (USF-1 and USF-2), mediates insulin activation of the FAS promoter (13Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

However, by generating mice transgenic for various 5′-deletion and mutant FAS promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs, we found that the -131 FAS promoter construct, containing the -65 E-box, is not sufficient for feeding/insulin-mediated activation of the FAS promoter in vivo. Instead, a region from -278 to -131, containing the -150 sterol regulatory element (SRE), as well as a more upstream region from -444 to -278, containing an additional E-box at -332, are required for high level activation of the FAS promoter by feeding/insulin (15Moon Y.S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the E-box at -65 and the SRE at -150 are required for transcriptional activation of FAS in vivo, as the induction of FAS transcription during fasting/refeeding was abolished in mice transgenic for mutations at these two sites (16Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). USFs belong to the class C bHLH/LZ transcription factor family and stimulate transcription by binding to E-boxes (5′-CANNTG-3′) as USF-1/USF-2 heterodimers (17Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) also belong to the bHLH/LZ family and stimulate transcription by binding to SREs present in the promoters of their target genes (19Guan G. Dai P.

Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, because of an atypical tyrosine residue, which replaces a conserved arginine present in the basic regions of this family of transcription factors, SREBPs can also bind to E-boxes, at least in vitro (24Kim J.B.

Nevertheless, we have clearly shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in transgenic mice that SREBP-1c functions through the -150 SRE and that USFs function through the -65 and -332 E-boxes in vivo (16Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function studies using mice doubly transgenic for a truncated active form of SREBP-1a and various FAS-promoter reporter constructs indicate that SREBP-1a, even when overexpressed during fasting, cannot activate FAS transcription through the -65 E-box in a -131 FAS promoter construct (26Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Regardless, loss-of-function studies in SREBP-1-/- and USF-1-/- knock-out mice clearly demonstrated that these transcription factors are critical in the regulation of FAS transcription (27Casado M.

These include Sp1 and NF-Y, both of which seem to be important for mediating a transcriptional response to cellular sterol depletion. For example, SREBP-1a was shown to cooperate with Sp1 on adjacent sites to regulate the FAS (30Magana M.M. Koo S.H. Towle H.C. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4726-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), low density lipoprotein receptor (31Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Given the apparent requirements for accessory factors in mediating a maximal response of target genes to SREBP-1a during sterol depletion, the identification of an analogous coregulator for SREBP-1c, the isoform specifically induced during feeding/insulin (15Moon Y.S.

Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The fact that SREBP-1c only modestly activates the FAS promoter in vitro (26Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but dramatically activates FAS transcription in vivo (26Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), implicates the involvement of other factors that may be absent in vitro. In this study, by using a combination of tandem affinity purification (TAP) and coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that USF and SREBP-1 directly interact in vivo. We have mapped the interaction domains to the bHLH region of each protein as well as an N-terminal region of SREBP-1c. Furthermore, through cotransfection of USF-1 and SREBP-1c in Drosophila SL2 cells, we show that these two factors synergistically activate the FAS as well as the mGPAT promoters. Importantly, we also show that USF and SREBP bind to the proximal mGPAT promoter in vivo in a manner identical to that of FAS. Functional domain mapping using USF and SREBP deletion constructs indicates that the activation domains of both proteins are required for synergy. Furthermore, the presence of closely spaced E-boxes and SREs in several lipogenic genes suggests involvement of USF and SREBP in mediating the transcriptional response to fasting/refeeding in vivo. Plasmids and Constructs—USF-1 was cloned into pCTAP-A (encoding an in-frame streptavidin affinity tag followed by a calmodulin affinity tag) (Stratagene) by PCR amplification of human USF-1 in pCDNA 3.0 (14Wang D.

A FLAG tag was also incorporated into the downstream primer. All PCR amplifications for subcloning USF and SREBP were conducted with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Insertion of USF-1 into pCTAP-A was confirmed by sequencing. A Myc tag was added to the C terminus of human SREBP-1c by PCR amplification of SREBP-1a in pCDNA-3.1 (26Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all cases where a construct containing the extreme N terminus of SREBP-1c was amplified by PCR from pCDNA3.1-SREBP-1a, the SREBP-1a sequence was converted to SREBP-1c by incorporating nucleotides encoding the first 5 amino acids of SREBP-1c into the 5′-primer. Insertion of the coding region of SREBP-1c-Myc into the correct reading frame was confirmed by sequencing. To construct GST fusions of USF-1 and SREBP-1, primers were designed to amplify the appropriate region of each transcription factor from pCDNA 3.0-USF-1 and pCDNA3.1-SREBP-1a using EcoRI and XhoI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends. Inserts were cloned into pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) followed by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. Insertion of the USF and SREBP constructs into the correct reading frame was confirmed by sequencing. To construct Drosophila expression vectors for USF-1 and SREBP-1c, the coding regions of USF-1 and SREBP-1c were amplified from pCDNA 3.0-USF-1 and pCDNA3.1-SREBP-1a using primers containing BamHI and XhoI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Inserts were ligated into the pPAC-Sp1 vector (36Courey A.J. Tjian R.

Tandem Affinity Purification—293FT cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The day before transfection, cells were seeded onto 150-mm dishes to achieve a confluency of ∼30–40%. Ten 150-mm dishes were each transfected with 10 μg of SREBP-1c-Myc and 5 μg of pCTAP-A-FLAG-USF-1 or 5 μg of pCTAP-A using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in serum free-media for ∼16 h following transfection and then replaced with complete media. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested by washing twice in PBS followed by scraping. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (Stratagene). The TAP protocol was then performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that the streptavidin-binding reaction was incubated overnight. Eluted proteins were boiled in SDS loading buffer and resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The presence of USF-1 and SREBP-1c-Myc was determined by immunoblotting with M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-Myc antibodies (4A6, Upstate). For copurification of endogenous SREBP-1 protein with USF-FLAG-TAP, HEK 293F cells were transfected with USF-FLAG-TAP vector or empty TAP vector using 293-Fectin (Invitrogen). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (38Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) 72 h after transfection and subjected to the TAP protocol. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG and anti-SREBP-1 antibodies (2A4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Preparation of Mouse Liver Nuclear Extract—Mice were fasted for 48 h and then refed a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet for 18 h. Livers were excised and homogenized in cell lysis buffer (2 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatants were discarded, and nuclei were resuspended in high salt extraction buffer (400 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The extracts were centrifuged for 60 min at 250,000 × g, and supernatants were used as nuclear extracts for subsequent analysis. Immunoprecipitation—To determine whether SREBP-1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with USF-1, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of pCDNA-FLAG-USF-1 and 10 μgof pCDNA 3.1-SREBP-1a and harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and then lysed by passing through a 21-guage needle 25 times in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH. 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates were clarified by centrifuging at maximum speed in a tabletop refrigerated centrifuge for 10 min. Antibodies (10 μg/immunoprecipitation) against USF-1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Sp1 (PEP-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control IgG were immobilized on protein A-agarose (100 μl) by incubating in 1 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 2–3 h followed by three washes in the same buffer to remove unbound antibodies. After the last wash, resins were resuspended in 800 μl of Triton X-100 lysis buffer + 200 μlof clarified lysates and incubated overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The following day, immunoprecipitates were washed five times in Triton X-100 lysis buffer followed by two additional washes in the same buffer without Triton X-100. After the last wash, immunoprecipitates were boiled in 50 μlof1× SDS loading buffer, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-FLAG and anti-SREBP-1 (2A4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies as described above. To determine whether USF-1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with SREBP-1c-Myc, cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCDNA 3.1 SREBP-1c-Myc and 10 μgof pCDNA-FLAG-USF-1. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described above except that 10 μg of anti-SREBP-1 antibodies (H160, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were immobilized on protein A-agarose beads prior to immunoprecipitation. GST-Pulldown Assay—Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with various GST-USF-1 and GST-SREBP-1c fusion constructs. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were grown to an A600 of ∼0.6 in 250 ml of LB media followed by induction of protein expression by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for ∼4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 9 ml of PBS. Cells were lysed by five 1-min cycles of sonication on ice. Following sonication, glycerol and Triton X-100 were added to concentrations of 10 and 1%, respectively, and incubated with gentle rotation at room temperature for 1 h. Aliquots of the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at maximum speed in a tabletop refrigerated centrifuge. Approximately 500 μg of each lysate containing GST fusion proteins were added to 100 μlof glutathione-agarose resin and brought to a final volume of 1 ml with PBS bead-binding buffer (1× PBS, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose resin for 2–3 h followed by three washes in binding buffer to remove unbound GST fusion proteins. FLAG-USF-1 or SREBP-1c in pCDNA 3.1 was used as DNA templates for in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase, followed by in vitro translation with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine (2 μl of 10 mCi/ml) in the same reaction. Coupled in vitro transcription and translation reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer, and 5 μlof in vitro translated and transcribed 35S-labeled USF-1 or SREBP-1c was added. Complexes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking and then washed seven times in 1 ml of binding buffer followed by boiling in 100 μl of SDS-loading buffer. Captured proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and exposed to film to detect the presence of 35S-USF-1 and 35S-SREBP-1 by autoradiography. In parallel experiments to assess the correct size and integrity of GST fusion proteins, the same procedure was followed except that no in vitro transcribed and translated proteins were added to GST complexes, and SDS-polyacrylamide gels were analyzed by Coomassie staining of purified proteins. In experiments where 35S-USF-1 was immunoprecipitated from the reticulocyte lysate reaction, 10% of the in vitro translation reaction was mixed with 1 μg of anti-USF-1 antibodies (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1 ml of PBS bead-binding buffer and immunoprecipitated overnight. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose, washed five times with PBS bead-binding buffer, and eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, for 5 min. The eluates were neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 7.4, and added to GST and GST-SREBP immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and processed as described. For copurification of endogenous SREBP-1 with GST-USF-1-FLAG from mouse liver, nuclear extracts were added to immobilized GST or GST-USF-1-FLAG fusion protein and incubated overnight with gentle rotation. Following extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with glutathione and then subjected to a second round of purification on anti-FLAG resin (Sigma). Eluted complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to detect the presence of GST-USF-1-FLAG and endogenous SREBP-1. Transfection of SL2 Cells for Functional Studies—Drosophila SL2 cells were maintained as described (39Roder K. Latasa M.J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30543-30550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Approximately 16–20 h before transfection, cells were plated at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells/ml into 48-well plates. Cells were transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. Each well received the indicated amount of pPAC-USF-1 and/or pPAC-SREBP-1c expression vector (generally 1–25 ng) and 500 ng of luciferase reporter construct along with 10 ng of the control plasmid pAC-5.1/V5-His/lacZ for normalization of transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA transfected per well was brought to 1 μg with the empty expression vector pPAC-0 (470–500 ng/well). Cells were harvested ∼48 h after transfection, and luciferase/β-galactosidase activities were assayed using the dual-light system (Applied Biosystems). Each transfection was carried out in triplicate. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on fasted/refed mice were performed as described previously (16Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Primer sequences for amplification of the proximal region of the mouse mitochondrial GPAT promoter were 5′-ACAGCCACACTCACAGAGAATGGGGC-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGGCAGACTCGGCGTTCCGGAG-3′. This produces a predicted amplicon size of 182 bp. Interaction of USF and SREBP-1c in Vivo—Our previous results in transgenic mice have indicated that binding sites in the FAS promoter for both USF and SREBP-1c are required for activation of FAS transcription by feeding/insulin. We also demonstrated that if binding of USF to the E-box at -65 is prevented by mutation, then SREBP does not bind to the -150 SRE in vivo (16Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S. Mol.

In addition, functional studies in USF-/- and SREBP-1-/- mice showed that FAS transcription is significantly reduced when either factor is missing (27Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol.

These highly suggestive data led us to investigate a possible mutual interaction of USF and SREBP-1c. To determine whether USF and SREBP-1c can physically interact in vivo, we employed the tandem affinity purification (TAP) technique (41Drakas R. Prisco M. Baserga R.

https://openalex.org/W1972147469,"Although the involvement of protease-activating receptor PAR1 and PAR4 is well established in platelet aggregation, their role in platelet adhesion and spreading has yet to be characterized. We investigated platelet adhesion and spreading on a fibrinogen matrix after PAR1 and PAR4 stimulation in correlation with the activation of two MAPKs, ERK2 and p38. Of the two PAR-activating peptides (PAR-APs), PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP, which both induce adhesion, only PAR4-AP induced full platelet spreading. Although both PAR1-AP and PAR4-AP induced ADP secretion, which is required for platelet spreading, only PAR4-AP induced sustained Ca(2+) mobilization. In these conditions of PAR4 induction, ERK2 and p38 activation were involved in platelet spreading but not in platelet adhesion. p38 phosphorylation was dependent on ADP signaling through P2Y12, its receptor. ERK2 phosphorylation was triggered through integrin alphaIIbbeta3 outside-in signaling and was dependent on the Rho pathway. ERK2 and p38 activation induced phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and actin polymerization, respectively, necessary for cytoskeleton reorganization. These findings provide the first evidence that thrombin requires PAR4 for the full spreading response. ERK2 and p38 and sustained Ca(2+) mobilization, involved in PAR4-induced platelet spreading, contribute to the stabilization of platelet thrombi at sites of high thrombin production."
https://openalex.org/W2085856731,"Glucose stimulates both insulin secretion and hydrolysis of arachidonic acid (AA) esterified in membrane phospholipids of pancreatic islet β-cells, and these processes are amplified by muscarinic agonists. Here we demonstrate that nonesterified AA regulates the biophysical activity of the pancreatic islet β-cell-delayed rectifier channel, Kv2.1. Recordings of Kv2.1 currents from INS-1 insulinoma cells incubated with AA (5 μm) and subjected to graded degrees of depolarization exhibit a significantly shorter time-to-peak current interval than do control cells. AA causes a rapid decay and reduced peak conductance of delayed rectifier currents from INS-1 cells and from primary β-cells isolated from mouse, rat, and human pancreatic islets. Stimulating mouse islets with AA results in a significant increase in the frequency of glucose-induced [Ca2+] oscillations, which is an expected effect of Kv2.1 channel blockade. Stimulation with concentrations of glucose and carbachol that accelerate hydrolysis of endogenous AA from islet phosphoplipids also results in accelerated Kv2.1 inactivation and a shorter time-to-peak current interval. Group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β) hydrolyzes β-cell membrane phospholipids to release nonesterified fatty acids, including AA, and inhibiting iPLA2β prevents the muscarinic agonist-induced accelerated Kv2.1 inactivation. Furthermore, glucose and carbachol do not significantly affect Kv2.1 inactivation in β-cells from iPLA2β-/- mice. Stably transfected INS-1 cells that overexpress iPLA2β hydrolyze phospholipids more rapidly than control INS-1 cells and also exhibit an increase in the inactivation rate of the delayed rectifier currents. These results suggest that Kv2.1 currents could be dynamically modulated in the pancreatic islet β-cell by phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to yield non-esterified fatty acids, such as AA, that facilitate Ca2+ entry and insulin secretion.

The effects of AA on β-cell intracellular [Ca2+] dynamics are likely to reflect the combined actions on such ion channels, possibly in concert with effects on G-protein-coupled receptor 40 signaling. In this study, we investigated the effects of arachidonic acid and iPLA2β on the Kv2.1-delayed rectifier channel of the pancreatic β-cell and on islet [Ca2+] dynamics. We find that incubating islet β-cells with exogenous arachidonic acid results in significant reduction of total Kv activity and increased glucose-stimulated islet [Ca2+] oscillations. Concentrations of glucose and carbachol that stimulate islet PLA2 activity (13Konrad R.J. Jolly Y.C. Major C. Wolf B.A. Biochim. Biophys.

We observe similar reductions in Kv currents with a genetically modified INS-1 insulinoma cell line that overexpresses iPLA2β. As far as we are aware, genetically modified cell lines with stably altered expression of iPLA2β have not heretofore been used to examine the role of the enzyme in modulating the activity of specific β-cell ion channels involved in regulating [Ca2+] dynamics. Isolation and Culture of Mouse, Rat, and Human Islets of Langerhans, Insulinoma Cells, and HEK Cells—Islets were isolated from pancreata of 1- to 5-month-old C57BL/J6 wild-type mice (Jackson Laboratories); of iPLA2β-/- mice, which were generated as described elsewhere (24Ramanadham S.

Human cadaveric islets were a generous gift from Dr. M. Garfinkel, University of Chicago. Islets were dissociated in 0.005% trypsin, placed on glass coverslips, and cultured for 16 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, concentrations of glucose specified in the figure legends, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. INS-1 cells and HEK cells expressing Kv2.1-GFP (a generous gift from Michael Tamkun (42O'Connell K.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2155-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) were cultured for 16 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells and islets were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Electrophysiological Recordings—Voltage-activated currents were recorded using whole-cell ruptured patch clamps with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Patch electrodes (2–4 micro-ohms) were loaded with intracellular solution containing (in mmol/liter) KCl, 140; MgCl2·6H2O, 1; EGTA, 10; Hepes, 10; MgATP, 5; pH 7.25 with KOH. Cells were perifused with a Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) containing (in mmol/liter) NaCl, 119; CaCl2·[(H2O)6], 2; KCl, 4.7; Hepes, 10; MgS04, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; glucose, 14.4; adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. When indicated, cells were incubated with arachidonic acid (Sigma) in ethanol (<0.3%). Ethanol (0.03%) treatment of cells alone had no effect on their KV currents. When indicated, cells were pretreated with a bromenol lactone (BEL) iPLA2β inhibitor (43Song H. Ramanadham S. Bao S. Hsu F.F. Turk J.

Cells were also pretreated with the S or R enantomers of BEL obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI) in 20 mm glucose and then treated with carbachol. S-BEL inactivates iPLA2β but not iPLA2γ, and R-BEL inactivates iPLA2γ but not iPLA2β (71Jenkins C.M. Han X. Mancuso D.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

The inactivation curves were fitted to the waveform with a single exponential function using Excel software and plotted with the standard error of the mean as a dashed line. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—An inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a dual rotating-disk confocal scanner (CSU10; Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo, Japan) was used for confocal imaging of HEK cells expressing KV2.1-GFP. The cells were illuminated at 488 nm, and emitted light was filtered through a 530/30 nm filter (Omega Filters, Brattleboro, VT). Measurement of Cytoplasmic [Ca2+]—Mouse islets were incubated (20 min, 37 °C) in KRB supplemented with 5 μmol/liter of Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope equipped with an epifluorescence illuminator and a 20× fluorescence objective (Fryer Company Inc., Huntley, IL) and MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were perifused at 37 °C at a flow of 1 ml/min with appropriate KRB-based solutions that contained glucose concentrations specified in the figures with or without the indicated concentrations of arachidonic acid or tolbutamide. The ratios of emitted fluorescence intensities at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (F340/F380) were determined every 5 s with background subtraction. Effects of Arachidonic Acid on β-Cell Kv2.1 Channel Activity— Stimulation of pancreatic islet β-cells with glucose induces both the secretion of insulin and hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, and the latter event is thought to facilitate Ca2+ entry and thereby to amplify insulin secretion (7Wolf B.A. Pasquale S.M.

https://openalex.org/W1965828533,"Nf1 (neurofibromin 1) is a Ras-GAP protein that regulates cytokine-induced proliferation of myeloid cells. In previous studies, we found that the interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP; also referred to as interferon regulatory factor 8) activates transcription of the gene encoding Nf1 (the NF1 gene) in differentiating myeloid cells. We also found that NF1 activation requires cytokine-stimulated phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) domain of ICSBP/IRF8. In this study, we found that ICSBP/IRF8 cooperates with PU.1 and interferon regulatory factor 2 to activate a composite ets/IRF-cis element in the NF1 promoter. We found that PU.1 binds directly to the NF1-cis element, and DNA-bound PU.1 interacts with IRF2, recruiting IRF2 to the cis element. This interaction requires cytokine-induced phosphorylation of specific serine residues in the PU.1 PEST domain and of a conserved tyrosine residue in the IRF domain of IRF2. We found that ICSBP/IRF8 interaction with the NF1-cis element requires pre-binding of PU.1 and IRF2. The conserved IRF domain tyrosine in ICSBP/IRF8 is required for interaction with the DNA-bound PU.1-IRF2 heterodimer. NF1 deficiency in myeloid progenitor cells results in cytokine hypersensitivity and myeloproliferation. Therefore, these studies identify a target gene for the previously observed tumor-suppressor effect of PU.1. Additionally, these studies identify a tumor-suppressor function for the “oncogenic” transcription factor, IRF2.

Consistent with a role in NF1 transcription, proliferative abnormalities in ICSBP/IRF8-deficient myeloid progenitor cells can be rescued by expression of the Nf1GAP-related domain (4Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we also found that activation of NF1 transcription requires cytokine-induced phosphorylation of a specific ICSBP/IRF8 tyrosine residue (Tyr-95) (15Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This residue is in the conserved IRF domain that is thought to be involved in DNA-binding or protein/protein interactions of IRF proteins. ICSBP/IRF8 is a substrate for SHP1 and SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatases in undifferentiated myeloid cells (15Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol.

However, a constitutively activated SHP2 mutant, described in human subjects with MDS, AML, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, dephosphorylates ICSBP/IRF8 in differentiated and undifferentiated myeloid cells (15Huang W.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8816-8820Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Such activated SHP2 mutants also induce cytokine hypersensitivity in myeloid progenitors (15Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G.

Blood. 2005; 105: 3737-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). IRF proteins regulate target gene transcription by interacting with several different DNA-binding site consensus sequences. ICSBP/IRF8 represses cis elements with PRDI consensus sequences (5′-TCACTT-3′) by interacting directly with DNA. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated ICSBP/IRF8 can activate PRDI-cis elements by interaction with DNA-bound IRF1 (19Sharf R. Meraro D. Azriel A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper F. Hauser H. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). ICSBP/IRF8 also binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (5′-GAAANNGAAA-3′). Interferon-stimulated response elements can be repressed by an interaction between ICSBP/IRF8, the ets protein Tel, and histone deacetylase 3 (20Kuwata T. Gongora C. Kanno Y. Sakaguchi K. Tamura T. Kanno T. Basrur V. Martinez R. Appella E. Golub T. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7439-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ICSBP/IRF8 activates gene transcription by interacting with composite ets/IRF-cis elements (also referred to as EICE sequences). Such ets/IRF sequences have a loose consensus (5′-GGAA(A/G)TGNNA-3′) and are found in a number of genes expressed in mature phagocytes and involved in the immune response. Examples include genes encoding the respiratory burst oxidase proteins gp91PHOX and p67PHOX and the gene encoding the Toll-like receptor 4 (the CYBB, NCF2, and TLR4 genes, respectively) (11Rehli M.

DNA-bound PU.1 interacts with IRF1, and this DNA-bound heterodimer recruits ICSBP/IRF8 and the CREB-binding protein (11Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

These interactions require post-translational modification of the proteins in differentiating myeloid cells. Specifically, interaction of ICSBP/IRF8 with the DNA-bound PU.1-IRF1 heterodimer requires phosphorylation of PU.1 Ser-148 and ICSBP/IRF8 Tyr-95 (16Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The ICSBP/IRF8-binding cis element in the proximal NF1 promoter has homology to composite ets/IRF consensus sequences found in myeloid-specific genes. This suggests possible involvement of PU.1 in NF1 transcriptional regulation and perhaps another IRF protein. The goal of these investigations is to determine the mechanism of cytokine-induced NF1 transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. This will be approached by identifying the components of the NF1 transcriptional activation complex. Although composite ets/IRF consensus sequences have been identified in a number of genes involved in the inflammatory response, no such cis elements have previously been identified in target genes regulating proliferation. Identification of homologous cis elements that interact with common trans-factors in genes that regulate both differentiation and proliferation would suggest a common mechanism of cytokine activation of different types of genes. This could have implications for understanding the inter-relationship between differentiation-progression and proliferation-arrest during myelopoiesis. Protein Expression Vectors—The ICSBP/IRF8 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Ben Zion-Levi (Technion, Haifa, Israel), and the full-length cDNA was generated by PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNAamp, as described (21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The cDNA for IRF2 in the pcDNAamp vector was obtained from Dr. Gary S. Stein (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). IRF2 with mutation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the IRF domain (Tyr-109) to phenylalanine was generated by PCR using the Clontech “QuikChange” protocol, as described (16Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant clones were sequenced on both strands to verify that only intended mutations had been introduced. Wild type PU.1 and PU.1 mutants with serine 41 and 45, 148, or 132 and 133 changed to alanine were obtained from Dr. Michael L. Atchison (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia) and subcloned into the pSRα mammalian expression vector. These cDNAs were also subcloned into the pGEX1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) for expression in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Reporter Constructs—An artificial promoter construct with four copies of the ICSBP/IRF8-binding cis element from the NF1 promoter (bp -320 to -336) linked to a minimal promoter and a CAT reporter (the p-TATACAT vector) was previously described (15Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This construct is referred to as nf1TATACAT. Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by MWG Biotec (Piedmont, NC). Double-stranded oligonucleotides used in EMSA and DNA affinity co-immunoprecipitation assays represent the -320- to -336-bp NF1 promoter sequence (NF1-320 to -336; 5′-ggatcccacttccggtggc-3′). The underlined sequence has homology to composite ets/IRF-cis elements from other ICSBP target genes. A double-stranded oligonucleotide with mutation of the ICSBP/IRF8-binding site (previously described (4Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) was also used in these assays (mutNF1 -320 to -336; 5′-ggatcccacaaccggtggc-3′). For in vitro binding competition assays, an oligonucleotide with the composite ets/IRF sequence for the CYBB gene was used 5′-gttttcatttcctcattgg-3′) (21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Subcloning these oligonucleotides into a plasmid vector to generate probes has been described (4Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (24Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft (Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Cells were maintained and differentiated as described (21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For differentiation experiments, U937 cells were treated for 24 or 48 h with 500 units/ml human recombinant IFNγ (Roche Applied Science) (21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). U937 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (4Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F.

Cells (32 × 106 per sample) were transfected with a vector to express the following: wild type ICSBP/IRF8, Y95F ICSBP/IRF8, or empty vector control; wild type IRF2, Y109F IRF2, or empty vector control; wild type PU.1, S148A PU.1, S132A/S133A PU.1, or empty vector control; the minimal promoter/reporter vector pTATACAT with four copies of the -320- to -336-bp NF1 sequence (nf1TATACAT) or empty vector control (pTATACAT); and p-CMVβgal (to control for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were harvested 48 h after transfection, with or without incubation with recombinant human IFNγ (500 units/ml). Lysates were analyzed for CAT and β-galactosidase activity, as described (21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract proteins were isolated from U937 cells by the method of Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar) (with the addition of protease inhibitors but not phosphatase inhibitors, as described). In some experiments, U937 cells were differentiated with 500 units/ml of IFNγ before nuclear protein isolation. Oligonucleotides probes were prepared, and EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed, as described (21Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Antibodies to phosphotyrosine, ICSBP/IRF8, IRF1, IRF2, PU.1, and irrelevant, control GST antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Western Blots of U937 Lysates Proteins—U937 cells were lysed by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. Lysate proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose, according to standard techniques. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to Nf1, ICSBP/IRF8, IRF2, PU.1, and GAPDH (to control for loading). In other studies, nuclear proteins were isolated from U937 cells (with or without IFNγ treatment). 30 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (20% acrylamide gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to PU.1, IRF2, pERK2 (as a control for IFNγ treatment), total ERK2 (as a loading control), or GAPDH (as a loading control). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Nuclear proteins were isolated from U937 cells with or without IFNγ treatment and immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions with antibody to PU.1, IRF2, phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)), or irrelevant control antibody (anti-GST), as described previously (14Scheller M. Foerster J. Heyworth C.M. Waring J.F. Lohler J. Gilmore G.L. Shadduck R.K. Dexter T.M. Horak I. Blood. 1999; 94: 3764-3771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were collected with staphylococcus protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose, as above. Western blots were serially probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, Upstate) and antibodies to IRF2 or PU.1. DNA Affinity Co-immunoprecipitation—Nuclear proteins were isolated from U937 cells with or without IFNγ treatment. Proteins (300 μg) were incubated with a biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe representing the -320- to -336-bp NF1 promoter sequence or a specific mutant, non-ICSBP/IRF8-binding sequence. Probes were immunoprecipitated with anti-biotin antibody or irrelevant control antibody under nondenaturing conditions and recovered with staphylococcus protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to ICSBP/IRF8, IRF2, and PU.1. In other experiments, 35S-labeled, in vitro translated proteins were generated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate from in vitro transcribed RNA, as described previously (16Kautz B. Kakar R. David E. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37868-37878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were also used in DNA affinity co-immunoprecipitation experiments with biotin-labeled probes, as described above. For these experiments, DNA/protein interaction was identified by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—U937 cells treated with IFN-γ for 0, 24, and 48 h were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, and lysate proteins (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with antibody to PU.1 or irrelevant control antibody. Immunoprecipitates were collected with staphylococcus protein A-Sepharose beads and separated by SDS-PAGE (20% acrylamide). Phosphorylated PU.1 protein was identified by autoradiography of the fixed and dried gel. In vitro transcribed IRF2, Y109F IRF2, ICSBP/IRF8, Y95F ICSBP/IRF8, PU.1, S148A PU.1, or S132A/S133A PU.1 mRNAs were generated from linearized template DNA using the riboprobe system, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). In vitro translated proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Control (unprogrammed) lysates were generated in similar reactions in the absence of input RNA, and proteins were radiolabeled by including [35S]methionine in the translation reaction. JM109 E. coli transformed with PU.1, IRF2, or ICSBP/IRF8 in the pGEX vector (or empty control vector) were grown to log phase, supplemented to 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. The cells were harvested and resuspended in HN buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF) and sonicated on ice (22Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105PubMed Google Scholar). Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysate was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed extensively. The beads were preincubated with control rabbit reticulocyte lysate to induce serine/threonine phosphorylation of PU.1/GST and tyrosine phosphorylation of ICSBP/GST or IRF2/GST as described (16Kautz B.

Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and identified by autoradiography of the fixed and dried gel. The Positive NF1-cis Element Binds a Multiprotein Complex—IFNγ treatment of U937 cells increases NF1 promoter activity and ICSBP/IRF8 binding to a positive cis element in the NF1 promoter (4Zhu C.

Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify other proteins that interact with this cis element, we used in vitro DNA binding assays. EMSAs were performed with a radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide representing the NF1-cis element and nuclear proteins from U937 cells. We found that IFNγ differentiation of U937 cells increases in vitro protein binding to this probe, consistent with our previous results (Fig. 1A) (4Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Huang W. Zhu C. Saberwal G. Horvath E. Lindsey S. Eklund E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6311-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We noted that the NF1-cis element has homology with the ets/IRF consensus sequences from the CYBB or NCF2 promoters. Therefore, we used double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors representing these cis element to investigate binding specificity of the NF1-protein complex. These competitors were compared with homologous oligonucleotide (ds NF1) or an oligonucleotide with mutation which abolishes protein binding to the NF1-cis element (ds mutNF1) (described (4Zhu C. Saberwal G. Ly Y.F. Platanias L.C. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50874-50885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). In EMSA with the NF1 probe and nuclear proteins from IFNγ-differentiated U937 cells, we found that the CYBB and NCF2 oligonucleotides compete for protein complex binding (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the NF1-cis element interacts with PU.1 and one or more IRF proteins. Therefore, we performed EMSA with the NF1 probe, nuclear proteins from IFNγ-treated U937 cells, and antibodies to various transcription factors (Fig. 1C). In these studies, we found that the shifted complex is cross-immunoreactive with PU.1, ICSBP/IRF8, and IRF2 but not IRF1. Because the NF1-cis element appears to bind a multiprotein complex, we tested the ability of various combinations of PU.1, IRF2, and ICSBP/IRF8 antibodies to disrupt the complex (Fig. 1C). We found that the complex is completely disrupted by combining all three antibodies. We also used DAPA to determine the impact of differentiation on assembly of the multiprotein complex on the NF1-cis element. To determine specificity of binding, wild type NF1-cis element probe (ds NF1) was compared with the binding-mutant probe (ds mutNF1). These oligonucleotides were biotin-labeled and incubated with U937 nuclear proteins. Probes were precipitated with anti-biotin antibody, and co-precipitating proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blot (Fig. 1D). In this assay, we also find that IFNγ treatment increases interaction of PU.1, IRF2, and ICSBP/IRF8 with the NF1-cis element probe. In contrast, we found previously that PU.1 and IRF1 bind the CYBB- and NCF2-cis elements in undifferentiated myeloid cells. For those cis elements, differentiation increases ICSBP/IRF8 interaction with these proteins but does not increase DNA binding of PU.1 and IRF1. Our current results suggest differences in the activation of various ets/IRF-cis elements, even in the same lineage.

Before undergoing apoptosis because of trophic factor deprivation, primary motor neuron cultures become immunoreactive for nitrotyrosine. We show here using tyrosine-containing peptides that free radical processes mediated by peroxynitrite decomposition products were required for triggering apoptosis in primary motor neurons and in PC12 cells cultures. The same concentrations of tyrosine-containing peptides required to prevent the nitration and apoptosis of motor neurons induced by trophic factor deprivation and of PC12 cells induced by peroxynitrite also prevented peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of motor neurons, brain homogenates, and PC12 cells. The heat shock protein 90 chaperone was nitrated in both trophic factor-deprived motor neurons and PC12 cells incubated with peroxynitrite. Tyrosine-containing peptides did not affect the induction of PC12 cell death by hydrogen peroxide. Tyrosine-containing peptides should protect by scavenging peroxynitrite-derived radicals and not by direct reactions with peroxynitrite as they neither increase the rate of peroxynitrite decomposition nor decrease the bimolecular peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of thiols. These results reveal an important role for free radical-mediated nitration of tyrosine residues, in apoptosis induced by endogenously produced and exogenously added peroxynitrite; moreover, tyrosine-containing peptides may offer a novel strategy to neutralize the toxic effects of peroxynitrite.

Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant formed by the diffusion-limited reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide (11Padmaja S. Huie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It can oxidize biomolecules either by direct reactions or by peroxynitrite-derived radicals such as nitrogen dioxide and carbonate radicals (13Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E.

In addition, peroxynitrite affects protein activity, as illustrated by the inhibition of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) 4The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GDNF, glial-derived neurotrophic factor; PBS, phosphate buffer saline; AFU, arbritary fluorescence units; DTPA, diethyleneaminepentaacetic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; l-NAME, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. and tyrosine phosphatases (19Takakura K.

Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the case of the phosphatases and zinc thiolate-containing proteins, the oxidation of methionine and cysteine residues is critical for their inactivation (19Takakura K. Beckman J.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, manganese SOD is inhibited by the nitration of a critical tyrosine residue near the active site (21MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Kerby J.D. Beckman J.S. Thompson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Motor neuron apoptosis induced by trophic factor deprivation or Fas activation is mediated by the endogenous production of peroxynitrite (4Estévez A.G. Spear N. Manuel S.M. Radi R. Henderson C.E.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1506-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In motor neuron studies, nitrotyrosine has often been used as a marker for peroxynitrite formation (4Estévez A.G. Spear N. Manuel S.M. Radi R. Henderson C.E. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 923-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Raoul C. Estévez A.G. Nishimune H. Cleveland D.W. deLapeyrière O. Henderson C.E. Haase G. Pettmann B. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1067-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); however, recent studies have shown that tyrosine nitration may occur independently of peroxynitrite (14Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R. Freeman B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 646-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 15Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4003-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that physiologically relevant concentrations of peroxynitrite are not able to nitrate tyrosine residues (54Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Romero N. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 728-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that the induction of apoptosis by peroxynitrite might be the result of general oxidative damage, growing evidence indicates that peroxynitrite interacts with specific intracellular pathways to induce apoptosis (47Raoul C.

Physiol. 1999; 277: H1647-H1653PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the role of nitrotyrosine in peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity remains unknown. Using tyrosine-containing peptides, we investigated the role of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation and tyrosine nitration in apoptosis induced in motor neurons by trophic factor deprivation and in PC12 cells by bolus addition of peroxynitrite. Tyrosine itself does not directly accelerate the rate of decomposition of peroxynitrite (23Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Freeman B.A. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); therefore, the tyrosine-containing peptides should not affect the direct reactions of peroxynitrite but act instead as competitive targets for the nitrating radical intermediates derived from peroxynitrite (13Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.C.X. De Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 62Bonini M.G. Radi R. Ferrer-Sueta G.

Our results reveal an important role for free radical-dependent processes in protein nitration and apoptosis induced by endogenous and exogenous peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite Synthesis—Peroxynitrite was synthesized by infusing acidified hydrogen peroxide with sodium nitrite (63Robinson K.M. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Residual hydrogen peroxide was eliminated with manganese dioxide, and peroxynitrite concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using ε302 = 1700 m-1 cm-1. The concentration of peroxynitrite was measured before each experiment. PC12 Cell Culture and Treatment—PC12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated dishes in RPMI medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FetalClone II (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and antibiotics. For viability assays, the cells were plated in the same medium at a density of 1.44 × 105 per 35-mm dish and incubated overnight. Following three washings with warm PBS, the cultures were incubated with peroxynitrite (0.5 mm) for 3 min in 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (90 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2). Five minutes after the peroxynitrite was added, the buffer was replaced by complete RPMI medium. Viability was determined using fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) 18 h after exposure to peroxynitrite (48Estévez A.G. Radi R. Barbeito L. Shin J.T. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Spear N. Estévez A.G. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Johnson G.V.W. J.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the peptide experiments, the cells were incubated with the peptides for 5 min before and during exposure to peroxynitrite. A number of tyrosine-containing peptides, and their controls replacing the tyrosine for phenylalanine, proline, and tryptophan, were used to perform the experiments. The RYEYA was designed to provide the maximum probability of tyrosine nitration after the analysis of the sequences nitrated in neurofilament L (29Crow J.P. Strong M.J. Zhuang Y. Ye Y. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1945-1953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences EYTR and EYTA provide sequences with different net charge, which it is expected to result in different nitration efficiency (64Sacksteder C.A. Qian W.J. Knyushko T.V. Wang H.H. Chin M.H. Lacan G.G. Melega W.P. Camp D.G. Smith R.D. Smith D.J. Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8009-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The dipeptide GY was used because free nitrotyrosine is known to induce motor neuron apoptosis (65Peluffo H. Shacka J.J. Ricart K. Bisig C.G. Martinez-Palma L. Pritsch O. Kamaid A. Eiserich J.P. Crow J.P. Barbeito L. Estevez A.G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 602-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The di- and tri-tyrosine homopeptides (Sigma) were used to test whether increasing the number of tyrosine residues despite the sequence provides more protection against peroxynitrite. Caspase 3 Activity—Caspase 3 activity was measure using the caspase 3 colorimetric assay kit from R&D Systems according to the manufacturer’s directions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells in a 100-mm dish were processed and incubated as described above. The cells were then collected in the culture media and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. After washing once with PBS, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer to have a concentration of 106 cells/25 μl. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). Two hundred μg of protein were used to perform the reaction. The product was measured at 405 nm after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C. Motor Neuron Isolation and Culture—Rat embryo motor neurons were first purified using a combination of cushion centrifugation and immunoaffinity and were then cultured in Neurobasal medium enriched with glutamine, glutamate, β-mercaptoethanol, and B27 supplement (Invitrogen), as described previously (4Estévez A.G.

More than 95% of the cells were immunoreactive for p75 neurotrophin receptor and Islet1, two early markers of motor neurons (66Yan Q. Johnson E.M.J. J.

Motor Neuron Peptide Treatment and Determination of Cell Survival—For survival studies, 1500 motor neurons were plated in a mixture of 100 μl of PBS containing the peptides (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL; Sigma), the permeation agent Chariot (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA), and 100 μl of Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Briefly, the peptides were prepared in 10 mm stock solutions in water and diluted in PBS to the concentrations indicated. Fifty μl of the peptide was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 μl of a 1:10 dilution of Chariot and 48 μl of H2O. The mixture was then added to 100 μl of motor neuron-containing Neurobasal medium and plated in well plates precoated with polyornithine/lamin. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator, supplements were added to 200 μl of the complete Neurobasal medium to reach a final volume of 400 μl. The cultures were then incubated for an additional 24 h, after which motor neuron survival was determined by counting all neurons with neurites longer than 3 soma diameters, as described previously (4Estévez A.G.

The survival of motor neurons cultured with a combination of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, 1 ng/ml), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 0.1 ng/ml), and cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1, 10 ng/ml) was considered 100% and was used to standardize the experiments. The neurons determined to be alive by this method also were found to stain for the vital dye fluorescein di-acetate. For dot blot analysis, 50,000 motor neurons were plated in 200 μl of PBS and Chariot plus 400 μl of Neurobasal medium. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 (5%) humidified atmosphere, 1.4 ml of Neurobasal medium was mixed with enough supplement to reach the requisite volume and then was incubated for an additional 16 h. Proteins were harvested, and the dot blot was processed, as described previously (65Peluffo H. Shacka J.J. Ricart K. Bisig C.G. Martinez-Palma L. Pritsch O. Kamaid A. Eiserich J.P. Crow J.P.

Two-day-old motor neurons were plated in 2-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and incubated with the liposomes by replacing the culture medium with 1.5 ml of fresh medium deficient in serum and glutamate but supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. A liposome suspension (3.5 μl) corresponding to 50 mmol lipid/cm2 was added to each well. Nitrotyrosine Immunofluorescence in Motor Neurons—After brief fixation with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS on ice for 15 min, immunofluorescence for nitrotyrosine was performed and quantified in motor neuron cultures using arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) (4Estévez A.G. Spear N. Manuel S.M. Radi R. Henderson C.E. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 923-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with Triton X-100, blocked for 1 h with 10% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin plus 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal nitrotyrosine antibody (1:500 (70Ye Y.Z.

Recent studies suggest that an increase in mitochondrial metabolism mediates CR-induced life span extension. Here we present evidence that Lat1 (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase), the E2 component of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, is a novel metabolic longevity factor in the CR pathway. Deleting the LAT1 gene abolishes life span extension induced by CR. Overexpressing Lat1 extends life span, and this life span extension is not further increased by CR. Similar to CR, life span extension by Lat1 overexpression largely requires mitochondrial respiration, indicating that mitochondrial metabolism plays an important role in CR. Interestingly, Lat1 overexpression does not require the Sir2 family to extend life span, suggesting that Lat1 mediates a branch of the CR pathway that functions in parallel to the Sir2 family. Lat1 is also a limiting longevity factor in nondividing cells in that overexpressing Lat1 extends cell survival during prolonged culture at stationary phase. Our studies suggest that Lat1 overexpression extends life span by increasing metabolic fitness of the cell. CR may therefore also extend life span and ameliorate age-associated diseases by increasing metabolic fitness through regulating central metabolic enzymes.

Calorie restriction (CR) 2The abbreviations used are: CR, calorie restriction; PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PDK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; RLS, replicative life span; rDNA, ribosomal DNA; CLS, chronological life span. is the most effective intervention known to extend life span in a variety of species, including mammals (1Weindruch W.

Sci. 2001; 928: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CR has also been shown to delay the onset or reduce the incidence of many age-related diseases (1Weindruch W. Walford R.L. The Retardation of Aging and Diseases by Dietary Restriction. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1998Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that CR may work by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species due to a slowing in metabolism (1Weindruch W. Walford R.L.

Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which CR extends life span and ameliorates age-associated diseases is still uncertain. Moderate CR can be imposed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by reducing the glucose concentration from 2 to 0.5% in rich media (4Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L.

Under this CR condition, the growth rate remains robust, and yeast mother cells show an extended replicative life span (division potential) of about 20–30%. Variations in CR protocols have been described where limitation of amino acids and other nutrients accompanies carbon source limitation (10Jiang J.C. Jaruga E. Repnevskaya M.V. Jazwinski S.M.

Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that yeast Sir2 extends life span by increasing chromatin silencing at specific genomic loci, thereby decreasing genome instability and inappropriate gene expression (28Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Sir2 may also increase the fitness of newborn cells by asymmetric partitioning of the oxidatively damaged proteins to mother cells (29Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nystrom T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The Sir2 family in higher eukaryotes also plays an important role in CR-induced life span extension. Both worm and fly Sir2 homologs are required for life span extension in several CR models (19Rogina B. Helfand S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15998-16003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. Tissenbaum H.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2006; 127: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In yeast, CR induces a shunting of carbon metabolism from fermentation to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (5Lin S.-J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.-A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The concomitant increase in respiration is necessary and sufficient for the activation of Sir2-mediated silencing and extension in life span (5Lin S.-J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.-A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The fact that respiration produces NAD from NADH (30Bakker B.M.

Res. 2001; 66: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as the finding that NADH can function as a competitive inhibitor of Sir2 activity (7Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) reinforce the idea that an increase in the NAD/NADH ratio activates Sir2 during CR. A link between CR and increased mitochondrial metabolism has also been reported in mammals. For example, in mice, CR was found to increase levels of endothelial nitricoxide synthase, mediating an increase in respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis (20Nisoli E. Tonello C. Cardile A. Cozzi V. Bracale R. Tedesco L. Falcone S. Valerio A. Cantoni O. Clementi E. Moncada S. Carruba M.O. Science. 2005; 310: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Concomitant with an increase in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase concentration, enhanced expression of the mammalian Sir2 ortholog Sirt1 was observed, thus reinforcing the link between respiration and Sir2 activation (20Nisoli E. Tonello C. Cardile A. Cozzi V. Bracale R. Tedesco L. Falcone S. Valerio A. Cantoni O. Clementi E. Moncada S. Carruba M.O. Science. 2005; 310: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms for CR-induced Sir2-dependent life span extension demonstrate that nictotinamide, a by-product of NAD degradation in the Sir2-mediated deacetylation reaction (32Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), also affects Sir2 activity. Overexpression of the nicotinamidase, Pnc1, increases yeast life span and suppresses the inhibitory effect of nictotinamide on Sir2 deacetylase activity in vivo and in vitro (8Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 33Gallo C.M. Smith Jr., D.L. Smith J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recently, a Sir2-independent CR pathway has been described (13Kaeberlein M. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 1381-1387Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Two Sir2 family members, Hst2 and Hst1, have been suggested to play a role in this Sir2-independent pathway under certain CR conditions (9Lamming D.W. Latorre-Esteves M. Medvedik O. Wong S.N. Tsang F.A. Wang C. Lin S.J. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2005; 309: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It remains highly possible that CR also induces other proteins in addition to the Sir2 family to extend life span. Many mitochondrial metabolic enzymes are regulated by the NAD/NADH ratio and are also likely to mediate CR-induced life span extension. To further understand the mechanism of CR, we characterized one such metabolic target of CR, the conserved NAD-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). The PDC acts in the mitochondria to convert pyruvate into acetyl-CoA (34Pronk J.T. Yde Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), an activity regulated by the NAD/NADH ratio (35Kresze G.B. Ronft H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that a functional PDC is required for CR-induced life span extension. Overexpressing components of the PDC extended life span, suggesting that PDC is a limiting longevity factor. The role of mitochondrial metabolism in CR and several genetic models of CR are also discussed. Strains and Media—Yeast strain BY4742 MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 was acquired from Open Biosystems and has been previously described (36Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). W303AR MATa ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 trp1-1 ade2-1 RDN1::ADE2 can1-100 has been described (23Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Rich medium YPD and synthetic medium were made as described (37Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 171-174Google Scholar). Medium used for life span analysis was YEP (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1.5% agar) supplemented with filter-sterilized glucose at a final concentration of 2, 0.5, or 0.05%. All gene deletions in this study were generated in our laboratory by replacing the wild type genes with the reusable Kanr marker as described in Ref. 38Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar and verified by PCR using oligonucleotides flanking the genes of interest. The Lat1 overexpression construct pADH1-LAT1 was made as follows. A pair of oligonucleotides were designed to amplify the LAT1 coding region (from start codon to stop codon) via PCR. This pair of oligonucleotides also added a NotI site to the 5′ end and a NheI site to the 3′ end of the LAT1 gene. After PCR amplification, DNA was digested with NotI and NheI and then ligated to ppp81 digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pADH1-LAT1. The Lpd1 overexpression construct pADH1-LPD1 and the Pda1 overexpression construct pADH1-PDA1 were made the same way. Both constructs carried a functional LAT1 or LPD1 as verified by the ability to suppress the growth defects of the lat1Δ and lpd1Δ mutant, respectively, on nonfermentable carbon. The cdc25-10 mutants were made by two-step allele replacement as previously described (4Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The Hap4-overexpressing construct pADH1-HAP4 has been previously described (5Lin S.-J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.-A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Strains overexpressing Lat1, Lpd1, or Hap4 were made by integrating PacI-linearized pADH1-LAT1, pADH1-LPD1, or pADH1-HAP4 into the genomic ADH1 promoter. Strains overexpressing Pda1 were made by integrating NheI-linearized pADH1-PDA1 into the genomic PDA1 locus. Strains carrying control vectors were made by integrating PacI-linearized ppp81 into the genomic ADH1 promoter. Replicative Life Span Analysis—All life span analyses in this study were carried out on YEP plates supplemented with different concentrations of glucose with 50 cells/strain/experiment as previously described (39Park P.U. McVey M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Fresh growing cells were patched daily onto a fresh YEP plate with 2% glucose at least 3 days prior to life span analysis. Cells from frozen stocks were grown on YEP plates with 2% glucose (repatched daily) for at least 7 days prior to life span analysis. On the day of life span analysis, cells were repatched onto the side of the life span plates and then allowed to grow. After 2 h, 10 groups of cells were moved from the initial patch and arrayed onto the center of the life span plate (one strain/plate) using a micromanipulator and allowed to grow for 1.5 h (one or two divisions). Virgin cells were then selected and subjected to life span analysis. To reduce the chance of human errors and biases, life span assays were measured at least three times by two or three researchers. NAD and NADH Measurements—Intracellular levels of the NAD and NADH nucleotides were determined as described previously (40Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. In brief, cells were grown to an A600 of ∼1, and then 107 cells were harvested in duplicates by centrifugation in two 1.5-ml tubes. Acid extraction was performed in one tube to obtain NAD, and alkali extraction was performed in the other to obtain NADH. 3 μl of neutralized cell extract (∼105 cells) was used for the enzymatic cycling reaction as previously described (40Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The concentration of nucleotides was measured fluorometrically with excitation at 365 nm and emission monitored at 460 nm. Standard curves for determining NAD and NADH concentrations were obtained as follows: NAD and NADH were added into the acid and alkali buffer to a final concentration of 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 μm, which were then treated with the same procedure along with other samples. The fluorometer was calibrated each time before use with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 μm NADH to ensure that the detection was within a linear range. Chronological Life Span Analysis—Three single colonies from each strain were analyzed in each experiment as previously described (41Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cells were grown in synthetic medium supplemented with 2% glucose and four times of the auxotrophic amino acids (uracil, histidine, lysine, and leucine) at a starting A600 of 0.1. Cell viability was monitored daily by plating a fraction of the culture onto fresh medium to determine the colony-forming units. The rate of cell survival was calculated by normalizing the colony-forming units to the highest cell number (the stationary phase) for each strain. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—50 ml of cells were grown in YPD containing 2, 0.5, or 0.05% glucose as indicated to midlogarithmic phase (A600 of 0.5–0.6) and concentrated by centrifugation, and total RNA extraction was performed using a hot phenol method employing phase lock tubes (Eppendorf) as previously described (42Powers T. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene). The membranes were then probed, washed, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and analyzed using a STORM 860 imaging system and software provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). DNA templates for the Northern probes were made as described previously (42Powers T. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In short, PCR and specific gene primers were utilized to prepare the DNA templates using BY4742 genomic DNA. Northern probes were made using [α-32P]dCTP and Ready-to-Go DNA-labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) Recombination—Rates of the rDNA recombination were determined by the rate of loss of ADE2 in the rDNA of strain W303AR at the first cell division (half-sectored colonies) as previously described (43Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P.A. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C for 2 days, followed by 4–5 days at 4 °C for color enhancement. A total of more than 70,000 colonies were examined for each strain in each experiment. Isolation and Immunofluorescence Microscopy Analysis of Young and Old Mother Cells—Yeast cells were labeled with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce), allowed to divide for ∼7 generations, and then isolated with streptavidin-magnetic beads as previously described (39Park P.U. McVey M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). “Young cells” refers to generation 0–1 cells that have not divided or have divided once only. “Old cells” refers to generation 6–7 cells that have divided 6–7 times. Strains for visualization of the mitochondrial structures were constructed by transformation with the pVT100-mtGFP plasmid carrying subunit 9 of the F0-ATPase of Neurospora crassa and a URA3 marker (44Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cells recovered from magnetic bead sorting were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), stained with calcofluor/fluorescent brightener (for bud scars) or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (for DNA) for 5 min, washed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and then examined under a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera at ×1000 magnification. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Activity Assay—Activity of the PDC was assayed in mitochondrial lysates as described (35Kresze G.B. Ronft H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in YPD to an A600 of 1–2, and then the crude mitochondrial fraction (pellet P12000) was purified as described (45Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed immediately after preparation of mitochondrial extracts. The assay mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NAD, 2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 2 mm cysteine, 5 mm pyruvate. The reaction was started by the addition of coenzyme A (final concentration 0.15 mm), and the increase of NADH concentration was followed at 340 nm. PDC activity was calculated and shown as the amount of NADH produced/μg of mitochondrial proteins/h (nmol·μg–1·h–1). CR induces an increase in mitochondrial metabolic activity (5Lin S.-J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.-A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 20Nisoli E. Tonello C. Cardile A.

The PDC catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the key substrate entering the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. The PDC is composed of multiple copies of three separate enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1, ∼20 copies), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2, ∼60 copies), and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3, ∼6 copies) (46Maeng C.Y. Yazdi M.A. Niu X.D. Lee H.Y. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13801-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In yeast, the E1 component of the PDC is composed of two different subunits encoded by the PDA1 and PDB1 gene, respectively (34Pronk J.T. Yde Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The activity of E1 is regulated by reversible phosphorylation catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatases. Phosphorylation of E1 by PDK leads to PDC inactivation (47James A.G. Cook R.M. West S.M. Lindsay J.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 48Holness M.J.

To date, four PDK isoforms and two pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase isoforms have been identified in mammals, whereas in yeast, only one PDK isoform (Pkp1) and one pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase isoform (Ppp1) have been identified (49Krause-Buchholz U. Gey U. Wunschmann J. Becker S. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The E2 component, encoded by the LAT1 gene is the core of the PDC and plays both an enzymatic and structural role (51Lawson J.E. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11249-11254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The E3 component, encoded by the LPD1 gene, is also a component in the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and glycine decarboxylase complexes (34Pronk J.T. Yde Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The protein X (encoded by the PDX1 gene) plays a structural role in the PDC; it binds and positions E3 to the E2 core (52Lawson J.E. Behal R.H. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deleting any genes in PDC resulted in defects in generating acetyl-CoA (34Pronk J.T. Yde Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To examine whether PDC is a novel metabolic target of CR, we first determined whether a functional PDC was required for CR-induced life span extension. Replicative life span (RLS) of cells devoid of Lat1, the core component of the PDC, was analyzed under 0.5% glucose-induced CR conditions as previously described (4Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L.

https://openalex.org/W1992011470,"The protein kinases PKR, GCN2, and PERK phosphorylate translation initiation factor eIF2α to regulate general and genespecific protein synthesis under various cellular stress conditions. Recent x-ray crystallographic structures of PKR and GCN2 revealed distinct dimeric configurations of the kinase domains. Whereas PKR kinase domains dimerized in a back-to-back and parallel orientation, the GCN2 kinase domains displayed an antiparallel orientation. The dimerization interfaces on PKR and GCN2 were localized to overlapping surfaces on the N-terminal lobes of the kinase domains but utilized different intermolecular contacts. A key feature of the PKR dimerization interface is a salt bridge interaction between Arg262 from one protomer and Asp266 from the second protomer. Interestingly, these two residues are conserved in all eIF2α kinases, although in the GCN2 structure, the two residues are too remote to interact. To test the importance of this potential salt bridge interaction in PKR, GCN2, and PERK, the residues constituting the salt bridge were mutated either independently or together to residues with the opposite charge. Single mutations of the Asp (or Glu) and Arg residues blocked kinase function both in yeast cells and in vitro. However, for all three kinases, the double mutation designed to restore the salt bridge interaction with opposite polarity resulted in a functional kinase. Thus, the salt bridge interaction and dimer interface observed in the PKR structure is critical for the activity of all three eIF2α kinases. These results are consistent with the notion that the PKR structure represents the active state of the eIF2α kinase domain, whereas the GCN2 structure may represent an inactive state of the kinase.

These results are consistent with the notion that the PKR structure represents the active state of the eIF2α kinase domain, whereas the GCN2 structure may represent an inactive state of the kinase. Protein synthesis in mammalian cells is regulated by four protein kinases (PKR, PERK, GCN2, and HRI) that specifically phosphorylate the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to various environmental stress conditions (reviewed in Refs. 1Ron D.

The double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR is a component of the cellular antiviral defense mechanism, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; KD, kinase domain; WCE, whole cell extract; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type.-resident kinase PERK senses misfolded proteins in the ER and transduces this signal to attenuate protein synthesis. The heme-regulated kinase HRI is activated under conditions of heme deprivation and coordinates globin chain synthesis with heme availability in reticulocytes. Finally, uncharged tRNAs that accumulate in cells under amino acid starvation conditions bind to and activate GCN2. Unique regulatory domains enable each of these kinases to respond to different stress conditions, whereas their conserved kinase domains specifically phosphorylate eIF2α on Ser51 (see Refs. 1Ron D.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 529-546Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser51 converts the factor from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. The resulting impaired nucleotide exchange blocks protein synthesis by preventing the recycling of inactive eIF2·GDP to functional eIF2·GTP that binds the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit in the first step of translation initiation (reviewed in Ref. 3Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of eIF2α in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates both general and gene-specific mRNA translation. Activation of the sole eIF2α kinase GCN2 is required for growth under amino acid starvation conditions as imposed by the histidine analog 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). By regulating translation reinitiation at upstream open reading frames in the GCN4 mRNA, phosphorylation of eIF2α in yeast by GCN2 paradoxically stimulates expression of the transcription factor GCN4 (reviewed in Ref. 6Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The GCN4 then stimulates expression of amino acid biosynthetic enzyme genes under its control, resulting in a 3-AT-resistant phenotype. Thus, growth on medium containing 3-AT is a simple test for eIF2α kinase activity in yeast. In contrast, high level phosphorylation of eIF2α by mutationally activated forms of GCN2 impairs general translation initiation in yeast and results in a slow growth phenotype (3Hinnebusch A.G.

Whereas yeast cells lacking GCN2 are unable to grow on medium containing 3-AT, low level expression of heterologous PKR or PERK kinases confers a 3-AT-resistant phenotype (8Dever T.E. Chen J.J.

In addition, high level expression of PKR or PERK inhibits yeast cell growth by impairing general translation (8Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G.

Moreover, replacement of Ser51 in eIF2α by nonphosphorylatable Ala (eIF2α-S51A) suppresses the growth phenotypes associated with expression of PKR and PERK in yeast (8Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N.

Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations that inactivate PKR kinase function in vitro abolish the ability of PKR to regulate GCN4 and general translation in yeast cells (8Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M.

A common feature in the activation of all four kinases eIF2α kinases is dimerization. Whereas GCN2 and the heme-regulated form of HRI are constitutive dimers (3Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N.

Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition to its kinase domain (KD), GCN2 contains a tRNAbinding domain that resembles HisRS (histidyl-tRNA synthetase) and a C-terminal domain. The isolated, KD, HisRS, and C-terminal domain of GCN2 were found to dimerize in vivo, and these dimer contacts are thought to maintain the protein in a dimeric state (13Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2697-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding of double-stranded RNA molecules promotes dimerization of the double-stranded RNA-binding motifs at the N terminus of PKR, which is thought to promote subsequent dimerization of the kinase domains (15Dey M.

Finally, in the absence of ER stress, it is proposed that ER chaperones prevent dimerization of the N-terminal IRE1-like domains of PERK that reside in the ER lumen. Under stress conditions, unfolded proteins are thought to titrate the ER chaperones and to directly bind to the IRE1-like domains of PERK, leading to dimerization of the N-terminal domains and the KDs of the protein (14Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar, 19Ma K. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. J. Biol.

Consistent with the idea that KD dimerization is critical for kinase activity, fusion of constitutive (GST) or regulated (GyrB and Fv2E) dimerization domains to the PKR or PERK KD was sufficient to promote kinase activation (16Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the PKR KD in complex with eIF2α has provided additional insights into KD dimerization (23Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, the catalytic domain of PKR consisted of the typical smaller N-terminal lobe and larger C-terminal lobe connected by a hinge region. A symmetric dimeric configuration of the PKR KD was observed in the crystal, and each KD was stoichiometrically phosphorylated on Thr446 in the activation segment, indicating that the structure represents an active form of the kinase (23Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Further supporting this notion, each KD in the crystal was bound to its substrate eIF2α. PKR dimerization was mediated by back-to-back positioning of the N-terminal lobes of the KD and involved residues that were preferentially conserved among the eIF2α family of kinases (23Dar A.C. Dever T.E. Sicheri F. Cell. 2005; 122: 887-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Significant among these conserved residues were Arg262 and Asp266, which form intermolecular salt bridges between the two PKR protomers in the dimer. Individual mutations of Arg262 to Asp or Asp266 to Arg blocked PKR toxicity in yeast and impaired PKR autophosphorylation and eIF2α substrate phosphorylation in yeast cells (15Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Moreover, when both the R262D and D266R mutations were introduced into the same PKR molecule, which was predicted to reestablish the salt bridge interaction with opposite polarity, PKR function was restored (15Dey M.

Thus, the back-to-back dimeric configuration of PKR observed in the crystal structure is critical for PKR activity. Additional structural insights into the eIF2α kinases were provided by recent crystal structures of the wild type yeast GCN2 KD and derivatives bearing activating mutations (24Padyana A.K. Qiu H. Roll-Mecak A. Hinnebusch A.G. Burley S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29289-29299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whereas the KD in the PKR structure was phosphorylated on a positive regulatory site (Thr446) within the activation segment, the KD of the GCN2 structures was not. Thus, the GCN2 structure may represent an inactive form of the KD, whereas the PKR structure represents an active conformation. Consistent with this notion, the activation segment and N-lobe catalytic elements of PKR adopt productive conformations, whereas those of GCN2 are nonproductive. Interestingly, the GCN2 KD also adopted a symmetrical but antiparallel dimer configuration involving primarily the N-lobes of two KDs (24Padyana A.K. Qiu H. Roll-Mecak A. Hinnebusch A.G. Burley S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29289-29299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This configuration contrasts with the symmetrical but parallel dimer configuration of the PKR KDs (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, the GCN2 KD dimer interface was located on a similar face of the N-terminal lobe as compared with the PKR dimer. Specifically, the PKR and GCN2 dimerization surfaces display 80% overlap of contacting residues with the two dimer orientations differing roughly by a 180° rotation normal to the plane of the contact surfaces. Thus, whereas the side chains of Arg262 and Asp266 are located 2.4-2.7 Ä apart in the PKR dimer, the corresponding residues, Arg594 and Asp598, are too far apart (13.14 Ä) to form a salt bridge interaction in the GCN2 dimer (Fig. 1, B and C). To gain further molecular insights into the dimeric configuration of the eIF2α kinases, we mutated the predicted salt bridge-interacting residues in the GCN2 and PERK KDs. Whereas single mutations to oppositely charged residues eliminated kinase function, reciprocal exchanges restored kinase activity. Thus, the salt bridge interaction and dimer interface observed in the PKR structure is conserved among PKR, GCN2, and PERK and is critical for eIF2α kinase activation. Yeast Strains—Yeast strain H17 (MATα gcn3-102 leu2-3 leu2-112 ura3-52) was described previously (25Harashima S. Hannig E.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Genetics. 1987; 117: 409-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type SUI2 allele in strain H2557 (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 gcn2Δ) was replaced with SUI2-S51A to generate strain J223 (15Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E.

Strain H1894 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1-Δ 63 gcn2Δ) was described previously (26Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4146-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids—Plasmid pC1685 expressing FLAG- and His6-tagged PKR under the control of a hybrid GAL-CYC1 promoter and related plasmids expressing mutant forms of PKR were described previously (15Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A SacI-PstI fragment encoding FLAG- and His6-tagged Caenorhabditis elegans PERK (residues 26-1077) was obtained by PCR using plasmid p551 (11Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR product was inserted into the yeast expression vector pEMBLyex4 (27Cesareni G. Murray J.A.H. Setlow J.K. Hollaender A. Genetic Engineering: Principals and Methods. Plenum Press, New York, NY1987: 135-154Crossref Google Scholar), generating plasmid pC2706. Plasmids pC2707, pC2708, pC2709, and pC2710 expressing PERK-R598E, PERK-D603R, the double mutant PERK-R598E,E603R, and PERK-K633R, respectively, were generated by using fusion PCR to introduce the appropriate mutations in pC2706. Plasmid p722 is a low copy number URA3 vector that expresses GCN2 from its native promoter (7Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of p722 was used to generate the plasmids pC2745, pC2746, pC2747, and pC2748 expressing GCN2-K628R, GCN2-R594D, GCN2-D598R, and GCN2-R594D,D598R, respectively. Plasmid pC2436 expressing FLAG- and His6-tagged GCN2 under the control of the hybrid GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter in pEMBLyex4 was derived from pDH103 (28Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The related plasmid pDH109 was used to express GCN2-K628R (28Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The GCN2 single mutations R594D and D598R and the double mutation R594D,D598R were introduced into pC2436, generating plasmids pC2437, pC2438, and pC2439, respectively. Immunoblot Analysis of Kinase Expression in Yeast—Transformants of strain H17 expressing PKR under the control of the GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter were grown as described previously (15Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Transformants of strains H2557 and J223 expressing PERK under the control of the GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter were grown in SC-Ura medium (synthetic minimal medium with all amino acids) overnight at 30 °C to saturation, diluted in fresh medium to A600 ≈ 0.1, and grown at 30 °C until A600 ≈ 0.6. Cells were harvested and transferred to SGal-Ura medium (SC-Ura except 10% galactose) for 2 h at 30 °C to induce PERK expression. Transformants of strain H1894 expressing GCN2 from its native promoter were grown in SC-Ura medium overnight at 30 °C to saturation, diluted in fresh medium to A600 ≈ 0.1, grown at 30 °C to A600 ≈ 0.6, and then treated with 3-AT (30 mm) for 1 h. Cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared as described previously (29Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WCEs (5 or 35 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using rabbit phosphospecific antibodies directed against phosphorylated Ser51 of eIF2α (BioSource International), rabbit polyclonal antiserum that recognizes yeast eIF2α irrespective of Ser51 phosphorylation, rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma), mouse monoclonal penta-His antibodies (Qiagen), or rabbit antiserum directed against the N terminus of yeast GCN2 (29Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Immunokinase Assay—FLAG- and His6-tagged PKR and PERK were overexpressed in yeast strain J223, and FLAG- and His6-tagged GCN2 was overexpressed in yeast strain H1894. Yeast transformants were grown to saturation in 5 ml of SC-Ura medium at 30 °C; the cells were harvested, transferred to 50 ml of SGR medium (SC medium containing 10% galactose and 2% raffinose), and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The cells were then harvested, washed with ice-cold water, and resuspended in FLAG binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 125 μm Na3VO4, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences)). Cells were broken by high speed mixing with glass beads on a vortex. WCEs were mixed with 100 μl of anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel (50% slurry; Sigma) preequilibrated with FLAG binding buffer, and incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with FLAG binding buffer and once with 1× kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound proteins were eluted with 25 μl of FLAG-peptide (500 μg/ml), and individual aliquots were used for immunoblot analysis and for protein kinase assays with recombinant yeast eIF2α as described previously (15Dey M.

Mammalian Cell Experiments—Plasmids PERK.WT.9E10. pCDNA.amp and PERK.K618A.9E10.pCDNA.amp that express Myc-tagged wild type PERK and PERK-K618A, respectively, under the control of a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter (30Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of David Ron (Skirball Institute, New York University School of Medicine). Using fusion PCR, mutations were introduced into the plasmid PERK. WT.9E10.pCDNA.amp to generate derivatives expressing PERK-R584D, PERK-D588R, or PERK-R584D, D588R. HEK 293 EbnaT cells (1.6 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (4 μl; Invitrogen) with derivatives of the vector pcDNA1 (1.6 μg) designed to express wild type mouse PERK, PERK-K618A, PERK-R584D, PERK-D588R, or PERK-R584D, D588R. Thirty hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and aliquots of WCEs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies against phosphorylated Ser51 of eIF2α, monoclonal antibodies against eIF2α, or anti-Myc antibodies (to detect PERK). Structural Models and Figures—Structural models were generated using the coordinates of the PKReIF2α complex (Protein Data Bank code 2A1A) and GCN2 (Protein Data Bank code 1ZYC) using PyMOL software (31DeLano W.L. The PyMol User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). Salt Bridge Interaction of Arg262 and Asp266 at the Dimer Interface of PKR Is Critical for eIF2α Phosphorylation—To initiate our studies, we added a FLAG and His6 tag to the N terminus of full-length human PKR and expressed the kinase in yeast cells. Whereas high level expression of PKR from a galactose-inducible promoter is lethal in wild type yeast (8Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), a slow growth phenotype is observed in yeast carrying a gcn3-102 mutation in the α subunit of eIF2B that desensitizes eIF2B to inhibition by phosphorylated eIF2 (Fig. 2A, row 1, left panel) (8Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Dey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E. Cell. 2005; 122: 901-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This growth inhibition is due to phosphorylation of eIF2α, because it is suppressed by mutation of the Ser51 phosphorylation site in eIF2α to Ala (Fig. 2A, row 1, right) and by mutation of the critical PKR kinase subdomain II residue Lys296 to Arg (Fig. 2A, row 2). Single mutations of Arg262 to Asp or Asp266 to Arg, designed to disrupt the salt bridge interaction between these residues, partially impaired PKR function and resulted in a growth phenotype intermediate between wild type PKR and the kinase-dead mutant (Fig. 2A, rows 3 and 4). When the two single mutations (R262D and D266R) were combined in one protein (PKR-R262D,D266R), PKR toxicity in yeast was restored (Fig. 2A, row 5). Thus, the salt bridge interaction between residues 262 and 266, with either normal or opposite polarity, is required for the growth-inhibitory effects of PKR in yeast. The suppression of PKR toxicity in the eIF2α-S51A strain indicates that the growth-inhibitory affects of wild type PKR and the PKR-R262D,D266R mutant were due to phosphorylation of eIF2α. To directly examine eIF2α phosphorylation in the yeast cells, whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-Ser51-specific antibodies. Subsequently, the blot was stripped and probed with anti-yeast eIF2α antiserum that detects eIF2α independently of Ser51 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2B, no Ser51 phosphorylation was detected in cells not expressing PKR (vector contro"

The Tg-G2320R mutation is responsible for congenital hypothyroidism in rdw/rdw rats, in which a lack of secondary thyroid enlargement (goiter) implicates death of thyrocytes as part of disease pathogenesis. We found that mutant Tg-G2320R was retained within the ER with no detectable synthesis of thyroxine, had persistent exposure of free cysteine thiols, and was associated with activated ER stress response but incomplete ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Tg-G2320R associated with multiple ER resident proteins, most notably ERp72, including covalent Tg-ERp72 interactions. In PC Cl3 thyrocytes, inducible overexpression of ERp72 increased the ability of cells to maintain Tg cysteines in a reduced state. Noncovalent interactions of several ER chaperones with newly synthesized Tg-G2320R diminished over time in parallel with ERAD of the mutant protein, yet a small ERAD-resistant Tg fraction remained engaged in covalent association with ERp72 even 2 days post-synthesis. Such covalent protein aggregates may set the stage for apoptotic thyrocyte cell death, preventing thyroid goiter formation in rdw/rdw rats.

Braakman I. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 191-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Secretory polypeptides that fold to a native conformation become eligible for anterograde transport, whereas those that fail to fold correctly are retained within the ER until they either achieve an acceptable conformation or are targeted for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (2McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 300: 17-40PubMed Google Scholar). These processes of ER quality control (3Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) help to prevent secretory protein congestion of the ER lumen that can adversely affect secretory pathway efficiency. A growing list of genetic diseases have been accounted for by structural changes in secretory proteins that alter their folding and render them deficient for ER export (4Rutishauser J. Spiess M. Swiss Med. Wkly. 2002; 132: 211-222PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these ER storage diseases produce a simple deficiency of the secreted protein (5Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 173-202PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others may be cytotoxic to cells that attempt to produce them (6Wu J. Kaufman R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Preventing toxic accumulation of misfolded secretory proteins, for example via ERAD, is vital for proper ER homeostasis and may be a strategy for therapies of ER storage diseases (7Sekijima Y.

ERAD is built around highly conserved mechanisms that target misfolded proteins for intracellular disposal (9Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Key steps in this pathway include recognition of the ERAD substrate for unfolding and targeting for retrotranslocation to the cytosol (10Nishikawa S. Brodsky J.L. Nakatsukasa K. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) followed by proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (11Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). An inability to effectively degrade mutant secretory (or membrane) proteins may result in a gain-of-toxic-function that leads to cell death. This can occur either in an autosomal dominant manner, such as occurs with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (12Russell T.A. Ito M. Ito M. Yu R.N. Martinson F.A. Weiss J. Jameson J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or in an autosomal recessive manner, such as in patients expressing the Z-variant of α1-antitrypsin (13Perlmutter D.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 232: 39-56PubMed Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (Tg), the major secretory glycoprotein of thyrocytes that serves as the precursor protein for thyroid hormone synthesis, begins to fold in the ER (14Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol.

Tg deficiency is a well recognized cause of congenital hypothyroidism (19Medeiros-Neto G. Kim P.S. Yoo S.E. Vono J. Targovnik H. Camargo R. Hossain S.A. Arvan P. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which disease-causing Tg mutants are blocked in ER export and then are routed for proteasomal degradation (20Tokunaga F. Brostrom C. Koide T. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40757-40764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consequently, the thyroid gland develops hypertrophy and hyperplasia (goiter) secondary to chronic elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (21Di Jeso B. Arvan P. Braverman L.E. Utiger R. The Thyroid. 9th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2004Google Scholar). However, recent genetic linkage analyses have found the thyroglobulin gene region as a major locus in human familial congenital hypothyroidism even in the absence of goiter formation (22Ahlbom B.E. Yaqoob M. Gustavsson P. Abbas H.G. Anneren G. Larsson A. Wadelius C. Hum. Genet. 2002; 110: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the rdw/rdw rat dwarf (23Koto M. Sato T.

Sci. 1998; 48: 496-501PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible gain-of-toxic-function in affected thyrocytes. In this study, we have investigated the Tg-G2320R mutant protein and found persistent cysteine thiol exposure consistent with thiol-mediated ER retention (27Carelli S. Ceriotti A. Cabibbo A. Fassina G. Ruvo M. Sitia R. Science. 1997; 277: 1681-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), activation of the ER stress response, and extensive but incomplete ERAD with a small degradation-resistant fraction remaining engaged in covalent complexes with ERp72 for days, if not longer. Evidence is provided to suggest that ERp72 might function as a thiol reductase in the ER, and because interaction with ERp72 has recently been shown to inhibit ERAD of mutant Tg (28Forster M.L. Sivick K. Park Y.N. Arvan P. Lencer W.I. Tsai B. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), these interactions might potentially predispose to toxicity of thyrocytes in rdw/rdw rats. PEG-Maleimide Treatment—Incubation was performed in Cys/Met-free DMEM containing 10 mm mPEG 5000-maleimide (SunBio) for 75 min at 37 °C. The samples were then boiled for 1 min in a buffer containing 1% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Silver Staining and Detection of ER Chaperones and T4—Thyroid homogenates were freshly prepared by boiling for 5 min in a buffer containing 4% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8. After SDS-PAGE, samples were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose before immunoblotting with respective chaperone antibodies or anti-T4 antibody (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence of Phospho-PERK—Paraffin-embedded wild-type and rdw/rdw rat thyroid paraffin sections (10 μm) were placed on coated glass slides and deparaffinized by three successive immersions in xylene for 10 min. The sections were rehydrated for 5 min each in a decreasing alcohol series (100, 90, 70% ethanol) and finally immersed in PBS for 5 min. The sections were then incubated in PBS-based blocking solution (5% goat serum) for 5 min at room temperature. Rabbit anti rat-phospho-PERK (Thr-980) from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog no. 3191) was incubated overnight in a humidity chamber at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times in PBS before incubating them with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. The slides were then washed three more times in PBS, rinsed with water, and mounted with ProLong anti-fading medium on top of the sample. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Mouse Tg cDNA—Full-length mouse Tg cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1A. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the presence of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection and Stable Cell Lines—COS-7 cells were grown in complete DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Pulse-chase experiments were performed 36 h after transfection. PC Cl3 rat thyroid cell lines were grown in complete Coons F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin plus a four-hormone mixture (10 milliunits/ml thyrotropin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml apotransferrin, 10 nm hydrocortisone). G418-resistant PC Cl3 thyrocytes engineered for constitutive expression of the reverse tet transactivator, called rtTA-7 cells (35Knauf J.A. Kuroda H. Basu S. Fagin J.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. James Fagin (Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York). These cells were maintained in PC Cl3 complete growth medium plus 100 μg of G418. The mouse ERp72 cDNA (from Dr. M. Green, Saint Louis University, MO) subcloned to the BamHI site of pTRE2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was transfected into rtTA-7, and stable expressors were selected for both hygromycin resistance and doxycycline-inducible expression of ERp72 protein by immunoblotting. rtTA-7-ERp72 cells were maintained in PC Cl3 complete growth medium plus 150 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml G418. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Transfected COS-7 cells were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys-free DMEM and then labeled for 1 h at 37°C with 80 mCi/ml of [35S] Easytag™ express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following pulse labeling, the cells were washed twice with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and chased with DMEM supplemented with an excess of cold methionine and cysteine. When indicated, 15 μm MG132, 100 μm kifunensine, 1 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin, 1 mm castanospermine, or 10 μg/ml brefeldin A was included in pretreatment, pulse labeling, or chase incubations. At the end of each chase period, the medium was aspirated, and the labeled cells were treated with ice-cold PBS containing 50 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 10 min to alkylate free cyteine thiols in situ. Labeled cells were then lysed for 1 h on ice in 1 ml of IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 6.8) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (29Caldwell S.R. Hill K.J. Cooper A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23296-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and 5 units/ml apyrase (Sigma). Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernates were then preincubated with zysorbin-protein A (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h before immunoprecipitation or co-precipitation overnight with the respective antibodies and zysorbin at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer, boiled in SDS-gel sample buffer, and the supernates were subjected to SDS-4% PAGE. The gels were dried, and Tg bands were visualized by phosphorimaging with quantitation done using ImageQuant 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). Polyclonal rabbit antisera against BiP, calnexin, ERp72, PDI, and ERp57 were directed against 18–22 amino acid sequences at the C termini of the respective proteins. Antibodies to Tg were as described previously (30Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sequential Immunoprecipitation—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing Tg-G2320R were pulse-labeled and chased as described in the text. First round immunoprecipitations were done using antibodies specific for Tg, BiP, ERp72, or PDI. After immunoprecipitation, the residual supernatants from the first round immunoprecipitation were split into three equal aliquots. A second round of immunoprecipitation was then done on these supernates using Tg-, ERp72-, or PDI-specific antibodies. Second round immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight in the presence of fresh protease inhibitors. Endoglycosidase H Treatment—At different chase times after pulse labeling, an aliquot of transfected COS-7 cell lysates was resuspended in 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and boiled for 5 min. The denatured lysates were then either mock-digested or digested in the presence of 250 units of endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, for 1 h at 37°C. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Tg antibody followed by reducing SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. TUNEL Staining—Paraffin-embedded wild-type and rdw/rdw rat thyroid paraffin sections (10 μm) were placed on coated glass slides and deparaffinized by three successive immersions in xylene for 10 min. The sections were rehydrated for 5 min each in a decreasing alcohol series (100, 90, 70% ethanol) and finally immersed in PBS for 5 min. Staining for apoptosis was performed using the TACS-XL in situ apoptosis detection kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol except for the following modifications. Tissue sections were permeabilized with proteinase K for 1 h, the labeling reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h, TACS Blue labeling was performed for 30 min, and nuclear fast red counterstaining was extended to 20 min. Tg-G2320R Exhibits a Disulfide Maturation Defect—The Tg monomer forms ∼60 intrachain disulfide bonds within its globular structure (17Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Pacifico F. Leonardi A. Vito P. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Arvan P. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 449-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Tg-G2320R mutation, responsible for the dwarf phenotype of the rdw/rdw rat, was examined for the steady state level of Tg disulfide maturation. The full-length wild-type mouse Tg cDNA was mutagenized to encode the G2320R mutation and this was transiently expressed in COS cells. Proteins of the transiently transfected cells were reacted with PEG-maleimide, a reagent that alkylates free thiols and adds ∼5 kDa of molecular mass to each reactive cysteine thiol (31Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). If a sufficient number of thiols were to be alkylated, a change in the molecular mass of the 330-kDa Tg monomer would be detected by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting as a slower migrating form. Well folded wild-type Tg migrated comparably under untreated versus treated conditions (Fig. 1A), and untreated Tg-G2320R migrated comparably to intracellular wild-type Tg after PEG-maleimide treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), whereas PEG-maleimide treatment shifted Tg-G2320R mobility to a slower position (Fig. 1B, lane 5), indicating abnormal exposure of cysteine thiols in the mutant protein. What are the consequences of high level expression of maturation-defective Tg-G2320R in the thyroid of rdw/rdw rats? By silver staining, wild-type thyroid tissue contains a more intensely staining Tg band at ∼330 kDa, whereas rdw/rdw thyroid exhibits increased bands of 150 and 94 kDa and one or more proteins with molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 2A, marked with asterisks). Immunoblotting showed that these reflect increased levels of ER chaperones (Fig. 2B, upper three panels) along with ER oxidoreductases ERp72, PDI, and ERp57 (next three panels) as well as the lectin-like chaperone calreticulin (next panel), whereas calnexin was only modestly affected (fibronectin levels served as a loading control (last panel)). Coordinate up-regulation of ER luminal chaperones in thyrocytes expressing Tg-G2320R (32Oh-Ishi M. Omori A. Kwon J.Y. Agui T. Maeda T. Furudate S.I. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1288-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Baryshev M. Sargsyan E. Wallin G. Lejnieks A. Furudate S. Hishinuma A. Mkrtchian S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 903-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is consistent with activation of the ATF6 and Ire1 stress-signaling proteins of the tripartite ER stress response (34Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar) that have been reported to be activated in rdw/rdw thyroid tissue (33Baryshev M. Sargsyan E. Wallin G. Lejnieks A. Furudate S. Hishinuma A. Mkrtchian S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 903-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To examine activation of the third ER stress-signaling protein, PERK, rdw/rdw rat thyroid tissue sections were immunostained with anti-phospho-PERK, which reacted in excess of that found in wild-type rat thyroid tissue (Fig. 2C) indicating generalized ER stress response activation. At the same time, formation of l-thyroxine (T4) was undetectable by anti-T4 immunoblotting within polypeptides contained in thyroid tissue extracts of rdw/rdw rats (Fig. 2D). Altogether, in conjunction with earlier work, the data in Fig. 2 demonstrate a loss of thyroid hormonogenesis accompanied by full-blown activation of ER stress response pathways in the rdw/rdw rat thyroid gland. Tg-G2320R (rdw) Mutant Thyroglobulin Is Retained Intracellularly and Degraded by ERAD—In transiently transfected COS cells, within 2 h after wild-type Tg synthesis, Tg glycans began to acquire resistance to digestion with endoglycosidase H. By contrast, the Tg-G2320R mutant did not acquire endoglycosidase H resistance even at 4 h, indicating its failure to arrive at the Golgi complex (Fig. 3A), and no rdw Tg was secreted (not shown). Instead, cells disposed of the mutant protein, primarily between 6 and 24 h after synthesis (Fig. 3B) when ≤10% of molecules still remained (Fig. 3C). The presence of MG132 (15 μm) greatly inhibited the intracellular degradation (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that ERAD of Tg-G2320R involves proteasomal disposal. ERAD of another mutant, Tg-L2263P (encoded by cog), is known to involve an ER mannosidase/EDEM (ER degradation-enhancing α-mannoside-like protein)-sensitive pathway inhibited by kifunensine and 1-deoxymannojirimicin (20Tokunaga F. Brostrom C. Koide T. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40757-40764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of COS cells with these glycan-processing inhibitors produced similar effects on the ERAD of Tg-G2320R at 16 h of chase; kifunensine (KF) and 1-deoxymannojirimicin (DMM) clearly inhibited ERAD of Tg-G2320R, whereas castanospermine (CAS) was largely without effect (Fig. 3D). Brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of ARF1-GEF (ADP-ribosylation factor 1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor) that blocks ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport, was similarly without effect on ERAD of Tg-G2320R (Fig. 3D). Based on these results, inhibitors of glycan processing and intracellular protein trafficking cannot be used to distinguish significant differences between ERAD of Tg-G2320R and Tg-L2263P mutants. Binding of ER Chaperones and Oxidoreductases to Mutant Tg-G2320R—Following a 60-min pulse labeling, co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type Tg or Tg-G2320R mutant with ER molecular chaperones was examined at various chase times. A fraction of newly synthesized wild-type Tg was associated with BiP at 0 h chase time, and this declined precipitously even during the first hour of chase (Fig. 4A) at a time when total labeled intracellular Tg was still maintained (upper panel). By contrast, Tg-G2320R association with BiP did not dramatically decline over 4 h (Fig. 4A), although it did decline over 24 h (Fig. 4B) in parallel with the kinetics of ERAD (upper panel). In addition to BiP, an obvious increase in the early association of both ERp72 and PDI with Tg-G2320R was evident (Fig. 4A), and substantial association continued with the remaining intracellular fraction throughout the entire 24-h post-synthesis (Fig. 4B). A similar but far less dramatic increase in association of mutant Tg was also observed with ERp57 (Fig. 4A, bottom), but because of the relatively low Tg co-precipitation (see below), this was not pursued extensively. Similarly, small amounts of wild-type and mutant Tg-G2320R were co-immunoprecipitated with calnexin during the first 4 h after Tg synthesis (Fig. 4A); although at much later chase times, the fraction of the small amount of residual labeled intracellular mutant Tg (upper panel) that was bound by calnexin became proportionately larger (Fig. 4B). As a control for these studies, when Tg was intentionally unfolded in situ with increasing doses of dithiothreitol prior to co-immunoprecipitation, the pattern of chaperone/oxidoreductase co-precipitation looked quite similar for wild-type Tg, Tg-G2320R, and Tg-L2263P (with all ER chaperones and oxidoreductases becoming significantly engaged as the Tg protein was increasingly denatured, Fig. 5). These data suggest that the differences shown in Fig. 4 reflect distinct chaperone preferences for Tg-G2320R rather than technical difficulties with antibody-mediated co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, under conditions of mannosidase inhibition when mutant Tg-G2320R persists, more mutant Tg could also be found associated with BiP, ERp72, and PDI binding partners (Fig. 4C). Indeed, the final amount of labeled Tg-G2320R at 24 h of chase (Fig. 4B, upper panel) appeared to be near quantitatively co-precipitated by BiP, calnexin, ERp72, or PDI (Fig. 4B, lower panels). Multiple Chaperones Interact with the Same Population of Mutant Tg Molecules—Based on the foregoing results, a sequential IP protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”) was employed to examine whether a fraction of Tg-G2320R was simultaneously associated with more than one ER oxidoreductase. A first IP with anti-Tg recovered virtually all labeled Tg at either 0 or 6 h of chase, such that essentially no additional labeled Tg could be recovered from the remaining IP-supernatant during a subsequent round of IP with any antibody (Fig. 6A, lanes 2–4). Similarly, the supernatant after a first IP with anti-ERp72 yielded virtually no additional Tg that could be co-precipitated in a second IP with the same antibody (Fig. 6A, lane 7); just as a first round anti-PDI IP yielded little additional Tg co-precipitation with a second round of anti-PDI (lane 12). By contrast, a second round IP with anti-Tg recovered significant additional labeled Tg that was not associated with either of these ER oxidoreductases (Fig. 6A, lanes 6 and 10). Most interesting, however, was that the supernatant after a first IP with anti-ERp72 did not yield additional labeled Tg that could be co-precipitated with anti-PDI (Fig. 6A, lane 8), and the supernatant after a first IP with anti-PDI IP did not yield appreciable labeled Tg in a second round co-precipitation with anti-ERp72 (lane 11). These data suggest that the fraction of labeled Tg bound to ERp72 was the same as that associated with PDI. This complex also included BiP (data not shown), indicating that multiple ER resident proteins interact with the same fraction of mutant Tg molecules. Covalent and Noncovalent Associations between Tg-G2320R and ER Oxidoreductases, Especially ERp72—Based on the observation that Tg-G2320R contains exposed free thiols (Fig. 1) and that both PDI and ERp72 interact with Tg-G2320R (Figs. 4, 5, and 6A), we tested the extent to which mixed disulfide bonds might form between the mutant Tg and ER-resident proteins. Lysates of transfected COS cells that had been pulse-labeled and chased for up to 1 day were untreated or treated with 2% SDS to disrupt all noncovalent associations before SDS dilution followed by co-IP of labeled Tg-G2320R with anti-BiP, anti-ERp72, or anti-PDI. Essentially no Tg-G2320R could be co-precipitated with BiP after disruption of noncovalent interactions (Fig. 6B). By contrast, co-IP of a fraction of mutant Tg with ERp72 and PDI persisted even after SDS treatment (Fig. 6B). Control experiments (not shown) established that co-IP of labeled Tg was prevented by prior reduction of the cell lysate, strongly suggesting that mutant Tg was disulfide-linked to the oxidoreductases. Although representing only a modest fraction of total Tg at the zero chase time, this fraction of mutant Tg covalently associated with ERp72 (or PDI) did not decline rapidly, as occurs in rat thyrocytes during resolution of covalent adducts of wild-type Tg with ERp57 and PDI (18Di Jeso B. Park Y.-n. Ulianich L. Treglia A.S. Urbanas M.L. High S. Arvan P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9793-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, by 24 h after synthesis, the mutant Tg fraction covalently associated with ERp72 closely approximated all residual Tg-G2320R that was refractory to ERAD (Fig. 6B). Given recent studies suggesting that ERp72 association can inhibit ERAD of mutant Tg (28Forster M.L. Sivick K. Park Y.N. Arvan P. Lencer W.I. Tsai B. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the present data seem to direct special attention to potential function(s) of ERp72 within the ER. Demonstration of Potential ERp72 Reductase Activity in Thyrocytes—We found that when PDI and ERp72 from the ER of PC Cl3 thyrocytes (under native conditions) were incubated with PEG-maleimide (not shown), there was partitioning of PDI into discrete bands implying distinct PDI forms, each oxidized to a different extent, whereas ERp72 was more completely and uniformly alkylated. Because ERp72 Cys residues, on average, may exist in a more reduced state than do those o"

The link between receptor conformation and activity is still insufficiently understood, as current models of GPCR activation fail to take an increasing amount of experimental data into account. To elucidate structure-function relationships in GPCR activation, we used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to directly assess the conformation of mutants of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. We analyzed substitutions in the arginine cage DRY motif and in the conserved asparagine N(3.35)119, which are pivotal molecular switches for receptor conformation and activation. Gαi activation of the mutants was either similar to wild-type CXCR4 (D133N, Y135A, and N119D) or resulted in loss of activity (R134A and N119K). Mutant N119S was constitutively active but further activated by agonist. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis suggested no simple correlation between conformational changes in response to ligand binding and activation of Gαi by the mutants. Different conformations of active receptors were detected (for wild-type CXCR4, D133N, and N119S), suggesting that different receptor conformations are able to trigger Gαi activity. Several conformations were also found for inactive mutants. These data provide biophysical evidence for different receptor conformations being active with respect to a single readout. They support models of GPCR structure-activity relationships that take this conformational flexibility of active receptors into account.

The ternary complex model of GPCR activation and its derivatives postulates a limited number of defined receptor conformations, representing inactive, active, and some intermediate states of activation. However, the link between receptor conformation and activity is not entirely clear, and limitations of this model are beginning to emerge (1Urban J.D. Clarke W.P. von Zastrow M. Nichols D.E. Kobilka B.K. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Roth B.L. Christopoulos A. Sexton P. Miller K. Spedding M. Mailman R.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 320: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Receptor mutants have often been used to derive conformational models of receptor activation indirectly from pharmacological and biochemical data. Energy transfer techniques have significantly advanced our capacity to directly assess receptor conformation and conformational responses to ligand binding in live cells (2Ayoub M.A. Couturier C.

However, to date, only few reports directly measured mutant GPCR conformations (4Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O. Kubo Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Vilardaga J.P. Steinmeyer R. Harms G.S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor involved in human immunodeficiency virus infection, spreading of tumors, and inflammatory diseases. Its sole natural agonist is the chemokine CXCL12. CXCR4/CXCL12 are essential during development, hematopoiesis, and immune system organization. The potential importance of CXCR4 also in the adult organism, where the receptor is expressed on a plethora of different cell types (6Murdoch C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), calls for more subtle therapeutic interventions than simple inhibition of the receptor by antagonists. This may be particularly important in long term treatments, such as those required for antiretroviral therapy. Better understanding of the link between CXCR4 conformation and activation is therefore warranted. We set out to directly measure the conformations of CXCR4 mutants bearing substitutions at positions that potentially affect receptor function. For this purpose, we used a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) conformational sensor in live cells based on CXCR4 homodimers. Chemokine receptor homodimers form constitutively and remain associated upon ligand binding, as shown previously by ourselves and others (3Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A. Slight I. Volkmer-Engert R.

Of note, our CXCR4 system uses C-terminal BRET donor (RLuc) and acceptor (yellow fluorescent protein, YFP) fusions of the receptors that preserve receptor activity and do not require receptor overexpression above physiological levels (3Percherancier Y.

[35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.1 nm was added, and membranes were further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After centrifugation at 4 °C and removal of supernatants, the plates were counted in a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta TriLux. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—cAMP was determined by radioimmunoassay using the Amersham Biosciences cAMP assays system following the manufacturer’s instructions. BRET Measurements—Usually 0.01–0.2 μg of RLuc constructs were cotransfected with increasing quantities of the corresponding YFP-tagged construct, completed to 2 μg with empty vector. Transfected cells were seeded in 96-well white clear bottom plates treated with poly-d-lysine and left in culture for 24 h. Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and coelenterazine H (Nanolight Technology) added to a final concentration of 5 μm in phosphate-buffered saline. Readings were collected using a Mithras LB 940 reader (Berthold) by sequential integration of the signals detected in the 480 ± 20 (for luciferase) and 530 ± 20 nm (for YFP) windows. The BRET signal is the ratio of the receptor-YFP over the receptor-RLuc emission. The values were corrected to net BRET by subtracting the background BRET detected in cells expressing the RLuc constructs alone. Ligands were incubated in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with the cells at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of coelenterazine H and BRET reading. In BRET titration experiments, net BRET ratios were expressed as a function of the [acceptor]/[donor] ratio (13Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Total fluorescence (excitation filter at 485 nm and emission filter at 535 nm) and luminescence (measured 10 min after the addition of coelenterazine in the absence of emission filter) were used as a relative measure of total acceptor and donor protein expression. Ligand-induced BRET changes were monitored at maximal BRET (BRETmax), and we ensured that BRETmax did not depend on the quantity of transfected Rluc or YFP fusion plasmids. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. GTPγS binding was analyzed using nonlinear regressions applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model (variable slope). The statistical significance of the net BRET differences between the different mutants and conditions was calculated using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s post-test for p value less than 0.05 We constructed mutants D133N, R134A, and Y135A in the conserved DRY motif (residues (3.49), (3.50), and (3.51) following the assignment of Ballesteros and Weinstein (14Ballesteros J.

Costa T. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2003; 1: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, mutants N119D, N119K, and N119S were introduced in position asparagine 119 (Asn-119, or (3.35)), a key residue in which replacements change receptor activity as a function of the size of their lateral chain (16Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol.

Surface expression of mutants D133N and R134A was somewhat reduced, whereas the remaining substitutions showed similar surface expression as wild-type CXCR4 (Fig. 1A). To analyze activation properties of the mutants, we measured G protein activation using a GTPγS binding assay (Fig. 1, B–D). D133N and Y135A displayed no apparent reduction of agonist-induced G protein activation, whereas R134A activity was strongly reduced. Replacement of the Asn-119 (N3.35) residue by lysine, serine, or aspartic acid resulted in the phenotypes previously reported by Zhang et al. (16Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24515-24521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The N119D substitution resembled wild-type CXCR4, and N119K leads to loss of activity, whereas constitutive activity is seen with the N119S mutant. GTPγS binding of the N119S mutant is further increased in the presence of agonist to maximal activity identical to wild-type CXCR4. These observations were substantiated by measurement of Gαi-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced adenylyl cyclase activity at a single maximal dose of 200 nm CXCL12 (Fig. 1E), which is close to the maximum activity achievable with wild-type CXCR4 (3Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A. Slight I. Volkmer-Engert R. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Bouvier M. Heveker N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9895-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and which corresponds to the concentrations used in the BRET assays (below). The results of both assays are in good agreement, suggesting that GTPγS binding is indeed due to Gαi activation. Taken together, our mutant panel comprises receptors that display a constitutive G protein activation that can be further activated by agonist (N119S), activity similar to that of wild-type CXCR4 (Y135A, D133N, N119D), or relative inactivity (N119K and R134A). The loss of activity of N119K and R134A is not due to loss of CXCL12 binding since the chemokine outcompetes binding of the monoclonal antibody 12G5 to all mutants (data not shown). We then monitored the conformation of the CXCR4 mutant homodimers. We used a BRET sensor system that measures the relative distance and orientation of an energy donor (Renilla luciferase, RLuc) and acceptor (YFP) fused to the C terminus of CXCR4. Coexpression of the two constructs leads to the constitutive formation of homodimers and permits measurement of conformational changes that alter orientation/distance of the fused fluorophores, such as those brought about by ligand binding to the dimeric receptor (3Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A. Slight I. Volkmer-Engert R. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Bouvier M. Heveker N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9895-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Energy acceptor over donor titrations demonstrated that most mutants retained BRET50 values (the YFP/RLuc ratio at which half-maximal BRET is obtained) in the same range as wild-type CXCR4 (Fig. 2A), and the observed differences are not statistically significant. BRET50 has been interpreted as the propensity of a receptor to dimerize (13Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 19Ramsay D. Kellett E. McVey M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The maximal BRET varied between wild-type and mutant CXCR4 with the exception of N119D. These BRETmax differences were significant, as were the differences between several mutants (Fig. 2B). Lower BRET results from the greater distance between the energy donor and acceptor or from altered orientation, which is likewise indicative of conformational change. This conclusion is in line with evidence presented by Zhang et al. (16Zhang W.B. Navenot J.M. Haribabu B. Tamamura H. Hiramatu K. Omagari A. Pei G. Manfredi J.P. Fujii N. Broach J.R. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24515-24521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) as a result of receptor modeling, which suggested conformational differences between wild-type CXCR4 and the N119S mutant. Of note, it is improbable that the mutations directly modify the orientation of the fused fluorophores since they are in TM3 and adjacent residues of the receptor. We therefore conclude that the observed differences in BRETmax are due to overall conformational changes within the receptor. We next measured BRET in the presence of the natural CXCR4 agonist CXCL12, the weak agonist AMD3100, or the inverse agonist TC14012. We have previously shown that these ligands induce distinct conformational changes in CXCR4 homodimers without affecting BRET50 values (3Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A. Slight I. Volkmer-Engert R. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Bouvier M. Heveker N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9895-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Acceptor over donor titration analyses performed with the constitutively active mutant N119S and the inactive mutant N119K in the absence and presence of ligands revealed no significant changes of BRET50, suggesting that ligand binding also to mutant CXCR4 does not change their propensity to dimerize (N119S at basal condition, 4.01 ± 1.31; in the presence of CXCL12, 7.93 ± 4.32; in the presence of TC14012, 5.99 ± 2.43; and N119K at basal condition, 4.85 ± 1.73; in the presence of CXCL12, 3.33 ± 1.36; in the presence of TC14012, 5.57 ± 2.46, n = 4). Fig. 3A shows the observed ligand-induced BRETmax changes of the CXCR4 mutants, expressed as the percentage of change relative to the respective BRETmax in the absence of ligand. The relative responses to the agonist CXCL12 of the mutants were different. Although the differences between wild-type CXCR4 and the mutants did not reach statistical significance, the differences between mutant Y135A and mutants D133N, R134A, N119K, and N119S were significant (p < 0.05). The relative BRET increase observed in response to AMD3100 is higher in the mutants than the very weak response of wild-type CXCR4, with the notable exception of R134A. In addition, there are significant differences among the mutant responses, the N119K response being more important than that of D133N and N119D. The differences between wild-type and mutant CXCR4 responses to TC14012 do not reach statistical significance, with the exception of D133N, which does not respond. The differences in ligand-induced BRET changes yield information about relative differences between basal and ligand-bound receptor conformations of the mutants. For example, the weak BRET response of wild-type CXCR4 to AMD3100 indicates either that the wild-type receptor does not undergo important conformational changes or that these changes do not translate into important BRET changes. In turn, the higher BRET responses of most mutants to AMD3100 suggest that the conformational changes that these mutants undergo upon AMD3100 binding are dissimilar from those of the wild-type receptor. This, in principle, might result from their different basal conformations. To directly compare the ligand-bound conformations of the mutants, BRETmax values of the mutants in the presence of ligands were plotted as the percentage of wild-type CXCR4 BRETmax under basal conditions (Fig. 3B, and for a summary, Table 1). This direct comparison reveals that the mutants also have altered conformations in complex with ligand. In the presence of CXCL12, only mutants Y135A and N119D have BRETmax values similar to the wild type, indicating that agonist-bound receptor conformations of the other mutants are different, including mutants D133N and N119S (p < 0.05), which nevertheless stimulate Gαi activity in the presence of CXCL12. Differences in inactive conformations are suggested by the differences of R134A, N119K, and CXCR4 in the presence of inverse agonist (p < 0.05). Interestingly, despite the obvious functional differences between mutants N119K and N119S, almost identical BRET in the presence and absence of ligands was measured. This suggests that despite the recorded differences among many of the mutants, the technical limits of our method may not permit appreciation of subtle but functionally paramount conformational differences.TABLE 1Overview, mutant Gαi activation and BRETmax in absence and presence of SDF-1ReceptorGαi activationbasal BRETmax (relative to wildtype CXCR4)BRETmax with CXCL12 (relative to basal wildtype CXCR4)CXCR4yes100139 ± 15D133Nyes76 ± 1294 ± 3R134Ano41 ± 749 ± 7Y135Ayes74 ± 12119 ± 19N119Dyes101 ± 15137 ± 3N119Kno68 ± 1687 ± 8N119Sconstitutive, further activated by agonist75 ± 1395 ± 5 Open table in a new tab BRETmax values are average values of a receptor population; it can therefore not be categorically ruled out that different BRETmax values represent different states of equilibrium between only two distinct conformations (for example, one inactive and one active conformation). However, we find no linear link between BRETmax and G protein activation (for example, R134A with CXCL12 has lower BRETmax and higher activity than N119K with or without CXCL12, p < 0.05). Moreover, inactive and active receptors can have similar BRETmax (such as mutants N119K and N119S in the presence of CXCL12). We therefore conclude that different BRETmax corresponds to genuinely different receptor conformations rather than to changes in equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. We have shown that mutations of the CXCR4 sequence can alter both the basal conformation and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding. Conformational rearrangements of a given mutant in response to agonist are not predictive of G protein activation (for example, mutant N119K conformationally responds to CXCL12 yet fails to activate G proteins). It remains to be investigated whether conformational responses could be predictive for receptor activities other than G protein activation; we do, however, not believe that conformational response per se must be followed by functional responses (i.e. the inverse agonist TC14012 induces conformational response but not activity). In turn, conformational differences between mutants in the presence of CXCL12 do not necessarily correlate with gross differences in G protein activation. For instance, the N119S mutant and wild-type CXCR4 have different conformations in the presence of CXCL12, yet both activate G proteins. Although it remains to be seen whether such mutants are functionally different with respect to other readouts, such differences would not affect our conclusion that distinct receptor conformations can mediate the same activity. Taken together, we detect important differences on both the functional and the conformational level in our mutant panel, but the link between function and conformation eludes simplification. Theoretical models that describe GPCR activation have been repeatedly amended to accommodate new experimental data (20Kenakin T. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The dominant ternary complex model and its derivatives assume the existence of a limited number of receptor conformations that derive from one another by intermediates between the extremes of one active and one inactive conformation. This assumption is increasingly difficult to reconcile with accumulating pharmacological evidence that different receptor ligands can stabilize different receptor conformations, as deduced from different functional consequences, and further revision of current models may be warranted (1Urban J.D. Clarke W.P. von Zastrow M. Nichols D.E. Kobilka B.K. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Roth B.L. Christopoulos A. Sexton P. Miller K. Spedding M. Mailman R.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 320: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). In this context, direct measurement of receptor conformation offers an additional perspective, contributing independent evidence to the elucidation of structure-function relationships in GPCRs. To date, few studies using these methods have employed mutant receptors in live cells (4Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O. Kubo Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Vilardaga J.P. Steinmeyer R. Harms G.S. Lohse M.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our data derived from a set of CXCR4 mutants provide biophysical evidence that active receptor conformations can have a degree of conformational diversity that was previously unappreciated and that is consistent with multiple receptor conformations being able to perform the same activation step. This fits models that take conformational heterogeneity of receptors into account. Such models were initially forwarded to better describe allosterism and suppose that collections of receptor conformations make up functionally similar receptor subpopulations (21Onaran H.O. Costa T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 812: 98-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Kenakin T. Onaran O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 275-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 186-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Although it might be rightly argued that recombinant systems expressing receptor mutants in cell lines do not reflect what wild-type receptors actually perform in vivo, such artificial test systems highlight aspects of the conformational plasticity of the active receptor, as they have previously permitted the accumulation of functional information. In conclusion, we find that heterogeneous CXCR4 conformations can lead to similar G protein activation, implying a flexibility of active receptors that is unaccounted for by the ternary complex model and its derivatives. Our findings might also help meet the conceptual challenges inherent to therapeutic targeting of CXCR4. The use of competitive inhibitors of CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 results in side effects that make the drug unsuitable for long term antiretroviral treatment in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Our data suggest that noncompetitive allosteric compounds, which modulate the receptor conformation rather than blocking ligand binding and thereby preserve some of the functions of the receptor, may be compatible with the maintenance of vital CXCR4 signaling but impinge on other properties such as the mediation of viral entry.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5425-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and inhibition of Cdk5 activity blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (15Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Cdk5 is a component of the Egr-1-dependent signaling pathway and that an Egr-1-driven increase in Cdk5 activity is required for differentiation of PC12 cells to neurons. In this study, we observed that PP1 phosphorylation is reduced in the brain extracts of Egr-1-/- mice, suggesting that a kinase that acts downstream of Egr-1 phosphorylates PP1 in the brain. This prompted us to investigate whether Cdk5 phosphorylates PP1. Herein, we show that PP1 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 in vitro, in transfected mammalian cells and in differentiating PC12 cells. We also demonstrate that in NGF-exposed PC12 cells, blocking PP1 phosphorylation by inhibiting Cdk5 activity, blocks neurite outgrowth. Overexpression of PP1 (WT) but not PP1 (T320A) promotes differentiation. Our data indicate that Cdk5 phosphorylates PP1 in vivo and suggest that PP1 phosphorylation has a role in neuronal differentiation. Animals—Experimental mouse studies were conducted in adult male wild type (+/+) C57Bl/6 or Egr-1-deficient (-/-) mice (n = 3). Egr-1-/- mice have a C57Bl/6 genetic background. The originating parental mice lacking Egr-1 (19Lee S.L. Tourtellotte L.C. Wesselschmidt R.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9971-9977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt (University of St. Louis, St. Louis, MO). All of the experiments were performed according to the regulations of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and the Animal Care Committee of the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research. The mice were genotyped by PCR using DNA obtained by tail docking and amplification using genespecific primers and Taq DNA polymerase. Primer pairs were neo-929 (5′-CTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGC-3′), Egr-1-1263 (5′-AACCGGCCCAGCAAGACACC-3′), and Egr-1-1677 (5′-GGGCACAGGGGATGGGAATG-3′). A 414-bp DNA was amplified from C57Bl/6 mice using the 1263 + 1677 primer combination, and no DNA was amplified using the neo929 + 1677 primers. A 520-bp DNA fragment was amplified from Egr-1-/- mice neo929 + 1677 primers, and no DNA was amplified using the 1263 + 1677 primers. The mice were killed at 3 months of age by cervical dislocation, and their brains were removed immediately. Each brain was quickly homogenized in an equal amount (w/v) of cold extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 mm okadaic acid, 10 mm NaF, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) using a Down’s glass homogenizer. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min using a bench top centrifuge. The resulting supernatants were used to generate Fig. 1. Protein and Antibodies—Cdk5 was purified from an extract of fresh bovine brain as described previously (20Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol.

PP1 (unless otherwise indicated PP1 means PP1α) was purified from E. coli overexpressing human PP1α (22Dohadwala M. Berndt N. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against Cdk1, Cdk2, and Cdk5 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A polyclonal anti-p35 antibody that recognizes both p35 and p25 and an anti-PP1 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, anti-Xpress, and anti-HA antibodies were described previously (23Li T. Paudel H.K.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3134-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Thr(P)320 antibody specific for PP1 phosphorylated on Thr320 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). NGF (2.5 S) was obtained from Upstate Signaling Solution (Temecula, CA). cDNA Cloning—PP1 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector Myc-pcDNA3.1/Zeo by PCR. Pfu DNA polymerase-catalyzed PCR was performed using forward primer (5′-CGG ATA TCA ATG TCC GAC AGC GAG AAG CTC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGG GAT CCC TAT TTC TTG GCT TTG GCG GT-3′) and human PP1α in pDR540 vector as the template. Site-specific mutant PP1 (T320A) was generated by PCR using Myc-PP1α-pcDNA3.1 as the template. The forward and reverse primers were: 5′-GGA ATT GCG GGG TGG GGC GAT GGG TCG GCC TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA GGC CGA CCC ATC GCC CCA CCC CGC AAT TCC-3′, respectively. All of the cDNA clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Dominant negative HA-Cdk5 (DN) in pcDNA 3.1 vector was a gift from Dr. L.-H. Tsai (Harvard University, Boston, MA). Mammalian vectors that express Xpress-Cdk5, FLAG-p25, and FLAG-p35 were described previously (24Li T. Hawkes C. Qureshi H.Y. Kar S. Paudel H.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3134-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine. HEK 293 cells were cultured using standard techniques (23Li T. Paudel H.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3125-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Li T. Hawkes C. Qureshi H.Y. Kar S. Paudel H.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3134-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All of the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Unless otherwise indicated, the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. PC12 cells were plated on polylysine-coated dishes. After 24 h NGF (0.1 μg/ml) was added, and cell differentiation was monitored microscopically as described (25Schipper H.M. Agarwal-Mawal A. Paudel H.K. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 μm okadaic acid, and 2 nm cypermethrin and aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (0.2 μg/ml of each)). Transfection of siRNA—siRNA-Cdk5 (SMARTpool containing four pooled SMARTselected siRNA duplex) and a nonspecific control were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solution. PC12 cells were transfected with siRNA using siMPORTER™ (Upstate Cell Signaling Solution) reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions. NGF was added 6 h after transfection. The cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Neurite Outgrowth Assay and Immunocytochemical Staining—NGF-treated cells grown on cover slips were fixed at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and then permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:500 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for ∼12 h at 4 °C. The washed cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and finally visualized and photographed using a Nikon fluorescent microscope. Neurite length was measured on the photographs using a micrometer (26Sakurai T. Lustig M. Nativ M. Hemperly J.J. Schlessinger J. Peles E. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Only those neurites that were equal or longer than the cell diameter were considered to be neurites, and cells that contained one or more neurites were regarded as having neurite outgrowth. Cells that had one or more neurites with the length twice or more than twice the diameter of the cell body were considered differentiated according to previously described criteria (28Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshell C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). More than 100 cells were quantitated in each experimental group. In Vitro Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of PP1 by Cdk5 was carried out at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mg/ml of PP1, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.2 μm okadaic acid, 1mm ATP, and 400 units/ml of Cdk5. The reaction was initiated by adding an aliquot of Cdk5 into the mixture containing the assay components. At the indicated time points, the aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of SDS/PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-PP1 or anti-Thr(P)320 antibody. Cdk5 activity in mouse brain extract was assayed as described previously (20Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using a synthetic peptide substrate of Cdk5 (KTPKKAKKPKTPKKAKKL) (29Lew J. Beaudette K.N. Letwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each brain extract was adjusted to 2 mg/ml by dilution with extraction buffer. The final concentrations of the assay components were: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 20 nm okadaic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm peptide substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of brain extract to 40 μl of the assay mixture. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The vials were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged for 5 min using a bench top centrifuge at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant (20 μl each) was withdrawn and analyzed for the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the substrate using a phosphocellulose filter paper assay (20Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cdk5 specific activity is expressed as the nanomoles of phosphate transferred to the peptide substrate/min/mg protein in the brain extract. PP1 Phosphorylation Is Reduced in Egr-1-/- Mouse Brain—To determine whether Egr-1 affects PP1 expression in vivo, we homogenized fresh brains from three Egr-1+/+ and three Egr-1-/- mice under identical conditions. Each homogenate was analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, PP1 is highly expressed in Egr-1+/+ (lanes 1-3) and Egr-1-/- brains (lanes 4-6). Quantitation of blot band intensities showed similar relative amounts of PP1 protein in Egr-1+/+ brains (∼0.32, ∼0.33, and ∼0.35) and Egr-1-/- brains (∼0.39, ∼0.36, and ∼0.35) (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that Egr-1 may not regulate expression and/or stability of PP1 in adult mouse brain. PP1 is phosphorylated on Thr320 in vivo (4Dhadwala M. Da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L.

We observed that PP1 in fresh mouse brain extract is highly immunoreactive to an anti-Thr(P)320 antibody that specifically cross-reacts with PP1 phosphorylated on Thr320 (see below). This observation indicates that PP1 is phosphorylated in the adult mouse brain. To determine whether Egr-1 regulates PP1 phosphorylation, we analyzed brain homogenates of Egr-1+/+ and Egr-1-/- mice by Western blot analysis using anti-Thr(P)320 antibody. We observed that PP1 is phosphorylated on Thr320 in brains of Egr-1+/+ as well as Egr-1-/- mice (Fig. 1A). Quantitation determined that the relative amount of Thr320-phosphorylated PP1 in Egr-1+/+ brains is twice (0.62, ∼0.59, and ∼0.57) that found in Egr-1-/- brains (∼0.32, ∼0.33, and ∼0.29) (Fig. 1B). These observations indicate that PP1 phosphorylation is significantly suppressed in Egr-1-/- mouse brains. Egr-1 is a transcription factor (16O'Donovan K.J. Tourtellotte W.G. Millbrandt J. Baraban J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 167-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and so may regulate PP1 phosphorylation by controlling the expression of a kinase that phosphorylates PP1. Thr320 of PP1 is a proline-directed phosphorylation site recognized by cyclin-dependent kinases: Cdk1 and Cdk2 (3Berndt N. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 22-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dhadwala M. Da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29470-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cdk1 and Cdk2 are not expressed significantly in adult brain, whereas Cdk5 shares a very similar substrate specificity with Cdk1 and Cdk2 (30Beaudette K.N. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20825-20830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the major cyclin-dependent kinase in the neurons of mammalian brain (10Lew J. Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Paudel H. Matsura I. Matsushita M. Zhu X. Wang J.H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Dhavan R. Tsai L.-H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 12Grant P. Sharma P. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that Egr-1 activates Cdk5 in neurons by increasing the expression of p35 subunit of Cdk5 (15Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 18Chen F. Wang Q. Wang X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5425-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If Egr-1 activates brain Cdk5, then Egr-1-/- brains would be expected to have reduced p35 level and Cdk5 activity. To test this possibility, we analyzed the levels of Cdk5, p35, and p25 by Western blotting and measured Cdk5 activity in Egr-1+/+ and Egr-1-/- brain extracts. Because p35 is proteolyzed to p25, we determined the level of p35 based on the levels of p25 and p35. The Cdk5 level was similar, but the sum of the levels of p35 and p25 was ∼2.7-fold more in Egr-1+/+ than in Egr-1-/- brain extracts (Fig. 1, A and B). The Cdk5 specific activity in Egr-1-/- brain extracts was ∼38% less than that of Egr-1+/+ (Fig. 1C). Thus, as expected, both p35/p25 level and Cdk5 activity are reduced in Egr-1-/- brains. The observation of reduced PP1 phosphorylation coupled to reduced Cdk5 activity in Egr-1-/- brain suggests that Cdk5 may be a kinase that phosphorylates PP1 in the brain. Cdk5 Phosphorylates PP1—To evaluate whether Cdk5 phosphorylates PP1, we first tested the specificity of pT320 antibody. Because PP1 is phosphorylated on Thr320 in proliferating cells by endogenous Cdk1 and Cdk2, we transfected Myc-PP1 (WT) or site-specific mutant Myc-PP1 (T320A) in HEK 293 cells and analyzed cell lysates by Western blot analysis. Anti-Myc antibody detected both Myc-PP1 (WT) and Myc-PP1 (T320A) (Fig. 2), but anti-Thr(P)320 antibody recognized Myc-PP1 (WT) phosphorylated by endogenous kinase(s) and completely failed to detect Myc-PP1 (T320A). These data demonstrated that anti-Thr(P)320 antibody is specific for PP1 phosphorylated on Thr320. We next co-transfected Myc-PP1 (WT) with Xpress-Cdk5 and FLAG-p25 (Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p25) in HEK 293 cells. Controls included co-transfection of Myc-PP1 (T320A) with Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p25 and Myc-PP1 (WT) with Cdk5 mutant, HA-Cdk5 (DN). HA-Cdk5 (DN) with Asp144 mutated to Asn, although reported to contain no detectable kinase activity when co-transfected with p35 in C33A cervical carcinoma cells (13Tsai L.-H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S.J. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), displays kinase activity ∼10% of Cdk5 (WT) when co-transfected with FLAG-p25 in HEK 293 cells (data not shown). Transfected cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblot analysis for the expression of the various transfected genes and PP1 phosphorylation. The relative amount of phosphorylated PP1 was calculated based on the band intensities of PP1 and phosphorylated PP1. As shown in Fig. 3A, in cells co-transfected with Myc-PP1 (WT) and Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p25, Myc-PP1 was phosphorylated ∼3.5-fold more than basal level (compare lanes 2 and 3 and see F). In cells co-transfected with Myc-PP1 (WT) and HA-Cdk5 (DN)/p25-FLAG, Myc-PP1 phosphorylation was slightly above basal level (compare lanes 2 and 6 and see F). These data indicate that PP1 is highly phosphorylated by Cdk5 and very modestly by Cdk5 (DN). To extend and confirm these results, we treated HEK 293 cells, co-transfected with Myc-PP1 and Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p25, with the Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine (21Agarwal-Mawal A. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23712-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.Y. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) or vehicle. Treated cells were then analyzed for PP1 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis as described above. PP1 was highly phosphorylated in vehicle-treated cells; however, PP1 phosphorylation progressively diminished with increasing olomoucine concentration. When the concentration of olomoucine reached 200 μm, PP1 phosphorylation was almost at basal level (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these results, we conclude that Cdk5 phosphorylates PP1 on Thr320 in HEK 293 cells transfected with Myc-PP1 and Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p25. The p25 regulatory subunit of Cdk5 is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of p35 protein (13Tsai L.-H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S.J. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Although p25 activates Cdk5, p35 is the natural activator of Cdk5 (11Dhavan R. Tsai L.-H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 12Grant P. Sharma P. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates PP1, we transfected Myc-PP1 and Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p35 in HEK 293 cells. Transfected cells were lysed and analyzed for expression of the transfected genes and Myc-PP1 phosphorylation as described above. The relative amount of phosphorylated Myc-PP1 in cells transfected with Myc-PP1 and Xpress-Cdk5/FLAG-p35 was ∼3-fold more than in those cells transfected with Myc-PP1 alone (data not included). These results determined that Cdk5/p35, like Cdk5/p25, phosphorylates PP1. In Vitro Phosphorylation—To test whether Cdk5 phosphorylates PP1 directly, we performed in vitro kinase assays. Bacterially expressed recombinant PP1 was incubated with purified Cdk5 in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ for various time points. Incubated samples were analyzed for PP1 phosphorylation by immunoblot analyses using anti-Thr(P)320 antibody (Fig. 4A). No immunoreactive band against anti-Thr(P)320 was observed in samples containing Cdk5 alone incubated with ATP/Mg2+(lane 1), and PP1 did not become phosphorylated when incubated alone with ATP/Mg2+ (lane 2). In samples containing PP1, Cdk5, and ATP/Mg2+, PP1 phosphorylation increased with inc"
https://openalex.org/W2051147707,"The human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 core plays an important role in fusion between viral and target cell membranes. A single chain polypeptide, N36(L8)C34, which forms a six-helix bundle in physiological solution, can be used as a model of gp41 core. Here we identified from a 12-mer phage peptide library a positive phage clone displaying a peptide sequence with high binding activity to the HIV-1 gp41 core. The peptide sequence contains a putative gp41-binding motif, ΦXXXXΦXΦ (X is any amino acid residue, and Φ is any one of the aromatic amino acid residues Trp, Phe, or Tyr). This motif also exists in the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a known gp41-binding protein. Cav-1-(61–101) and Cav-1-(82–101), two recombinant fusion proteins containing the Cav-1 scaffolding domain, bound significantly to the gp41 expressed in mammalian cells and interacted with the polypeptide N36(L8)C34. These results suggest that the scaffolding domain of Cav-1 may bind to the gp41 core via the motif. This interaction may be essential for formation of fusion pore or endocytosis of HIV-1 and affect the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. Further characterization of the gp41 core-binding motifs may shed light on the alternative mechanism by which HIV-1 enters into the target cell."

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; DNDGIC, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; GUV, giant unilamellar vesicle; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; NBD-Cl, 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole; NBDHEX, 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ITO, indium tin oxide.2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; DNDGIC, dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; GUV, giant unilamellar vesicle; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; NBD-Cl, 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole; NBDHEX, 6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ITO, indium tin oxide. are a superfamily of enzymes that protect the cell from toxic endogenous or xenobiotic compounds. Eight different gene-independent, isoenzymatic classes have been found in mammals, and two of these, Alpha and Mu classes, are abundantly expressed in rat liver, where they represent 43 and 56%, respectively, of the entire pool of cytosolic GSTs (1Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Beside their catalytic competence to conjugate GSH to many toxic substances having an electrophilic center, these enzymes also display peroxidase activity and ligandin properties (2Hurst R. Bao Y. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Mannervik B. Chem. Scr. 1986; 26: 281-284Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, Alpha GSTs efficiently trap a natural nitric oxide carrier, the dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC), thus preventing the irreversible inhibition of glutathione reductase caused by this compound (4Pedersen J.Z. De Maria F. Turella P. Federici G. Mattei M. Fabrini R. Dawood K.F. Massimi M. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6364-6371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence was also reported that GSTs could be associated with the nuclear membrane or compartmentalized in nuclei. The presence of GSTs on intracellular membranes is not a new finding. MGST1 is a peculiar trimeric microsomal integral membrane isoenzyme discovered and characterized many years ago (5Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Jornvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13976-13983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSTA4-4, a specific isoenzyme able to detoxify hydroxyalkenals, displays a widespread mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and cytosolic localization, but the plasma membrane also binds detectable amounts of this enzyme (6Singh S.P. Janecki A.J. Srivastava S.K. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Xia S.J. Zimniak P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4232-4239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tight association of Alpha and Mu class GSTs with the microsomal membrane fraction of rat liver was demonstrated by Morgenstern et al. (7Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. DePierre J.W. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and about 2% of the cytosolic GSTA1-1 has been found in the microsomal membrane of sheep liver cells (8Sandeep K. Prabou K.S. Reddy P.V. Gumpricht E. Hildenbrandt G.R. Scholz R.W. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 345-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical evidence suggested the presence of nuclear Alpha and Pi class GSTs in different human tissues, but these studies did not quantify the specific isoenzymes involved (9Campbell J.A.H. Corrigal A.V. Guy A. Kirsch R.E. Cancer. 1991; 67: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Abei M. Harada S. Tanaka N. McNeil M. Osuga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other investigations claimed either the presence or the absence of nuclear compartmentalization of GSTs. In particular, McCusker et al. (11McCusker F.M. Phillips M.F. Boyce S.J. Mantle T.J. Hayes J.D. Pickett C.B. Mantle T.J. Glutathione S-Transferases and Drug Resistance. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1990Google Scholar) did not report any detectable nuclear GST activity, whereas Soboll et al. (12Soboll S. Grundel S. Harris J. Kolb-Bachofen V. Ketterer B. Sies H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), using a nonaqueous technique of cell fractionation, found that both Alpha and Mu GSTs are present in the nucleus. Other studies reported a nuclear localization of GSTs (13Rogers L.K. Gupta S. Welty S.E. Hansen T.N. Smith C.V. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 69: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Bennett C.F. Spector D.L. Yeoman L.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Rozell B. Hansson H.A. Guthenberg C. Tahir M.K. Mannervik B. Xenobiotica. 1993; 23: 835-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the identification of the specific isoenzyme(s) involved in this association and their quantification are uncertain. This study reveals for the first time that beside a significant amount of Alpha GSTs inside the nucleus, an equivalent amount is found in electrostatic association with the outer nuclear membrane. This particular modality of interaction has been detailed in cells and model systems using confocal microscopy, immunostaining experiments, and molecular modeling. Materials—6-(7-Nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX), dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl-iron complex (DNDGIC), and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) were synthesized as described previously (16Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M.

Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Recombinant human GSTA1-1, GSTM2-2, and GSTP1-1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (17Lo Bello M. Nuccetelli M. Caccuri A.M. Stella L. Parker M.W. Rossjohn J.

All other materials were of reagent grade. Cells—CCRF-CEM cells (human T-lymphoblastic leukemia) were grown as described previously (16Turella P. Cerella C. Filomeni G. Bullo A. De Maria F. Ghibelli L. Ciriolo M.R. Cianfriglia M. Mattei M. Federici G. Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3751-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were prepared from Wistar male rats as described in the accompanying paper (4Pedersen J.Z. De Maria F. Turella P. Federici G. Mattei M. Fabrini R. Dawood K.F. Massimi M. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6364-6371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in accordance to the ethical guidelines for animal research (Communication of the Italian Ministry of Health). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—Subcellular fractions were prepared and characterized as reported in the accompanying paper (4Pedersen J.Z. De Maria F. Turella P. Federici G. Mattei M. Fabrini R. Dawood K.F. Massimi M. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6364-6371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) except that two parallel procedures were used; one procedure used a saline isotonic solution (0.05 m KCl, 0.04 m KH2PO4, and 0.1 m sucrose, pH 7.4), and the other procedure used a pure 0.25 m sucrose without salts. Purification of Weakly and Tightly Bound GSTs—The nuclear fraction obtained from 10 g of liver was washed three times with 20 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and resuspended in 20 ml of 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The suspension was rapidly centrifuged at 1000 × g, and the procedure was repeated. Further rapid extractions did not increase the amount of GSTs in the supernatant. The collected supernatants were concentrated and represent the “weakly bound GSTs.” The pellet was again resuspended in the same buffer solution and incubated under gentle agitation for 1 h. This procedure was repeated three times. The collected supernatants were concentrated and represent the “tightly bound GSTs.” Both weakly and tightly bound GSTs were purified by affinity chromatography through a column (1 × 4 cm) of glutathione-Sepharose matrix (21Simmons P.C. Vander Jagt D.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The first eluate was again passed through the column to retain quantitatively the Alpha GSTs. GST Activity—The standard test for glutathione transferase activity contained 1 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB in 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. An isotonic enzymatic test for GST was also performed using standard phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB. The activity was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Activity of nuclear GST was measured by diluting aliquots of a nuclear suspension in the standard assay mixture or using the isotonic test described above. After 2 min of preincubation, the time course of the reaction was linear. A similar procedure was used for activity determination in the mitochondria and microsome and lysosome fractions. With these activity measurements, it is not possible to distinguish whether the activity is because of GSTs inside the intact structures or due to GSTs bound to the outside of the membranes. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The proteins were immunoblotted with either a polyclonal anti-Alpha GST antibody or a polyclonal anti-Mu GST antibody. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were made as described previously (4Pedersen J.Z. De Maria F. Turella P. Federici G. Mattei M. Fabrini R. Dawood K.F. Massimi M. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6364-6371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of GSTs—The GSTs extracted from nuclei were resolved on a reverse-phase (C18, 4.6 mm × 250 mm) column, essentially as reported by Yeh et al. (1Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Studies—The nuclei pellet was fixed in 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in 0.25 m sucrose for 4 h at 4 °C. After extensive washings in 0.25 m sucrose, floating pellets were incubated with a polyclonal anti-Alpha GST diluted 1:100 in 0.25 m sucrose overnight at 4 °C and washed again in 0.25 m sucrose for 20 min. Pellets were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:200 in 0.25 m sucrose, for 1 h at room temperature, washed in 0.25 m sucrose, and finally mounted on slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Slides were observed in a laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon), and micrographs were digitally captured. Fluorescence Labeling of GSTA1-1 and GSTM2-2—1 mm NBD-Cl was reacted with 10 μm purified human GSTA1-1 or GSTM2-2 in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After 2 h the excess of reagent was removed by G-25 Sephadex chromatography, and the modified enzymes were analyzed spectrophotometrically. The selective alkylation of enzyme cysteines was confirmed on the basis of the diagnostic absorption peak centered at about 430–440 nm. Liposome Preparation—Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared according to a procedure reported previously (22Stella L. Mazzuca C. Venanzi M. Palleschi A. Didone M. Formaggio M. Toniolo C. Pispisa B. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 936-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in a chloroform/methanol solution (1:1 v/v), and the solvents were evaporated under reduced argon atmosphere until a thin film formed. Complete evaporation was ensured by applying a rotary vacuum pump for at least 2 h, and the film was hydrated with a 0.25 m sucrose solution. After vigorous stirring and 10 freeze and thaw cycles, the liposome suspension was extruded 31 times through two stacked polycarbonate membranes with 100-nm pores (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Final phospholipid concentration was determined by the Stewart method (23Stewart J.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Anionic liposomes were formed by egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol (8:1:1 molar ratio) to reproduce the charged lipid and cholesterol content of the nuclear membrane (24Albi E. Tomassoni M.L. Viola-Magni M. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1997; 15: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Neutral liposomes were formed by phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (9:1 molar ratio). Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were prepared by the electroformation method (25Estes D.J. Mayer M. Colloids Surf. B. 2005; 42: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lipids were dissolved in a chloroform/acetonitrile solution (95:5 v/v) at a 5 mm total concentration; 0.25 ml of this solution was deposited on a 25 × 30-mm indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass slide, and spin-coated at 600 rpm for 5 min. Complete solvent evaporation was ensured by applying a rotary vacuum pump for at least 2 h. A 15 × 15 × 1.5-mm electroformation chamber was formed by separating the lipid covered ITO electrode by another bare ITO glass slide with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) spacer. The chamber was filled with a 0.25 m sucrose solution, and a 1.1-V (peak to peak), 10-Hz potential was applied to the two ITO electrodes, using a Wavetek 182-A function generator. After 1.5 h the potential was switched to 3 V, 4 Hz for 10 min to favor detachment of GUVs from the electrode. The solution contained in the electroformation chamber was gently removed, and aliquots were deposited on silanized microscope slides for observation in the confocal microscope. The lipid compositions of GUVs were the same employed for LUVs, except that 1% rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine was included to allow visualization of the liposomes by confocal microscopy. Electrostatic Calculations—Molecular structures of human and rat GSTs were derived from the following Protein Data Bank entries: 2GSD (human A1-1), 2GTU (human M2-2), 6GSS (human P1-1), 1EV4 (rat A1-1), and 1B4P (rat M2-2). Protein charges were calculated by using the PDB2PQR software (26Dolinsky T.J. Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Baker N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W665-W667Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar), and Poisson-Boltzmann calculations of electrostatic potential were performed with the APBS program (27Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5699) Google Scholar), with 161 × 161 × 161 grid points, a 110-Ä coarse grid and an 83-Ä fine grid dimension, dielectric constants equal to 2 and 78.54 for protein and water, respectively, and Debye-Hückel boundary conditions. Protein dipoles were estimated by employing the Dipole server, and molecular graphics were realized with the MOLMOL (28Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) and Chimera software (29Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26024) Google Scholar). Confocal Imaging—Confocal images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope, Nikon PCM 2000 (Nikon Instruments) equipped with Spectra Physics Ar ion laser (488 nm, 514 nm) and He-Ne laser (543.5 nm) sources. A 60×/1.4 oil immersion objective was used for the observations. GST Activity in Subcellular Fractions of Rat Hepatocytes— Many peripheral membrane proteins can easily be detached with mild treatments like increasing the ionic strength. As most standard procedures for the isolation of subcellular components include the use of buffered solutions, some of the electrostatic protein-membrane interactions occurring in intact cells may be lost. Thus, in our study on the cellular compartmentalization of GSTs, we used only an isotonic solution of sucrose (0.25 m) for homogenization of the liver, as well as for isolation of the subcellular components. In addition, we adopted a particular GST activity determination on intact organelles (see “Experimental Procedures”) that avoids inactivation caused by sonication steps or by detergent extractions. As shown in Table 1, crude nuclear, lysosomal, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions all contain GST activity. The highest activity was recovered in the nuclear pellet that contained an amount corresponding to about 15% of the overall cytosolic GST activity. Interestingly, about 50% of the GST activity of the fractions is lost when the subcellular components are isolated in isotonic saline solution (Table 1), suggesting that about half of the GST could be electrostatically bound. Because of the considerable amount of GST activity associated with the nuclear pellet, only this specific subcellular fraction was further studied and characterized.TABLE 1Subcellular localization of GST activity Activity measurements were done on intact organelles, isolated in pure sucrose (0.25 m) or in 0.1 m sucrose, 0.05 m KCl, and 0.04 m KH2PO4, pH 7.4, using the isotonic assay medium described under “Experimental Procedures.”Cell componentsGST (units/g tissue)SucroseSucrose + potassium phosphate bufferCytosol101 ± 8110 ± 10Nuclei16 ± 28 ± 2Mitochondria1.6 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.3Lysosomes2.9 ± 0.71.6 ± 0.2Microsomes4.2 ± 12.1 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab GST Activity in Hepatocyte Nuclear Pellet—The nuclear pellet from rat liver, isolated after homogenization in 0.25 m sucrose (1:10), was washed three times with 10 volumes of sucrose 0.25 m to remove any contamination of the cytosolic GSTs. Optical microscopy showed that the nuclei were intact. The nuclear pellet resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose contained a total of 16 GST units per g of tissue. After treatment of nuclei with 10 volumes of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer or 20 mm NaCl in the presence of 0.25 m sucrose, about 8 units were released into the surrounding solution, confirming the presence of GSTs electrostatically bound to the nuclei (weakly bound GST). No additional release was observed after increasing the concentration of the buffer up to 0.1 m. The remaining activity associated with the nuclear pellet, termed tightly bound GST (about 8 units), could only be partially extracted by multiple and prolonged incubations (1 h each) with 10 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer. Sonication treatment of the nuclear pellet or the use of detergents like Triton X-100 even at low concentrations (1%) caused partial and irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The use of concentrated carbonate did not increase the rate and extent of the extraction, indicating that the tightly bound GST did not behave like a peripheral protein (8Sandeep K. Prabou K.S. Reddy P.V. Gumpricht E. Hildenbrandt G.R. Scholz R.W. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 345-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely localization of the tightly bound GST is the nuclear interior, as indicated by confocal microscopy (see below). Further evidence of the presence of equivalent levels of GSTs associated with the nucleus was provided by EPR spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that the paramagnetic species DNDGIC binds tightly to Alpha and Mu GST with 1:1 stoichiometry, giving an EPR spectrum different from that of the free complex (30De Maria F. Pedersen J.Z. Caccuri A.M. Antonini G. Turella P. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42283-42293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Titration of GSTs with DNDGIC therefore allows quantification of GSTs. Experiments performed on nuclei isolated in 0.25 m sucrose or in saline solution are shown in Fig. 1 where the loss of activity because of the binding of DNDGIC is also reported. Starting from a rat liver of 10 g (51 mg of total GSTs), the weakly bound GST was about 5 mg and a similar amount was recovered as tightly bound GST. GSTA1-1 and GSTA2-2 Are Involved in the Nuclear Association—The extracts containing the solubilized weakly and tightly bound GSTs contain other proteins as well. In fact, they display specific activities of ∼3 units/mg that rise to 16 units/mg after glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE, performed after the affinity step, indicates that these samples have similar protein composition (Fig. 2A) with a main component at about 25 kDa and a minor component of 24 kDa (about 20%). The immunoblot in Fig. 2B shows that only the major component at 25 kDa cross-reacts with the anti-Alpha GST antibody, whereas neither the 25-kDa nor the 24-kDa component react with the anti-Mu GST antibody. The minor component, which neither belongs to the Alpha nor to the Mu class, has not yet been further analyzed. To identify the specific Alpha isoenzyme(s) involved in the weak and tight association, a simple reversed phase HPLC analysis was performed, according to the procedure described by Yeh et al. (1Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The weakly bound GSTs are mainly represented by GSTA1-1, GSTA2-2, and GSTA3-3, approximately with the same relative abundance as found in the cytosol. Conversely, the tightly bound GSTs are mainly represented by GSTA1-1 and GSTA3-3 (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3HPLC analysis. Tightly and weakly bound GSTs, extracted as reported under “Experimental Procedures,” were purified through affinity chromatography and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (1Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Identification of GST isoenzymes were made according to Ref. 1Yeh H.-I.

Upper panel, representative chromatogram of the cytosolic GSTs, previously purified through two subsequent affinity chromatography steps on glutathione-Sepharose matrix (21Simmons P.C.

Isoenzymes below 2% are not reported. The total amount of cytosolic GSTs is 5.1 mg/g liver. B, relative amounts of isoenzymes of the weakly bound GSTs. The total amount of the weakly bound GSTs is 0.5 mg/g liver, corresponding to 10% of the cytosolic GSTs. C, relative amounts of isoenzymes of the tightly bound GSTs. The amount of the tightly bound GSTs after partial extraction (60%) is 0.3 mg/g liver, corresponding to 6% of the cytosolic GSTs. The nomenclature used for rat GST isoenzymes is in accordance with the one proposed recently (20Mannervik B. Board P.G. Hayes J.D. Listowsky I. Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Percentages represent the mean of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct Observation of the Association of Alpha GSTs to the Nuclear Membrane—Direct evidence of intranuclear and perinuclear association of Alpha GSTs is provided by confocal fluorescence microscopy using an anti-Alpha GST antibody and a secondary fluorescent antibody. All nuclei display intense staining at the periphery but also inside the nuclei (Fig. 4A). NBDHEX, a specific fluorescent probe for Alpha GST, gives further confirmation. It has been demonstrated recently that this fluorescent compound, able to trigger apoptosis in human tumor cells, acts as a strong inhibitor of Alpha, Pi, and Mu GSTs by binding tightly to the active site of these enzymes (31Ricci G. De Maria F. Antonini G. Turella P. Bullo A. Stella L. Filomeni G. Federici G. Caccuri A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26397-26405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interaction of this compound with Mu and Pi GSTs causes a dramatic loss of its intrinsic fluorescence, whereas the fluorescence spectrum is almost unchanged when NBDHEX binds to Alpha GST (KD = 5.3 × 10-6 m) (31Ricci G. De Maria F. Antonini G. Turella P. Bullo A. Stella L. Filomeni G. Federici G. Caccuri A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26397-26405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Incubation of intact nuclei with 10 μm NBDHEX causes a distinct accumulation of fluorescence at the nuclear membrane and also faint fluorescence inside the nucleus (Fig. 4B). When the same experiment was performed with nuclei extensively washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, only faint intranuclear fluorescence was observed (not shown). Electrostatic Binding of Alpha GST to the Nuclear Membrane; Reality or Artifact?—The data reported above prove that a part of the intracellular GST pool is associated with the nucleus. However, they do not exclude the possibility that this association might not be present in the intact hepatocyte but is induced artificially by the homogenization in sucrose in the absence of buffer or other inorganic salts. Convincing evidence that this interaction really occurs in intact cells is achieved using NBDHEX as a fluorescent intracellular marker for Alpha GSTs. NBDHEX not only specifically labels GSTs but also accumulates in the cell within a few minutes (32Turella P. Filomeni G. Dupuis M.L. Ciriolo M. Molinari A. De Maria F. Tombesi M. Cianfriglia M. Federici G. R"
https://openalex.org/W2077603844,"To understand the biochemical basis for the function of the rotenone-insensitive internal NADH-quinone (Q) oxidoreductase (Ndi1), we have overexpressed mature Ndi1 in Escherichia coli membranes. The Ndi1 purified from the membranes contained one FAD and showed enzymatic activities comparable with the original Ndi1 isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When extracted with Triton X-100, the isolated Ndi1 did not contain Q. The Q-bound form was easily reconstituted by incubation of the Q-free Ndi1 enzyme with ubiquinone-6. We compared the properties of Q-bound Ndi1 enzyme with those of Q-free Ndi1 enzyme, with higher activity found in the Q-bound enzyme. Although both are inhibited by low concentrations of AC0–11 (IC50 = 0.2 μm), the inhibitory mode of AC0–11 on Q-bound Ndi1 was distinct from that of Q-free Ndi1. The bound Q was slowly released from Ndi1 by treatment with NADH or dithionite under anaerobic conditions. This release of Q was prevented when Ndi1 was kept in the reduced state by NADH. When Ndi1 was incorporated into bovine heart submitochondrial particles, the Q-bound form, but not the Q-free form, established the NADH-linked respiratory activity, which was insensitive to piericidin A but inhibited by KCN. Furthermore, Ndi1 produces H2O2 as isolated regardless of the presence of bound Q, and this H2O2 was eliminated when the Q-bound Ndi1, but not the Q-free Ndi1, was incorporated into submitochondrial particles. The data suggest that Ndi1 bears at least two distinct Q sites: one for bound Q and the other for catalytic Q. To understand the biochemical basis for the function of the rotenone-insensitive internal NADH-quinone (Q) oxidoreductase (Ndi1), we have overexpressed mature Ndi1 in Escherichia coli membranes. The Ndi1 purified from the membranes contained one FAD and showed enzymatic activities comparable with the original Ndi1 isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When extracted with Triton X-100, the isolated Ndi1 did not contain Q. The Q-bound form was easily reconstituted by incubation of the Q-free Ndi1 enzyme with ubiquinone-6. We compared the properties of Q-bound Ndi1 enzyme with those of Q-free Ndi1 enzyme, with higher activity found in the Q-bound enzyme. Although both are inhibited by low concentrations of AC0–11 (IC50 = 0.2 μm), the inhibitory mode of AC0–11 on Q-bound Ndi1 was distinct from that of Q-free Ndi1. The bound Q was slowly released from Ndi1 by treatment with NADH or dithionite under anaerobic conditions. This release of Q was prevented when Ndi1 was kept in the reduced state by NADH. When Ndi1 was incorporated into bovine heart submitochondrial particles, the Q-bound form, but not the Q-free form, established the NADH-linked respiratory activity, which was insensitive to piericidin A but inhibited by KCN. Furthermore, Ndi1 produces H2O2 as isolated regardless of the presence of bound Q, and this H2O2 was eliminated when the Q-bound Ndi1, but not the Q-free Ndi1, was incorporated into submitochondrial particles. The data suggest that Ndi1 bears at least two distinct Q sites: one for bound Q and the other for catalytic Q. Alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) 3The abbreviations used are: NDH-2, alternative NADH-quinone oxidoreductase; Ndi1, internal rotenone-insensitive NADH-quinone oxidoreductase from S. cerevisiae; complex I, mitochondrial proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase; DM, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Q, quinone; UQ, ubiquinone; MQ, menaquinone; SMP, submitochondrial particles; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. catalyze electron transfer from NADH to quinone (Q) without the energy transduction. NDH-2 is considered to be composed of a single polypeptide, houses FAD as a cofactor (1Yagi T. Di Bernardo S. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Kao M.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Zannoni D.

Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The NDH-2 enzymes are present in bacteria, plant, and fungal mitochondria but not in mammalian mitochondria. In bacteria, all NDH-2 enzymes known to date are located in the cytoplasmic phase. By contrast, plant and fungal mitochondria possess two types of NDH-2 enzymes (3Moller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar); one is directed to the matrix and catalyzes NADH oxidation in the matrix (designated the internal NADH dehydrogenase or Ndi), whereas the other faces the intermembrane space and oxidizes NADH in the cytoplasmic space (designated the external NADH dehydrogenases or Nde). The Ndi1 enzyme is similar to complex I in terms of NADH oxidation in the matrix (4Yagi T. Seo B.B. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Marella M. Barber-Singh J. Yamashita T. Kao M.C. Matsuno-Yagi A. Rejuvenation.

A series of studies in our laboratory suggest that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NDI1 gene may work as a therapeutic agent for mitochondrial diseases caused by complex I deficiencies (5Seo B.B.

In fact, the Ndi1 expression in the substantia nigra of mouse brains has protective effects against Parkinsonian symptoms caused by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment (12Seo B.B.

Recently, we illustrated that the expressed Ndi1 enzyme may play a dual role in rescuing complex I-deficient cells (15Seo B.B. Marella M. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6105-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); one is to restore the NADH oxidase activity, and the other is to decrease oxidative damage by complex I inhibition. It is important to clarify the mechanism of protective effects by the expressed Ndi1 against complex I deficiency. For this purpose, thorough biochemical studies of the isolated Ndi1 enzyme is a prerequisite. Although NDH-2 from several sources have been investigated, these studies provided only fragmental information about the structure and function of NDH-2 (1Yagi T. Di Bernardo S. Nakamaru-Ogiso E.

In our earlier work (23Kitajima-Ihara T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we overexpressed the T7 tag-fused mature Ndi1 enzyme in Escherichia coli membranes. Although we showed that the expressed Ndi1 works as a member of the respiratory chain of E. coli, the attempt to isolate the T7 tagfused mature Ndi1 enzyme in an active form was unsuccessful. In this paper, we report that we have successfully overexpressed Ndi1 in E. coli membranes using the N-terminal His10 tag fusion system and purified the functional enzyme. The purified recombinant Ndi1 has similar properties to the original Ndi1 enzyme isolated from S. cerevisiae mitochondria (24de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). When Triton X-100 was used for extraction of membranes, the purified Ndi1 contained no bound Q. The reconstitution of the Q-bound Ndi1 from the Q-free Ndi1 with Q was successful. From comparison studies between the Q-bound and Q-free Ndi1 enzymes, we demonstrate that the bound Q site is distinct from the Q catalytic site. Furthermore, possible roles of the bound Q in the Ndi1 are discussed. Materials—UQ1, UQ2, UQ6, and UQ10 were purchased from Sigma. AC0–11 was synthesized as described by Miyoshi et al. (25Miyoshi H. Takegami K. Sakamoto K. Mogi T. Iwamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was from Anatrace. Materials for PCR product purification, gel extraction, and plasmid preparation were from Qiagen. All of the chemicals were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Bovine heart mitochondria were kindly provided by Prof. Chang-An Yu (Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK), and bovine heart SMP were prepared according to Ref. 26Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar. Piericidin A1 was a generous gift from Prof. Dale. L. Boger (The Scripps Research Institute) (27Schnermann M.J. Romero F.A. Hwang I. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yagi T. Boger D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 11799-11807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning of the NDI1 Gene and Construction of Expression Plasmid—To obtain the NDI1 gene coding for the mature form of the protein, we designed two oligonucleotide primers. One was to generate a NdeI recognition site at the mature protein initiation codon: 5′-TAGTCAGATTCGCTTCCCATATGTCCACAGGGGTGG-3′ (the underlined bases were altered from S. cerevisiae DNA, and italic bases indicate the NdeI site). The other was to generate a XhoI recognition site downstream of the mature protein terminal codon: 5′-TTCCAGAAAAGGGCATGCTCGAGTCATCTATAATCC-3′ (the underlined bases were altered from S. cerevisiae DNA, and italic bases indicate the XhoI site). The NDI1 gene was amplified by PCR using pRVS2.3, which has a SalI/SmaI fragment containing the full-length NDI1 gene (23Kitajima-Ihara T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the two primers described above. The PCR product of the NDI1 gene was subcloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) plasmid and was verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI/XhoI. The NdeI/XhoI DNA fragment was finally ligated into the NdeI/XhoI site of pET16b, which is designed for expression of the N-terminal His10 tag-fused protein. The resulting plasmid was designated pET16b(NDI1-m). Expression and Purification of Ndi1—E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)pLysS was transformed with pET16b(NDI1-m). The optimum expression procedure of the His10 tag-fused mature Ndi1 enzyme was as follows. The cells were grown in 5 ml of 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for about 7–8 h with rotation at 250 rpm at 37 °C and were used to inoculate 500 ml of the same medium. The cells were grown at 250 rpm at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.8, and then 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture. The cells were cultured at 70–80 rpm at 35 °C for 10 h, collected by centrifugation at 5,400 × g for 10 min, and suspended at 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were then broken by sonication for 3 min at 50% duty cycle and two passages through a French pressure cell (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) at 16,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation at 4,300 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet (membrane fraction) was suspended at 5 mg of protein/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol (buffer A). After the addition of Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.3% (w/v), the sample was incubated for 30 min with slow stirring and centrifuged at 250,000 g for 60 min. The supernatant was applied onto a Ni-NTA column (about 1 ml of bed volume/25 mg of protein; Qiagen) and equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 15 mm histidine, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer A containing 0.02% Triton X-100 and 175 mm histidine. The active fraction was pooled and concentrated (Amicon-Ultra, molecular weight cut-off 30K; Millipore) to >10 mg of protein/ml. The concentrated Ndi1 enzyme was immediately applied onto a desalting column (Econo-Pac 10DG, 10 ml; Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Mops-KOH (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% Triton X-100, to prevent precipitation caused by high concentration of histidine. The desalted enzyme fraction was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. The Ndi1 enzyme devoid of Triton X-100 was prepared by two different methods. The first method was to replace Triton X-100 with DM in the above procedures. In this case, the yield of Ndi1 decreased severalfold because DM-extracted Ndi1 did not bind to the Ni-NTA column efficiently. To improve the low yield by the first method, the second method was introduced as follows. Triton X-100 was used until the step of loading Ndi1 on the Ni-NTA column as described above. In all the subsequent procedures including the washing and elution of the Ni-NTA column, DM in buffer A was used throughout. The yield of Ndi1 thus prepared was about the same as that obtained with Triton X-100. The Triton X-100-free sample was used for measurements of UV-visible absorption spectra. Enzyme Assays—NADH-UQ1 oxidoreductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring oxidation of NADH at 340 nm (ε = 6.2 mm–1 cm–1) at 30 °C. The reaction mixture (total, 0.5 ml) consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADH, 60 μm UQ1, and enzyme. The reaction was started by the addition of NADH or UQ1. Prior to the reaction, the enzyme was preincubated with the other substrate (UQ1 or NADH) for 1 min. For the NADH oxidase activity, UQ1 was omitted. Quantitation of Bound Quinones in the Purified Ndi1—The bound Q in the purified Ndi1 enzyme were determined according to Elias et al. (28Elias M.D. Nakamura S. Migita C.T. Miyoshi H. Toyama H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3078-3083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, a suspension containing ∼10 nmol of enzyme and 10 nmol UQ10 as an internal standard in 100 mm NaCl was treated with 10 volumes of ethanol and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. Two and a half volumes of n-hexane was added to the supernatant, and the suspension was vigorously mixed for 2 min by vortex. The upper phase was collected and dried under argon gas. The residue was dissolved in ethanol/methanol/acetonitrile (4:3:3 v/v/v) and applied to the reverse-phase HPLC column (Waters Spherisorb ODS2, 5 μ, 4.6 × 150 mm; Millipore) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25 °C. The elution was monitored at 214 nm, and the content (UQ6) was calculated from the peak area by comparison with authentic UQ6. The efficiency of extraction was also verified by the internal standard UQ10 in each measurement. Incorporation of UQ6 into the Purified Ndi1—The purified Ndi1 (30 μm) was mixed with 60 μm UQ6 in 50 mm Mops-KOH (pH 7.0) buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol for 5 min, and then 0.1% DM was added to the mixture to reduce nonspecific Q binding by Triton X-100 contained in the sample. The mixture was incubated for 10–12 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to the desalting column (Econo-Pac 10DG, 10 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer containing 0.02% DM. The eluted fraction was concentrated (Amicon-Ultra, molecular weight cut-off 30K; Millipore) to about 10 mg of protein/ml and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Reconstitution of NADH Oxidase Activity by Ndi1 and Bovine Heart SMP—First, SMP were suspended in an assay medium consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm MgCl2. Then the Ndi1 enzyme was added to the mixture. In less than 10 s after addition of the Ndi1 enzyme, the NADH oxidase activity measurement was started by NADH (100 μm). Short incubation of Ndi1 with SMP was required to exclude the possibility that the Q-free Ndi1 enzyme is associated with the bountiful Q in SMP and transformed to the Q-bound Ndi1 state. In the experiments in which inhibition of electron transfer of SMP is required, piericidin A1 (20 nm) or KCN (2 mm) was added before the Ndi1 addition. All of the procedures were performed at 30 °C. Detection of Superoxide and Hydrogen Peroxide—Production of superoxide radicals induced by NADH oxidase activity of Ndi1 was determined by the superoxide dismutase-sensitive acetylated cytochrome c reduction (29Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in 0.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm NADH, and 20 μm acetylated cytochrome c from horse heart (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 300 units/ml superoxide dismutase (from bovine erythrocytes; Sigma). Acetylated cytochrome c reduction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 550–540 nm (ε = 19.1 mm–1 cm–1) at 30 °C. The production of hydrogen peroxide coupled to NADH oxidase of the Ndi1 in the absence or presence of SMP was measured using a horseradish peroxidase-based scopoletin assay, which was modified from the horseradish peroxidase-based o-dianisidine assay (30Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10119-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The initial reaction was performed in the assay buffer for NADH-UQ1 oxidoreductase and NADH oxidase activity (see “Enzyme Assays”). After NADH was completely oxidized, an appropriate volume of sample (50–200 μl) from the initial solution was transferred to a new cuvette filled with the same buffer containing 7.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (type VI, sigma) and 5 mm scopoletin to a final volume of 1 ml. The fluorescence change of scopoletin (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 450 nm) was measured in a Spectra Max fluorescence spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) (31Loschen G. Flohe L. Chance B. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The concentration of hydrogen peroxide of the initial solution was determined from a standard curve (0.25–5 μm hydrogen peroxide, R2 = 0.999). Other Analytical Procedures—Protein concentration was determined by a Coomassie protein assay kit from Pierce (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). FAD content was determined according to Refs. 33Massey V. Swoboda B.E. Biochem. Z. 1963; 338: 474-484PubMed Google Scholar and 34Yagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by a modified method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Molecular mass of the purified Ndi1 was determined by HPLC with a gel filtration column (G3000WXL, Toso Hass) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min at 25 °C. The elution was monitored at 214 nm, and the apparent molecular mass of Ndi1 was calculated using a LMW gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). UV and visible absorption spectra were measured on an Olis DW2000 spectrophotometer. Anaerobic experiments were carried out in the Coy anaerobic chamber at room temperature. Any variations from the procedures and other details are described in the figure legends. Expression and Purification of Ndi1—When E. coli cells containing pET16b(NDI1-m) were grown aerobically (at 250 rpm), the expression level of the Ndi1 protein was detectable but significantly low. Lowering the rotation speed of the culture from 250 rpm to 70–80 rpm, after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, increased the expression level of Ndi1 5–10-fold. NADH oxidase activity of E. coli membranes was also increased several times, suggesting that the Ndi1 enzyme expressed in the E. coli membranes is functionally active. The inactivation during the purification process was completely protected by 10% glycerol. By using histidine instead of imidazole for the Ndi1 elution from the Ni-NTA column, we were able to prevent precipitation of the enzyme. Similar strategies were reported for purification of the His-tagged bc1 complex (36Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 mg of Ndi1 was yielded from 20 g of wet cells. The isolated Ndi1 protein exhibited a single band in the SDS gel (Fig. 1, inset). Molecular Properties of Purified Ndi1—The purified Ndi1 exhibited a sharp peak at 274 nm and two broad peaks at 383 and 448 nm (Fig. 1). The apparent molecular extinction coefficients of peaks at 383 and 448 nm were 9.85 and 9.26 (mm–1 cm–1), respectively. The visible absorption spectra of the expressed Ndi1 are consistent with those of Ndi1 isolated from S. cerevisiae mitochondria (24de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The peak at 448 nm was quenched by dithionite similar to authentic Ndi1 (24de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the expressed Ndi1 was determined to be 54 kDa by using the molecular exclusion column. This is close to the predicted molecular weight of 56,904, indicating that the expressed Ndi1 enzyme exists as a monomer. FAD content of the purified Ndi1 assessed by the heating method was 0.993 ± 0.019 mol/mol of protein. These results were confirmed by the trichloroacetic acid extraction method with SDS. The expressed Ndi1 enzyme bears one noncovalently bound FAD as a cofactor. It is known that UQ8 and MQ8 are major Q components in E. coli (37Shestopalov A.I. Bogachev A.V. Murtazina R.A. Viryasov M.B. Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We examined whether the purified Ndi1 contains Q and which Q if it does. The samples prepared by Triton X-100 extraction did not contain Q. In contrast, the Ndi1 extracted by DM exhibited detectable UQ and MQ peaks on HPLC with the same retention time as those of UQ8 and MQ8 extracted from the E. coli membranes. The UQ8 content of this preparation was estimated to be 0.17 mol of UQ8/mol of Ndi1. The MQ8 content could not be determined because of a lack of MQ standards. Because the isolated Ndi1 enzyme showed NADH-MQ reductase activity (24de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it was not surprising that MQ8 was associated with the expressed Ndi1 similar to UQ8. The observation that the Ndi1 houses bound Q is consistent with the previous reports for E. coli NDH-2 extracted with cholate (17Jaworowski A. Mayo G. Shaw D.C. Campbell H.D. Young I.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3621-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, there are known Q-bound enzymes, in which Triton X-100 extraction removed bound Q (28Elias M.D. Nakamura S.

Incorporation of UQ6 into the Purified Ndi1—Because the Ndi1 enzyme extracted by DM contained a substoichiometric amount of UQ8 and MQ8, we tried the incorporation of Q into purified Ndi1 extracted with Triton X-100 (Q-free Ndi1). We used UQ6, an authentic Q, in yeast mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 2, when the concentration of UQ6 was 60 μm, the ratio of bound UQ6/Ndi1 reached ∼1.1. This ratio was slightly increased at higher concentrations of UQ6. The slight increase of bound UQ6 appears to be due to nonspecific binding of UQ6 to detergent micelles that are present in the Ndi1 preparation. It should be noted that the experiments have been done with a high concentration (30 μm) of the Ndi1 enzyme. The results suggest that Ndi1 bears at least one Q-binding site. The Q-bound Ndi1 (1 mol/mol) prepared from the Q-free Ndi1 and UQ6 was subjected to UV-visible absorption spectrum analyses. As shown in curve c in Fig. 3, the difference spectrum between the Q-bound and Q-free Ndi1 clearly displayed a UQ peak with small splits (273, 283, and 290 nm). Although these splits in UV-visible absorption spectrum of the bound Q have never been reported as far as our present knowledge is concerned, it seems likely to be caused by the interaction between the bound UQ6 and Ndi1. Kinetic Analyses of the Q-bound and Q-free Ndi1—Our preparation extracted with Triton X-100 (Q-free Ndi1) has 2000 μmol of NADH oxidized/min/mg for NADH-UQ2 reductase activity, which is comparable with 1671 μmol of NADH oxidized/min/mg reported for the Ndi1 extracted with Triton X-100 from the yeast mitochondria under the same assay conditions (24de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The optimum pH of the enzyme activities of the expressed Ndi1 was found to be ∼6.5, which was similar to 6.2 of the Ndi1 isolated from yeast mitochondria. It is likely that our overexpressed Ndi1 enzyme in E. coli displayed similar characteristics to the authentic enzyme isolated from yeast mitochondria. To characterize the difference between the Q-bound and Q-free Ndi1, we measured the NADH-UQ1 reductase activity. For detailed analyses of kinetic parameters in this study, we used UQ1 as an electron acceptor instead of UQ2 and UQ6 for the following reasons. First, it is difficult to accurately measure NADH-UQ2 and NADH-UQ6 reductase activities because the assay traces were immediately curved. Second, use of UQ2 and UQ6 required the addition of detergents in the assay medium. As shown in Fig. 4, when Ndi1 was preincubated with UQ1 for 60 s and then NADH was added for assay start, there was no difference between the Q-bound and Q-free Ndi1. Similar results were reported for Q-bound and Q-free membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase with regard to preincubation of the enzyme with Q (28Elias M.D. Nakamura S. Migita C.T. Miyoshi H. Toyama H.

When the reaction was started by addition of Ndi1, the Q-bound Ndi1 showed higher activity than the Q-free Ndi1. When the reaction was started by the addition of Q but after preincubation with NADH (0–60 s), the NADH-UQ1 reductase activity of the Q-bound Ndi1 was decreased as the preincubation time was prolonged and reached the level of the Q-free Ndi1"

We investigated the molecular and structural basis of helix 12 mobility, as well as the involvement of individual residues with regard to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) constitutive and ligand-dependent transcriptional activity. Functional assays of the activity of PPARα helix 12 mutants were combined with free energy molecular dynamics simulations. The agreement between the results from these approaches allows us to make robust claims concerning the mechanisms that govern helix 12 functions. Our data support a model in which PPARα helix 12 transiently adopts a relatively stable active conformation even in the absence of a ligand. This conformation provides the interface for the recruitment of a coactivator and results in constitutive activity. The receptor agonists stabilize this conformation and increase PPARα transcription activation potential. Finally, we disclose important functions of residues in PPARα AF-2, which determine the positioning of helix 12 in the active conformation in the absence of a ligand. Substitution of these residues suppresses PPARα constitutive activity, without changing PPARα ligand-dependent activation potential.

The effect of PPARs on the expression of their target genes results from three events: recognition and binding of the receptor to response sequences in the promoter of the target genes, ligand binding, and co-repressor/co-activator exchange. Two regions exhibit a high degree of similarity in all members of the superfamily, namely the DNA binding domain, which is located toward the N terminus, and the ligand and cofactor binding domain (LBD). Ligand binding by the receptor is generally thought to be the trigger for transcriptional activation, but alternative mechanisms such as modulation of receptor activity by phosphorylation have also been reported (8Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Diradourian C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Particularly, PPARα shows a high constitutive activity, but the molecular basis and role in vivo of this activity are unclear (10Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A.

Among the synthetic ligands, the lipid-lowering drugs fibrates and the insulin sensitizers thiazolidinediones are PPARα and PPARγ agonists, respectively; these underscore the important role of PPARs as therapeutic targets. Besides its role in ligand binding and dimerization, the LBD is also the site of the major and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of the nuclear receptors, called the activation function 2 (AF-2) domain (16Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The PPAR LBD consists of 12 α helices forming the characteristic three-layer anti-parallel α-helical sandwich comprising a small four-stranded sheet, which delimitates a large Y-shaped hydrophobic pocket, the ligand binding cavity (16Renaud J.P.

It is thought that ligands activating PPARs stabilize the LBD in a relatively compact and rigid structure, in which helix 12, the dynamic part of the AF-2, is in a position that promotes binding of co-activator proteins and thus has a critical function in the stimulation of target genes (16Renaud J.P.

Muscat G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 700-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), helix 12 contains a core amino acid sequence motif ΦΦX(D/E)ΦΦ, with amphipathic α-helix properties, where Φ represents hydrophobic residues and X, in general, denotes residues with long hydrophilic, neutral, or polar side chains. The three PPAR subtypes possess a unique C-terminal sequence that includes two overlapping motifs within helix 12, both conforming to the AF-2 core consensus sequence (Fig. 1). Motif I ends four residues upstream of the C-terminal end of the protein, whereas motif II corresponds to the last six residues of the receptor. Because PPARs are therapeutic targets, it is important to understand the molecular basis of helix 12 constitutive and ligand-dependent dynamics, since this may provide valuable information with regard to drug design. In this report, we have analyzed the role of these C-terminal residues in PPARα activity using combined experimental mutant analyses and computational simulations. We have identified important residues for PPARα, which determine helix 12 regulation in its constitutive and ligand-dependent transcriptional activity. Based on these results, a detailed mechanistic description of the ligand-dependent role of helix 12 is proposed. Xenopus laevis PPARα mutants were obtained as described previously (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). HeLa cells cultured in 10% delipidated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) were transfected with pSG5 expression vectors containing full-length wild-type or mutant PPARα, and either CAT (ACO-A pBL-CAT8+ (30Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W.

PPARα agonist Wy-14,643 (Chem Syn Laboratories) was added 6 and 24 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen), cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing and were assayed for CAT or luciferase activity (Promega, Madison, WI). The GST-p3002–516 (31Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol.

Full-length PPARs were produced with reticulocyte lysates (TnT T7 quick translation/transcription system) and labeled with [35S]methionine. The GST-p300 fusion protein or the GST protein alone (3 μg each) were then incubated with 15 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysates in 500 μl of binding buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 25 mm, EDTA 1 mm, NaCl 100 mm, Triton X-100 0.1%, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.2 mm, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) supplemented with 0.5% dry milk, during 4 h at 4°C, in the presence or absence of the PPARα ligand Wy-14,643 at 100 μm. Beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and samples were boiled with 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 0.002% Bromphenol Blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to a phosphorimager (PhosphorImager, Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences).

The sequence identity is 90%. Default parameters of the homology modeling routine were used. The energy of the model was then minimized using the CHARMM program (36Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.

Based on the PPARα model mentioned above, a model of the PPARα/Wy-14,643 complex was built using the EADock evolutionary algorithm, taking account of the solvent effect. Details of the calculations are presented separately (45Grosdidier A. Zoete V. Michielin O. Proteins. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). Residues of the binding site were flexible during the docking to account for the inherent inaccuracy of coordinates in the PPARα model, and for the induced fit of the protein in the presence of the ligand. These include residues 247, 253, 257, 278–279, 281–283, 285–286, 320, 323–324, 327, 336, 338, 345, 360–361, 446, 450, and 470. The final conformations with the lowest energy were further minimized by 100 steps of steepest descent using the GB-MV2 (46Lee M.S. Salsbury Jr., F.R. Brooks III, C.L. J. Chem.

Chem. 2003; 24: 1348-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) generalized Born model. The lowest energy conformation was used for the following molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD Simulations—All simulations were performed using the CHARMM program (version c31b1) and the CHARMM22 force field. The starting structure of the R471L/D472N PPARα mutant was obtained from the structure of the wild-type protein by replacing the two native side chains by the mutated ones. MD simulations were performed on four systems, corresponding to the wild-type or mutated PPARα, in the presence (liganded) or in absence (unliganded) of the Wy-14,643 ligand. Each isolated system (no co-activator) was minimized using 250 steps of steepest descent minimization using the GBSW implicit solvent (48Im W. Lee M.S. Brooks 3rd., C.L. J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) to remove sterical clashes in the structural model. The protein (or complex) was solvated in a cubic box of 80.7 Å3 of TIP3P (49Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29504) Google Scholar) water molecules that were previously equilibrated at 300 K and 1 atm of pressure. The solvent was equilibrated at 300 K during 20 ps in the presence of the fixed protein. The entire system was then equilibrated at 300 K during 150 ps, in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (NPT) to adjust the solvent density at 1 atm. Finally, the production MD simulation was conducted during 1 ns in the canonical (isovolume isothermal, NVT) ensemble. The MD simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions. The Verlet leapfrog integrator was used for time propagation with a time step of 0.001 ps. A 12-Å cutoff was applied. Calculation of Side-chain Contributions to the Conformational Stability—To estimate the role of the residue side chains on the protein stability, we used the approach developed by V. Zoete and M. Meuwly (52Zoete V. Meuwly M. J. Comput. Chem. 2006; 27: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The method is based on the notion that the binding free energy (ΔGstab) corresponding to the alchemical complexation of a given side chain (considered as a “pseudo-ligand”) into the rest of the protein (considered as a “pseudo-receptor”) reflects the importance of this side chain to the thermodynamic stability of the protein (52Zoete V. Meuwly M. J. Comput. Chem. 2006; 27: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The binding free energy was estimated according to the MMGBSA approach, ⟨ΔGbind⟩=⟨EvdW⟩+⟨Eelec⟩+⟨ΔEintra⟩+⟨ΔGelec,desolv⟩+⟨ΔGnp,desolv⟩-T⟨ΔS⟩(Eq. 1) where the brackets, 〈 and 〉, indicate an average of these energy terms over 250 frames regularly extracted from the 1-ns MD simulation trajectory of the complex described above (one every 4 ps). Terms relative to a given isolated partner were also calculated using frames extracted from the MD simulation of the complex, after removing the other partner. This single trajectory method was found to lead to important cancellation of errors (53Zoete V. Meuwly M. Karplus M. Proteins. 2005; 61: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). EvdW and Eelec are the van der Waals and electrostatic pseudo-ligand:pseudo-receptor interaction energies, respectively. ΔEintra is the variation of the internal energy of both partners upon complexation. Because we use the single trajectory method, we have in fact ΔEintra = 0. ΔGelec,desolv and ΔGnp,desolv are the electrostatic and non-polar desolvation energies, respectively. ΔGelec,desolv is calculated according to the GB-MV2 generalized Born model. ΔGnp,desolv is assumed to be proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area that is buried upon complexation (54Amidon G.L. Yalkowsky S.H. Anik S.T. Valvani S.C. J. Phys.

We neglected the entropy term –TΔS. The binding free energy has been calculated for all side chains, except for proline residues. Actually, the role of a proline side chain on the protein stability, which may arise from the covalent bridge between the Cα and N atoms, is not expected to be assessed by the present method, which only takes account of the non-bonded interactions between the side chain and its environment. Integrity of Motifs I and II of PPARα Helix 12 Is Required for the Full Transcriptional Activity of the Receptor—Using X. laevis PPARα (PPARα) as a model (30Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar), we studied whether motifs I and II of helix 12 are both necessary for the function of the PPARs. Mutants were generated in which 1, 2, 4, or 12 C-terminal residues were deleted (Δ1, Δ2, Δ4, and Δ12, respectively). Of these, Δ1, Δ2, and Δ4 affected motif II residues, whereas Δ 12 affected the entire helix 12. The mutants were tested for their ability to activate a PPRE-driven reporter construct using transient transfections in HeLa cells in the presence or absence of Wy-14,643, a selective PPARα ligand (59Keller H. Devchand P.R. Perroud M. Wahli W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The mutations did not affect the ectopic expression level of these proteins relative to wt PPARα (data not shown). As expected, deletion of both motif I and II (Δ 12) resulted in total loss of transcriptional activity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, total loss of activity was also observed with mutant Δ4, which lacks motif II, suggesting that motif I on its own is unable to sustain transactivation. The integrity of motif II as a prerequisite for full transactivation was confirmed with mutants Δ1 and Δ2, which exhibited decreased transcriptional activity. These first experiments also confirmed that PPARα has a relatively high constitutive activity in the absence of any exogenous ligand (10Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A.

A PPARα deletion mutant lacking 84 N-terminal residues exhibited similar constitutive activity than the wt PPARα protein, suggesting that the contribution of AF-1 in this case is minor (data not shown). The requirement of an intact α-helical structure for the AF-2 function was further demonstrated by the site-directed substitution of either Arg-471 or Asp-472 with a Pro, a residue that would destabilize the PPARα helix 12 secondary structure (mutants R471P and D472P, respectively, Fig. 2B). Constitutive receptor activity was reduced in the R471P mutant and was totally absent in the D472P mutant, whereas neither mutant exhibited ligand-induced activity (Fig. 2B). To further investigate which residues are responsible for the transactivation properties of the receptor, point mutations on helix 12 residues were generated. The acidic residue centrally located within the AF-2 core motif of estrogen receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and retinoic acid receptor, was shown to be essential for the ligand-dependent activation function of these receptors (61Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 62Tone Y. Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol.

Therefore, we first targeted Glu at position 468 (motif I) and Asp-472 (motif II), which were replaced by Gln and Asn, respectively (E468Q and D472N). The E468Q mutant was totally inactive in the transactivation assay, in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 2B). The D472N mutation had a less dramatic effect, because the receptor retained 35% of the constitutive and 60% of the induced activity of the wt PPARα. One feature distinguishing motif II from motif I in all known PPARs is the presence of a positively charged residue, Arg or Lys, preceding the centrally located Asp residue (Fig. 1). Replacement of Arg-471 with Leu (R471L) resulted in a disproportionate decrease of the constitutive relative to the induced activity (Fig. 2C). The simultaneous substitution of residues Arg-471 and Asp-472 to Leu and Asn, respectively (R471L/D472N), resulted in further decrease in the ligand-dependent but in no cumulative decrease in the constitutive activity, compared with the single mutant D472N (Fig. 2C). The possibility that post-translational modifications affect the function of the AF-2 domain was examined by substituting Tyr-470, a potential target of phosphorylation by various kinases, with Phe (Y470F, Fig. 2B). This mutation resulted in a receptor retaining 80% of wt PPARα activity, indicating that phosphorylation of this residue, if it takes place, is not crucial for PPARα activity. Together, the above results suggest that the PPARα AF-2 function depends on the integrity of both motifs I and II and confirm the crucial role of the acidic residues Glu-468 (motif I) and Asp-472 (motif II). Point mutants were then designed according to the data obtained after free energy simulations of the wt PPARα LBD. As presented in detail later in this report, an in silico approach was used to determine the contribution of each residue in the LBD to the protein structural stability. It showed that in helix 12, Leu-466, Met-473, and Tyr-474 are associated with large negative ΔG value and that they most probably strongly stabilize the active conformation of the helix (Table 1). Each of these residues was mutated into the neutral residue Ala (L466A, M473A, and Y474A). A double mutation of the C-terminal residues Met-473 and Tyr-474 was also generated (M473A/Y474A), and the activity of these mutants was tested in the transactivation assay (Fig. 2D). Mutation of Leu-466 almost totally suppressed the activity of the receptor. M473A and Y474A retained 30 and 80% of wt activity, respectively. Interestingly, M473A/Y474A lost constitutive activity but retained 30% of the ligand-inducible activity, like the Δ2 deletion mutant. Transactivation assays thus confirmed the in silico prediction according to which Leu-466, Met-473, and Tyr-474 are important residues for the activity of the receptor. Taken together, all our mutagenesis results argue fo"

Extensive site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopic studies have associated D1-Asp170 more directly with binding of the first manganese involved in the assembly of the OEC (25Nixon P.J.

For example, Ala, Asn, and Ser mutations at this site raise the apparent dissociation constant (Km) 50–60-fold in manganese-depleted PSII core complexes, as measured by blockage by Mn2+ of charge recombination between QA− and the oxidized donor side (25Nixon P.J.

D1-Asp170 is shown in the x-ray crystallographic structure to coordinate Mn4, making this manganese, therefore, the most likely to be the first one bound in the assembly process.

Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) depicting this residue as bidentate, bridging Mn4 and Mn3. As a consequence of this assignment, substantial attention in this paper has been directed at mutations constructed at this site. Some reservations, however, have been voiced regarding the accuracy of the proposed structures because of reduction of the Mn4Ca cluster during the collection of the x-ray diffraction data (9Sproviero E.M.

Considering the resolution of the structures, and the fact that the x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K, it would seem unlikely that a displacement of the manganese-manganese distances of <1 Ä upon reduction (30Grabolle M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4580-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) would cause major reorganization of the relative locations of the coordinating residues. Therefore, residues D1-Asp170 and D1-Glu333, although far apart in the primary structure of the D1-polypeptide, are certainly located in close proximity in the fully assembled Mn4Ca cluster, even if they do not coordinate the same manganese. It is at present unclear at what stage of Mn4Ca cluster assembly the C terminus of D1 is folded to bring the two residues together. In this paper, experiments are described that examine a possible role for D1-Glu333 in the binding and oxidation of Mn2+ at the high affinity manganese binding site, implicated in the first step of cluster assembly. Mutations at this site are compared with others in the C-terminal region of D1. The reported observations are consistent with the C terminus of the D1-polypeptide, taking on a conformation close to that depicted in the x-ray crystal structure at the very first step of the assembly process. However, D1-Glu333 appears not to be more privileged than other coordinating D1-C-terminal carboxylate residues in facilitating the coordination of the first manganese. The glucose-tolerant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (31Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar) was used for construction of the site-directed mutants described in this paper. All strains were grown on BG-11 medium as described by Williams (31Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar) and Metz et al. (32Metz J.G. Nixon P.J. Rogner M. Brudvig G.W. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6960-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Five millimolar glucose was included in the medium to allow the propagation of mutants inactive in PSII. The site-directed mutations were constructed in psbA3 as described by Nixon and Diner (25Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) using a host strain (TD41) in which the psbA1,-2, and -3 genes had been previously deleted. Initial rates of oxygen evolution were measured on whole cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in saturating light (>610 nm) at 25 °C using a thermostated Hansatech oxygen electrode. The cells were suspended in BG-11 medium containing 5 mm glucose to which 0.3 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6 had been added. The concentration of chlorophyll present in the sample was determined spectroscopically by extracting the cell pigments by brief sonication in methanol and using an extinction coefficient of 79.24 ml mg-1 cm-1 at 665 nm (33Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9424) Google Scholar). Typical initial rates of oxygen evolution were 490 ± 36 μmol of O2 (mg Chl)-1 h-1 in strain TC35 (psbA1-, psbA2-, with a wild-type copy of psbA3). PSII core complexes were isolated from cells grown in 20-liter clear plastic carboys (Nalgene Labware). The isolation procedure was performed according to the combined methods of Tang and Diner (34Tang X.S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Rögner et al. (35Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in that order and stored at -80 °C until use. The passage of the core complexes through the hydroxylapatite column (SynChropak HAP-3, SynChrom Inc.) resulted in complete extraction of the Mn4Ca cluster (25Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Optical spectroscopy on PSII core complexes was performed using a flash detection spectrophotometer based on a design by Joliot et al. (36Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chem. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar) and described in Metz et al. (32Metz J.G. Nixon P.J. Rogner M. Brudvig G.W. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6960-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This instrument has 1-μs time resolution. Actinic flashes were provided either by a xenon flash (EG&G FX-199, 8-mm arc, 2-μs width at half-height) or a Cyanosure LFDL-3 dye laser using sulforhodomaine 640 dye (Exciton Inc., 1-μs width at half-height). The kinetics of charge recombination between QA− and the oxidized PSII donor side in the presence and absence of MnCl2 were followed at 325 nm (absorbance maximum of QA−−QA, (37Van Gorkom H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)) as previously described (25Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 38Diner B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 337-360Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using weak detecting flashes (EG&G FX-199U) rendered monochromatic by a Jobin Yvon HL300 monochromator. The kinetics of YZ· reduction in PSII core complexes, measured at different MnCl2 concentrations, were performed as described by Diner and Nixon (26Diner B.A. Nixon P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 134-138Google Scholar). All core complexes were suspended at a concentration of 10 μg/ml chlorophyll in 20 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.1), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 to 2 μm K3Fe(CN)6. The same instrument was also used for measurements in whole cells of the amplitude of and kinetics of relaxation of the relative quantum yield of chlorophyll fluorescence (25Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 38Diner B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 337-360Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This kinetic relaxation, following excitation with saturating actinic light flashes (EG&G FX-199), was monitored using weak detecting flashes (EG&G FX-199) rendered monochromatic by the HL300 monochromator at 422 nm. The filter sets used for the actinic flash and to protect the sample photodiode were the same as used previously (32Metz J.G. Nixon P.J. Rogner M. Brudvig G.W. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6960-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) except that the Schott LF550 was replaced by a Schott LF470. The same technique was used to determine the relative PSII reaction center concentration per cell, which is proportional to the total variable fluorescence yield at a fixed cell concentration. The variable fluorescence is the difference in the fluorescence yield measured at a given time point after actinic illumination minus the F0 level (QA oxidized) measured before actinic illumination. Prior to measurements of the evolution of the variable fluorescence following actinic flash illumination, Synechocystis cells at an optical density of 0.9 cm-1 at 730 nm were preincubated for 10 min in BG-11 plus 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.3 mm p-benzoquinone, and 0.3 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The preincubation in the dark was long enough to allow for complete oxidation of the primary and secondary quinone electron acceptors, QA and QB. To measure the kinetics of charge recombination between QA− and the oxidized donor side, 40 μm DCMU was added after the 10-min dark incubation, blocking oxidation of QA− by QB. A single saturating actinic flash was given ≥1 min later and the relaxation of the variable fluorescence yield followed as above. Further addition of 20 mm NH2OH provides a stable donor electron that acts in place of the Mn4Ca cluster, blocking charge recombination. A flash train of 20 saturating flashes (18 Hz) then results in the stable accumulation of QA−. The variable fluorescence yield measured under these conditions is a measure of the relative amounts of PSII on a per cell basis (39Chu H.-A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6137-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Physiological Characterization of Mutations—Site-directed mutant strains were constructed in psbA3 in the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 host strain TD41, as described by Nixon and Diner (25Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and contained one of each of the following mutations: D1-His332 was replaced by Leu; D1-Glu333 by Ala, Cys, Gln, and His; D1-Asp342 by Val; D1-Ala344 by a Stop codon; and D1-Ser345 by Pro. All of these strains lack PsbA1 and PsbA2. The wild type strains (TC31 and TC35), to which the mutant stains are compared, contain wild-type PsbA3 but lack PsbA1 and -2. TC31 and TC35 were derived from identical constructs and host strains. The site-directed mutants show depressed rates of oxygen evolution (Table 1) and are unable to grow photoautotrophically, with the exception of D1-E333Q that is very weakly photoautotrophic (this work and Ref. 40Chu H.-A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5859-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, the amounts of PSII core complex isolated biochemically from the D1-E333H, Ala, and Cys mutants were significantly lower from what could be isolated from wild type, consistent with reduced variable fluorescence yields observed in each case (see below).TABLE 1Comparison of WT and site-directed mutantsStrainPhotoautotrophic growthaDetermined in liquid growth medium or Petri plates in the absence of glucoseCells grown at 50 μE/m2s (2 μE/m2s)Km-overalldKm,overall is the concentration of Mn2+ that produces half-saturation of the blockage of charge recombination in previously manganese-depleted PSII core complexes (see Fig. 4)Km1;Km2eKm1;Km2 are apparent dissociation constants for Mn2+ in two-component hyperbolic fits of the charge recombination data (see Fig. 4)O2 rate per chlorophyllbInitial O2 rates measured in saturating lightRelative PSII centers per cellcEstimated from the total yield of variable chlorophyll fluorescence (Fmax – F0)% of WT% of WTμmμmWT (TC31, TC35)+100 (100)100 (100)0.30.044 (57%); 9.8 (43%)D1-H332L–0361.31.9 (90%)D1-E333Q+ (weak)29 (16)60 (43)2.50.16 (27%); 4.8 (73%,)D1-E333H–≤7 (≤5)27 (9)200.035 (29%); 44 (71%)D1-E333A–NDfND, not determined12NDNDD1-E333C–≤6 (0)10 (10)NDNDD1-D342V–0163.00.005 (11%); 3.5 (89%)D1-A344stop–040–573.44.3 (83%)D1-S345P–020–251.70.15 (34%); 4.1 (66%)a Determined in liquid growth medium or Petri plates in the absence of glucoseb Initial O2 rates measured in saturating lightc Estimated from the total yield of variable chlorophyll fluorescence (Fmax – F0)d Km,overall is the concentration of Mn2+ that produces half-saturation of the blockage of charge recombination in previously manganese-depleted PSII core complexes (see Fig. 4)e Km1;Km2 are apparent dissociation constants for Mn2+ in two-component hyperbolic fits of the charge recombination data (see Fig. 4)f ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Donor and Acceptor Side Electron Transfer—The fluorescence yield of chlorophyll in PSII depends upon the oxidation states of several redox cofactors. State P680PheoQA, competent for charge separation, shows a low quantum yield of fluorescence (F0). State P680PheoQA−, formed from P680PheoQA following charge separation and reduction of P680+, shows an elevated quantum yield of fluorescence (Fmax). The charge-separated state P680+Pheo−QA−, formed upon excitation of P680PheoQA−, is close in energy to the lowest singlet excited states of the primary donor and of the antenna chlorophylls. The consequent long-lived excited states, which reside for the most part in the antenna, are responsible for the elevated fluorescence yield. The state P680+Pheo−QA− formed following primary and secondary charge separation of photoexcited state P680*PheoQA is very much lower in energy than P680+Pheo−QA− and has a fluorescence yield close to F0. This is because P680+ quenches the fluorescence (41Butler W.L. Visser J.W.M. Simons H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Upon reduction of P680+, but prior to the oxidation of QA−, the fluorescence yield increases to Fmax (42Mauzerall D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Upon electron transfer from QA− to QB or QB− the fluorescence yield again decreases, with the rate of decrease tracking the kinetics of electron transfer between the quinones. In Synechocystis cells and under the conditions measured here, the relationship between the quantum yield of fluorescence (between F0 and Fmax) and the relative concentration of QA− is to a first approximation linear. Monitoring the variable fluorescence yield following each of a series of saturating flashes provides a measure of the relative concentration of PSII and of the intactness of the electron donor side of the PSII reaction center. The relative concentration of the PSII centers in the various mutants was obtained by pretreating cells with 0.3 mm p-benzoquinone and 0.3 mm K3Fe(CN)6 followed by illumination in the presence of 40 μm DCMU and 20 mm NH2OH, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown in Table 1 and show a substantial difference in the center concentration between the different D1-Glu333 mutants. Fig. 1A shows the variation in the quantum yield of fluorescence following each of a series (1.67 Hz) of five saturating actinic flashes given to whole cells of WT (TC35) Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, pretreated with 0.3 μm ferricyanide and 0.3 μm p-benzoquinone in BG-11 medium plus 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5). The presence of these oxidants assures that the acceptor side of the reaction center is initially in the QAQB state in the dark. The amplitude of the variable fluorescence yield measured at 100 μs after the first actinic flash for the Gln, His, and Cys mutants was determined to be 0.89, 0.45, and 0.40, respectively, compared with WT (TC35). The relative amplitudes of the variable fluorescence observed in Fig. 1 in the mutants were somewhat greater than those determined using NH2OH plus DCMU (Table 1) for reasons that may have to do with the influence of the intactness of the Mn4Ca cluster on the QA/QA− reduction potential (43Johnson G.N. Rutherford A.W. Krieger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 202-207Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which influences the kinetics of QA− oxidation. The variable fluorescence and the yields of PSII core complexes were consistently higher in the case of D1-E333Q than for D1-E333H and Cys for reasons that likely have to do with Gln being a better steric match to the wild-type Glu. The decay of the fluorescence yield, following each actinic flash in Fig. 1A, reflects the oxidation of QA− by QB ( QB−) in WT (TC35). These kinetic traces show a marked oscillation of period two, rapid on odd-numbered flashes and slow on even-numbered flashes. On odd-numbered flashes, QA−QB is generated an"
https://openalex.org/W1992349538,"Recent studies suggest that effector T cells generated by immune responses migrate to multiple non-lymphoid sites, even those without apparent expression of antigen or inflammation. To investigate the ability of distinct CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets to enter and persist in non-lymphoid, noninflamed compartments, we examined the migration and persistence of naïve, effector, and rested effector CD4+ T cells generated in vitro following transfer to nonimmunized adoptive hosts. Th1 and Th2 effectors migrated to both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs (peritoneum, fat pads, and lung). In contrast, rested effectors and naïve cells migrated only to lymphoid areas. Adhesion molecule expression, but not chemokine receptor expression, correlated with the ability to enter non-lymphoid sites. Donor cells persisted longer in lymphoid than in non-lymphoid sites. When hosts with naïve and memory donor cells were challenged with antigen, effectors developed in situ, which also migrated to non-lymphoid sites. Memory cells showed an accelerated shift to non-lymphoid migration, in keeping with memory effector formation. These results suggest that only recently activated effector T cells can disperse to non-lymphoid sites in the absence of antigen and inflammation, and as effectors return to rest, they lose this ability. These data also argue that memory cells in lymphoid sites are longer lived and not in equilibrium with those in non-lymphoid sites."

Gravin (aka AKAP250, AKAP12, and SSeCKS) is a 250-kDa AKAP displaying the ability to dock protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC), phosphoprotein phosphatases (such as PP2B), adaptor molecules, as well as a prominent member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (2Malbon C.C. Tao J. Wang H.Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gravin interacts with the β2AR primarily through a conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the scaffold, whose interaction with the cytoplasmic, C-terminal tail of this GPCR is enhanced by protein phosphorylation catalyzed by the PKA itself docked to the scaffold (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This receptor-scaffold interaction is obligate for resensitization and recycling of β2AR following classic agonist-induced desensitization and internalization (4Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y.

Gravin associates with the inner leaflet of the cell membrane through two types of domains, in addition to the RBD through which it interacts with a heptihelical GPCR (5Gelman I.H. Front.

Like the RBD-GPCR interaction that is dynamic and regulated by PKA phosphorylation, the cell membrane/positively charged domain-based interactions of gravin are dynamic, in this case readily reversible by increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ in the presence of calmodulin (8Tao J.

Far less is known about the docking of members of another major family of protein kinases, the tyrosine kinases, to AKAP scaffolds. Inhibitors of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src (e.g. PP2) as well as expression of dominant negative versions of Src have been shown to display complex effects of regulation of GPCRs (12Luttrell D.K.

As gravin has been shown to be a scaffold obligate for the resensitization/recycling of β2AR and Src has been shown to effect both the internalization and recycling arms of receptor trafficking, we test the hypothesis that the AKAP gravin acts as a scaffold for Src regulation of receptor trafficking. We show that Src docks to gravin through a class I ligand for the SH3 domain found in the far N terminus of the scaffold and that its docking and activation are essential for the ability of the AKAP to resensitize and recycle to the cell membrane β2AR that have been internalized in response to agonist-induced desensitization. HA-tagged Fusion Proteins—To isolate and quantify gravin and gravin fragments, fusion proteins with the hemagglutinin antigen (YPYDVPDYALV, HA) on the N terminus were created. The HA-tagged fusion proteins of full-length gravin, N-terminal-truncated, C-terminal-truncated, and other alanine-substituted gravin mutants were constructed as previously described (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and inserted into the expression vector pCDNA3. To generate HA-tagged gravin in which amino acids 1–51 are deleted (gravin Δ1–51), the sense primer was engineered to contain a 5′ NheI site and nucleotides encoding the HA tag followed by nucleotides corresponding to 154–174. The antisense primers synthesized correspond to the BamHI restriction site in gravin. The PCR products were subcloned into HA-gravin pcDNA3 between NheI and BamHI restriction sites. The proline to alanine substitution mutants of HA-gravin were engineered according to the standard protocol for PCR-mediated mutagenesis. All of the polymerase chain reactions were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The identity of the amplified sequences was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—Human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) from the ATCC collection were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Studies—For most studies, A431 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector harboring the cDNA or an HA-tagged protein. Cells were harvested and treated with a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min to promote cell lysis. After centrifugation of the cell debris at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 90 min, and subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with antibodies specific to Src itself (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or to the HA tag. The primary antibodies were linked covalently to a protein A/G-agarose matrix. Immune complexes were washed three times with immune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0), then denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide, Laemmli-type gels. Resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane (“blot”). The protein and/or peptide blots were stained with specific antibodies. The immune complexes were made visible by staining with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, in combination with the chemiluminescence reagent, and a brief autoradiography of Kodak X-Omat film. Purification of His-tagged Gravin Fragments by Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic Acid-Agarose Affinity Chromatography—To generate hexahistidine (His6)-tagged gravin-(1–231) or gravin-(50–231), primers were synthesized as described earlier (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Tao J. Shumay E. McLaughlin S. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23932-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Products from PCRs were subcloned into pET-28b(+) between NheI and BamHI restriction sites. His6-tagged gravin fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli by standard procedures. For purification of His6-tagged proteins, 1 ml of His-Bind resin (Novagen, San Diego, CA) was prepared for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography using a small disposable column containing resin pre-washed with 3 column volumes of water, 5 column volumes of 50 mm NiSO4, and 3 column volumes of the binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The solubilized proteins sample was applied to the column at 4 °C. The column was washed and then eluted with 10 ml of 60 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The eluted peptides were dialyzed in 2 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and later concentrated by use of a Thermo SpeedVac concentrator. Src Activity Assay—Src activity was assayed using a kit, following the protocol detailed by the commercial supplier (Upstate Biochemicals; Millipore). In each reaction, a 10-μl aliquot of total cell lysate or an immunoprecipitation sample of gravin was assayed for Src activity in the presence or absence of the Src family inhibitor PP2 (50 nm). The sample of cell lysates, immune precipitate, or gravin fragment were added to a final 30-μl reaction containing the Src/ATP mixture, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 150 μm of the Src kinase substrate (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK, amino acids 6–20 of p34cdc2). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated with 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid. A 25-μl aliquot of each reaction mixture was then spotted onto P81 paper blot. The assay blots were washed 5 times for 5 min each with 0.75% phosphoric acid, followed by a final, 3-min wash with acetone. The assay blots were air-dried and transferred to scintillation vials for counting. Knockdown of Gravin with Antisense Morpholinos— Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (morpholinos) were designed, synthesized, and purified to cell culture grade (Gene Tools, LLC). The morpholinos and protocol for knockdown (KD) of cellular gravin expression were optimized and reported earlier (3Tao J. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Tao J. Shumay E. McLaughlin S. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23932-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The extent of the suppression of gravin expression by antisense morpholinos in these studies was >75 ± 6.3%. The antisense morpholinos were designed to target the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA for native gravin and do not recognize gravin mRNA transcribed from the expression vector. Prior to their addition to A431 cell cultures, morpholinos were mixed in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) with EPEI special delivery solution (Gene Tools, LLC). Cells were treated with the anti-gravin morpholinos (5 μg/ml) for 3 days. Whole cell lysates of the morpholino-treated cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the resolved proteins were blotted and stained with anti-gravin antibody. Under standard conditions, morpholinos antisense for gravin suppressed the cellular level of the AKAP by more than 90% (8Tao J. Shumay E. McLaughlin S. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23932-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An additional treatment with morpholinos antisense to gravin was performed prior to transient transfection of the cells with either wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of gravin. The morpholinos are designed to suppress the expression of endogenous gravin, whereas not interfering with the gravin expressed through use of mammalian expression vectors. Following this protocol, cells were analyzed for β-adrenergic agonist-induced (i.e. Iso, 10 μm) desensitization and internalization of β2AR, as well as the recovery (i.e. resensitization and recycling of β2AR) after washout of agonist. Desensitization and Internalization of β2AR—Two days prior to the analysis of agonist-induced desensitization, the A431 cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 25,000–50,000 cells/well. Routinely cells were serum-starved overnight, prior to the analysis. Desensitization was accomplished by pretreating the cells with the β-adrenergic agonist Iso (10 μm) for 30 min. Under these conditions, subsequent β-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation is severely blunted (i.e. desensitized) and cell surface-localized β2AR is reduced precipitously by internalization (9Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Further details of the desensitization protocol employed herein as well as the assay of intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP are described elsewhere (4Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Analysis of β2AR Localization and Recycling to the Cell Membrane—The internalization of β2AR correlates well with the extent of agonist-induced desensitization observed by assay of intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP. Using radioligand equilibrium binding assays with A431 cells and a cell-impermeant, tritiated antagonist ([3H]CGP-12177), the complement of cell surface-localized β2ARs as well as internalized β2AR (by subtraction) was determined. Cultures of A431 cells were treated with Iso for 30 min (i.e. “desensitized and internalized”) or treated with Iso for 30 min then washed free of agonist for 60 min (i.e. “resensitized and recycle”). The cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the hydrophilic, membrane-impermeant β2-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 (70 nm). Binding was performed at 4 °C for 6 h. The cells then were diluted with cold buffer, collected on GF/C membranes at reduced pressure, and washed twice in rapid succession. The amount of radioligand bound to the washed cell mass collected on the filter provides a direct assay of the cell surface complement of receptors. The amount of bound ligand was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry (4Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Shih M. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21478-21483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The experiments were performed at least in triplicate. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for at least three separate experiments. Statistical significance (p value of ≤0.05) is denoted with an asterisk and is derived from comparison of experimental data with the respective controls by two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. The InStat statistics program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical computations. Src Docks to the N-terminal Region (1–200) of AKAP Gravin—Human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were employed in this investigation as these cells display 35,000–50,000 β2AR/cell and provide a well studied model of agonist-stimulated receptor desensitization and trafficking (23Delavier-Klutchko C. Hoebeke J. Strosberg A.D. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a hallmark of members of the superfamily of GPCRs (24Wang H.Y. Berrios M. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Earlier, it had been shown that inhibition of Src activity alters agonist-induced desensitization (15Fan G. Shumay E. Wang H.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24005-24014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas, little is known about a role of Src, if any, in resensitization and trafficking of GPCRs. We investigated first the effects of the Src family inhibitor 4-amine-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) on resensitization of desensitized, internalized β2AR, a process catalyzed by the AKAP gravin (Fig. 1). Cells were treated with β-adrenergic agonist for 30 min to stimulate β2AR internalization. The cells were washed free of agonist and allowed to recycle the internalized β2AR back to the cell membrane, a process that could be followed through equilibrium binding experiments with intact A431 cells and use of a radioligand [3H]CGP-12177, a cell-impermeant ligand able only to bind to those receptors accessible to the bulk solution, i.e. on the exterior of the cell membrane (Fig. 1). The amount of β2AR internalized within 30 min of Iso (10 μm) treatment was ∼50% (+ Isoproterenol) and the amount of β2AR that remains internalized 60 min following the washout of agonist (W60) was determined. Washout of agonist for 60 min provokes complete recovery of the internalized β2AR trafficking to the cell membrane. When cells are treated with the Src family inhibitor PP2 (50 nm), in contrast, the recycling of internalized β2AR is markedly attenuated, i.e. sequestered β2AR remains internalized. These data identify a critical role of Src in the recycling of agonist-internalized β2AR, a process known to be gravin-dependent. We searched the protein sequence of human gravin scanning for proline-rich sequences (PRS) to which a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain might bind. The putative ligands for SH3 domains are displayed along with several well characterized landmarks in gravin (Fig. 2A). Nine PRSs predicted to bind SH3 domains were identified. The nine PRSs are distributed throughout the molecule, the first found in the N terminus at 12PXXP15 and the ninth found at 1471PXXP1474, in close proximity to the highly conserved PKA RII subunit binding site (1540–1553) in the C terminus (residue 1783) of this AKAP. Any one or more of these nine PRSs may bind Src and play a role in Src-dependent recycling of internalized β2AR. To facilitate analysis of these putative SH3 binding domains, we expressed gravin and targeted fragments of gravin as fusion proteins tagged with the HA antigen. The HA tag enabled isolation and quantification of expression of full-length and mutant gravin fragments (Fig. 2B). Full-length HA-gravin and HA-gravin fragments were expressed in A431 cells, harvested from whole cell lysates of the clones, subjected to immune precipitation with anti-HA antibody followed by SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose blots, and stained with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2C). Staining of the blots with anti-HA antibody allows comparison of the relative levels of expression of HA-tagged gravin versus that of the gravin fragments. To test for Src binding to gravin-based complexes, we probed the immune complexes of gravin pulldowns (or pulldowns of gravin fragments) by anti-HA antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotting, and staining with anti-Src antibodies (Fig. 2C). Immune complexes of full-length HA-tagged gravin-(1–1783) stained positive for Src (Fig. 2C). Immune complexes obtained of each expressed gravin fragment that harbored the N terminus of the AKAP (e.g. 1–200, 1–365, 1–652, and 1–938) also stained positive for Src. Immune complexes of gravin fragments lacking the N terminus (e.g. 840–1782 and 554–938), in sharp contrast, displayed no positive staining for Src. We further refined the analysis of the N-terminal region, making use of additional deletions. This deletion analysis revealed that the Src binding domain of gravin occurs in the first 51 residues of the scaffold (Fig. 2C). Immune complexes of N-terminal truncates HA-(52–652) gravin and HA-(52–1782) gravin do not stain positive for Src, whereas those of HA-tagged gravin stain prominently for Src binding (Fig. 2C), focusing attention on the N-terminal PRSs of gravin-(1–51) as the site(s) of Src binding. Inspection of the protein sequence of the N-terminal 1–51 region of gravin reveals two PRS, both potential sites for Src binding (Fig. 3). The more N-terminal of the two sites with the sequence 10RXPXXP15 is a classic type 1 ligand for SH3 domains (25Li S.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Addition of a C-terminal Pro residue (Pro16) may influence the interaction with an SH3 domain (25Li S.S. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The second of the two N-terminal sites with the sequence 22PXXPXP27 may also dock an SH3 domain. The next PRS to be encountered is at 284PXXP287 and six more are found C-terminal in the 51–1783 primary sequence. The deletion of the gravin-(52–1783) region that harbors seven PRS did not alter the ability of the gravin to dock Src. If the results from the Src binding studies to gravin and its fragments are correct, either the loss (truncations) or mutagenesis of the N-terminal region harboring the two PRS should influence gravin biology. This premise was tested functionally using two independent assays of gravin function. The N-terminal Region (1–51) of AKAP Gravin Is Obligate for Gravin Function—Gravin has been shown to function primarily in the resensitization and recycling of desensitized, internalized β2AR (26Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To probe the functional role of the 1–51 N terminus of gravin, we measured in a time course the ability of a washout of agonist (Iso, 10 μm) to reverse the desensitization of the cyclic AMP response (Fig. 4A). In the control, Iso stimulates a maximal desensitization within 5 min, desensitization persists for 30 min. Following the washout of agonist, the amplitude of the desensitization declines by more than 70% within 30 min (W30, not shown) and declines by more than 90% within 60 min (W60, Fig. 4A). Next we sought to examine the resensitization response of A431 cells made deficient in gravin. Cells treated with morpholinos antisense to human gravin (targeting the 5′-untranslated region of gravin mRNA) for 3 days displayed a knockdown of more than 75% of the cellular complement of gravin (gravin KD, Fig. 4A). In the gravin-deficient cells, desensitization in response to Iso proceeded normally, whereas the resensitization of the cyclic AMP response to Iso was abolished, even following a 60-min washout (W60) of agonist, when recovery is normally complete. Transient transfection of the gravin KD cells with an expression vector harboring WT gravin (not susceptible to suppression by the antisense morpholinos) effectively rescues the resensitization response absent in gravin-deficient cells (Fig. 4A). In sharp contrast, if the gravin-deficient cells were transfected with the same expression vector harboring the Δ1–51 truncate of gravin, no such rescue was observed. These data suggest that unlike the case for the gravin, expression of the Δ1–51 gravin truncate is not able to rescue the resensitization of the β2AR in cells made deficient of gravin. Thus, KD of gravin by antisense morpholinos, like treatment with the Src family inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 1), blocks the resensitization of the desensitized β2AR (Fig. 4A). We tested further, using an independent assay, the conclusions derived from the analysis of β2AR resensitization, i.e. that the loss of the 1–51 N-terminal region of gravin abolishes the ability of the AKAP to support the resensitization response. To assess function as recovery (i.e. “recycling”) of agonist-internalized β2AR, we first treated cells with Iso (10 μm for 30 min; +Isoproterenol) to promote agonist-induced desensitization and internalization of β2AR (Fig. 4B). Cells made deficient of gravin (gravin KD) fail to display recycling of agonist-stimulated, internalized β2AR, as measured by radioligand binding experiments with the cell-impermeant β-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177, a radioligand that can access only cell surface-localized β2AR. β2AR internalized in response to β-adrenergic agonist is recycled back to the cell membrane within 60 min of a washout of the agonist (W60). At 60 min post-washout of Iso, gravin-KD cells failed to recycle internalized β2AR (Fig. 4B). The ability of expression of WT gravin versus that of the Δ1–51 mutant gravin to rescue the recycling of internalized β2AR that is absent in gravin-KD cells was investigated. Expression of gravin, b"

Of these proteins, one of the most robustly up-regulated (22-fold) was S100A4. The identity of the protein was verified by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis confirmed increased expression with increased tonicity, both acute and chronic. S100A4 protein expression was further confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis. Cells grown in isotonic conditions showed complete absence of immunostaining, whereas chronically adapted IMCD3 cells had uniform cytoplasmic localization. The protein is also regulated in vivo as in mouse kidney tissues S100A4 expression was many -fold greater in the papilla as compared with the cortex and increased further in the papilla upon 36 h of thirsting. Increased expression of S100A4 was also observed in the medulla and papilla, but not the cortex of a human kidney. Data from Affymetrix gene chip analysis and quantitative PCR also revealed increased S100A4 message in IMCD3 cells adapted to hypertonicity. The initial expression of message increased at 8-10 h following exposure to acute sublethal hypertonic stress (550 mosmol/kg H2O). Protein and message half-life in IMCD3 cells were 85.5 and 6.8 h, respectively. Increasing medium tonicity with NaCl, sucrose, mannitol, and choline chloride stimulated S100A4 expression, whereas urea did not. Silencing of S100A4 expression using a stable siRNA vector (pSM2; Open Biosystems) resulted in a 48-h delay in adaptation of IMCD3 cells under sublethal osmotic stress, suggesting S100A4 is involved in the osmoadaptive response. In summary, we describe the heretofore unrecognized up-regulation of a small calcium-binding protein, both in vitro and in vivo, whose absence profoundly delays osmoadaptation and slows cellular growth under hypertonic conditions. Proteomic analysis of Inner Medullary Collecting Duct (IMCD3) cells adapted to increasing levels of tonicity (300, 600, and 900 mosmol/kg H2O) by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed several proteins as yet unknown to be up-regulated in response to hypertonic stress.

In summary, we describe the heretofore unrecognized up-regulation of a small calcium-binding protein, both in vitro and in vivo, whose absence profoundly delays osmoadaptation and slows cellular growth under hypertonic conditions. The cells that inhabit the hypertonic environment of the inner medulla possess a number of adaptive mechanisms that allow them to survive this harsh environment. This survival is mediated initially by the activation of ion transport systems (1Chamberlin M.E. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C159-C173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thereafter by the cellular accumulation of a number of organic osmolytes (2Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly evident that in addition to the proteins required for the cellular uptake and/or synthesis of these osmolytes (transporters and enzymes), hypertonic stress brings about a coordinated response involving the up- and down-regulation of hundreds of genes (3Rivard C.J. Capasso J.M. Heasley L.E. Berl T. J. Am. Soc. Neph. 2003; 14: 56AGoogle Scholar, 4Tian W. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F388-F398Google Scholar), many of which may be critical to cell viability and adaptation. The use of genomic and proteomic tools, including gene arrays and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) 2The abbreviations used are: DIGE, difference gel electrophoresis; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; QPCR, quantitative PCR.2The abbreviations used are: DIGE, difference gel electrophoresis; IMCD, inner medullary collecting duct; QPCR, quantitative PCR. analysis allows for the discovery of proteins that heretofore were not attributed to the osmotic stress response in kidney tissues. A useful tool in this discovery process is the development of stable cell lines that are chronically adapted to increasing levels of hypertonicity. One such cell line, the Inner Medullary Collecting Duct (IMCD3) cells originally developed by Rauchman et al. (5Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been adapted to 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O and can be directly compared with cells grown at isotonic conditions and thereby provides an excellent model for genomic and proteomic changes in response to osmotic stress. Identification of perspective proteins that are involved in the osmotic response has been underway in our laboratory and has given rise to a large number of candidate proteins to study. One such heretofore unrecognized osmoregulated protein described in this report is S100A4, a 101-amino acid, calcium-binding protein with a molecular mass of ∼11.5 kDa, also known as metastasin or metastatic cell protein 1 (mts1), pEL-98, 18A2, p9Ka, CAPL, calvasculin, and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FspI), a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (6Garrett S.C. Varney K.M. Weber D.J. Bresnick A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In general, S100 proteins are small, acidic proteins of 9-14 kDa and contain two distinct EF-hands (7Marenholz I. Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 8Ravasi T. Hsu K. Goyette J. Schroder K. Yang Z. Rahimi F. Miranda L.P. Alewood P.F. Hume D.A. Geczy C. Genomics. 2004; 84: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Members of this family of proteins have been related to the intracellular- and extracellular Ca2+-dependent regulation of multiple activities such as calcium homeostasis, the dynamics of cytoskeleton components and myofilaments (F-actin, muscle and non-muscle myosin heavy chain, and non-muscle tropomyosin), cell proliferation and differentiation, mesenchymal morphology, cancer, protein phosphorylation, enzyme activities, the structural components of membranes, inflammation, and cell protection from oxidative stress (6Garrett S.C.

As a mediator of metastasis, S100A4 has been implicated in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (13Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin.

Nephrol. 2004; 15: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because S100A4 does not have known enzymatic activity, interaction with other proteins, both intracellular and extracellular, is functionally critical (6Garrett S.C. Varney K.M. Weber D.J.

S100A4 is expressed in normal tissues such as smooth muscle, liver, bone marrow, smooth muscle cell of arteries, kidney, and osteoblastic cells in rats and humans. However, the physiological functions of S100A4 in normal tissues have not been clarified yet (15Kato C. Kojima T. Komaki M. Mimori K. Duarte W.R. Takenaga K. Ishikawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

S100A4 has also been reported to prevent the phosphorylation of non-muscle myosin by protein kinase C (19Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Maitland N. Lomonosov M. Hansen K. Georgiev G.

Therefore, it is possible that S100A4 can regulate the function of cytoskeletal proteins or impinge on signal transduction pathways ultimately controlling cell movement or adhesion (26Li Z.H. Bresnick A.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this regard, Bustamante et al. (25Bustamante M. Roger F. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Martin P.Y.

Upon exposure to hypertonic stress with NaCl or sucrose, but not urea, the actin cytoskeleton of MTAL cells is reorganized. Although S100A4 has been shown to be present in kidney tissues and in chronic renal allograph dysfunction (8Ravasi T. Hsu K. Goyette J. Schroder K. Yang Z. Rahimi F. Miranda L.P. Alewood P.F.

The present work was undertaken to confirm the observations made by proteomic analysis and to further characterize the osmotic regulation of the protein as to timing, half-life, cellular distribution, in vivo effects, and possible physiologic role in osmoadaptation. Materials—Cell culture medium, serum, and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies to S100A4 were from Abcam (ab27957) and Covance (Berkeley, CA) (PRB-497P). Both manufacturers assert that this antibody is specific for the S100A4 protein and does not recognize other members of the S100 family. We also undertook studies to determine whether the antibody recognizes both the calcium-bound and free forms of S100A4 and found that it recognizes both equally. All other chemicals were UHP grade from Sigma. Cell Culture—The established murine inner medullary collecting duct cell line IMCD3 was previously provided by Dr. Steve Gullans (Boston, MA). Cell stocks were frozen in liquid N2 and propagated in 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). IMCD3 cultures chronically adapted to increasing levels of tonicity (i.e. 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O) were developed as previously described (29Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in the specified medium. In experiments involving acute hypertonic stress, the medium in culture dishes was exchanged for that with added NaCl or other solutes to the specified osmolality depending on the experiment. Osmolality was determined with an Advanced Instruments (Norwood, MA) Micro-Osmometer (model 3300). Cell Viability and Growth Experiments—Cell viability in tissue culture stress experiments was determined by cell counts following exposure to sublethal osmotic stress. Experiments were initiated once cells reached confluence at isotonic conditions in 24-well flat bottom tissue culture plates (35-3047; Falcon BD Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ), with each experimental time point after exposure to the sublethal osmotic stress performed in triplicate. In cell growth studies, cell counts were initiated when cultures had reached ∼90% confluence and followed for an additional 80-h period with counts at 24 and 48 h. Growth curves were fit to linear regression using the Prism 4.0 software and the slope of the curves compared for relative differences in growth rate. Cell counts were performed at the defined time point by removal of medium, after which the wells were washed vigorously with 2 ml of new medium and the medium removed and 1 ml of trypsin added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. An additional 1.5 ml of medium was then added to each well, the cells were resuspended, and a 20-μl aliquot of cell suspension was diluted 1:1 with Trypan Blue (Invitrogen). Viable cells that exclude Trypan Blue were counted using a hemocytometer (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Greater than 96% of the cells excluded Trypan Blue and were determined viable and could be successfully replated. Floating cells were determined to take up Trypan Blue (>94%) and did not reattach and grow when replated in fresh medium. Data from cell counts were similar to that obtained using the Cell Titer 96 assay (MTS reagent; Promega, Madison, WI), albeit with greater reproducibility. Cell Transfection—IMCD3 cultures were transfected with the pSM2 empty vector or the stable small interference RNA vector pSM2-S100A4 (v2MM_83072; Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Stable transfectants (clones) were selected from colonies growing in plates from a 10-fold dilution series in medium prepared with 10 μg/ml of puromycin antibiotic (Sigma). Clones were subjected to a second round of 10-fold dilutions and replated in puromycin medium and a second colony selection performed to provide clean clones for further analysis. Mouse Kidney Tissues—C57/B6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were subjected to food and ad libitum water or thirsted for 36 h. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Urine samples were collected from the bladder for osmolality analysis and kidneys removed and papilla and cortex tissues dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized using a glass tissue grinder on ice with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) lysis buffer and analyzed as previously described (29Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human Kidney Tissues—Human kidney tissues from cortex, medulla, and papilla were obtained under IRB COMIRB 05 and NIH Program Project Grant U19 A10636030 from a kidney that was not suitable for transplantation. Tissues were processed as described above. Confocal Microscopy—Cell cultures were grown on cover glasses and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3. They were then rinsed, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti-S100A4 antibodies (Abcam) that were detected with goat anti-rabbit antibodies labeled with Alexa 488 and counterstained with To-Pro nuclear stain. Cultures were observed with a Leica TCS SL confocal laser scanning microscope (Mannheim, Germany). Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics—Cultures of IMCD3 cells were cultivated from independent inocula in medium supplemented with NaCl at total osmotic concentrations of 300, 600, and 900 mosmol/kg H2O(n = 6 at each osmotic pressure). Each replicate was washed with isosmotic buffer, lysed with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% SDS with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor as described previously (30Blake C.A. Brown L.M. Duncan M.W. Hunsucker S.W. Helmke S.M. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2005; 230: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared from the lysates and subjected to DIGE as described previously (30Blake C.A. Brown L.M. Duncan M.W. Hunsucker S.W. Helmke S.M. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2005; 230: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed with DeCyder software (version 6.5; GE Healthcare) with false discovery rate correction enabled and individual p values generated from the multiple comparisons test of analysis of variance as implemented in the Extended Data Analysis module of that software. Initial identification of spots by mass spectrometry with a Voyager DE-STR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was by peptide mass fingerprinting (30Blake C.A. Brown L.M. Duncan M.W. Hunsucker S.W. Helmke S.M. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2005; 230: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The same trypsin digest was analyzed with a liquid chromatograph/mass selective detector (LC/MSD) XCT Ultra ion trap liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) with an Agilent 3.5-μm pore size reversed phase Zorbax brand C18-μm ID at 300 nl/min. RNA Preparation—Confluent culture plates were harvested by trypsinizing the cells followed by centrifugation to a cell pellet. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA content was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The integrity of the RNA preparation was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (model 2100). Reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA was prepared using the Omniscript kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene Arrays—The mouse gene array 430-2.0, which contains 43,000 transcripts (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), was employed. RNA transcription to cDNA biotinylated to cRNA, fragmentation, hybridization to the chip, and chip analysis using a HP Gene Array Scanner were according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and performed by the University of Colorado Gene Array Core. Gene array data were analyzed using both the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 and GeneSpring GX 7.3 Expression Analysis (Agilent Technologies) software analysis programs. Quantitative PCR (QPCR) Analysis—QPCR was performed using a MyICycler (Bio-Rad) with the Quantitech SYBR Green kit (Qiagen). Primer sets for specific genes were determined using Beacon Designer software (version 4.0; Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). Primers for QPCR for S100A4 were (forward) 5′-GCTGCCCAGATAAGGAACCC-3′, (reverse) 5′-TGCGAAGAAGCCAGAGTAAGG-3′ producing a product of 124 bp. QPCR cDNA samples were normalized to 18 S rRNA content using the following primers (forward) 5′-GCTCGCTCCTCTCCTACTTG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GCCTGCTGCCTTCCTTGG-3′, producing a product of 355 bp. QPCR runs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and melt curve to verify that the correct amplicon was produced. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared from confluent cell cultures in 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes as previously described (29Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Capasso J.M. Rivard C. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sample protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Depending on the experiment, from 25 to 150 μg of protein was loaded per lane for PAGE analysis. The primary antibody against S100A4 (mouse) was from Abcam. Gels were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody and Lumi-Phos reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Chemiluminescence was recorded with an Image Station 440CF and results analyzed with the 1D Image Software (Kodak Digital Science, Rochester, NY). Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). Data graphics and statistical analysis were performed using Instat (version 3.0) and Prism 4 (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Independent replicates for each data point (n) are identified in the figure legends. p values <0.05 were recognized as statistically significant. Proteomic Analysis of IMCD3 Cells Adapted to Hypertonicity—Analysis of the proteomic data revealed that in addition to aldose reductase (27-fold increase), the most up-regulated protein in cells adapted to hypertonicity was spot 3022, depicted in Fig. 1A (22-fold increase). This difference was highly significant (p = 8 × 10-14) for comparison of cells adapted to 900 mosmol/kg H2O and was 8.6-fold increased (p = 7 × 10-11) in cells adapted to 600 mosmol/kg H2Oas compared with isotonic controls (Fig. 1B). Peptide mass fingerprinting identified the protein in this spot as S100A4 calcium-binding protein, and this was further confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Fig. 1C). Peptide mass fingerprinting data indicated a significant score (66) for S100A4 with 5 peptides matching out of 22 submitted, representing 30% sequence coverage (root mean square error was 3 ppm). Image analysis of the gel indicated a protein mass of 10.3 kDa and pI of 5.0, in good agreement with published values for S100A4 protein of 11.7 kDa and a pI of 5.2. Genomic Analysis of S100A4 Expression in IMCD3 Cells Adapted to Hypertonicity—To complement the observation made in the proteomic analysis, we studied the expression of S100A4 message both by gene chip analysis (Affymetrix) and by QPCR. Data shown in Fig. 2 indicate very low levels of message in cells grown under isotonic conditions, with a substantial increase in message with adaptation of cells to increasing levels of tonicity. This pattern observed by gene chip analysis was more directly confirmed by QPCR. Although a further increment in message was not appreciated in the gene chip data when comparing expression in cells adapted to 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O, a marked increase was evident by QPCR. Western Blot Analysis of S100A4 in Cells Adapted to Hypertonicity and Acute Increments in Tonicity—Because antibodies to S100A4 are available, to confirm the observations obtained in the proteomic analysis we examined the expression of the protein in the adapted cells and extended it to study the response to acute increments in tonicity. As depicted in Fig. 3, although undetectable at isotonic conditions the protein is robustly expressed in adapted cells, further confirming the proteomic data. Of added interest is the time-dependent expression of the protein with acute sublethal osmotic stress at 24 h, further increased at 48 h. Expression of S100A4 in the Renal Cortex and Medulla from Rodents and Human Kidneys—To assess whether the changes seen in cultured cells are also observed in renal tissues, protein expression was examined in kidney tissues when mice were subjected to ad libitum water following thirsting for 36 h (urine osmolality increased from 1424 ± 211 to 3105 ± 524 mosmol/kg H2O, n = 6). Western blot data shown in Fig. 4A indicate minimal S100A4 protein expression in the cortex and substantial protein in the papilla. Furthermore, S100A4 protein expression increased 31.0 ± 4.2% (p < 0.01) in the papilla tissues upon thirsting animals for 36 h, with no substantial change in the cortex. Analysis of S100A4 protein expression in normal human kidney is shown in Fig. 4B for comparison and demonstrates the greatest expression in the hypertonic medulla followed by papilla tissues and essentially no protein expression in the isotonic cortex tissues. Immunocytochemical Localization of S100A4 in Cells Adapted to Hypertonicity—Immunocytochemical staining was undertaken to assess the localization of S100A4 protein in IMCD3 employing confocal microscopy. The upper panel of Fig. 5 demonstrates a complete lack of staining for cells grown under isotonic conditions, whereas a consistent high level of staining occurs in cells adapted to 900 mosmol/kg H2O(lower panel). Cells adapted to 600 mosmol/kg H2O demonstrate a somewhat intermediate level of staining. In all cases immunocytochemical staining for S100A4 occurred uniformly within the cytoplasm and without significant structural details. Kinetics of S100A4 Message and Protein Expression following Exposure to Hypertonicity—The onset of S100A4 message in IMCD3 cells subjected to acute sublethal osmotic stress was evaluated to determine whether the response is rapid or delayed. To this end we undertook QPCR measurements for message and Western blot analysis for protein at several time points following exposure to sublethal hypertonicity. Data shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate a significant increase in message only after 8-10 h of hypertonic stress (550 mosmol/kg H2O) with a maximum level of message after 16 h. S100A4 protein expression following acute sublethal osmotic stress is depicted in Fig. 7 with increasing protein levels determined over the 32-h analysis period. Analysis of half-life for S100A4 message and protein in IMCD3 cells is shown in Fig. 8. Data were curve fit for decay and the half-life calculated to be 6.8 and 85.5 h for S100A4 message and protein, respectively.FIGURE 7Effect of acute sublethal osmotic stress (550 mosmol/kg H2O) on S100A4 protein expression in IMCD3 cells.

We tested both the accessibility of residue 436 and the influence of its charge on single channel conductance (γ) by substituting Arg436 with Cys and examining the effect of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents on γ. Inclusion of positively charged 2-aminoethyl-MTS (MTSEA) within the electrode solution reduced γ of 5-HT3A(R436C) receptors in outside-out patches from 7.8 ± 0.5 to 5.0 ± 0.5 picosiemens (pS). To increase γ, we substituted Arg436 by Cys in the 5-HT3A(R432Q,R440A) mutant, yielding the 5-HT3A(QCA) construct with a γ of 17.7 ± 0.4 pS. Modification of 5-HT3A(QCA) receptors by MTSEA or 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl-MTS reduced γ to 8.7 ± 0.5 and 6.7 ± 0.4 pS, respectively, both significantly below that of channels exposed to nonpolar propyl-MTS. Extracellular MTSEA, but not 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl-MTS, crossed the membrane and in so doing slowly (τ = 94 s) reduced γ. MTSEA more rapidly (τ = 15 s) reduced the γ of 5-HT3A(QCA) receptors in inside-out patches, an effect reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol. Cys436 modification by negatively charged 2-carboxyethyl-MTS and 2-sulfonatoethyl-MTS increasedγ to 23 ± 1.0 and 26 ± 0.7 pS, respectively. MTS reagents did not affect γ values for 5-HT3A(QDA) constructs with Cys substituted for Lys431 predicted to be outside the entrance to the portals. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the dynamic modification of the charge of a cytoplasmic residue regulates γ, consistent with the existence of cytoplasmic portals that impose a rate-limiting barrier to ion conduction in Cys loop receptors.

Cys loop receptor subunits combine as pentamers forming a central ion pore that traverses the plasma membrane. Studies examining the role of residues comprising the pore-lining second transmembrane (TM2) helices of the nACh receptor led to the traditional view that this region of Cys loop receptors serves as the rate-limiting barrier to ion flux. Among the cation-selective Cys loop receptor subunits, conserved acidic residues influence unitary conductance (γ) by forming concentric rings of negative charge positioned along the vertical axis of the central pore (2Imoto K.

Although the role of residues within the TM2 helix of Cys loop receptors in controlling γ is well established, recent studies demonstrate a similar function for residues located in the large cytoplasmic TM3–4 loop (1Peters J.A.

Subsequent electrophysiological studies demonstrated that cytoplasmic residues within membrane-associated (MA) helices of the 5-HT3 and α4β2 nACh receptors are determinants of γ (3Kelley S.P.

Arg436 in the 5-HT3A subunit at a position termed MA 0′ is critical for maintaining the anomalously low γ (∼900 femtosiemens) that is a hallmark of the homomeric 5-HT3A receptor. Furthermore, introduction of MA 0′ Arg into α4β2 nACh receptors halved γ (4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol.

Although it is now clear that specific MA helix residues influence the γ of nACh and 5-HT3 receptors, it remains to be determined whether their charge plays a role. We used substituted cysteine modification to address this question, a method frequently used to determine whether residues are located within water-accessible regions of proteins (7Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents form disulfide bonds rapidly with accessible cysteine residues. Instead of examining accessibility per se, we used a series of MTS compounds with differing charges to examine how the properties of the modified cysteine residue, substituted at the 5-HT3A receptor MA 0′-position, influence γ. This approach is advantageous compared with systematic mutagenesis; basic amino acids are large compared with acidic residues; thus, charge and volume cannot be treated as separate variables. Cysteine modification by contrast enables alterations of charge while minimizing changes in side chain volume. Furthermore, the effect of sulfhydryl modification on γ can be observed in real time and reversed by administration of the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, thereby diminishing the likelihood that altered function is caused by gross changes in assembly and/or tertiary structure. Our results demonstrate that the dynamic modification of the charge of the MA 0′ Cys residue modulates the γ of the 5-HT3A receptor. 5-HT3A Constructs and Transfection of Subunit cDNAs—cDNAs encoding human wild type 5-HT3A and mutant constructs were cloned into pGW1. Point mutations were introduced into the 5-HT3A construct using standard molecular biological techniques, and all constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity. Transient transfection of HEK293 or tsA-201 cells with cDNA was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method or electroporation, respectively, as described previously (3Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured twice weekly and incubated in a medium composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and 10% calf serum, supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 (100% relative humidity). HEK293 cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight during the transfection and were washed after 16 h with medium. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Electrophysiology—Outside-out and inside-out patch configurations were used to record single channel currents from patches excised from transfected cells. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with NaOH). Patch electrodes in the outside-out configuration were filled with a solution comprising 130 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP (Mg2+ salt), and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH). The same bath solution was used for whole-cell current recordings, and electrodes contained 140 mm CsCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP (Mg2+ salt), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. 5-HT was dissolved in the bath solution and applied locally by pressure ejection to whole cells and outside-out patches held at –60 and –74 mV, respectively (the latter includes correction for a 14-mV liquid junction potential associated with the use of potassium gluconate). Inside-out patch electrodes were filled with the bath solution containing 5-HT (1 μm), and the electrode potential was clamped at +80 mV, corresponding to a holding potential of –80 mV. Stock solutions of MTS reagents (200 mm) obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada) were stored at –20 °C. Prior to each experiment, MTS reagents were diluted in the electrode solution (or in the extracellular solution in some experiments using MTSEA and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl-MTS (MTSET)) for outside-out patch experiments and in the bath solution for inside-out patch experiments to yield a final concentration of 200 μm. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments) and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. Data were digitized (Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments) at 10 kHz onto the hard drive of a PC for subsequent offline analysis. Sections of data recorded from outside-out patches ∼10 s in length, in which unitary events predominated were selected for analysis and leak-subtracted using Clampfit (pCLAMP 8.0; Axon Instruments) for the generation of all-points amplitude histograms using Fetchan (pCLAMP 8.0). Multiple Gaussian distributions were fitted (least squares minimization) to all-points amplitude histograms using the Simplex method within pSTAT (pCLAMP 8.0) and used to determine single channel current amplitude as described previously (4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Single channel conductance (γ) values are reported as the chord conductance determined from the relationship γ = i/(Vm – Erev), in which i is the current amplitude of single channel events, Vm is the holding potential, and Erev is the experimentally determined reversal potential. The onset of reduced 5-HT-activated single channel amplitude following local pressure application of MTSEA (200 μm) to inside-out patches was monitored by measuring the amplitudes of all unitary events individually using cursors in Clampfit. The recovery of single channel amplitude following the local pressure application of 100 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was similarly monitored. The time courses of channel amplitude attenuation by MTSEA and its reversal by DTT were determined by fitting each with an exponential function. To assess the influence of extracellularly applied MTSEA (200 μm) or MTSET (200 μm), single channel events recorded over 1-min epochs were used to construct amplitude histograms from which γ was derived. The rates at which extracellularly applied MTSEA modified the amplitudes of single channel and macroscopic currents, recorded from outside-out patches, and whole cells were determined by fitting single exponential functions to plots of mean current amplitude (recorded every 60 and 30 s, respectively) versus time. Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± either S.E. or S.D., as indicated. Data sets were routinely compared using one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey’s test. However, the paired t test was used to compare γ values obtained from inside-out and outside-out patch recordings before and after the addition of MTS reagents. Modeling the Structures of WT 5-HT3A and Mutant Receptors Using the 4 Ä Resolution Model of the T. marmorata nACh Receptor—Homology models were generated as previously described (4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, amino acid sequences for the human WT 5-HT3A, the 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436C,R440A), and the 5-HT3A(K431C,R432Q,R436D,R440A) subunits were aligned against the T. marmorata α, β, δ, and γ subunits using MultiAlign (available on the World Wide Web at prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html). Gaps between the template and query sequences in the extracellular domain were filled in with corresponding amino acids from the template sequence. The C termini of the query sequences were shorter than the templates and were filled in with amino acids from the template subunits. The structure of the T. marmorata nACh receptor was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 2BG9) and loaded into a Deepview Swiss-PdbViewer for imaging and modeling. Wild type 5-HT3A and 5-HT3A(QCA) query sequences were threaded onto the backbone of the nAChR model using the “Fit Raw Sequence” and “Alignment” features in Deepview. Models were then submitted to SwissModel (available on the World Wide Web at swissmodel.expasy. org) for optimization. Following energy minimization (Gromos96, SwissModel), structures were uploaded into Deepview for imaging. The subunit interface illustrated (Fig. 6) is equivalent to the T. marmorata 1′α-5′γ portal. The Protein Data Bank model of cysteine-MTSEA was imported from Spartan’04 (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA) and for illustrative purposes was manually aligned and positioned onto the cysteine residues of the 5-HT3A(QCA) and 5-HT3A(K431C,QDA) homology models. Amino Acid Volumes—We used Spartan’04 (Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA) to estimate all volumes to ensure consistency when comparing amino acids and cysteine residues modified by MTS reagents. Structures were energy-minimized in the extended chain conformation. The volumes of amino acids determined by Spartan’04 correlated well with those previously published by Zamyatnin (9Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1974; 24: 107-123Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A linear regression fitted to a plot of the amino acid volumes determined by Spartan’04 versus those published previously (9Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1974; 24: 107-123Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar) yielded a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.97 (data not shown). Substituted Cysteine Modification of Mutant 5-HT3A Receptors by Methanethiosulfonate Reagents—Wild type (WT) 5-HT3A subunits combine to form homopentameric receptors that have a γ below the resolution of single channel recording (3Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J.

Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The anomalously low γ (estimated by variance analysis to be ∼900 femtosiemens) derives from residues located in the MA stretch that form putative intracellular portals depicted in the ribbon rendering of the 5-HT3A receptor homology model (Fig. 1A). The γ of 5-HT3 receptor channels is enhanced to the resolvable range either by incorporation of the 5-HT3B subunit into heteropentameric 5-HT3A/B receptors (8Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 10Hanna M.C. Davies P.A. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or by replacing the 5-HT3A subunit MA helix 0′ Arg by Asp, the MA 0′ residue of the 5-HT3B subunit (4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The receptor assembled from human 5-HT3A subunits harboring the single point mutation R436D has a γ ∼ 10 times that of the WT receptor (4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The R436D substitution introduces both opposite charge and reduced side chain volume at the MA 0′-position, and it is unclear whether a favorable change in local electrostatic potential, reduced steric hindrance, both, or other factors contribute to the enhancement of γ. To address this issue, we used substituted cysteine modification to examine the γ of mutant receptors containing varying chemical entities at the MA 0′-position. We created 5-HT3A constructs in which Cys replaced Arg at the 436-position (Fig. 1A) and subsequently modified the physicochemical properties of the substituted residue with MTS compounds that react rapidly and specifically with thiolate groups (Fig. 1B). When examining the influence of charge, we utilized the MTS compounds: 2-aminoethyl-MTS (MTSEA), propyl-MTS (PMTS), 2-carboxyethyl-MTS (MTSCE), and 2-sulfonatoethyl-MTS (MTSES) with similar van der Waals volumes estimated in Spartan’04 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The estimated volumes of cysteines modified by these reagents were 173, 178, 185, and 196 Ä3, respectively (Table 1). Thus, such agents differ predominantly in the substituent attached to an ethanethiol chain (i.e. positively charged ammonium, neutral methyl, and negative carboxylate and sulfonate groups) (Table 1). We also utilized the larger quaternary ammonium compound MTSET. The estimated volume of cysteine modified by MTSET was 231 Ä3 (Table 1).TABLE 1MTS reagents affect the γ of 5-HT3A mutants with MA 0′ cysteine residuesConditionMTS reagent variable group: volumeaValues are calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”) volumes of a cysteine residue either unmodified (control) or modified by the indicated MTS reagent.Outside-out γInside-out QCA γR436DR436CQDAK431C,QDAQCApSpSControlUnmodified Cys: 108 Ä39.1 ± 0.6bIncludes values reported previously (4).7.8 ± 0.534.9 ± 1.6bIncludes values reported previously (4).42.4 ± 1.617.7 ± 0.417.5 ± 1.1MTSEA (ic)-S-CH2-CH2-NH3+: 173 Ä39.8 ± 0.95.0 ± 0.5cStatistical significance was determined by unpaired t-test, p < 0.01, compared with control.34.5 ± 0.938.9 ± 0.48.7 ± 0.5dStatistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test, p < 0.001, compared with untreated 5-HT3A (QCA).8.2 ± 0.4eStatistical significance was determined by paired t test, p < 0.001, compared with control.MTSEA (ec)NTNT31.8 ± 1.2NT8.5 ± 0.9dStatistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test, p < 0.001, compared with untreated 5-HT3A (QCA).NTMTSET (ic)-S-CH2-CH2-N(CH3)+: 231 Ä3NTNTNTNT6.7 ± 0.4fStatistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test, p < 0.001, compared with all other values in the QCA column.NTMTSET (ec)NTNTNTNT17.2 ± 0.8NTPMTS (ic)-S-CH2-CH2-CH3: 178 Ä3NTNT34.3 ± 1.3NT11.9 ± 0.4fStatistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test, p < 0.001, compared with all other values in the QCA column.NTMTSCE (ic)-S-CH2-CH2-COO-: 185 Ä3NTNT34.4 ± 0.3NT22.7 ± 1.0fStatistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test, p < 0.001, compared with all other values in the QCA column.NTMTSES (ic)-S-CH2-CH2-SO3-: 196 Ä3NTNT34.4 ± 0.341.7 ± 0.826.2 ± 0.7fStatistical significance was determined by analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s test, p < 0.001, compared with all other values in the QCA column.NTa Values are calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”) volumes of a cysteine residue either unmodified (control) or modified by the indicated MTS reagent.b Includes values reported previously (4Hales T.G.

Open table in a new tab MTSEA Reduces γ of the 5-HT3A(R436C) but Not the 5-HT3A(R436D) Mutant Receptor—The single amino acid substitution of the MA 0′ Arg by Cys in the mutant homomeric 5-HT3A(R436C) receptor increased γ to a level that could be directly observed in recordings from outside-out patches. The transient application of 5-HT (10 μm) to outside-out membrane patches clamped at –74 mV elicited rapidly rising inward currents from which unitary events with a mean γ of 7.8 ± 0.5 pS (Table 1) were discernable during current deactivation (Fig. 1C). Inclusion of MTSEA (200 μm) within the electrode solution, thus exposing the intracellular face of the membrane to the reagent, reduced the γ of unitary events mediated by the 5-HT3A(R436C) receptor to 5.0 ± 0.5 pS, a value close to the limit of resolution (Fig. 1D and Table 1). Since the γ of WT 5-HT3A receptors is too low to enable direct observation of unitary events (3Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), we used homomeric mutant 5-HT3A(R436D) receptors as a control to exclude potential effects of MTSEA that may occur independently of the substituted cysteine residue. MTSEA had no significant effect on the γ of events mediated by homomeric 5-HT3A(R436D) receptors, which was 9.1 ± 0.6 and 9.8 ± 0.9 pS in the absence and presence of the reagent, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, the reduction in γ of the 5-HT3A(R436C) receptor was caused specifically by modification of the substituted MA 0′ Cys. MTS Reagents Modulate γ of the Mutant 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436C,R440A) Receptor—In subsequent experiments, we employed a 5-HT3A(R432Q,R436C,R440A) construct, hereafter termed 5-HT3A(QCA), which we anticipated from our previous studies (3Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) would produce channels with a γ more amenable to the quantitative analysis of the modulatory effects of MTS reagents. In comparison with 5-HT3A(R436C), the γ of the 5-HT3A(QCA) construct determined from recordings performed on outside-out membrane patches was indeed substantially increased (17.7 ± 0.4 pS) (Fig. 2A and Table 1), although not to the extent found for the previously characterized 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor (4Hales T.G. Dunlop J.I. Deeb T.Z. Carland J.E. Kelley S.P. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which has a γ of 34.9 ± 1.6 pS (Fig. 2B and Table 1). MTSEA (200 μm) reacted with 5-HT3A(QCA) receptors, causing a substantial reduction in γ to 8.7 ± 0.5 pS (Fig. 2C and Table 1). The specificity of this effect was confirmed in parallel experiments performed on the 5-HT3A(QDA) receptor, the γ of which was unaffected by MTSEA (Fig. 2D and Table 1). MTSEA is sufficiently membrane-permeant to access residues engineered within a cytoplasmic region of the Shaker B K+ channel when applied to the extracellular aspect of the membrane (11Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacol. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether extracellular MTSEA could access the MA 0′ residue of the 5-HT3A(QCA) construct in excised outside-out patches. In such experiments, single channel events evoked by pressure-applied 5-HT (10 μm) were recorded prior to MTSEA application to obtain a control data set (Fig. 3, A and D). The subsequent addition of MTSEA (200 μm) to the perfusate caused an ∼50% reduction in γ (to 8.5 ± 0.9 pS, n = 6) within 2 min (Fig. 3, A and D). A single exponential function fitted to the onset of the reduction of the mean conductance by MTSEA yielded a τ = 94 s (fit not shown). The extent of the depression of γ was essentially identical to that caused by intracellular application of MTSEA at the same concentration (Fig. 3A and Table 1). A washout period of up to 20 min did not reverse the inhibition of γ by extracellularly applied MTSEA (data not shown). Furthermore, extracellular application of MTSEA did not decrease the γ of 5-HT3A(QDA) receptors in outside-out patches (γ = 31.8 ± 1.2, n = 6), confirming that the inhibition of γ observed with 5-HT3A(QCA) receptors is due to the specific reaction of MTSEA with MA 0′ Cys, rather than a rapid “flickery” nonselective pore block from the extracellular environment that could, in principle, yield the impression of a reduction in γ (Fig. 3, B and D). In parallel experiments, bath application of the membrane-impermeant compound MTSET (200 μm) (11Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacol. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) to 5-HT3A(QCA) receptors in excised outside-out patches had no influence upon γ (17.2 ± 0.8 pS, n = 6). However, in common with MTSEA, MTSET was clearly effective when applied to the intracellular aspect of the membrane, reducing γ to 6.7 ± 0.4 pS (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table 1). Extracellular MTSEA Crosses the Cell Membrane to Reduce 5-HT3A(QCA)-mediated Currents—MTSEA has a smaller volume than MTSET (Table 1); thus, it is possible that the former, but not the latter, is able to pass through the open channel of the 5-HT3A(QCA) receptor and modify Cys436 when applied to the extracellular aspect of an outside-out patch. Alternatively MTSEA, which exists in both charged and uncharged species (11Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacol. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), may access the cytoplasmic Cys436 residue by permeating the membrane, a route denied to MTSET, which is permanently charged and therefore membrane-impermeant. We performed whole-cell experiments to determine whether the inhibition of current by extracellularly applied MTSEA required activation of 5-HT3A(QCA) receptors, which would indicate a necessity for the reagent to pass through the open channel (Fig. 4). First, we applied 5-HT (30 μm) by local pressure ejection every 30 s throughout the cours"

Correlating the utilization of this high affinity binding site with genes exhibiting perturbed expression in <i>Hoxa13</i> mutant limbs, we identified that HOXA13 suppresses the expression of the BMP antagonist, <i>Sostdc1</i>. In the absence of HOXA13 function, <i>Sostdc1</i> is ectopically expressed in the distal limb, causing reduced expression of BMP-activated genes and decreased SMAD phosphorylation. Limb chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed HOXA13 binding at its high affinity site in two conserved <i>Sostdc1</i> regulatory sites <i>in vivo</i>. <i>In vitro</i>, HOXA13 represses gene expression through the <i>Sostdc1</i> high affinity binding sites in a dosage-dependent manner. Together, these findings confirm that the high affinity HOXA13 binding site deduced by quantitative analyses is used <i>in vivo</i> to facilitate HOXA13 target gene regulation, providing a critical advance toward understanding the molecular basis for defects associated with the loss of HOXA13 function."

The RC complex of purple bacteria consists of L, M, and H subunits and, in most species, a cytochrome subunit (3Lancaster C.R.D. Ermler U. Michel H. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 503-526Google Scholar). The L and M subunits form a heterodimer in the membrane and contain a special pair of bacteriochlorophylls, monomeric bacteriochlorophylls, bacteriopheophytins, an iron atom, and two quinones (3Lancaster C.R.D. Ermler U. Michel H. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 503-526Google Scholar). These cofactors are roughly aligned from the periplasmic side to the cytoplasmic side, in this order. The RC-bound cytochrome subunit protrudes into the periplasmic space and serves as the immediate electron donor to the photooxidized special pair. The three-dimensional structures of RCs determined in Blastochloris viridis (4Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar) and Thermochromatium tepidum (5Nogi T. Fathir I. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that the cytochrome subunit contains four c-type hemes aligned along the long axis of this subunit. The amino acid sequences of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit contain four heme-binding motifs (Cys-X-X-Cys-His) together with a methionine or a histidine residue as a possible 6th axial ligand to the heme iron (6Nagashima K.V.P. Sakuragi Y. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 349-355Crossref Google Scholar). Such molecular building blocks seem widely conserved, because these four heme-binding motifs have been reported even in green filamentous bacteria, Chloroflexus aurantiacus and Roseiflexus castenholzii, which are rather distant from purple bacteria (7Dracheva S. Williams J.C. Van Driessche G. Van Beeumen J.J. Blankenship R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11451-11458Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Yamada M. Zhang H. Hanada S. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1702-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, among purple bacteria themselves, in Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, the amino acid sequence of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit lacks one of the heme-binding motifs (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, the methionine 6th-axial-ligand to one of the hemes is replaced by a cysteine residue (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Alric J. Tsukatani Y. Yoshida M. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Hienerwadel R. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Nitschke W. Nagashima K.V.P. Vermeglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26090-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The missing heme in Rvu. sulfidophilum corresponds to the most distal heme from the special pair in tetraheme cytochromes, which has been shown to be the direct electron acceptor from the soluble electron carriers (11Knaff D.B. Willie A. Long J.E. Kriauciunas A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24108-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These unusual features observed for the cytochrome subunit in Rvu. sulfidophilum are conserved in all other Rhodovulum species (16Tsukatani Y. Matsuura K. Masuda S. Shimada K. Hiraishi A. Nagashima K.V.P. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this respect, Rhodovulum species may have a unique pathway of photosynthetic electron transfer through the unusual triheme cytochrome. The oxidized hemes in these tetra- or triheme subunits are re-reduced by soluble electron carriers (1Meyer T.E. Donohue T.J. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 725-745Google Scholar). Some purple bacteria, i.e. Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodospirillum rubrum, do not possess the RC-bound cytochrome subunit. In this case, the cytochrome c2 donates an electron directly to the photooxidized special pair (2Matsuura K. J. Plant Res. 1994; 107: 191-200Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 3Lancaster C.R.D. Ermler U. Michel H. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 503-526Google Scholar). Most photosynthetic species belonging to the α-subclass of purple bacteria use soluble cytochrome c2 as an electron carrier regardless of the presence or absence of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit. Indeed, a mutant of Rba. sphaeroides devoid of the cytochrome c2 cannot grow photosynthetically, which demonstrates that cytochrome c2 is an essential electron donor to the RC in this species (17Donohue T.J. McEwan A.G. Van Doren S. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a mutant of Rhodobacter capsulatus lacking the cytochrome c2 is capable of photosynthetic growth (18Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Rba. capsulatus synthesizes, in addition to the cytochrome c2, a membrane-bound cytochrome designated cytochrome cy that can serve as an electron donor to the RC (19Jenney F.E. Daldal F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rba. sphaeroides also synthesizes the membrane-bound cytochrome cy, although it does not work as a physiological electron donor to the RC (20Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proteins homologous to cytochrome cy have been reported in non-photosynthetic species of purple bacteria, Paracoccus denitrificans (21Turba A. Jetzek M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar) and Bradyrhizobium japonicum (22Bott M. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6766-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which work as an electron carrier between cytochrome bc1 and terminal oxidases. Rvu. sulfidophilum synthesizes cytochrome c2. Reconstitution experiments using the purified cytochrome c2 and the membranes of this bacterium showed that this cytochrome is a good electron donor to the RC-bound triheme cytochrome in Rvu. sulfidophilum (23Yoshida M. Masuda S. Nagashima K.V.P. Verméglio A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, a mutant lacking cytochrome c2 was able to grow photosynthetically with a doubling time nearly equal to that of the wild type, showing that another electron carrier participates in the photosynthetic electron transfer in Rvu. sulfidophilum (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A water-soluble c-type cytochrome, cytochrome c-549, was recently purified from this mutant as a candidate for an alternative electron transfer pathway (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments showed that the second-order rate constant for the electron transfer reaction from the cytochrome c-549 to the RC-bound cytochrome is about 7 times larger than that from the cytochrome c2, suggesting that the major electron donor to the RC in Rvu. sulfidophilum is this cytochrome, c-549 (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we report that a new membrane-bound cytochrome c, with a molecular mass of 50 kDa, is found in Rvu. sulfidophilum. This cytochrome serves as a physiological electron donor to the RC. The gene coding this cytochrome was cloned and sequenced. The analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that the soluble cytochrome c-549 originates from this membrane-bound cytochrome c. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the region containing a heme in the membrane-bound cytochrome c newly found in Rvu. sulfidophilum is closer to cytochrome c2 rather than cytochrome cy. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Rvu. sulfidophilum strains DSM 1374 (wild type) and C21 (a mutant in which the gene for the cytochrome c2 was disrupted (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) were used in this study. The cells were photosynthetically grown at 30 °C in screw-capped bottles filled with a PYS medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium succinate, 1% basal salt solution (25Nagashima K.V.P. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)) supplemented with 2% NaCl. Illumination was provided by 60 watt tungsten lamps (50 watt/m2). Preparation of Chromatophore Membranes Free from Soluble Proteins—Cells in a 1-liter culture of Rvu. sulfidophilum wild type were harvested by centrifugation at 6,800 × g for 20 min and washed with 400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The washed cells were sedimented by centrifugation and suspended in 60 ml of a solution containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm sucrose followed by an addition of 10 μm lysozyme. The cell suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to digest the cell wall and then mixed with 600 ml of 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), 2.4 m KCl, and 250 mm sucrose to remove periplasmic proteins. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 6,800 × g for 20 min and suspended in 50 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and a trace amount of DNase I. Spheroplasts were disrupted using a glass homogenizer. Membranes from spheroplasts were collected by the method of differential centrifugation as a sedimented fraction between 27,000 × g for 15 min and 193,000 × g for 60 min and suspended in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 100 mm KCl. Purification of Membrane-bound Cytochrome c—Cells of Rvu. sulfidophilum strain C21 were harvested by centrifugation at 6,800 × g and washed with a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 350 mm NaCl. Harvested cells were suspended in the same buffer and disrupted using a French pressure cell (1100 kg/cm2) after the addition of a trace amount of DNase I. The membranes were collected by the method of differential centrifugation as a sedimented fraction between 27,000 × g for 15 min and 193,000 × g for 60 min. The membranes were suspended in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 100 mm KCl to reach OD854 = 50 and incubated with 30 mm octylthioglucoside on ice for 20 min to solubilize the membrane-bound cytochrome c. The solubilized sample was dialyzed against the same buffer to remove octylthioglucoside and centrifuged at 19,300 × g for 60 min to remove aggregated proteins. The supernatant was applied to preparative PAGE. The buffer system was according to Davis (26Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15967) Google Scholar). A pink-colored band was excised from the gel and crushed by a glass homogenizer. Cytochrome c was extracted from the crushed gels using a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 100 mm KCl. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) with 15% polyacrylamide gel. Samples (membranes; 300 μg, purified proteins; 10 μg) were solubilized by the addition of 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min for membrane samples or at 100 °C for 3 min for purified proteins. A small amount of sodium ascorbate was added to the membrane samples to reduce cytochrome c. Heme staining was performed by the method of Thomas et al. (28Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing of the Gene Encoding the Membrane-bound Cytochrome c—The membrane-bound cytochrome c polypeptide separated by SDS-PAGE was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the polypeptide was determined by the method of automated Edman degradation. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, an oligonucleotide, which has a sequence of 5′-TCSAACAACTCSCAGAACCTNATCCGSCTN-3′, was designed and used as a probe to detect a gene for the membrane-bound cytochrome c. The oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′-end with digoxigenin-dUTP, as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science GmbH, Germany). The cosmid library constructed in our previous study (29Masuda S. Matsumoto Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Inoue K. Bauer C.E. Matsuura K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4205-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was screened against the probe. Cosmids showing positive signals were digested with EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes and cloned into pUC119 plasmids. A plasmid containing a ∼4.5-kb DNA fragment giving a positive signal was, thus, obtained. Sequencing of the inserted DNA was performed using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and a 310A Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides designed to generate overlapping DNA sequences were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The DNA sequences were analyzed using a DNASIS software package (Hitachi Soft, Yokohama, Japan). Mutant Construction—The 4.5-kb insert DNA described above was shortened into 1.8-kb DNA containing a full-length of the membrane-bound cytochrome gene by treatments with ApaI and HindIII endonucleases and self-ligation. A region containing the sequence for the heme-binding motif was then removed by digestions with SalI and SphI and ligation. The insert DNA was transferred into a suicide vector, pJPCm, a derivative of the plasmid pJP5603 (30Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), in which the kanamycin-resistance gene is replaced by a chloramphenicol-resistance gene derived from plasmid pHSG396. A DNA fragment containing a Kmr-marker gene and sacB-sacR genes was then inserted at the EcoRI restriction site in the multicloning site. The expression of the sacB-sacR genes is lethal for cells grown in the presence of sucrose (31Gay P. LeCoq D. Steinmetz M. Berkelman T. Kado C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 918-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was introduced into the cells of Rvu. sulfidophilum wild type and a mutant lacking cytochrome c2, strain C21 (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), by conjugal transfer from Escherichia coli S17-1 λpir host cells. First, Rvu. sulfidophilum cells growing on agar plates containing kanamycin were picked up as transformants keeping the plasmid in their genomic DNAs via a single crossover homologous recombination. After cultivation in a medium without kanamycin to allow a second homologous recombination, the cells were grown in a medium containing 15% sucrose. Cells tolerant to sucrose were selected and the deletion of the gene for the membrane-bound cytochrome was confirmed by Southern hybridization, PCR, and DNA sequencing. Spectroscopy—The flash-induced absorbance changes were recorded with a single beam (32Matsuura K. Shimada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 9-18Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and a double beam (33Schoepp B. Parot P. Menin L. Gaillard P. Richaud P. Verméglio A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11736-11742Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) spectrophotometers assembled in our laboratories. The absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-160 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mass Spectrometry—Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager Elite XL time-of-flight mass spectrometer with delayed extraction, operating with a pulsed nitrogen laser at 337 nm. Positive ion mass spectra were acquired using a linear, delayed extraction mode with an accelerating potential of 25 kV, a 90% grid potential, a 0.2% guide wire voltage, and a delay time of 200 ns for the recombinant p2. In a previous study, we showed that Rvu. sulfidophilum, grown under photoheterotrophic conditions, synthesizes at least three different water-soluble cytochrome c (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One of these cytochromes was identified as cytochrome c2, based on its redox property (Em = 358 mV) and amino acid sequence. Its apparent molecular mass resolved in SDS-PAGE analysis was 15 kDa. The other two cytochromes were named cytochrome c-549 (Em = 238 mV) and c-556 (Em = 73 mV) based on the wavelength maxima of their α-bands. Their apparent molecular masses were 25 kDa and 14 kDa, respectively (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have suggested that cytochrome c-549 is the major electron donor to the RC in Rvu. sulfidophilum on the basis of in vitro reconstitution experiments (24Masuda S. Tsukatani Y. Kimura Y. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11211-11217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, we have since noticed that the relative yield of the soluble cytochrome c-549 varies with the culture batch used for the preparation. Especially, cells grown to the mid-exponential phase contain a much smaller amount of cytochrome c-549 than other soluble cytochromes. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the heme-protein content of such intact cells was examined by SDS-PAGE and specific staining. Bands with apparent molecular masses around 30 and 46 kDa were assigned to the cytochrome c1 of the cytochrome bc1 complex and to the RC-bound cytochrome subunit, respectively, in agreement with a previous study (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An intense band attributable to both cytochrome c2 and cytochrome c-556 was detected at around 14 kDa. This band was very weak in mutant cells lacking cytochrome c2, reflecting the fact that the band is mainly derived from cytochrome c2 (data not shown). On the other hand, no heme staining was observed at around 25 kDa, where the contribution of cytochrome c-549 is expected. Even in experiments using cells grown over a stationary phase, we could not detect clear signals derived from cytochrome c-549 (data not shown). Instead, a large amount of unknown cytochrome c was detected at around 100 kDa. The absence of a significant amount of cytochrome c-549 led us to examine the possibility that a membrane-bound electron donor to the RC is involved in the Rvu. sulfidophilum photo-induced cyclic electron transfer. In a first set of experiments, membranes free from water-soluble proteins were prepared from the Rvu. sulfidophilum wild-type cells grown to the mid-exponential phase. The content in heme c was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and specific staining. As shown in Fig. 1, several bands with apparent molecular masses of around 30, 46, and 100 kDa were detected. A brown band with a high molecular mass (around 220 kDa) was probably derived from protein aggregates containing carotenoids. Presence of the cytochrome c1 and the RC-bound cytochrome was confirmed as 30- and 46-kDa bands, respectively. The difference of staining between the bands corresponding to cytochrome c1 and RC-bound cytochrome is caused by the presence of three hemes in the latter compared with one in the former. In addition, the purification procedure of the membranes may have induced a partial loss of bc1 complex (34Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Bahatyrova S. Frese R.N. Siebert C.A. John D. Olsen J.D. van der Werf K.O. van Grondelle R. Niederman R.A. Bullough P.A. Otto C. Hunter C.N. Nature. 2004; 430: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The lack of the 14-kDa band in the membrane prepared in this study demonstrates the total absence of periplasmic proteins. Two other bands with molecular masses of ∼100 kDa, which were also observed in the total cell extract, were still detected in this preparation, showing that these are membrane-bound cytochrome c. To examine whether or not the light-induced cyclic electron transfer in Rvu. sulfidophilum is maintained by solely membrane-bound components, we performed measurements of flash-induced absorbance changes on membranes prepared from the Rvu. sulfidophilum strain C21, a mutant lacking the cytochrome c2. As shown in Fig. 2, at an ambient redox potential (Eh) of 85 mV, where the high potential heme in the RC-bound cytochrome subunit and the cytochrome c1 in the bc1 complex are reduced prior to flash activation, the photo-oxidized cytochrome was rapidly re-reduced. Upon addition of myxothiazol, an inhibitor of the electron transfer from the quinol to the cytochrome bc1 complex, a large amount of cytochrome was rapidly photooxidized after the flash and remained in that state over several hundred milliseconds. The light-induced difference spectrum measured under this condition presented a peak at 552 nm. The strong effect of the addition of myxothiazol on the rate of re-reduction of the photooxidized cytochrome(s) demonstrates the occurrence of a photo-induced cyclic electron transfer between the RC and the cytochrome bc1 even in the absence of soluble cytochrome c2 and c-549. This is a strong argument for the connection by a membrane bound electron carrier between these two membranous components. We thought that the electron transfer from the bc1 complex to the RC resolved in the flash-induced kinetic measurements was mediated by membrane-bound cytochrome c with apparent molecular masses of ∼100 kDa in SDS-PAGE analysis. To examine this hypothesis, these cytochrome c were purified and characterized. Membranes were treated with a low concentration (30 mm) of octylthioglucoside. Then, the solubilized proteins were separated by preparative PAGE. A pink-colored band in the high molecular mass region, containing possible c-type cytochromes, was excised and extracted. Isolated proteins showed a single band at about 100 kDa in SDS-PAGE analysis when the protein was denatured at 100 °C for 3 min prior to loading (Fig. 3A, lane 1). However, when the treatment was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min, a band showing a mobility of 120 kDa was observed (Fig. 3A, lane 2), and, sometimes, two bands of 100 and 120 kDa were observed (data not shown). Although the reason that this cytochrome shows different mobility in SDS-PAGE according to the denaturing conditions was not further addressed in this study, we concluded that the two bands that resolved at around 100 kDa in the SDS-PAGE analysis of the membranes and cells (Fig. 1) are derived from the same cytochrome c. This cytochrome c was further analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (see Supplemental Data). The molecular mass was determined to be 50,429 Da, which is about half of the value estimated from the SDS-PAGE analysis. This large discrepancy will be discussed later, and this membrane-bound cytochrome c newly isolated from Rvu. sulfidophilum will be referred to as the 50-kDa cytochrome c in this article. The absorption spectrum of the membrane-bound 50-kDa cytochrome c reduced by ascorbate showed α, β and Soret absorption peaks at 550, 521, and 416 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B), as typically observed for c-type cytochromes. Fig. 3C shows the result of the redox titration of this cytochrome c obtained by plotting the height of the α-absorption band against Eh. The data were well fitted with a one-electron Nernst curve with Em of 369 mV. To confirm the electron transfer ability of the 50-kDa cytochrome c to the RC, reconstitution experiments with the membrane and the purified cytochrome were performed. The native membrane-bound cytochrome c was detached from the membrane by treatment with 0.04% Triton X-100. Fig. 4 shows the flash-induced absorbance changes of cytochrome c with or without the addition of the extra cytochrome c. The measurements were ca"
https://openalex.org/W1997845178,"In a 1991 editorial in The FASEB Journal, Robert W. Krauss commented on a recent report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program (Augustine report). He concluded that, although a manned mission to Mars with life sciences as the priority was endorsed by the Committee, it failed to deal realistically with one huge gap; biological sciences have never been given high priority. According to Krauss, this left a void that will cripple, perhaps fatally, any early effort to ensure long-term survival on any mission of extended duration. The gap included insufficient flight time for fundamental biological space research and insufficient funds. Krauss expressed his opinions 15 years ago. Have we better knowledge of space biology now? This question becomes more acute now that President George W. Bush recently proposed a manned return to the moon by 2015 or 2020, with the moon to become our staging post for manned missions to Mars. Will we be ready so soon? A review of the progress in the last 15 years suggests that we will not. Because of the Columbia disaster, flight opportunities for biological sciences in shuttle spacelabs and in Space Station laboratories compete with time for engineering problems and construction. Thus, research on gravity, radiation, and isolation loses out to problems deemed to be of higher priority. Radiation in deep space and graded gravity in space with on board centrifuges are areas that must be studied before we undertake prolonged space voyages. Very recent budgetary changes within National Aeronautics and Space Administration threaten to greatly reduce the fundamental space biology funds. Are we ready for a trip to Mars? Like Krauss 15 years ago, I think not for some time."
