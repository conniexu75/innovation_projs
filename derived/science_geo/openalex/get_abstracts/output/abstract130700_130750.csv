https://openalex.org/W2088915729,"A method combining laser ablation cluster formation and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth was developed for the synthesis of semiconductor nanowires. In this process, laser ablation was used to prepare nanometer-diameter catalyst clusters that define the size of wires produced by VLS growth. This approach was used to prepare bulk quantities of uniform single-crystal silicon and germanium nanowires with diameters of 6 to 20 and 3 to 9 nanometers, respectively, and lengths ranging from 1 to 30 micrometers. Studies carried out with different conditions and catalyst materials confirmed the central details of the growth mechanism and suggest that well-established phase diagrams can be used to predict rationally catalyst materials and growth conditions for the preparation of nanowires."

https://openalex.org/W2135011583,"The transduction of many cellular stimuli results in oscillations in the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (Ca 2+ ). Although information is thought to be encoded in the frequency of such oscillations, no frequency decoder has been identified. Rapid superfusion of immobilized Ca 2+ - and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in vitro showed that the enzyme can decode the frequency of Ca 2+ spikes into distinct amounts of kinase activity. The frequency response of CaM kinase II was modulated by several factors, including the amplitude and duration of individual spikes as well as the subunit composition and previous state of activation of the kinase. These features should provide specificity in the activation of this multifunctional enzyme by distinct cellular stimuli and may underlie its pivotal role in activity-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2005591501,"Several ion channels are reportedly redox responsive, but the molecular basis for the changes in activity is not known. The mechanism of nitric oxide action on the cardiac calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) (CRC) in canines was explored. This tetrameric channel contains approximately 84 free thiols and is S-nitrosylated in vivo. S-Nitrosylation of up to 12 sites (3 per CRC subunit) led to progressive channel activation that was reversed by denitrosylation. In contrast, oxidation of 20 to 24 thiols per CRC (5 or 6 per subunit) had no effect on channel function. Oxidation of additional thiols (or of another class of thiols) produced irreversible activation. The CRC thus appears to be regulated by poly-S-nitrosylation (multiple covalent attachments), whereas oxidation can lead to loss of control. These results reveal that ion channels can differentiate nitrosative from oxidative signals and indicate that the CRC is regulated by posttranslational chemical modification(s) of sulfurs."

The site lost 0.3 ± 0.5 metric ton of carbon per hectare per year (ton C ha −1 year −1 ) from 1994 to 1997, with a gain of 0.6 ± 0.2 ton C ha −1 year −1 in moss and wood offset by a loss of 0.8 ± 0.5 ton C ha −1 year −1 from the soil. The soil remained frozen most of the year, and the decomposition of organic matter in the soil increased 10-fold upon thawing. The stability of the soil carbon pool (∼150 tons C ha −1 ) appears sensitive to the depth and duration of thaw, and climatic changes that promote thaw are likely to cause a net efflux of carbon dioxide from the site."

The physiological function of these receptors in initiating transduction in olfactory receptor neurons remains to be established. Here, a recombinant adenovirus was used to drive expression of a particular receptor gene in an increased number of sensory neurons in the rat olfactory epithelium. Electrophysiological recording showed that increased expression of a single gene led to greater sensitivity to a small subset of odorants."
https://openalex.org/W2076718353,"We have used C-terminal domain mutants to further define the role of interactions of progelatinase A and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1 MMP) in the binding of TIMP2 and in the cell-associated activation of progelatinase A. Soluble constructs of MT1 MMP were used to demonstrate that binding with TIMP2 occurs primarily through N-terminal domain interactions, leaving the C-terminal domain free for interactions with progelatinase A. The rate of autolytic activation of progelatinase A initiated by MT1 MMP cleavage could be potentiated by concentration of the proenzyme by binding to heparin. Residues 568–631 of the progelatinase A C-terminal domain are important in formation of the heparin binding site, since replacement of this region with the corresponding stromelysin-1 sequence abolished binding to heparin and the potentiation of activation. The same region of gelatinase A was required for binding of latent and active enzyme to TIMP2, but residues 418–474 were not important. A similar pattern was seen using cell membrane-associated MT1 MMP; residues 568–631 were required for binding and activation of progelatinase A, whereas residues 418–474 were not. Neither region was required for activation in solution. The addition of TIMP2 to HT1080 membrane preparations expressing MT1 MMP, but depleted of endogenous TIMP2, resulted in potentiation of progelatinase A activation. This effect was dependent upon TIMP2 binding to MT1 MMP rather than at an independent membrane site. Together, the data suggest that TIMP2 forms a receptor with MT1 MMP that regulates the concentration and efficient generation of functionally active gelatinase A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activation of progelatinase A (MMP2) has proved particularly enigmatic since early studies indicated that it cannot be efficiently activated by plasmin, in contrast to other MMPs including stromelysin 1, collagenase 1, and gelatinase B (3Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Salvensen G. Nagase H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Treatment of progelatinase A with organomercurials initiates autolytic cleavages, leading to activation, as does proteolysis by either matrilysin or collagenase (4Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C.

At high concentrations, progelatinase A also self-activates in a process that is concentration-dependent, and the rate of activation can be enhanced by the presence of heparin at low ionic strength (7Crabbe T. Ioannou C. Docherty A.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Truncated forms of progelatinase A lacking the C-terminal domain are also activated by all the above mechanisms, but when no C-terminal domain is present, self-cleavages are not accelerated in the presence of heparin (7Crabbe T. Ioannou C. Docherty A.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This implies a role for the C-terminal domain in the concentration of proenzyme by binding to heparin.Searches for potential physiological activation mechanisms for progelatinase A have implicated a role for a membrane-mediated process involving certain types of activated cell (9Overall C.M.

Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This has led to the identification of the membrane-associated MT MMPs as potential mediators of progelatinase A activation (11Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar). Many laboratories noted that activation of progelatinase A at the cell surface requires the C-terminal domain of progelatinase A (8Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

It was shown that MT1 MMP expressed at the surface of cells lacks the propeptide and is largely associated with TIMP2 (17Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 18Imai K. Ohuchi E. Aoki T. Nomura H. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2707-2710PubMed Google Scholar). The TIMP2 has no inhibitory capacity, which is likely to be due to an interaction of the N-terminal domain with the catalytic domain of MT1 MMP. Progelatinase A can bind to TIMP2 by interactions between the C-terminal domain of the enzyme and the C-terminal three loops and charged tail of the inhibitor (19Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The problem has arisen as to how to unequivocally identify this mechanism of progelatinase A binding to the cell surface as a prerequisite for its efficient activation. Data suggest that TIMP2 is critical for the cellular activation process; too little and activation is compromised, but in the presence of excess TIMP2, there is no free MT1 MMP available to initiate progelatinase A activation. It has been clearly established, however, that MT1 MMP can cleave the propeptide of progelatinase A at Asn-Leu38, a process that is not inhibited by TIMP1 (15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The efficiency of this activation process depends upon the concentration of gelatinase A present, since this effects the final cleavage at Asn-Tyr81. Soluble forms of MT1 MMP have been prepared, and their ability to initiate this two step activation of progelatinase A has been confirmed (20Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 21Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In solution, this process is apparently not dependent upon TIMP2, which merely functions as an inhibitor if it is introduced into the system, nor does it require the presence of the C-terminal domain of progelatinase A. Since most cell-based studies of activation, namely propeptide processing, have been carried out using zymography as an assay, it is not clear to what extent functionally active gelatinase A is being generated. To resolve the differences in the data derived from the study of progelatinase A activation by membrane-associatedversus soluble MT1 MMP, we have addressed the questions of the precise kinetics and concentration dependence of these events. We have also assessed the role of the C-terminal domain of progelatinase A in both the activation process and TIMP2 binding to determine whether they are related.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A is required for binding of the proenzyme to TIMP2 (19Howard E.W. Banda M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17972-17977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G.

Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

The C-terminal domains of gelatinase A and stromelysin-1 show >50% identity, but in stromelysin-1 this region does not interact significantly with TIMP2 (22Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A mutant with the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A replaced with the corresponding region from stromelysin-1, N-GL.C-SL, was also not activated by cell membranes. 4M. Cockett and G. Murphy, unpublished observation. To localize more precisely the regions of the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A involved in TIMP2 binding and cellular activation, we constructed further subdomain-exchange mutants.The binding of TIMP2 to progelatinase A required the C-terminal region of both the inhibitor and proenzyme as demonstrated previously (8Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and substitution of the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A with that of stromelysin-1 abolished binding of proN-GL.C-SL to TIMP2. TIMP2 was able to bind to proN-G.C-SGG, where residues 418–474 of gelatinase A have been replaced with stromelysin-1 sequence, but was unable to bind to proN-G.C-SGS, where there is an additional replacement of residues 568–631. A similar effect of these C-terminal domain mutations was seen on the rate of association of TIMP2 with the active enzymes,i.e. only N-G.C-SGG showed a rate of binding to TIMP2 comparable to that for wild-type gelatinase A.Our results agree with those of Fridman et al. (33Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who made deletion mutants of gelatinase A (Δ426–631 and Δ455–631). The proform of these mutants did not bind TIMP2 and the active enzyme showed decreased inhibition by TIMP2. However, our domain-swap mutants not only preserve the C-terminal disulfide bond (data not shown), which is thought to be essential for integrity (16Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but also allow us to more precisely define the site of interaction with TIMP2. Our results suggest that the region between residue 568 and the C-terminal residue 631 is required for formation of the TIMP2 binding site, whereas residues 418–474 do not interact significantly with TIMP2. The x-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A predicts a disc-shaped four-bladed propeller (34Libson A.M. Gittis A.G. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Goldberg G.I. Lattman E.E. Nat.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The region implicated here (residues 568–631) consists of part of blade 3 and all of blade 4. Electrostatic interactions between the C-terminal domain of TIMP2 and that of gelatinase A are believed to be responsible for an initial docking, which aligns the inhibitory domain of TIMP2 with the catalytic domain of the enzymes, increasing the rate of inhibition (22Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W.

A surface patch of positively charged residues around lysine residues 566, 567, and 568 (the latter is replaced in mutant N-G.C-SGS by a serine residue) may be involved in binding TIMP2, in particular, the negatively charged C-terminal tail. Our immunolocalization studies support this proposal, since the binding of gelatinase A to cell-bound TIMP2 blocked binding of the anti-TIMP2 C-terminal peptide monoclonal antibody.We then compared the association of ΔTM MT1 MMP and MT1 MMPcat with TIMP2 and C-terminally truncated forms of TIMP2, to determine which interactions are likely to occur in vivo. The similarity of the association rates for all combinations of full-length and truncated proteins suggests that only N-terminal domain interactions occur between soluble MT1 MMP and TIMP2. Other evidence suggests that this interaction is important at the cell surface; binding of TIMP2 to HT1080 cell membranes is abolished by excess N-terminal domain of TIMP2, and the activation of progelatinase A is abolished by antibodies against the N-terminal domain of TIMP2 (17Strongin A.Y.

The role of the C-terminal domain of MT1 MMP is unclear; however, in vitro, it has been shown to be important for specific cleavage of type I collagen.2 This domain appears to be responsible for the binding of active ΔTM MT1 MMP to heparin.The data presented here suggest that interactions occur between the C-terminal domain of TIMP2 and the C-terminal domain of progelatinase A and between the N-terminal domain of MT1 MMP and the N-terminal domain of TIMP2. This is consistent with the theory that a ternary complex between MT1 MMP, TIMP2, and progelatinase A can form on the cell surface (17Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

Butler and G. Murphy, unpublished results. presumably due to the formation of a ternary complex as described by Kolkenbrock and colleagues (37Kolkenbrock H. Hecker-Kia A. Orgel D. Ruppitsch W.

In solution, the activation of progelatinase A and C-terminal domain mutants by APMA was virtually identical. This is in accordance with previous studies, which suggest that the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A is not involved in catalysis (16Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Nguyen Q. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G.

Similarly, progelatinase A and the mutants were activated equally well by soluble ΔTM MT1 MMP or MT1 MMPcat. Thus, in solution, the activation of progelatinase A by MT1 MMP does not require the C-terminal domain of the proenzyme or of MT1 MMP and is efficient even in the absence of TIMP2.The heparin binding site in the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A has not previously been identified (7Crabbe T. Ioannou C. Docherty A.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other than C-GLA and progelatinase A, N-G.C-SGG was the only mutant that bound to heparin-agarose, suggesting that N-G.C-SGG retains the heparin binding domain, whereas it is absent or non-functional in the other mutants, N-G.C-SGS, N-GLA, and N-GL.C-SL. Hence removal of gelatinase A residues 568–631 disrupts the heparin binding site. ΔTM MT1 MMP was previously purified on heparin-Sepharose (21Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar); in this study, pro and active ΔTM MT1 MMP bound to heparin-agarose, whereas active MT1 MMPcat did not. Hence, there appears to be a heparin binding site in the hemopexin domain of MT1 MMP. We have previously demonstrated that activation of progelatinase A by MT1 MMP is dependent upon the concentration of the proenzyme (32Butler G.S. Will H. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In vitro, the rate of activation of progelatinase A was also dependent upon the concentration of MT1 MMP. At low ratios of MT1 MMP:progelatinase A,e.g. 1:125, activation in solution was very slow, but as the MT1 MMP concentration was increased, the activation rate increased. The rate of activation of progelatinase A by MT1 MMP was increased by heparin. Although both ΔTM MT1 MMP and progelatinase A bind to heparin, experiments with MT1 MMPcat and proE375A-gelatinase A suggest that the major effect of heparin was exerted on the autolytic step. Hence, the two-step activation process described by Will et al. (20Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) is likely to be critically dependent upon the concentration and colocalization of both components.In contrast to the activation of progelatinase A and the C-terminal domain mutants in solution, there were differences when the mutant proenzymes were exposed to membrane preparations from NS0 or HT1080 cells displaying MT1 MMP. Wild-type progelatinase A and proN-G.C-SGG were efficiently activated by these membrane preparations, whereas the mutant proN-G.C-SGS was not. An identical amount of membranes from NS0 cells transfected with vector DNA did not activate any of the proenzymes, indicating a requirement for MT1 MMP for activation of progelatinase A. We have demonstrated by immunolocalization that TIMP2 is bound to CHO cells transiently expressing MT1 MMP, but not to those transfected with vector DNA alone, suggesting that TIMP2 binds to MT1 MMP in transiently expressing cells. Progelatinase A and proN-G.C-SGG, but not proN-G.C-SGS, can bind to CHO cells that are transfected with MT1 MMP, whereas none of the proenzymes bind to cells transfected with vector alone. The pattern of binding of the gelatinase A C-terminal domain mutants to CHO cells expressing MT1 MMP and their activation by NS0 and HT1080 cell membrane preparations containing MT1 MMP correspond to their propensity to bind to TIMP2, i.e. the region between residues 568 and 631 in gelatinase A is required, whereas residues 418–474 do not play a significant role. Thus, it is likely that the proenzymes are localized on the cell surface via TIMP2. These results indicate that, although TIMP2 in the HT1080 membranes was below the level of detection by Western blotting, sufficient TIMP2 remained to account for the differences in the efficiency of activation of the mutants. It is also possible that activation occurs in the absence of TIMP2 due to the presence of TIMP3 (which can bind to both MT1 MMP (20Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B Murphy G. J. Biol.

The integrin, αvβ3, has also been reported to act as a receptor for gelatinase A (41Brooks P.C. Strömblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P.

J. Messent, G. Murphy, and J. Gavrilović, unpublished observations. Progelatinase A binding to and activation by membrane preparations or cells that were transfected with vector DNA rather than MT1 MMP did not occur, suggesting that MT1 MMP is the only membrane protein required for the interaction with TIMP2 and progelatinase A. The involvement of both TIMP2 and MT1 MMP in the activation process is further substantiated by the potentiation of the activation of progelatinase A after the addition of TIMP2 to TIMP2-depleted membranes. The addition of increasing amounts of TIMP2 to a fixed concentration of MT1 MMP in a membrane preparation derived from HT1080 cells overexpressing MT1 MMP resulted in potentiation at low levels of TIMP2, but then inhibition of progelatinase A activation at the highest concentrations of TIMP2. We propose that this is due to the formation of additional receptors for progelatinase A composed of MT1 MMP and TIMP2 and that activation is inhibited when enough TIMP2 is added to bind and inhibit all the free MT1 MMP. Membranes from HT1080 cells transfected with vector alone did contain some endogenous MT1 MMP but the level was 10 times lower than the MT1 MMP overexpressing cells. Progelatinase A activation was inhibited in all cases by the same concentrations of TIMP2, which were able to potentiate activation in the membranes from cells transfected with MT1 MMP. Since the same concentrations of membrane proteins were present in each experiment, the difference in progelatinase A activation can be attributed directly to the difference in MT1 MMP concentration. (Δ128–194)TIMP2 was inhibitory at all concentrations, possibly reflecting its ability to inhibit MT1 MMP and active gelatinase A but its failure to form a progelatinase A “receptor.” Since the balance between the amount of “free” MT1 MMP and MT1 MMP·TIMP2 complex appeared to determine the degree of activation of gelatinase A, we carried out a further experiment where the level of free MT1 MMP remained constant and increasing levels of MT1 MMP membranes:TIMP2 were added. As expected, molar ratios of MT1 MMP:TIMP2 to free MT1 MMP up to 3:2 resulted in a potentiation of progelatinase A activation consistent with the idea of extra receptors being formed. As a consequence, more progelatinase A is concentrated in the vicinity of the free MT1 MMP; therefore, the two-step cleavage of progelatinase A, initiated by MT1 MMP (15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L.

When higher molar ratios of MT1 MMP membranes:TIMP2 were added to MT1 MMP, no potentiation was observed. In this case, many of these receptors may be distant from active MT1 MMP molecules so that an inactive ternary complex with progelatinase A persists; this is in accordance with the findings of Strongin et al.

The interaction of Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits with effectors initiates and accounts for the known signaling events mediated by GPCRs. Exposure of GPCRs to an agonist often results in rapid attenuation of receptor responsiveness, a process termed desensitization. Signal termination is initiated by phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors, mediated by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family (1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

First, it uncouples the receptor from its cognate G protein and thus leads to diminished receptor signaling (4Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) stimulate mitogenesis in part via mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. The mechanism of activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways by GPCRs is poorly understood, although it is becoming evident that signal transduction by certain GPCRs utilizes many of the same intermediates as those activated by RTKs (see Reaction 1).

Recruitment of mSos facilitates Ras GDP/GTP exchange leading to recruitment of Raf (MAP kinase kinase kinase) into complex with activated Ras.

Here we demonstrate that, unlike classical GPCR-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C which occurs entirely within the plasma membrane, MAP kinase activation involves GPCR sequestration. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation (14Oppermann M.

Cells were starved overnight in medium containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin prior to agonist stimulation. All assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Transient expression of β-arrestin1, β-arrestin1 V53D, dynamin, and dynamin K44A transfected plasmids were verified by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates using commercially available antibodies. The β2-AR sequestration was determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry (15Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Cells expressing epitope-tagged β2-AR at 300–400 fmol/mg of whole cell protein were exposed to 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition of antibodies. Sequestration is defined as the fraction of total cell surface receptors which are removed from the plasma membrane (and thus are not accessible to antibodies added to the cells) following agonist treatment. Cells were metabolically labeled with 1 μCi of [3H]adenine/ml, washed in PBS, and incubated with 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 25 min at 37 °C. Agonist was added for 5 min followed by the addition of 1 ml of stop solution (0.1 mm cAMP, 4 nCi of [14C]cAMP/ml, 2.5% perchloric acid). Cell lysates were neutralized with KOH, and total [3H]cAMP was assayed by anion exchange chromatography (14Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Cells were metabolically labeled for 16–18 h with 2 μCi of [3H]inositol/ml and washed in PBS containing 20 mm LiCl alone (basal) or with agonist for 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 0.8 m perchloric acid, and total inositol phosphates were assayed by anion exchange chromatography (14Oppermann M. Freedman N.J.

Agonist-treated cells were lysed by direct addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated MAP kinases on nitrocellulose filters were detected using a phosphospecific MAP kinase IgG (Promega). Bands corresponding to MAP kinase were visualized with enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by scanning laser densitometry. Agonist-treated HEK293 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) and clarified by centrifugation. Shc proteins were immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated Shc proteins on nitrocellulose were detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (RC20H, Transduction Laboratories), visualized with ECL, and quantitated by scanning laser densitometry. Lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer from cells treated with agonists for 5 min at 37 °C. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of anti-Raf-1 polyclonal antibody (C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were washed with cold RIPA, wash buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40), and kinase buffer (75 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 30 μm ATP). Raf-1 kinase activity was determined by incubating the resuspended immune complexes in kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [32P]ATP and 0.5 μg of MEK at ambient temperature for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the phosphorylated substrate bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Cells stimulated with or without 10 μm isoproterenol were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 5% (w/v) sucrose in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), and disrupted by Dounce homogenization (16Graham J.M. Dealtry G.B. Rickwood D. Cell Biology Labfax. Academic Press, New York1992Google Scholar). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded on a sucrose cushion (4 ml of 35% sucrose in buffer A) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The 35% (vesicle) sucrose interface fractions were collected, diluted with buffer A, and pelleted. The pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer; 25 μg for each protein sample was analyzed. The presence of clathrin and Raf was detected by protein immunoblotting. Clathrin was detected using a 1:500 dilution of a monoclonal anti-clathrin IgM (ICN), and Raf-1 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-Raf-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes on nitrocellulose were detected using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by ECL. Binding assays were performed exactly as described (17Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To determine the role of GPCR internalization in signal transduction we employed dominant suppressor mutants of β-arrestin1 and dynamin. Dominant suppressor β-arrestin1 (V53D) prevents GPCR targeting to clathrin-coated pits, while the dominant suppressor form of dynamin (K44A) inhibits fission of the budding vesicle from the plasma membrane (18McClure S.J. Robinson P.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Adepicts the effects of wild type and mutant β-arrestin1 and dynamin expression on β2-AR internalization. Whereas overexpression of the wild type β-arrestin1 protein increases isoproterenol-mediated internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) modestly, overexpression of wild type dynamin has no effect. In cells overexpressing the dominant suppressor forms of these proteins (β-arrestin1 V53D or dynamin K44A) a dramatic decrease in agonist-mediated internalization of the β2-AR is observed, in agreement with previous results (6Ferguson S.S.G.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The β-arrestin1 V53D mutant inhibits sequestration of the receptor by 50%, and the dynamin K44A mutant inhibits sequestration by 70%. As shown in Fig. 1 B, cells expressing β-arrestin1 V53D or dynamin K44A exhibit normal β2-AR coupling efficiency to Gs, as measured by the accumulation of intracellular cAMP. Similarly, coupling of the LPA receptor to Gi, as measured by the accumulation of intracellular inositol phosphates, was unaffected by expression of β-arrestin1 V53D or dynamin K44A proteins (Fig. 1 C). Thus, neither inhibitor of receptor sequestration significantly impaired classical receptor-G protein-effector-mediated generation of soluble second messengers. Stimulation of the endogenous receptors for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and isoproterenol (ISO; β2-AR) in HEK293 cells induces a 6- to 8-fold increase in phosphorylated MAP kinase (Erk1/2) levels (Fig. 2 A). Activation of MAP kinases by the β2-AR in HEK293 cells, like in Cos-7 cells (20Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), is c-Src- and Ras-dependent (21Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MAP kinase reflects the enzymatic activation of MEK (13van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Expression of β-arrestin1 V53D and dynamin K44A mutants impaired the ability of these receptors to activate MAP kinase (Fig. 2 A). β-Arrestin1 V53D inhibited LPA- and ISO-mediated phosphorylation of MAP kinase by 56% and 63%, respectively. Similarly, the dynamin K44A protein inhibited LPA- and ISO-stimulated phosphorylation of MAP kinase by 60% and 55%, respectively. Other known inhibitors of GPCR sequestration, concanavalin A, monodansylcadavarine, and low temperature (22Waldo G.L. Northup J.K. Perkins J.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13900-13908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hoffman J.F. Linderman J.J. Omann G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18394-18404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), all inhibited LPA- and isoproterenol-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation by approximately 70% (data not shown). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2 B, phorbol ester (PMA)-stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation in HEK293 cells, which is not receptor-mediated, is not affected by the presence of β-arrestin1 V53D or dynamin K44A proteins. Together, these data demonstrate that inhibition of receptor sequestration attenuates activation of MAP kinase without affecting early, plasma membrane-delimited, signaling events such as receptor coupling to G proteins. Signal transduction between receptors on the plasma membrane and MAP kinase in the cytosol requires a series of events leading first to the assembly of an activated Ras-Raf complex on the membrane, followed by initiation of the cytosolic MEK-MAP kinase cascade. To determine the point in the signaling cascade at which receptor internalization is required, we assayed the effects of β-arrestin1 V53D and dynamin K44A on two intermediate steps in the pathway: tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adaptor protein and activation of the Raf kinase. Activation of protein-tyrosine kinases by GPCRs and RTKs is obligatory for signal transduction to MAP kinases (8–13; see Reaction 1). Coincident with the increase in protein-tyrosine kinase activity is the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc, thought to play an important role in the nucleation and assembly of the multiprotein, Ras activation complex (11Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 12Luttrell L.M. DellaRocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, stimulation with LPA or isoproterenol results in an increase of 4.2- or 3-fold, respectively, in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc relative to unstimulated cells (Fig.3 A). Expression of neither β-arrestin1 V53D nor dynamin K44A proteins had any effect on LPA- or ISO-stimulated Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). Stimulation of the endogenous receptors for LPA or isoproterenol increases Raf-1 enzymatic activity 2-fold relative to unstimulated cells, in agreement with results reported recently in rat hepatocytes (25Spector M.S. Auer K.L. Jarvis W.D. Ishac E.J. Gao B. Kunos G. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3556-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In cells expressing β-arrestin1 V53D or dynamin K44A mutant proteins Raf-1 activity was similar to that in wild type cells following stimulation of these endogenous receptors (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the initial steps in the GPCR-mediated MAP kinase cascade, including tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptors and activation of Raf, are unaffected by inhibitors of receptor sequestration. These data demonstrate that the process of vesicle-mediated endocytosis is required for mitogenic signaling initiated by G protein-coupled receptors. Inhibition of endocytosis blocks phosphorylation of MAP kinase, but does not affect plasma membrane-delimited processes such as receptor coupling to G proteins, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, or Raf activation. Rather, inhibition of endocytosis impairs signal transduction between activated Ras-bound Raf and the cytosolic MEK kinase. Regulation of Raf kinase activity has been shown to be complex; dependent, in part, upon its translocation to the plasma membrane and binding to Ras and 14-3-3 proteins, serine and tyrosine phosphorylation, and oligomerization (26Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 27Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr, R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Our data suggest an additional mechanism for regulating the biological actions of Raf; targeting the activated form of the enzyme to an intracellular compartment wherein its substrate, MEK, resides. Since both β-arrestin V53D and dynamin K44A exert their inhibitory effects downstream of Raf, why does inhibition of receptorinternalization (by β-arrestin V53D) impair the mitogenic signaling cascade initiated by the GPCRs? A likely possibility is that the agonist-occupied, β-arrestin-bound receptor actually comprises part of a multicomponent signaling complex, assembled at the plasma membrane, which includes not only the receptor, but also various intermediates in the pathway up to and including Raf. Stimulation of HEK293 cells with isoproterenol results in the internalization of 25–35% of the receptor into a vesicular compartment (17Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In addition, agonist treatment induces recruitment of soluble clathrin onto the plasma membrane where it forms cage-like structures that enclose a membrane vesicle (18McClure S.J. Robinson P.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Following fission of the vesicle from the plasma membrane, clathrin rapidly dissociates from the internalized vesicle into the cytosolic compartment. Fig.4 shows the agonist-mediated translocation of β2-AR (4.2-fold), clathrin (3.7-fold), and Raf (2.4-fold) proteins to the internalized vesicles. These data support the notion that agonist stimulates the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex, including Raf, which is internalized by the clathrin-coated vesicle pathway. These results, however, do not exclude the possibility that Raf internalization, independent of receptor, is required for signal transduction. A high degree of parallelism exists among GPCR- and RTK-mediated mitogenic signal transduction pathways to MAP kinases. Both receptor types utilize many of the same intermediates in this signaling cascade (13van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Recently, inhibition of TrkA (nerve growth factor receptor) internalization was found to block the nerve growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB (28Riccio A. Pierchala B.A. Ciarallo C.L. Ginty D.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Likewise, in endocytosis-defective HeLa cells, epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase Cγ is unaffected, but phosphorylation of MAP kinase is impaired (29Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate yet another emerging analogy between RTKs and GPCRs in mitogenic signal transduction, a requirement for receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits.

The left planum temporale was significantly larger in 94 percent (17 of 18) of chimpanzee brains examined. It is widely accepted that the planum temporale is a key component of Wernicke's receptive language area, which is also implicated in human communication-related disorders such as schizophrenia and in normal variations such as musical talent. However, anatomic hemispheric asymmetry of this cerebrocortical site is clearly not unique to humans, as is currently thought. The evolutionary origin of human language may have been founded on this basal anatomic substrate, which was already lateralized to the left hemisphere in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans 8 million years ago."

Whether CaMKII activity also controls morphological maturation of optic tectal neurons was tested using in vivo time-lapse imaging of single neurons over periods of up to 5 days. Dendritic arbor elaboration slows with maturation, in correlation with the onset of CaMKII expression. Elevating CaMKII activity in young neurons by viral expression of constitutively active CaMKII slowed dendritic growth to a rate comparable to that of mature neurons. CaMKII overexpression stabilized dendritic structure in more mature neurons, whereas CaMKII inhibition increased their dendritic growth. Thus, endogenous CaMKII activity limits dendritic growth and stabilizes dendrites, and it may act as an activity-dependent mediator of neuronal maturation."

Functional studies show that simultaneous expression of all three subunits is required to generate maximal Na+ current, although expression of αENaC alone can produce small currents. In addition, biochemical data show that the three human ENaC (hENaC) subunits associate (19Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that MEC-4, MEC-10, and DEG-1 also function as heteromultimers (7Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev.

However, the subunit stoichiometry is not known for any DEG/ENaC channel. cDNAs and mutations were generated as described previously (9Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

FaNaCh was amplified by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription of RNA from H. aspersa. We tagged the C terminus of αhENaC with the sequence DYKDDDDK (αFlag) for immunoprecipitation by anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody. This did not alter the function of the α subunit in Xenopus oocytes or epithelia or its ability to associate with other subunits (19Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant α-, β-, and γhENaC (0.2 ng each) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by nuclear injection of cDNA (18McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When a mixture of wild-type and mutant cDNAs for a subunit was coinjected, the total amount of cDNA for the subunit remained constant. 16–24 h after injection, whole-cell Na+current was measured by two-electrode voltage clamp at −60 mV (bathing solution, 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). To increase the affinity for amiloride of channels containing γG536C, we decreased the Na+ concentration for experiments in Fig. 1 (25 mm NaCl, 93 mm KCl). Under these conditions, 3 mm amiloride completely inhibits hENaC current. The fraction of Na+ current inhibited by MTS 1The abbreviations used are: MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. reagents,Inh, was determined by measuring current blocked by a maximal concentration of amiloride before and after addition of MTSET (Toronto Research Chemicals) or MTSEA to the bathing solution for 100 s. Following coexpression of wild-type and mutant hENaC subunits, we determined the number of α, β, or γ subunits in the channel complex, n, as described previously by MacKinnon (21MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) using the equation Inh=fwtnInhwt+(1−fwtn)Inhmut where Inh wt is the fraction of current inhibited in channels containing only wild-type subunits,Inh mut is the fraction of current inhibited in channels containing n mutant subunits, andf is the fraction of subunits expressed that are wild-type or mutant, as indicated. cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes, as described previously (22Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were electroporated as described previously (19Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) at 37 °C for 30 min, and then chased for 0–7 h at 15 °C. We have found that hENaC subunits assemble in the ER (19Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), then become insoluble to detergents prior to transport to the golgi. 2L. S. Prince and M. J. Welsh, unpublished observations. To minimize insolubility, we incubated cells at 15 °C to inhibit transport out of the ER. Proteins were solubilized in cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% digitonin, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A and sedimented on sucrose gradients as described in figure legends. To investigate the stoichiometry of hENaC, we first asked how many γ subunits contribute to the channel complex. Our strategy, similar to that described by MacKinnon (21MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), was to coexpress mixtures of wild-type and mutant γ subunits in Xenopus oocytes and then determine the sensitivity to an inhibitor. We used MTSET, 3P. M. Snyder and M. J. Welsh, unpublished observations. an agent that covalently modifies cysteines. Wild-type hENaC is relatively insensitive to MTSET (Fig.1 A). Previous studies indicate that Gly536 in the γ subunit lines the channel pore (23Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).3 When we replaced Gly536 with cysteine (γG536C), MTSET irreversibly decreased current 87% (Fig.1 B) by covalently modifying the introduced cysteine. Wild-type γ (γwt) and γG536C produced equal Na+ currents (Fig. 1 E). Interestingly, when we coexpressed a 0.5:0.5 mixture of γwt and γG536C (with wild-type α and βhENaC), most of the Na+ current (77%) was inhibited by MTSET (Fig.1 C). When we increased the contribution of γwt(0.8:0.2 γwt:γG536C), MTSET decreased Na+ current 48% (Fig. 1 D). The finding that MTSET decreased Na+ current out of proportion to the fraction of mutant subunits suggested that hENaC contains more than one γ subunit and the γG536C phenotype is dominant. To determine the number of γ subunits in hENaC, we make two assumptions. First, we assume that γwt and γG536C express equally and associate randomly in the channel complex. This seems reasonable since expression of γwt or γG536C with α- and βhENaC produced equal amounts of Na+ current. If this is correct, then channel composition will be determined by a binomial distribution. Second, we assume that a single mutant γ subunit is sufficient to make a channel sensitive to MTSET. The dominant effect of γG536C suggests this is correct. Consider the examples illustrated in Fig. 1 G (expression of 0.5:0.5 γwt:γG536C). If hENaC has one γ subunit, there will be two channel populations; one will contain a wild-type γ subunit and the other will contain γG536C. In contrast, if hENaC has three γ subunits, then one-eighth of the channels will have three wild-type γ subunits and one-eighth will have three mutant subunits. The remainder (six-eighths) will contain both wild-type and mutant γ subunits. If a single mutant γ makes a channel sensitive to MTSET, then the fraction of Na+current sensitive to MTSET will be determined by the fraction of channels that have at least one mutant γ subunit. Thus, we can calculate the number of γ subunits in the hENaC complex (n) by measuring the fraction of Na+ current inhibited by MTSET (Inh). Fig. 1 F shows a plot of the values measured for Inh when we expressed γwt (f wt = 1.0), γG536C (f wt = 0), or mixtures of both. Curves for expected values of Inh if n is 1–4 are superimposed. The data suggest hENaC has three γ subunits. In contrast to MTSET, MTSEA inhibited current in cells expressing wild-type subunits by 54% (Fig.2 A). Our unpublished data suggest that MTSEA inhibits by covalently modifying one or more pore-lining cysteines in the γ subunit. As a second independent test of the number of γ subunits and to determine the number of α and β subunits, we took advantage of a mutation in the Deg residue that prevents inhibition. In MEC-4, mutation of Ala442 to bulky amino acids causes neurodegeneration (20Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and mutation of the equivalent residue in BNC1 activates the channel (10Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In hENaC subunits, the Deg residues are serines. We found that mutation of a Deg serine to cysteine in any of the subunits (αS549C, βS520C, and γS529C) abolished inhibition by MTSEA. Instead, MTSEA and MTSET (Fig. 2 A) stimulated a small increase in Na+ current. In this regard, modification of this residue in hENaC may be similar to the activation that occurs with a bulky residue at the Deg position in MEC-4 and BNC1. Perhaps after the cysteine is modified, it provides a steric barrier that prevents MTSEA from entering the pore where it could alter the γ-cysteine(s) and inhibit current. We expressed mixtures of these mutant and wild-type subunits and measured current inhibition by MTSEA. Because MTSEA stimulates channels containing the Deg Ser-to-Cys mutation, it complicates the quantitative assessment of MTSEA's inhibition of wild-type channels. To circumvent this problem, we took advantage of the fact that MTSET also stimulates these mutant channels (Fig. 2 A), but it does not inhibit wild-type channels (Figs. 1 A and2 A). We performed the experiments in two steps as shown in Fig. 2 A. First, we added MTSET. It stimulated channels containing αS549C, but more importantly, it prevented stimulation on subsequent addition of MTSEA. Second, after washing out MTSET, we applied MTSEA and measured the inhibitory effect on amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 2 A). In contrast to wild-type hENaC, when we expressed αS549C, MTSEA produced a minimal decrease in current (6.9%). Studies with mixtures suggest that αS549C prevents channel inhibition by MTSEA in a dominant manner, since Na+ current was inhibited less than the proportion of wild-type α subunits. Similar results were obtained with βS520C and γS529C, although MTSET stimulated γS529Cless than the other mutants. Each mutant produced Na+currents equal to wild-type (Fig. 2 E), supporting the assumption that wild-type and mutant subunits express equally. Fig. 2, B–D, shows the fraction of Na+ current inhibited by MTSEA versus the fraction of subunits that were wild-type. The results suggest that hENaC contains three α, three β, and three γ subunits. To further test stoichiometry, we determined the molecular mass of hENaC by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Because αhENaC can form a homomeric channel, we first determined the mass of channels containing only the α subunit. We translated αhENaC in vitro with microsomal membranes. This assay allows subunit multimerization in the ER, while minimizing the possibility that other cellular proteins will associate with the hENaC channel complex and alter its molecular mass. Fig.3 A shows that unglycosylated α subunits sedimented mainly in fractions 4 and 5, similar to a standard of 240 kDa. This migration suggested that most of the unglycosylated subunits were in the form of dimers or trimers, consistent with our previous finding that subunit interactions begin prior to glycosylation (19Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, glycosylated subunits sedimented in the same fractions (8Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 9Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) as a 950-kDa standard (Fig.3 A), consistent with a channel complex containing at least nine subunits. Because most of the α subunits in fractions 8–10 were glycosylated, the data suggest that subunits oligomerize during processing in the ER. Further, multimerization is probably very efficient, since little glycosylated α was found in fractions 4 and 5. Because most multimeric proteins multimerize in the ER (24Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), this assay probably provides an accurate representation of the size of the complex at the plasma membrane. We asked whether other members of the DEG/ENaC family form a complex of similar size. The glycosylated form of FaNaCh sedimented in the same fractions as αhENaC (Fig. 3 B). BNC1 sedimented in lighter fractions (peak in fraction 8) (Fig.3 B), consistent with the lower molecular mass of glycosylated BNC1 monomer (70 kDa) compared with αhENaC (87 kDa) and FaNaCh (90 kDa). These results are consistent with FaNaCh and BNC1 complexes that contain at least nine subunits. To determine whether the mass of an hENaC complex containing α, β, and γ was the same as a homomeric complex, we coexpressed the three subunits in COS-7 cells. Sedimentation was determined at times from 0 to 7 h after pulse labeling. Immediately after the 30-min pulse, immunoprecipitated α subunits peaked in fraction 4, and very little α was present in fractions 8 and 9 (Fig.4). This suggests a complex containing two-three subunits. With time, the fraction of α in denser fractions increased, and at 7 h, a significant amount of α subunits were in a complex that sedimented in fractions 8 and 9. We also determined the sedimentation of β subunits that coimmunoprecipitated with αhENaC. At 7 h, a large fraction of β subunits were also in a complex sedimenting in fractions 8 and 9. Because this assay only detected β subunits that were associated with α, the results suggest that fractions 8 and 9 contain heteromeric complexes and likely represent the oligomeric state of the functional channel complex. These data suggest that the channel complex contains at least nine subunits. We cannot exclude the possibility that other cellular proteins tightly associate with hENaC and influence the density. However, this seems unlikely because sedimentation of the channel complex in cells andin vitro was similar. Our functional and our biochemical data support a model of hENaC containing nine subunits; three α, three β, and three γ. These results suggest a novel stoichiometry for an ion channel and contrast with the stoichiometry of voltage-gated K+ channels (four subunits) (21MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) and Na+/Ca2+ channels (four repeats), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (five subunits), and gap junction hemichannels (six subunits) (25Hille B. Ionic Channels in Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 236-258Google Scholar). The finding that BNC1 and FaNaCh migrated on sucrose gradients similar to hENaC suggests that those channels may also be constructed from nine subunits. Thus, a multimeric complex composed of nine subunits may be a conserved feature of the DEG/ENaC family. In addition, genetic evidence suggests that some C. elegans family members contain more than one copy of each subunit. For example, MEC-4, MEC-10, and probably one unidentified subunit may form a functional complex. A loss-of-function mutation on one mec-4 allele suppressed a dominant neurodegeneration-associated mutation on the othermec-4 allele (26Hong K. Driscoll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similar interactions appear to occur with MEC-10 subunits (27Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the functional complex contains two or more MEC-4 and two or more MEC-10 subunits (7Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The approach we used has several advantages. First, the electrophysiological assays allowed us to selectively determine the stoichiometry of functional channels. If different combinations of subunits produced nonfunctional channels or channels not delivered to the cell surface, they would not be detected. Second, our approach allowed us to determine the absolute number of α, β, and γ subunits in the channel complex, rather than a ratio of one subunit relative to another. Third, use of two independent electrophysiological assays for the γ subunit strengthen our conclusions. Fourth, we were able to avoid the use of concatameric constructs, which could disrupt the normal association of subunits, as previously reported for Shaker K+ channels (28McCormack K. Lin L. Iverson L.E. Tanouye M.A. Sigworth F.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1406-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Finally, we used both functional and biochemical approaches. Both supported the same conclusion. Our approach also has limitations. First, our electrophysiological assays would not detect inactive channels. Second, our sucrose gradient assay detected channels in the ER, rather than channels at the plasma membrane. However, earlier work suggested that the hENaC subunits assemble in the ER (19Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Finally, our electrophysiological approach relies on two assumptions; that wild-type and mutant subunits express equally and associate randomly and that a single mutant subunit has a dominant effect on MTS sensitivity. As discussed above, these assumptions are likely valid. However, if the assumption that a single mutant subunit is dominant is incorrect, our calculations will underestimate the number of subunits. In the case of all three limitations, the concordance between biochemical and functional data support the validity of our approach. It is interesting to speculate how nine subunits might assemble to form a highly selective channel. Based on theoretical considerations, Guy and Durell (29Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) independently proposed a model for ENaC that contains three α, three β, and three γ subunits. In their model, the pore is formed by αβ barrels derived from the residues immediately preceding M1 and M2, and they predicted that all nine subunits contribute to the channel pore. Our experimental data are consistent with this model. We thank H. Robert Guy for discussions about his model of ENaC, Theresa Mayhew, Ellen Tarr, and Dan Bucher for technical assistance, and John B. Stokes, Christopher Adams, Margaret Price, Joseph Cotten, and our other laboratory colleagues for helpful discussions. We thank the University of Iowa DNA Core for assistance."

Recent three-dimensional structures suggest mechanisms by which tandem SH2 domains might confer higher specificity than individual SH2 domains. To test this, binding studies were conducted with tandem domains from the five signaling enzymes: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85, ZAP-70, Syk, SHP-2, and phospholipase C-γ1. Bisphosphorylated TAMs (tyrosine-based activation motifs) were derived from biologically relevant sites in platelet-derived growth factor, T cell, B cell, and high affinity IgE receptors and the receptor substrates IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1) and SHPS-1/SIRP. Each tandem SH2 domain binds a distinct TAM corresponding to its appropriate biological partner with highest affinity (0.5–3.0 nm). Alternative TAMs bind the tandem SH2 domains with 1,000- to >10,000-fold lower affinity than biologically relevant TAMs. This level of specificity is significantly greater than the ∼20–50-fold typically seen for individual SH2 domains. We conclude that high biological specificity is conferred by the simultaneous interaction of two SH2 domains in a signaling enzyme with bisphosphorylated TAMs in activated receptors and substrates.

SH2 domain proteins transmit intracellular signals initiated by activated tyrosine kinase receptors (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains bind phosphorylated receptor tyrosines, and, since many SH2 domain proteins also contain or associate with catalytic subunits, these interactions recruit the effector enzymes to activated receptors. Tyrosine kinase signaling pathways thus gain specificity from the intrinsic binding preferences of SH2 domains for short sequences that flank phosphotyrosine. A great deal has been learned by studying isolated, individual SH2 domains. Common mechanisms are used for phosphotyrosine recognition (2Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D.

The latter is within the conserved FLVRES sequence. Binding site selectivity is conferred by interactions between two variable loops within SH2 domains (EF and BG) and peptide residues COOH-terminal to phosphotyrosine. The degree of selectivity varies, but phosphopeptides derived from biologically relevant sites typically bind with 20–50-fold higher affinity than irrelevant or randomized sequences (e.g. Refs. 13Piccione E.

Shoelson, unpublished observations. these are exceptions and not the rule. Nevertheless, biological specificity in intact cells is substantially greater than 50-fold, suggesting that more is involved than individual SH2 domain interactions. In fact, all SH2 domain proteins contain additional binding modules (e.g. SH2, SH3, PTB, and PH domains) or motifs. A fundamental concept may have been overlooked by the common tendency to evaluate specificity using isolated, individual domains. Simultaneous binding to multiple domains could enhance specificity through combinatorial effects, as 1) each independent domain has intrinsic linear binding specificity; 2) relative orientations between binding sites may be limited by structural constraints; and 3) the ligands for all domains must be present in the same cellular locations and properly oriented for multisite binding. As an example, bisphosphorylated tyrosine-based activation motif (TAM) 2The abbreviations used are: TAM, tyrosine-based activation motif; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PLC, phospholipase C; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; pY, phosphotyrosine; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TCR, T cell receptor; RU, resonance unit(s); cRU, corrected resonance unit(s). peptides activate the SH2 domain enzymes, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, SHP-1, SHP-2, and Syk, more potently than monophosphoryl peptides (19Backer J.M.

Each enzyme contains two SH2 domains, suggesting that bivalent interactions might confer higher affinity, perhaps through an avidity effect. Moreover, tandem phosphorylation sites are necessary, for example, in immune cell signaling where bisphosphorylated TAMs bind the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 or Syk (e.g. Refs. 26Samelson L.E.

Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Two solved structures of tandem SH2 domains, from ZAP-70 and SHP-2, suggest that spatial constraints on binding site orientation might play a role in higher specificity (28Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29Eck M.J.

Using five different proteins, we show that tandem SH2 domain interactions have substantially higher affinities than comparable single SH2 domain interactions. Furthermore, since each tandem SH2 domain binds a distinct, biologically relevant TAM with highest affinity and alternative, irrelevant TAMs with much lower affinity, we conclude that tandem domain interactions greatly enhance biological specificity in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. cDNA fragments encoding human PI 3-kinase p85α (310–712), ZAP-70 (1–259), and Syk (1–265) tandem SH2 domains were subcloned into pGEX vectors (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Transformed Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was grown at 30–37 °C; protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2–4 h. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.0 mm benzamidine, and 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin) and either sonicated or passed through a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (1–10 × 104× g at 4 °C). The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (95% homogeneity), treated with thrombin to remove the glutathioneS-transferase domain, and purified further by sequential phosphotyrosine affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography (28Hatada M.H.

Following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and cell lysis, the non-fusion PLC-γ1 and SHP-2 tandem SH2 domain proteins were purified by phosphopeptide affinity chromatography (immobilized PDGFR pY1021, DNDpYIIPLPDPK, for PLC-γ1; immobilized IRS-1 pY1172, LSTpYASINFQK-NH2 for SHP-2), eluted with 500 mmphenyl phosphate, dialyzed, and gel filtered using Superdex-75 (29Eck M.J. Pluskey S. Trub T. Harrison S.C. Shoelson S.E. Nature. 1996; 379: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Protein homogeneity was ≥ 95% for the five tandem domains, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Prior to BIAcore analyses, proteins were exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline/dithiothreitol buffer (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol) by fast protein liquid chromatography or dialysis. Protein concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically using the following molar extinction coefficients: ZAP-70 (1–259) ε280 = 36,070 m−1cm−1, Syk (1–265) ε280 = 31,630m−1 cm−1, p85α (310–712) ε280 = 59,410 m−1cm−1, SHP-2 (1–225) ε280 = 21,260m−1 cm−1, and PLC-γ1 (543–763) ε280 = 30,350 m−1cm−1.

Phosphopeptides were covalently immobilized to a biosensor chip CM5 through the ε-amino group of an Ac-Lys-Gly-Gly linker (18Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Low ligand densities (50–100 resonance units (RU)) were used to minimize “bridging” between tandem SH2 domain proteins and adjacent phosphopeptides. The presence of accessible phosphopeptide was confirmed by monoclonal antibody binding: ≈2,200 RU using 5 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. 05-321). BIAcore measurements were made in phosphate-buffered saline/dithiothreitol at 25 °C. After each cycle, the chip was regenerated with a 60-s pulse of 3 m NaCl and 50-s pulse of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 7.0. Neither loss of peptide or tyrosine phosphorylation (as assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine binding) nor change in baseline RU was apparent during the course of an assay. Values for apparent dissociation constants, K D (app), were calculated from equilibrium binding data at six or more protein concentrations. Data were fit using the Eadie-Hofstee equation, cRU=(−cRU/[protein])KD(app)+cRUmaxEquation 1 where cRU is the response at equilibrium corrected for bulk refractive index errors using a sham-coupled flow cell, cRUmax is cRU when all accessible peptides on the biosensor chip are occupied, [protein] is the analyte (tandem SH2 domain) concentration, and K D is the dissociation constant. Independently purified batches of protein and independent BIAcore analyses were used for each replicate. Each tandem SH2 domain protein was paired with its highest affinity ligand for competition studies: ZAP-70 with immobilized TCRζ TAM1, Syk with FCεRIγ TAM, PLC-γ1 with PDGFR 1009/1021, SHP-2 with SHPS-1/SIRP TAM, and p85α with immobilized PDGFR 740/751. Solutions of tandem SH2 domain proteins (5 nm for p85α, 10 nm for all others) were pre-mixed with varying concentrations of competing (soluble) peptide and injected (2 μl/min for p85α, all others at 5 μl/min flow rates) over the appropriate immobilized peptide until an equilibrium in binding was achieved. Inhibition of binding was measured as a decrease in cRU as a function of peptide concentration. Experimental data were analyzed according to the equation cRUexp=[cRUmax−cRUmink[Inh]−IC50]/(1+k[Inh]−IC50)Equation 2 where cRUmax is maximum binding in the absence of inhibitor, cRUmin is minimum binding (complete inhibition), cRUexp is binding at inhibitor concentration [Inh],k is the slope factor, and IC50 is the inhibitor concentration that reduces binding by one-half. Peptide concentrations were determined independently for each experimental replicate. Binding analyses were conducted with native tandem SH2 domain sequences derived from five well characterized signaling proteins: PI 3-kinase p85, ZAP-70, Syk, SHP-2, and PLC-γ1 (Fig.1 A). Interactions were with natural ligands, including TAMs derived from biologically relevant sites in the PDGF receptor (31Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F.

Equilibrium values were determined 10 s prior to the end of each protein injection. Scatchard plots of cRU versus cRU/[SHP-2] were linear (inset). This suggests that binding data can be treated as a second order, bimolecular process with a single value for K D (app). Each tandem SH2 domain binds a bisphosphorylated TAM with low nanomolar or subnanomolar affinity (Table I). As additional controls, the monophosphoryl forms of the SHPS-1/SIRP TAM and TCRζ TAM1 peptides were synthesized and immobilized to sensor chips under identical conditions. The tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2 and ZAP-70, respectively, bind with micromolar affinities (data not shown), similar in magnitude to the micromolar affinities of individual SH2 domains toward monophosphorylpeptides (Fig. 3) (13Piccione E.

To test this, relative affinities were determined for the five tandem SH2 domains versus nine distinct, biologically relevant bisphosphoryl TAMs. Competition methods of surface plasmon resonance were used for this comparison. The optimal ligands identified in TableI were bound to the sensor chips (i.e. TCRζ TAM1 was bound for competition studies with ZAP-70, PDGFR 740/751 for competition analyses with PI 3-kinase p85, etc.). Analyte solutions containing fixed concentrations of the SH2 domain protein and variable concentrations of each TAM were passed over the chip. Binding sensograms were recorded and equilibrium measurements (RU) were used to generate binding curves. Each tandem SH2 domain binds a bisphosphoryl TAM derived from its biological target with greatest affinity (TableII). Alternative bisphosphoryl TAMs bind with 1,000- to >10,000-fold lower affinity. In the examples shown (Fig. 4), ZAP-70 binds TCRζ TAM1 with high affinity (IC50 = 8.3 nm), whereas the two PDGF receptor TAMs and the SHPS-1/SIRP TAM bind with 1,000- to 10,000-fold lower affinity (panel A). In contrast, the PI 3-kinase p85 tandem SH2 domains bind PDGFR 740/751 TAM with high affinity (IC50 = 1.5 nm). TCRζ, SHPS-1/SIRP, and PDGFR 1009/1021 TAMs bind with more than 1,000-fold lower affinity (Fig. 4 B). SHP-2 binds the SHPS-1/SIRP TAM with high affinity (IC50 = 8 nm), but in this case the T cell and PDGF receptor TAMs bind with 1,000- to more than 10,000-fold lower affinity (Fig. 4 C). These differences are significantly greater than the 20–50-fold windows of selectivity typically seen when individual SH2 domains bind specificversus nonspecific or randomized motifs (Fig. 3) (13Piccione E.

The ζ-chains contain three TAMs (TCRζ TAM1, TAM2, and TAM3) having the consensus sequence (pYXXI/LX 6–8pYXXI/L) (Fig. 1 B). Although ZAP-70 binds all three TCR TAMs (TableII), affinity is highest for TCRζ TAM1 and TCRζ TAM2. Interestingly, this matches the order of in vitrophosphorylation by the Src-like kinase, Lck, 3A. Proudfoot, personal communication. consistent with an ordered assembly of tetrameric ζ-chain-ZAP-70 complexes. ZAP-70 also binds the T cell receptor ε-chain (TCRε TAM) and the common immunoreceptor γ-chain TAM (FcεRIγ TAM) with high affinity (IC50 = 18 and 25 nm, respectively). γTAM-1 binding correlates with the ability of ZAP-70 to reconstitute defective B cell receptor signaling in Syk-deficient cells through interactions with the B cell receptor γ-chain (45Kong G.H. Bu J.Y. Kurosaki T. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Combined, these data illustrate a strong preference for ZAP-70 binding to conserved immunoreceptor TAMs over alternative TAMs. Syk and ZAP-70 have homologous sequences and similar architectures, although Syk primarily mediates signaling through B cell, the high affinity IgE (FcεRI), and other antigen receptors containing the common immunoreceptor γ-chain (46Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 86: 4389-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of TAM selectivity is similar for Syk and ZAP-70, as Syk binds immunoreceptor TAMs (FcεRIβ and γ TAMs and TCRε and ζ TAMs 1, 2, and 3) with high or moderate affinity. Alternative, non-immunoreceptor TAMs (e.g. PDGFR 740/751, PDGFR 1009/1021, and SHPS-1) bind with much lower affinity (Table II). Of the high affinity IgE receptor TAMs, Syk prefers γTAM-1 over βTAM-1 (IC50 = 23versus 420 nm, respectively). This correlates with reported interactions between Syk and γ-subunits"
https://openalex.org/W2091980012,"The dynamics of two-dimensional small-polaron formation at ultrathin alkane layers on a silver(111) surface have been studied with femtosecond time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. Optical excitation creates interfacial electrons in quasi-free states for motion parallel to the interface. These initially delocalized electrons self-trap as small polarons in a localized state within a few hundred femtoseconds. The localized electrons then decay back to the metal within picoseconds by tunneling through the adlayer potential barrier. The energy dependence of the self-trapping rate has been measured and modeled with a theory analogous to electron transfer theory. This analysis determines the inter- and intramolecular vibrational modes of the overlayer responsible for self-trapping as well as the relaxation energy of the overlayer molecular lattice. These results for a model interface contribute to the fundamental picture of electron behavior in weakly bonded solids and can lead to better understanding of carrier dynamics in many different systems, including organic light-emitting diodes."

Expression of this hybrid enzyme in the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea produced several novel antibiotic erythromycins derived from endogenous branched-chain acid starter units typical of natural avermectins. Because the avermectin polyketide synthase is known to accept more than 40 alternative carboxylic acids as starter units, this approach opens the way to facile production of novel analogs of antibiotic macrolides."
https://openalex.org/W2022693510,"Abstract A full-length heme oxygenase gene from the pathogenic bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae has been subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is expressed at high levels as a soluble catalytically active protein that results in the accumulation of biliverdin within the E. coli cells. The purified heme oxygenase forms a 1:1 complex with heme (K d = 2.5 ± 1 μm) and has hemeprotein spectra similar to those previously reported for the purified eukaryotic heme oxygenases. In the presence of an E. coli NADPH-dependent reductase isolated during the purification of Hmu O, the heme-Hmu O complex is catalytically turned over to yield biliverdin IXα and carbon monoxide. A number of redox partners were investigated for their ability to reconstitute Hmu O activity in vitro. Of these the most efficient appeared to be the recombinant NADH-dependent putidaredoxin/putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida. As with the E. coliNADPH-dependent reductase the final products of the reaction were biliverdin IXα and carbon monoxide. This is the first bacterial heme oxygenase to be described to date. The close relationship between iron acquisition and pathogenesis suggests that the release of iron from heme by heme oxygenase may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of C. diphtheriae."

It has been postulated that the molecular basis of this highly dynamic adhesion is the low affinity and rapid kinetics of selectin interactions. However, affinity and kinetic analyses of monomeric selectins binding their natural ligands have not previously been reported. Leukocyte selectin (L-selectin, CD62L) binds preferentially to O-linked carbohydrates present on a small number of mucin-like glycoproteins, such as glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1), expressed in high endothelial venules. GlyCAM-1 is a soluble secreted protein which, following binding to CD62L, stimulates β2-integrin-mediated adhesion of lymphocytes. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that a soluble monomeric form of CD62L binds to purified immobilized GlyCAM-1 with a dissociation constant (K d) of 108 μm. CD62L dissociates from GlyCAM-1 with a very fast dissociation rate constant (≥10 s−1) which agrees well with the reported dissociation rate constant of CD62L-mediated leukocyte tethers. The calculated association rate constant is ≥105m−1 s−1. At concentrations just above its mean serum level (∼1.5 μg/ml or ∼30 nm), GlyCAM-1 binds multivalently to immobilized CD62L.

Indeed, it has been proposed that the binding of soluble GlyCAM-1 to leukocyte CD62L inhibits CD62L-mediated adhesion (25Brustein M. Kraal G. Mebius R.E. Watson S.R. J. Exp.

In the present study we expressed a soluble, monomeric form of rat CD62L and used surface plasmon resonance to measure the monovalent affinity and kinetics of its interaction with native GlyCAM-1 purified from mouse serum. We show that CD62L binds immobilized GlyCAM-1 with a very low affinity (K d ∼ 105 μm) and a very fast dissociation rate constant (k off ≥ 10 s−1). In contrast, the binding of soluble GlyCAM-1 to immobilized CD62L is detectable at concentrations just above 1.5 μg/ml (∼30 nm) and dissociates with ak off < 0.001 s−1. Our results establish that CD62L binds its physiological ligand with a very low affinity and very fast kinetics. In addition, our data suggest that soluble GlyCAM-1 binds multivalently to, and therefore cross-links, cell surface CD62L, suggesting a mechanism for signal transduction. The rabbit anti-GlyCAM-1 polyclonal antibodies CAMO2 and CAMO5, which are directed against middle (KEPSIFREELISKD) and carboxyl-terminal (IISGASRITKS) GlyCAM-1 peptides, respectively, were produced as described (22Lasky L.A.

The mouse anti-rat mAb OX85 (IgG1) was raised by immunizing 8–12-week-old BALB/c mice with purified CD62L-CD4. OX85 was identified by screening hybridoma supernatants for binding to both purified CD62L-CD4 (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and lymph node cells (by FACS®). OX85, like HRL2 (32Tamatani T.

W., Molecular Analysis of the Leukocyte Cell-Surface Adhesion Protein L-Selectin.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Oxford.Google Scholar), indicating that it binds native rat CD62L. GlyCAM-1 was purified from mouse serum as described (27Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 196: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mouse CD62L Ig was expressed in human kidney 293 cells and purified as described (36Watson S.R. Imai Y. Fennie C. Geoffroy J.S. Rosen S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 110: 2221-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rat CD62L Ig was expressed in silkworm cells and was purified by protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) affinity chromatography from silkworm hemolymph provided by Dr. M. Miyasaka (33Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar). DNA encoding the extracellular portion of rat CD62L was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from rat spleen cDNA. The 5′ primer (5′-GCCCGCTCTAGAACTTACAGAAGAGACC) was complementary to the 5′-untranslated region and added an XbaI site (underlined). The 3′-primer (5′-GAGAAAGTCGACTTTGTCTTTTGACATATTGG) was designed to include CD62L up to Lys-282 (numbered as the mature protein) and add a SalI site (underlined). To facilitate cloning, a silent mutation was introduced into the CD62L sequence (TCTAGA → TCTCGA) to remove an internal XbaI site. The CD62L fragment was ligated into theXbaI/SalI sites of a previously described pBluescript vector containing an insert encoding domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4 (CD4d3+4) (37Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Prot. Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA encoded the leader and most of the extracellular portion of CD62L fused at its carboxyl-terminal end to CD4d3+4 (CD62L-CD4, Fig. 1 A). The interveningSalI site introduced a Ser (underlined) at the junction between CD62L and CD4 (..QKTKSTSITA..). The DNA encoding CD62L-CD4 was excised with XbaI and BamHI, subcloned into expression vector pEE14 (38Bebbington C.R. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1991; 2: 136-145Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using its XbaI and BclI restriction sites, and then checked by dideoxy sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were transfected with the CD62L-CD4/pEE14 plasmid using calcium phosphate as described (38Bebbington C.R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10410-10418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones expressing high levels of CD62L-CD4 were identified as described (37Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Prot. Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using the anti-CD4 mAb OX68 (40Simon J.H.M. Stumbles P. Signoret N. Somoza C. Puklavec M. Sattentau Q.J. Barclay A.N. James W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1476-1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best clone (secreting 40–60 mg/liter) was grown up to confluence in bulk culture before switching to serum-free medium supplemented with 2 mm sodium butyrate. The cultures were then left for a further 3–4 weeks prior to harvesting. CD62L-CD4 was purified from the spent tissue culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using OX68 coupled to Sepharose CL-4B (37Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Prot. Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 HR10/30 column (Fig.1 C). The extinction coefficient (at 280 nm) of purified CD62L-CD4 was determined by amino acid analysis to be 1.87 cm2 mg−1. Briefly, the duplicate 20-μl samples of CD62L-CD4 at an A 280 (path length 1 cm) of 0.46 were subjected to acid hydrolysis and the following amino acids were quantitated: Asp + Asn, Glu + Gln, His, Arg, Ala, Pro, Val, Leu, Phe, Lys. The amino acid composition was as expected from the primary sequence (data not shown). The extinction coefficient was calculated based on a CD62L-CD4 protein M r(excluding carbohydrate) of 51,999. The proportion of purified CD62L-CD4 that bound OX85 was estimated as follows. Protein A-Sepharose beads (packed volume 100 μl) were incubated with 1 mg of OX85 or the control antibody W3/25 (IgG1, binds domain 1 of rat CD4 (40Simon J.H.M. Stumbles P. Signoret N. Somoza C.

OX85 or W3/25 beads (40 μl) were added to 20 μl of CD62L-CD4 (1 μg/μl in Tris saline) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then pelleted and the supernatants (8 μl) analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C (unless otherwise indicated) on a BIAcoreTM(BIAcore AB, Stevenage, Herts, United Kingdom) with Hepes-buffered saline as running buffer. Hepes-buffered saline comprised (in mm): NaCl 150, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, Hepes 10 (pH 7.4), and 0.005% surfactant P20. All directly immobilized proteins were covalently coupled to research grade CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore) via primary amine groups using the Amine Coupling Kit (BIAcore) as described (42Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) except that a flow rate of 10 μl/min was used throughout. The purified mAbs OX68 and R10Z8E9 were coupled and regenerated as described previously (43van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44Nath D. van der Merwe P.A. Kelm S. Bradfield P. Crocker P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26184-26191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies CAMO2 and CAMO5 were coupled by injecting them for 7 min at 60 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). Immobilized CAMO2 was regenerated with minimal loss of GlyCAM-1 binding activity by injecting 100 mm HCl over the surface for 3 min (data not shown). Because GlyCAM-1 is not covalently coupled to the surface, it dissociates continuously, with the result that the amount of immobilized GlyCAM-1 decreases by 10–20% between the first and last CD62L-CD4 injections (Fig. 3 A). If this is not taken into account the K d determined for the CD62L-GlyCAM-1 interaction is artificially increased (K d ∼ 140 μm) when proceeding from high to low CD62L-CD4 concentrations and decreased (K d ∼ 90 μm) when proceeding from low to high concentrations (data not shown). Therefore the binding (CD62L bound) at each CD62L-CD4 concentration was adjusted (CD62L adjusted) for the level of GlyCAM-1 (GlyCAM injection) on the surface immediately preceding that injection, using the formula, CD62Ladjusted=CD62Lbound×GlyCAMinitialGlyCAMinjectionEquation 1 where GlyCAM initial is the level of immobilized GlyCAM-1 immediately preceding the first CD62L-CD4 injection. When this adjustment is made the same K d values are obtained irrespective of the order of CD62L-CD4 injections (Fig. 3 D). The extracellular portion of rat CD62L was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells as a fusion protein with domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4 (CD62L-CD4, Fig. 1 A) and purified on an anti-CD4 mAb affinity column (Fig. 1 B). The CD62L-CD4 fusion protein migrated at ∼76 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B) under reducing conditions, consistent with the calculated protein molecular mass of 52 kDa plus utilization of several of the 7 potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig.1 A). CD62L-CD4 migrated slightly faster under nonreducing condition (∼70 kDa, Fig. 1 B), demonstrating that it does not form intermolecular disulfide bonds, and consistent with the presence of intramolecular disulfides. Several lines of evidence suggest that the CD62L-CD4 is correctly folded. First, it bound to 3 previously described CD62L mAbs (HRL1, HRL2, and HRL3) (Fig. 2), two of which (HRL1 and HRL3) block binding of CD62L to its natural ligands (32Tamatani T. Kitamura F. Kuida K. Shirao M. Mochizuki M. Suematsu M. Schmid-Schönbein G.W. Watanabe K. Tsurufuji S. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar). Second, CD62L-CD4 was used to raise a new mAb (OX85, see “Experimental Procedures”). OX85, in addition to binding CD62L-CD4 (Fig. 2), binds lymphocyte populations known to express CD62L (34Seddon B. Saoudi A. Nicholson M. Mason D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2702-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35.Nicholson, M. W., Molecular Analysis of the Leukocyte Cell-Surface Adhesion Protein L-Selectin.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Oxford.Google Scholar) and to a well characterized (33Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar) chimeric protein comprising rat CD62L fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (CD62L Ig, data not shown). Third, CD62L-CD4-coated fluorescent microspheres bind selectively to high-endothelial venules (HEV) in lymph node sections (35.Nicholson, M. W., Molecular Analysis of the Leukocyte Cell-Surface Adhesion Protein L-Selectin.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Oxford.Google Scholar). Fourth, CD62L-CD4 binds both porcine peripheral node addressin (PNAd, purified using the MECA-79 mAb) (35.Nicholson, M. W., Molecular Analysis of the Leukocyte Cell-Surface Adhesion Protein L-Selectin.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Oxford.Google Scholar) and mouse GlyCAM-1 (see below). And finally, as expected for interactions involving C-type lectins, binding of CD62L-CD4 to HEV, PNAd, and GlyCAM-1 was inhibited by EDTA (see Ref. 35.Nicholson, M. W., Molecular Analysis of the Leukocyte Cell-Surface Adhesion Protein L-Selectin.Ph.D. thesis, 1995, University of Oxford.Google Scholar and Table I).Table IBinding of CD62L-CD4 to immobilized GlyCAM-1 involves the selectin portion of CD62L-CD4Sample injected1-aThe samples were injected over the indicated surfaces for 5 s at a flow rate of 60 μl/min.

Open table in a new tab Accurate affinity measurements require knowledge of the proportion of the CD62L-CD4 that is active with respect to ligand binding. It was not possible to measure directly ligand binding activity and so, as a surrogate, we used binding to mAbs, including two mAbs (HRL1 and HRL3) which block ligand binding (32Tamatani T. Kitamura F. Kuida K. Shirao M. Mochizuki M. Suematsu M. Schmid-Schönbein G.W. Watanabe K. Tsurufuji S. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar). If one assumes bivalent binding, the mAbs HRL1, HRL3, and OX85 bind to ≥60% of CD62L-CD4 immobilized on the sensor surface (Fig. 2). Furthermore, protein A-Sepharose beads coated with OX85 depleted ∼90% of CD62L-CD4 (Fig. 1 B), despite the fact that OX85 dissociates rapidly from CD62L (Fig. 2). Since these data show that most of the recombinant CD62L-CD4 is correctly folded, the affinity measurements below assume ligand binding activity of 100%. To determine whether CD62L-CD4 was monomeric it was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1 C). Using globular, unglycosylated proteins as calibration markers, CD62L-CD4 eluted at molecular mass ∼ 140,000 (Fig. 1 C), which is higher than the molecular mass measured by SDS-PAGE (∼76 kDa, Fig.1 B). However, asymmetric glycosylated proteins such as CD62L-CD4 typically elute much earlier in size exclusion chromatography than predicted by their M r. For example, the asymmetric, glycosylated proteins sCD2, sCD80, and sCD48-CD4 (M r ∼ 30,000, 35,000, and 50,000 on SDS-PAGE), which are known to be monomeric in solution, elute atM r ∼ 52,000, 63,000, and 84,000 on the same column (45van der Merwe P.A. Bodian D.L. Daenke S. Linsley P. Davis S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that CD62L-CD4 exists as a monomer in solution. The monomeric peak of CD62L-CD4 (Fig.1 C) was used for affinity and kinetic measurements which were performed within 48 h of size exclusion chromatography to minimize the accumulation of multivalent aggregates (46van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). GlyCAM-1 purified from mouse serum was immobilized on the sensor surface indirectly using the rabbit polyclonal antibody CAMO2, which was raised against a peptide from the middle (non-mucin) region of GlyCAM-1 (see “Experimental Procedures"
https://openalex.org/W1966433812,"Repeated seismic surveys of the Landers, California, fault zone that ruptured in the magnitude (M) 7.5 earthquake of 1992 reveal an increase in seismic velocity with time. P, S, and fault zone trapped waves were excited by near-surface explosions in two locations in 1994 and 1996, and were recorded on two linear, three-component seismic arrays deployed across the Johnson Valley fault trace. The travel times of P and S waves for identical shot-receiver pairs decreased by 0.5 to 1.5 percent from 1994 to 1996, with the larger changes at stations located within the fault zone. These observations indicate that the shallow Johnson Valley fault is strengthening after the main shock, most likely because of closure of cracks that were opened by the 1992 earthquake. The increase in velocity is consistent with the prevalence of dry over wet cracks and with a reduction in the apparent crack density near the fault zone by approximately 1.0 percent from 1994 to 1996."

Biol. 1996; 3: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), here we have applied the proteolysis method with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; FHV, flock house virus; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; TLCK,N α -p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. to study the surface-accessible regions of the viral particle. MALDI-MS typically provides picomole sensitivity and accuracy on the order of 0.05% (i.e. ± 0.5 Da on a 1000-Da peptide) and therefore offers a useful method for identifying the proteolysis products of the virus. The limited proteolysis/MALDI-MS experiments were performed on flock house virus (FHV), a non-enveloped, icosahedral, RNA animal virus (Fig. 1) with dimensions similar to the rhino and polio viruses (∼300 Å). Its protein coat or capsid is composed of 180 copies of a single gene product, protein α, which is autocatalytically cleaved to peptides, β and γ, during maturation (13Zlotnick A. Reddy V.S. Dasgupta R. Schneemann A. Ray W.J. Rueckert R.R. Johnson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13680-13684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using time-resolved proteolysis followed by MALDI-MS it was expected that the reactivities of virus particles to different proteases would be a reflection of the structure present on the surface of the viral capsid. In this study we present evidence for the transient exposure of internal viral capsid protein domains and the further use of mass spectrometry to elucidate the functional dynamics of the protein complexes (2Kriwacki R.W. Wu J. Tennant T. Wright P.E. Siuzdak G. J. Chromatogr. 1997; 777: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Kriwacki R.W. Wu J. Siuzdak G. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5320-5321Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS mass analysis was conducted using a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager Elite equipped with delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser. All analyses were conducted using 0.5 μl of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) in a saturated solution of acetonitrile/water (50:50) 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid. External calibration typically was accurate to 0.05% and allowed unequivocal assignment of most proteolytic fragments. FHV was prepared in Drosophila cells (Schneider's line 1) suspended to 4 × 107 cells/ml in a complete growth medium containing Schneider's insect medium with 15% fetal bovine serum (CGM). FHV was added at a multiplicity of 120 plaque-forming units/cell and allowed to attach for 1 h at 26 °C. Cells were then sedimented and resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in CGM. Aliquots were distributed onto 100-mm tissue culture plates and incubated at 26 °C. At 15 h postinfection, the medium was removed and monolayers were rinsed with 10 ml of ice-cold HE buffer (0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were lysed in 2 ml of ice-cold HE buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet p-40. Nuclei and cell debris were removed from the lysate by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C in a table top centrifuge. Supernatant containing the virus was pelleted through 2-ml sucrose gradients (10–30% (w/w) in HE buffer without bovine serum albumin) at 100,000 rpm for 13 min. Pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of 5 mm CaCl2 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol buffered with HEPES (pH 7.0). Proteolytic digests were conducted at 25 °C and 1 mg/ml virus. The endoproteases trypsin, clostripain (Arg-C), protease V8 (Glu-C), and Lys-C were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Endoproteinase Asp-N was obtained from Calbiochem (Table I). The activity of all the enzymes was verified with control peptides. Trypsin reactions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1 mm EDTA. All others enzymes were in the manufacture's recommended reaction buffer. Enzyme to virus to ratio (w:w) was adjusted to 1:3000 to achieve time-resolved cleavage beginning with a sampling rate of one per minute 1 min to 24 h. Reaction volume was 10–20 μl and 0.5 μl was removed from the reaction at each time point and placed directly on the MALDI analysis plate and allowed to dry before the addition of matrix. To confirm the identity of trypsin-released fragments the digest was then exposed to the exprotease carboxypeptidase Y or CPY (Sigma) to obtain C-terminal sequence information on each of the trypsin fragments. The trypsin/CPY sequential digests were performed by first exposing the virus to trypsin that was then inhibited with TLCK (50 μg/ml) and then allowed to dry on the MALDI sample plate. Carboxypeptidase Y (Sigma) diluted to 1 mg/ml in water was then added (1–3 μl) to the dried trypsin digest. Digestion was allowed to continue at room temperature until stopped by evaporation.Table IProtease specificityProteaseAmino acid sequence specificityTrypsinX-K/-X and X-R/-XLys-CX-K/-XClostripainX-R/-XProtease V8X-E/-X and X-D/-XAsp-NX-/N-XThe limited proteolysis experiments of FHV employed five endoproteases each with different specificity's.

The location of cleavage sites is denoted by a slash (/) before or after the amino acid responsible for specificity. Combinations of proteases can be used to reduce specificity and to mimic other proteases. For example Lys-C and clostripain together are specific for the same sites as trypsin. LCMS experiments were performed using an Ultrafast microprotein analyzer (Michrom BioResources, Inc. (Auburn, CA) coupled to a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API 100 electrospray mass spectrometer. Native and digested FHV were denatured prior to LCMS in a 10% trifluoroacetic acid/50% acetonitrile solution. Reverse phase LC separation used an Alpha-Chrom C18 column 2 x 150 mm (Upchurch Scientific) with a flow rate of 50 μl/min in a water/acetonitrile (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) solvent system. Initial trypsin proteolysis experiments on FHV revealed that at suggested enzyme/protein ratios (1:10 to 1:100) numerous tryptic peptides appeared within the first minute of digestion. To better understand the kinetics and therefore accessibility of capsid domains, the reaction was slowed by lowering the enzyme concentration to an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:3000. Slowing the reaction allowed measurements to be performed at 1 min time intervals which provided greater temporal resolution. The initial trypsin cleavages were found to occur within the γ-peptide, followed by the release of peptide fragments from the N-terminal region of the β-protein and, as the digestion continued, peptides associated with B-sheets E′ and E“, which form a protruding loop on the surface of the capsid and C-terminal of the capsid protein were released (Fig.2). As the digestion progressed, intact γ-peptide was no longer detectable. Exposure of FHV to Lys-C initially cleaved the intact γ-peptide only at one of two possible sites, and some intact γ-peptide remained present even after extended exposure (>24 h). The ability of Lys-C to only access a portion of γ-peptide is consistent with the model of FHV having T3 quasi-equivalence with two distinct “types” of the γ-peptide (4Fisher A.J. Johnson J.E. Nature. 1993; 361: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The differential access of trypsin and Lys-C to specific cleavage sites demonstrated an unexpected specificity of the proteases to local quaternary structure. The only other observed Lys-C cleavages occurred after extended exposure at residues of the β-protein associated with loops on the viral surface and near the 5-fold symmetry axes. Exposure of FHV to clostripain did not generate any fragments from the γ-peptide or β-protein even after prolonged exposure (>24 h). Experiments with clostripain and Lys-C, which together mimic the cleavage specificity of trypsin, resulted in fewer cleavages on the FHV viral capsid than those with trypsin. Because clostripain is unable to access putative cleavage sites before and after treatment with Lys-C, these results further suggest that the initial cleavages must not cause large-scale unfolding of the capsid proteins. These results are consistent with previous experiments where access of proteases (14Gallagher T.M. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3399-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleases to the interior of viruses is known to be limited by the failure of nucleases to cleave viral nucleic acids. Exposure of FHV to the endoprotease Glu-C resulted in initial cleavage of the γ-peptide. Likewise, Glu-C cleaved the β-protein at sites consistent with amino acids located on the surface and edges of the capsid monomer after prolonged exposure. Exposure of FHV to Asp-N generated no fragments, even though putative cleavage sites are present on the β-protein. Interestingly, electron micrographs of the viral particles revealed that they maintained their spherical shape even after exhaustive enzyme digestion, yet when analyzed under the denaturing conditions of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis no intact β-protein was detected. This result indicated that even though quantitative cleavage had occurred the viral particle maintained its structural integrity. To further confirm that the results obtained reflected a population-wide digestion of the γ-peptide, high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed before and after digestion. Here UV and mass spectral data for the γ-peptide was obtained before digestion and was absent after trypsin treatment. Quantitative MALDI-MS experiments were also employed using a synthetic γ-peptide fragment as an internal standard; the results of these experiments produced a linear correlation between the internal standard and γ-peptide. The calibration of the γ-peptide against the γ-peptide fragment was then used to monitor γ-peptide content as a function of exposure to digestion. These experiments also confirmed the population-wide digestion of the γ-peptide. To assure that correct assignments of proteolytic fragments were made, a “sequential digestion approach (endo- followed by exoproteolysis) followed by MALDI-MS analysis (15Nelson R.W. Dogruel D. Krone J.R. Williams P. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used to further characterize the proteolytic fragments (Table II). In cases where complicated mixtures precluded the use of sequential digestion, HPLC purification and Edman sequencing were employed.Table IISequential digestion of FHV with trypsin and CPYTrypsin digestionCPY sequential digestionγ-Peptide (364–407)γ-Peptide (364–406)γ-Peptide (370–407)γ-Peptide (370–406)γ-Peptide (372–407)γ-Peptide (372–406)γ-Peptide (372–405)γ-Peptide (372–404)γ-Peptide (376–407)γ-Peptide (376–406)γ-Peptide (376–405)γ-Peptide (376–404)β-Peptide (12–32)β-Peptide (12–31)β-Peptide (15–38)β-Peptide (15–37)β-Peptide (15–36)β-Peptide (15–35) Open table in a new tab As a group the time course experiments clearly demonstrated that the kinetics of proteolysis are domain-specific (Fig.3). Many of the cleavage sites were consistent with the expected surface structure of the virus such as the surface loop digestion, yet the kinetics of cleavage of the γ-peptide and the N-terminal of the β-protein revealed that sites internal in the x-ray structure were the most susceptible. These experiments indicate that the γ-peptide and the N-terminal region of the β-protein, which are crystallographically defined as being internal to FHV, are part of the solvent-accessible domain. When combined with the crystal structure data, the proteolysis results strongly suggest that these domains are transiently present on the viral surface. Previous experiments with poliovirus offer precedent for these observations. Binding experiments with poliovirus demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies specific to internal domains of capsid proteins VP1 and VP4 could reversibly neutralize the virus (16Li Q. Yafal A.G. Lee Y. Hogle J. Chow M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3965-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experiments (17Fricks C.E. Hogle J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1934-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on poliovirus with proteases, antiviral monoclonal antibodies, and antisera against synthetic peptides also suggest that externalization may occur in solution. The exposed amino terminus of VP1 was also shown to be responsible for liposome attachment. These previous studies, and our results from FHV, are consistent with a dynamic capsid in which specific protein regions can translocate to the capsid surface. In conclusion, previous studies on FHV (5Cheng R.H. et al.Structure. 1994; 2: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Munshi S. et al.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggested that the γ-peptides are involved in the release of RNA via a dynamic mechanism where γ-peptides, in an amphipathic α-helical configuration, form a pentameric helical bundle at the 5-fold symmetry axes creating a conduit for the release of RNA. Our proteolysis experiments now confirm that γ-peptides are in equilibrium with the capsid surface. In addition, the mass spectrometry-based method for structural analysis offers information that is complementary to crystallographic and electron microscopy data. Since the MALDI/proteolysis approach does not require the formation of crystals, consumes only microgram quantities of material, and can unequivocally identify proteolytic cleavage sites, it offers a unique and efficient approach to viral structural analysis. Most importantly, since the proteolysis is performed in solution, this method can significantly contribute to an understanding of the dynamic domains that initiate RNA release and translocation, the final phase of the virus life cycle. We thank Jennifer Boydston for her editorial contributions to this manuscript. We also appreciate Dr. Vijay Reddy for providing the Fig. 1 graphics and Dennis Bong for the synthesis of the γ-peptide fragment."

During Drosophila oogenesis, nurse cells transfer their cytoplasmic contents to developing oocytes and then die. Loss of function for the dcp-1 gene, which encodes a caspase, caused female sterility by inhibiting this transfer. dcp-1 − nurse cells were defective in the cytoskeletal reorganization and nuclear breakdown that normally accompany this process. The dcp-1 − phenotype suggests that the cytoskeletal and nuclear events in the nurse cells make use of the machinery normally associated with apoptosis and that apoptosis of the nurse cells is a necessary event for oocyte development."

In the vertebrate central nervous system, neurons withdraw from the cell cycle immediately after differentiation from their proliferative precursors, and remain in the postmitotic state all of their lives. Differentiated neurons are absolutely incapable of dividing even in the presence of chemical and physical stimuli that promote cell-cycle progression of proliferative cells. However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying the permanent quiescence displayed by all neurons. Several previous studies have suggested that the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; SV40, simian virus 40; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, maltose-binding protein; EF-1α, polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α; CR, conserved region. 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma protein; SV40, simian virus 40; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, maltose-binding protein; EF-1α, polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α; CR, conserved region. a well characterized growth suppressor protein, is involved in neuronal differentiation-associated growth arrest. In the brain of Rb-deficient mouse embryos, aberrant mitotic figures accompanied by massive neuronal death are observed particularly in the hindbrain, spinal cord, and sensory ganglia (1Lee E.Y.-H.P.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2008-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In cultured murine embryonal carcinoma cells, Rb is markedly induced during neural differentiation (4Slack R.S. Hamel P.A. Bladon T.S. Gill R.M. McBurney M.W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1585-1591PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of adenovirus E1A, an oncoprotein that suppresses Rb functions, impairs neuronal differentiation and induces cell death (5Slack R.S. Skerjanc I.S. Lach B. Craig J. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that Rb plays a critical role in cell-cycle arrest of certain types of neurons during differentiation. However, the fact that many neurons still differentiate properly in Rb-deficient mice (1Lee E.Y.-H.P. Chang C.-Y. Hu N. Wang Y.-C.J. Lai C.-C. Herrup K. Lee W.-H. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 2Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2008-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) suggests that other growth-suppressive proteins compensate the loss of Rb functions in neurogenesis. We have previously isolated a novel cDNA sequence encoding a 325-amino acid residue protein, termed necdin, from a subtraction cDNA library of neurally differentiated murine embryonal carcinoma cells (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Necdin is a nuclear protein, whose gene is expressed in virtually all postmitotic neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems of mice (7Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The necdin gene is expressed in postmitotic neurons derived from embryonal carcinoma cells, but not in transformed cell lines originating from neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas even after they are induced to differentiate (7Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In developing mouse brain, the necdin gene is constitutively expressed in neurons from early embryonal stages (e.g. embryonic day 10 at the forebrain) until adulthood, whereas necdin mRNA is undetectable in neuronal precursor cells (i.e. neuroepithelial stem cells) in the neural tube (8Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that necdin is expressed in postmitotic neurons that are differentiated from their precursor cells in an irreversible manner. Furthermore, the fact that ectopic expression of necdin strongly suppresses the growth of proliferative NIH3T3 cells (9Hayashi Y. Matsuyama K. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) leads to the speculation that necdin acts as a growth suppressor in postmitotic neurons. The tumor suppressor gene products Rb and p53 are nuclear proteins that interact with transforming proteins encoded by small DNA tumor viruses such as simian virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, and human papillomavirus (10Weinberg R.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). For example, SV40 large T antigen binds to both Rb and p53, whereas adenovirus E1A and E1B form specific complexes with Rb and p53, respectively. These viral transforming proteins target cellular growth suppressors that are operative in normal cells. Here we demonstrate that necdin binds to SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1A, both of which interact with Rb. Moreover, we found that necdin, like Rb, interacts with the transcription factor E2F1, which promotes cell-cycle progression. Necdin functionally replaces Rb as a growth suppressor in Rb-deficient SAOS-2 cells, leading to the suggestion that necdin is a neuron-specific growth suppressor that is functionally similar to Rb. Necdin cDNA-carrying p94BFL was transfected into COS-1 cells by DEAE-dextran method as described (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells 48 h after transfection (11Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar), separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. The membrane was incubated with the antibody against necdin (antibody C2) (1:500) (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or anti-SV40 large T antigen monoclonal antibody (1:500) (a gift from Dr. N. Yamaguchi, University of Tokyo). The proteins were detected by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique using a kit (Vector Labs). For immunoprecipitation of necdin-large T antigen complex, the nuclear extract was dialyzed against buffer N (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated with antibody C2 for 1 h at room temperature. After adding the equal volume of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) slurry suspended in buffer N, the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. Immune complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot with the anti-large T antigen antibody. For immunoprecipitation of necdin-E2F1 complex, cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged E2F1 (amino acids 55–430), necdin (amino acids 1–325), and necdinΔN (amino acids 110–325) were inserted into pRc/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen) to make pRc-E2F1*, pRc-necdin, and pRc-necdinΔN, respectively. Mouse E2F1 cDNA used was prepared from mRNA of P19 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and confirmed to be identical with the reported sequence (12Li Y. Slansky J.E. Myers D.J. Drinkwater N.R. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1861-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sets of these expression vectors and the expression vector for SV40 large T antigen (pEF321-T, a gift of Dr. S. Sugano, University of Tokyo) were transfected into ∼70% confluent SAOS-2 cells in a 60-mm dish by the calcium phosphate method (13Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts and their immunoprecipitates of cDNA-transfected SAOS-2 cells were prepared, and the proteins were detected by antibodies C2 and anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak) as described above. GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector (pGBT9), GAL4 activation domain vector (pGAD424), pTD1 encoding SV40 large T antigen, and pVA3 encoding mouse p53 were purchased fromCLONTECH. Rb cDNA and adenovirus type 5 E1A gene were provided by Dr. T. Akiyama (Osaka University) and Dr. K. Shiroki (University of Tokyo), respectively. DNA fragments for hybrid proteins were generated by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers with restriction sequences at both ends. After treatment with respective restriction enzymes, the fragments were directionally inserted in pGBT9 and pGAD424, and introduced intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae SFY 526. Transformants were spread onto a 100-mm dish, and selected for both leucine and tryptophan requirements. The above procedure and colony lift filter assay for β-galactosidase activity were carried out as recommended by CLONTECH. The reaction was evaluated 4 ranks with the time for the appearance of blue colonies at 30 °C: +++, less than 2 h; ++, 2–6 h; +, 6–12 h; −, remaining white over 12 h. EcoRI-BamHI fragments were excised from inserted cDNAs in pGAD424, and subcloned directionally into pMALC2 (New England Biolabs) to make maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins, which were purified as recommended by New England Biolabs. RNA was synthesized in vitro by transcribing linearized Bluescript II (Stratagene) carrying cDNA for necdin (amino acids 1–325) or Rb (amino acids 379–928) with T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) supplemented with [35S]methionine (Amersham). For the large T antigen binding, 10 μl of the translation reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 150 μl of binding buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing MBP fusion proteins bound to amylose resin (5 μg). For E1A binding, 10 μl of the translation reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 150 μl of binding buffer B (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing MBP fusion proteins bound to amylose resin (5 μg). After washing three times with binding buffer A, bound35S-labeled proteins were eluted with 20 mmmaltose, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Three wild-type E2F motifs (14Zamanian M. LaThangue N.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2603-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were linked to the minimal L23 gene promoter (15Uetsuki T. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 1990: 2562-2569Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and inserted in the luciferase reporter plasmid PGV-B (Toyo Ink). SV40 early promoter and human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoter were excised from PGV-C (Toyo Ink) and pEF-BOS (a gift from Dr. S. Nagata, Osaka University), respectively, inserted in PGV-B, and used as controls. cDNAs encoding Rb (amino acids 379–928) and E2F1 (amino acids 55–430) were inserted in pRc/CMV to make pRc-Rb and pRc-E2F1, respectively. Sets of plasmids were co-transfected into ∼70% confluent SAOS-2 cells in a 35-mm dish by the calcium phosphate method (13Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold). A LacZ reporter plasmid (pRc-LacZ) was constructed by inserting pCH110-derived LacZ gene in pRc/CMV, and co-transfected (1 μg/assay) with the reporter genes for normalizing the activities. The assay was carried out as described previously (16Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar): SAOS-2 cells were grown to ∼70% confluence, and transfected with pRc/CMV, pRc-necdin, pRc-necdinΔN, or pRc-Rb (10 μg each per 60-mm dish) by the calcium phosphate method (13Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). G418 (500 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. The cells were incubated for 14 days, fixed with 10% acetate, 10% methanol for 15 min, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 15 min for visualizing the colonies. For immunocytochemistry, SAOS-2 cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min on ice, permeabilized with methanol at 25 °C, stained with antibody C2 by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method (Vector Labs), and photographed with a phase-contrast microscope. COS-1 cells, a monkey kidney cell line transformed by SV40, constitutively express the large T antigen, which forms stable complexes with Rb and p53 (17Manfredi J.J. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously found that ectopic necdin is accumulated in the nucleus of cDNA-transfected COS-1 cells (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To examine whether necdin interacts with SV40 large T antigen in the nucleus in vivo, necdin cDNA was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. By Western blot analysis, similar levels of the large T antigen were present in untransfected and necdin cDNA-transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2), and a ∼45-kDa band of necdin was detected in the cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). The large T antigen was co-immunoprecipitated with necdin from the nuclear extract of the cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 4, compared with negative controls in lanes 2 and3), suggesting that ectopic necdin forms a specific complex with the large T antigen in the nucleus in vivo. We then examined the interaction between necdin and the large T antigen by the yeast two-hybrid assay. We first examined whether necdin fused to GAL4 DNA-binding protein stimulates the transcription in this assay even in the absence of GAL4 activation domain fusions (Fig.2). Full-length necdin (amino acids 1–325) showed a high reporter activity, suggesting that necdin possesses a transactivation domain. The amino (N)-terminal region (amino acids 1–100), which is highly acidic (calculated pI = 3.9) and proline-rich (21%) (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was deleted to make three truncated forms, which showed reduced reporter activities. The truncated form of amino acids 83–325 exhibited no longer transactivation. Therefore, we used this truncated form as a DNA-binding domain fusion in the following two-hybrid assay. Necdin strongly bound to the large T antigen (amino acids 84–708, T) with which both Rb and p53 interacted (Fig.3 A). The Rb-binding domain of the large T antigen comprises the region exhibiting cellular transforming activity (18DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.-Y. Huang C.-M. Lee W.-H. Marsilio E. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 275-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), and is distinct from the p53-binding domains (17Manfredi J.J. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the NH2 terminus of T (amino acids 84–120) including the Rb-binding domain was deleted to make TΔN (amino acids 121–708) for testing whether necdin interacts with this region. Neither necdin nor Rb bound to TΔN, but p53 still interacted with the truncated form. This suggests that necdin and Rb share a specific binding site of the large T antigen. We then examined the direct interaction between necdin and the large T antigen by in vitro binding assay (Fig. 3 B). Like Rb, necdin bound to T fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-T), but not to MBP-TΔN, suggesting that necdin directly binds to the NH2 terminus of the large T antigen, which comprises Rb-binding region.Figure 3Necdin interacts with SV40 large T antigen. A, yeast two-hybrid assay. Combinations of GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusions (pGBT9 inserts: necdin (amino acids 83–325), Rb (amino acids 379–928), p53 (amino acids 72–390)) and GAL4 activation domain fusions (pGAD424 inserts: large T antigen (amino acids 84–708, T) and NH2-terminally truncated T (amino acids 121–708, TΔN)) were introduced into yeast cells. The Rb- and p53-binding domains are indicated. B, in vitro binding assay.35S-Labeled necdin (amino acids 1–325) (left panel) and Rb (amino acids 379–928) (right panel) were incubated with immobilized MBP (lanes 2), MBP-TΔN (lanes 3), and MBP-T (lanes 4). The bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography.Lanes 1, in vitro translated products (input).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rb forms a specific complex with adenovirus oncoproteins E1A, whereas p53 interacts with E1B (10Weinberg R.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Rb-binding sites of the large T antigen and E1A contain the LXCXE motif (X = any amino acid) (19Adams P.D. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our data that necdin and Rb share the ability to bind to the NH2 terminus of the large T antigen led us to examine whether necdin interacts with adenovirus E1A. We used part of the E1A gene (amino acids 1–185) including three functional domains designated conserved regions (CR) 1–3, of which CR1 and CR2 possess transforming activities (20Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Both necdin and Rb bound to E1A (amino acids 1–185), with which p53 failed to interact (Fig.4 A). We then tested whether necdin binds to three types of deletion mutants; E1AΔCR2 (lacking CR2), E1AΔCR2/3 (lacking CR2 and CR3), and E1A-CR3 (containing only CR3). Necdin bound weakly but significantly to both E1AΔCR2 and E1AΔCR2/3, but failed to bind to E1A-CR3. On the other hand, Rb failed to bind to the three deletion mutants. It was confirmed, byin vitro binding assay, that both necdin and Rb bound to E1A (Fig. 4 B). Necdin bound, albeit weakly, to E1AΔCR2 (Fig.4 B, left panel, lane 3) and E1AΔCR2/3 (data not shown). Since CR2 contains the LXCXE motif (19Adams P.D. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it is suggested that this motif is less requisite for binding to necdin. Since necdin and Rb show similar, if not identical, binding characteristics toward the large T antigen and E1A, we then examined whether necdin interacts with cellular Rb-binding factor E2F, which directly regulates the transcription of a diverse set of genes involved in DNA replication and cell growth control (19Adams P.D. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the binding of necdin to E2F1 by the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 5 A). Both necdin and Rb bound to F2F1 (amino acids 55–430), which covers the domains for cyclin A binding, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation that comprises the Rb-binding domain (19Adams P.D. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Necdin bound weakly to a carboxyl (COOH)-terminally truncated form lacking the Rb-binding domain (21Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) (E2F1ΔRB), but failed to interact with a form devoid of the entire transactivation domain (22Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) (E2F1ΔTA). These results suggest that necdin binds to the transactivation domain of E2F1 to modulate E2F-driven transcription. Since SAOS-2 cells are established osteosarcoma cells lacking functional Rb, we chose this cell line to test the ability of necdin to form a nuclear complex with E2F1 in the absence of interference with Rb. We examined the interaction between necdin and E2F1 in vivo by immunoprecipitating the nuclear extracts from cDNA-transfected SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 5 B). Expression vectors carrying cDNAs for FLAG-tagged E2F1 and necdin were transfected into SAOS-2 cells, in which FLAG-E2F1 and necdin showed single bands at ∼60 and ∼45 kDa, respectively (upper panels). FLAG-E2F1 was co-precipitated with necdin from the nuclear extract of SAOS-2 cells transfected with both cDNAs (lower left panel, lane 4) Conversely, necdin was present in the complex precipitated with FLAG-E2F1 (lower right panel, lane 8). This cDNA transfection experiment demonstrated that necdin and E2F1 form a nuclear complex in SAOS-2 cells. We determined the functional domain of necdin required for the interactions with the large T antigen, E1A, and E2F1 using various NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 6 A). Necdin (amino acids 102–325) retained the ability to bind to the large T antigen and E2F1, but failed to interact with E1A, suggesting that amino acids 83–101 are requisite for binding to E1A. Further deletion of the NH2 terminus of necdin (amino acids 110–325 and 167–325) resulted in a failure of binding to these proteins. On the other hand, a COOH-terminally truncated form (amino acids 83–292) of necdin retained the ability to bind to these proteins, but further COOH-terminal deletion (amino acid 83–279) completely eliminated the binding activity. These data suggest that the central region of amino acids 83–292 is important for the interactions with these three proteins. We then examined whether the NH2-terminally truncated form of necdin (necdinΔN, amino acids 110–325) is unable to interact with E2F1 in SAOS-2 cells in vivo (Fig. 6 B). NecdinΔN, like full-length necdin, was stably expressed in the transfected cells (upper panel), but failed to interact with E2F1 (lower panel) in agreement with the finding in the two-hybrid system. Since SV40 large T antigen and E2F1 share the binding domain of necdin, the competition between the large T antigen and E2F1 for binding to necdin was examined in SAOS-2 cells in vivo (Fig. 6 C). The large T antigen was stably expressed (upper panel), and reduced the E2F1 content in the immunoprecipitates (lower panel), implying that the large T antigen antagonizes the formation of necdin-E2F1 complex in the nuclei of SAOS-2 cells in vivo. We then examined whether necdin represses E2F-driven transcription in vivo using SAOS-2 cells (Fig.7 A). Necdin and Rb reduced the basal (intrinsic) E2F site-dependent transcription to 57 and 40%, respectively. E2F1 increased 13-fold the basal transcriptional activity, and necdin and Rb repressed the activation to 41 and 52%, respectively. Necdin had no effect on SV40 early promoter activity. In this analysis, the suppression of E2F site-dependent transcription by the truncated form of Rb (amino acids 379–928) was weaker than the previous report in which full-length Rb was used (23Hiebert S.W. Chellappan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We analyzed the expression of Rb in transfected SAOS-2 cells by Western blotting, and found that a considerable amount of Rb immunoreactivity underwent degradation (data not shown), inferring that the weak suppression by Rb is attributable, at least in part, to its metabolic instability. The inhibition of E2F1-driven transcriptional activity by necdin was concentration-dependent, and the maximum suppression was ∼30% of the control value (Fig. 7 B, left panel). On the other hand, the NH2-terminally truncated form of necdin (necdinΔN, amino acids 110–325), which lacks E2F1 binding activity, exhibited no inhibition. Full-length necdin showed no inhibition of EF-1α promoter activities at the concentrations that repressed the E2F site-dependent transactivation (Fig. 7 B, right panel). These results suggest that necdin specifically suppresses E2F1-driven transcription in vivo by interacting with the transactivation domain of E2F1. SAOS-2 cells are Rb-deficient osteosarcoma cells, whose growth is inhibited by reintroduction of wild-type Rb (16Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Expression of the functional domain of Rb (amino acids 379–928) suppresses the formation of macroscopic colonies of SAOS-2 cells (16Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the growth suppressive effect of necdin in this assay system. Ectopic necdin markedly suppressed the colony formation of transfected SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 8 A). On the other hand, the NH2-terminally truncated necdin (necdinΔN, amino acids 110–325) exerted little or no growth suppression of SAOS-2 cells. To rule out the possibility that the repressed colony formation by necdin is attributable to its cytotoxicity, we analyzed the levels of necdin expressed in these transfectants. Similar amounts of necdin were detected in cell lysates from the 4- and 18-day cultures (Fig.8 B), suggesting that the suppression by necdin is due to its constitutive expression and not to the cytotoxic effect. Immunoreactive necdin was localized to the nuclei of transfected SAOS-2 cells (Fig.8 C). Moreover, the necdin-positive cells exhibited a severalfold increase in size, a typical phenotype displayed by Rb cDNA-transfected SAOS-2 cells (16Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These results suggest that necdin serves as a substitute for Rb in these Rb-deficient cells. This study has shown that necdin interacts with SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1A, both of which possess cellular transforming activities. Necdin bound to the NH2-terminal region of the large T antigen (amino acids 84–120) (see Fig. 3). The NH2-terminal fragment of the large T antigen (amino acids 1–120) induces cellular transformation, and missense mutations and short deletions in this region are defective in transformation (17Manfredi J.J. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, necdin potentially inhibits the transforming activity of the large T antigen by binding to the NH2-terminal region. Moreover, necdin bound to the region encompassing two conserved regions, CR1 and CR2 of E1A (see Fig. 4), both of which are responsible for cellular transformation and induction of cellular DNA synthesis (20Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We failed to obtain replication-defective recombinant adenovirus carrying necdin cDNA from 293 cells, a cell line constitutively expressing adenovirus oncoproteins, 2T. Uetsuki and K. Yoshikawa, unpublished observations. suggesting that ectopic necdin inactivates endogenous E1A that promotes the replication of adenovirus DNA. These findings raise the possibility that necdin modifies or neutralizes the transforming activities of these viral oncoproteins. Conversely, it seems likely that these viral oncoproteins target necdin for cellular transformation because this nuclear protein is normally involved in growth-suppressive mechanisms. Necdin is functionally similar, but structurally dissimilar to Rb. Besides necdin and Rb, two Rb-related proteins, p107 and p130, interact with the large T antigen and E1A (24Whyte P. Cancer Biology. 1995; 6: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These Rb family proteins are structurally similar, and comprise the binding region designated “pocket domain,” with which various factors such as viral oncoproteins and cellular transcription factors interact (25Kouzarides T. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Necdin consists of 325 amino acid residues (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), much smaller than Rb family proteins, and no homologous sequences are found between necdin and Rb family proteins. We found recently that amino acid sequences of the core functional domain of necdin (amino acids 83–292, see Fig. 6) are highly conserved (91% identity) between human and mouse, whereas the sequences of the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 1–82) are less conserved (60% identity). 3Y. Nakada and K. Yoshikawa, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, this region may be evolutionally conserved because of its functional importance. The biological significance of the formation of necdin-E2F1 complex in postmitotic neurons remained to be elucidated: postmitotic neurons differentiated from P19 cells contain high levels of mRNAs for E2F1 (5Slack R.S. Skerjanc I.S. Lach B. Craig J. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), necdin (6Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and Rb (4Slack R.S. Hamel P.A. Bladon T.S. Gill R.M. McBurney M.W. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1585-1591PubMed Google Scholar), leading to speculation that E2F1 activities in these neurons are regulated by Rb and necdin in combination. As shown presently, necdin binds to the transactivation domain of E2F1, and represses E2F1-induced transactivation in vivo. E2F-binding sites exist within the promoters of a number of cellular genes involved in cell-cycle progression (19Adams P.D. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that necdin, in cooperation with Rb, suppresses the expression of a battery of genes required for DNA replication by silencing E2F1 in postmitotic neurons. We are currently investigating whether necdin substantially controls E2F1 functions in postmitotic neurons by transferring cDNAs encoding necdin and E2F1 using recombinant adenovirus vectors. Rb is expressed in both neuroepithelial stem cells and postmitotic neurons (26Okano H.J. Pfaff D.W. Gibbs R.B. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2930-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus potentially induces growth arrest of the stem cells at the very beginning of neuronal differentiation. On the other hand, necdin is expressed only in postmitotic neurons (7Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that necdin has a function to keep differentiated neurons staying in the postmitotic state. Rb loses its growth inhibitory functions upon phosphorylation by D-type cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (27Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these cyclins and kinases physiologically coexist with the Rb-E2F system in postmitotic neurons (5Slack R.S. Skerjanc I.S. Lach B. Craig J. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Freeman R.S. Estus S. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). If Rb is the sole molecule that arrests the cell cycle of differentiated neurons, then pathological or accidental phosphorylation of Rb would lead quiescent neurons to undergo abortive mitosis and death. Thus, necdin might be involved in a “fail-safe” mechanism, complementing Rb to prevent postmitotic neurons from resuming cell division. Studies using necdin-defective animal models are currently under way in our laboratory to clarify the implications of necdin in neuronal postmitotic phenotype in vivo. Further information about interactions between necdin and cell-cycle regulatory machinery will lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying permanent quiescence displayed by all nerve cells.

Inhibitor A was slightly more hydrophilic than ouabain on RP-C18 high pressure liquid chromatography. Hence, it showed properties similar to the proscillaridin A immunoreactivity (Sich, B., Kirch, U., Tepel, M., Zideck, W., and Schoner, W.

All other properties, such as the retention time in a C18-reversed phase chromatography, molecular mass determination by electrospray mass spectrometry and fragmentation pattern, and UV and 1H NMR spectroscopic data, were identical to ouabain.

Since the cardiac glycoside binding site of the sodium pump has been conserved over the millennia, it has been suggested that endogenous cardiac glycosides may exist. In fact, a material cross-reacting with antibodies against ouabain, digoxin, and digitoxin and inhibiting the sodium pump circulates in increased concentrations in the blood of patients with low renin essential hypertension (1De Wardener H.E.

There has been an intensive search for such substances that has led to the isolation of an ouabain-like inhibitor of the sodium pump from human plasma (5Hamlyn J.M. Blaustein M.P. Bova S. DuCharme D.W. Harris D.W. Mandel F. Matthews W.R. Ludens J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6259-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and an attempt to isolate an isomer of ouabain from bovine hypothalamus (6Tymiak A.A. Norman J.A. Bolgar M. Didonato G.C. Lee H. Parker W.L. Lo L.C. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Haber E. Haupert Jr., G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8189-8193Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nanogram scale CD structural analysis indicates that both substances show similar properties but are not identical with ouabain (7Zhao N. Lo L.-C. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Tymiak A.A. Ludens J.H. Haupert Jr., G.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9893-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has been shown in a number of investigations that both compounds show inotropic effects and increase the contractility of arterial blood vessels (8Haupert Jr., G.T. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1994: 732-742Crossref Google Scholar, 9Hamlyn J.M. Manunta P. Hamilton B.P. Laragh J.H. Bernner B.M. Hypertension: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Management. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1995: 1069-1081Google Scholar). They may, therefore, be a new type of steroid hormone involved in the genesis of low renin essential hypertension (2Haddy F.J. Buckalew Jr., V.M. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension, Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Management. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1995: 1055-1067Google Scholar, 3Goto A. Yamada K. Yagi N. Yoshioka M. Sugimoto T. Pharmacol.

Consistent with such a possibility, the release of material cross-reacting with ouabain antibodies has been demonstrated in vitro from zona glomerulosa cells of bovine adrenals upon the addition of ACTH and angiotensin II (10Laredo J. Shah J.R. Lu Z. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Laredo J. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Additionally, other cardenolides have been isolated from human and rat urine, namely a substance indistinguishable from digoxin from human urine (12Goto A. Ishiguro T. Yamada K. Ishii M. Yoshioka M. Eguchi C. Shimura M. Sugimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1093-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and neoconvalloside as well as the monorhamnoside of periplogenin from rat urine. The latter two compounds cross-reacted with anti-ouabain and anti-digoxin antibodies but originated in the diet of the rats (13Tamura M. Harris T.M. Phillips D. Blair I.A. Wang Y.F. Hellerqvist C.G. Lam S.K. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11972-11979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A substance of unknown nature and indistinguishable in its mode of action from ouabain, but differing in its molecular mass (below 350 Da), was purified from bovine adrenals (14Tamura M. Lam T.-T. Inagami T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4244-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This substance, called adrexin C, differed in its properties from another yet unidentified inhibitor of the sodium pump, called uroxin, that was isolated from pig urine and had a molecular mass of 620 Da (15Tamura M. Harris T.M. Konishi F. Inagami T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was concluded that at least two different types of endogenous inhibitors of the sodium pump in the mammalian body exist (16Tamura M. Naruse M. Sakakibara M. Inagami T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In fact, other inhibitors of the sodium pump of the bufadienolide type of cardiotonic steroids have been identified; a substance was isolated from human cataractous lenses that was identified as 19-norbufalin and a peptide derivative thereof (17Lichtstein D. Gati I. Samuelov S. Berson D. Rozeman Y. Landau L. Deutsch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A compound similar to the amphibian bufadienolide marinobufagenin was isolated and identified from human urine (18Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V. Dimitrieva R.I. Am. J. Hyperten. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and a substance from human placentas with a molecular mass of 370 Da was tentatively identified as a dihydropyrone-substituted steroid, possibly a 3β,14α,20:21-bufadienolide (19Hilton P.J. White R.W. Lord G.A. Garner G.V. Gordon D.B. Hilton M.J. Forni L.G. McKinnon W. Ismail F.M.D. Keeman M. Jones K. Morden W.E. Lancet. 1996; 348: 303-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Starting from the idea that mammals may, like toads, be able to synthesize bufadienolides, we recently demonstrated that a compound is circulating in increased concentrations in patients with hypertension, which cross-reacts with antibodies against proscillaridin A (20Sich B. Kirch U. Tepel M. Zideck W. Schoner W. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The compound differed in its mode of action from ouabain insofar as its concentration did not correlate with the diastolic blood pressure, albeit it had a similar HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone.retention time to that of ouabain. It was clearly neither ouabain nor marinobufagenin, since the antibodies against proscillaridin A did not cross-react with these cardiotonic steroids. Since bovine adrenals have been identified as a gland where synthesis and release of cardiotonic steroids may occur (5Hamlyn J.M. Blaustein M.P. Bova S. DuCharme D.W. Harris D.W. Mandel F. Matthews W.R. Ludens J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6259-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 9Hamlyn J.M. Manunta P. Hamilton B.P. Laragh J.H. Bernner B.M.

Hypertension. 1997; 29: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we intended to isolate this substance and to show that the material cross-reacting with anti-proscillaridin A-IgG differs from the known endogenous inhibitors of the sodium pump. The work presented here shows that besides ouabain an additional inhibitor of the sodium pump of molecular mass 600 Da can be isolated. This compound cross-reacts with antibodies against proscillaridin A but from its different UV spectrum does not seem to be a bufadienolide or a cardenolide. A preliminary report has been given in abstract form (21Schneider R. Wray V. Nimtz M. Lehmann D. Li S.-Q. Eim C. Antolovic R. Kost H. Mohadjerani M. Sich B. Schoner W. Am. J. Hyperten. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies against ouabain from rabbits were a kind gift of Prof. R. E. Lang (Dept. of Physiology, University of Marburg, Germany). Immunochemicals were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch and Dianova (Hamburg), 86RbCl was from Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig), and Silicon oil AR 200 and 20 were from Wacker Chemie (München). All other chemicals were of the highest available purity.AssaysInhibition of 86RbCl Uptake into Red Blood CellsThis was essentially performed as described previously using a silicon oil centrifugation technique in Eppendorf cups (20Sich B.

The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min and 9,000 ×g in a rotor GS3 of a Sorvall RC2B refrigerated centrifuge. The supernatant was decanted. The sediment was resuspended in the same volume of methanol and stirred for 60 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged a second time, and the combined supernatants were brought to dryness using a Büchi rotatory evaporator. This extraction of 16 kg of bovine adrenals resulted in 297 g of a dark brown greasy material.Acetone ExtractionThis residue was suspended in acetone and stirred for about 20 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 6,500 × g, the supernatant was decanted and concentrated by rotatory evaporation. The sediment was extracted again with acetone in the same way, and this procedure was repeated until the yellow color had disappeared.Ultrafiltration of the Sediment from the Acetone ExtractionThe sediment fraction (84.5 g) was suspended in 5 liters of distilled water, and the suspension was filtered through OMEGA polyether sulfon membrane filters with an exclusion size of 10, 3, and 1 kDa using a Filtron Pro Vario-3-System and a pressure <3 bar. The filtrate that had passed the filter with a 1-kDa exclusion volume was lyophilized.Flash ChromatographyThe residue was dissolved in ∼100 ml of 70% methanol. Any insoluble material was removed by Schleicher & Schuell 595½ filters. The fluid was added to a 5 × 15-cm Bakerbond™ Octadecyl-C18-column (40-μm particle size) that had been equilibrated with water. After washing with 4,000 ml of distilled water at a flow rate of 25 ml/min, the inhibitor was eluted with 2,000 ml of 70% methanol. Fractions eluting at 2,000 ml of 80, 90, and 100% methanol showed no inhibitory potency. The 70% methanol fraction was brought to dryness by rotatory evaporation.First HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-RP18The residue dissolved in a small amount of distilled water was applied in small volumes to a 20 × 250-mm column filled with Lichrospher 100-18-10-RP-C18 (10-μm particle size). A linear 0–100% methanol gradient in 60 min was applied at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. A Merck-Hitachi HPLC with L-6200 Intelligent Pump, L-3000 photodiode array detector, LC-Organizer, and D-2000 Chromato-Intergrator was used. The absorbance at 220 nm was recorded, and 4-ml fractions were taken. The inhibitor eluted at 44–49-min retention time.Second HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-RP18The concentrated fractions of the inhibitor were rechromatographed on the same column using a linear 5–30% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70 min and a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and samples eluting with a retention time of 45–46 min were concentrated by evaporation.Third and Fourth HPLC Chromatography on a Nucleosil-Phenyl ColumnThe residue was dissolved in a small amount of distilled water and applied onto a Nucleosil-120-7-C6H5column (7-μm particle size; 4 × 250 mm), and a shallow gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (linear gradient of 5–10% acetonitrile in 10 min, isocratic elution at 10% acetonitrile for 40 min and then increased to 30% acetonitrile within the next 10 min and thereafter up to 100% acetonitrile within the next 10 min). The inhibitor eluted with a retention time of 13–14 min. This step was repeated using the fraction with a retention time of 13–14 min. The fractions eluting at 13–14-min retention time were concentrated.Fifth HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-5-NH2ColumnAlthough the fraction obtained in the previous step seemed homogenous when recorded at 220 nm, ESI-MS analysis revealed major impurities. Therefore, the material was applied onto a 4 × 250-mm column of Lichrospher 100–5-NH2 (5-μm particle size), and a descending gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (100–90% within 10 min; flow rate, 1 ml/min; recording wave length, 250 nm) was used. The substance eluted heterogeneously in the void volume. Fractions with a retention time of 2–3 min were concentrated.Sixth HPLC Chromatography on Lichrocart 100-3-CNThe residue was taken up in distilled water and applied onto a 4 × 250-mm Lichrocart 100-3-CN (3-μm particle size), and a isocratic elution with 1% ammonium acetate, pH 5.8 (90 parts), acetonitrile (10 parts), and dioxane (10 parts) was started with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were recorded at 220 and 250 nm. The inhibitor eluted at 13.5 min and an impurity at 11.5 min.Seventh HPLC Chromatography on Nucleosil 100-3 RP 18The fraction eluting at 13.5-min retention time was applied onto a 4 × 250-mm Nucleosil 100-3 RP 18 column (3-μm particle size) and eluted with 20% acetonitrile containing 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluate was recorded at 220 and 250 nm, and the fraction with a retention time of 6.6 min was concentrated.Purification of Sodium Pump Inhibitor BMethanol ExtractionFrozen bovine adrenals (20 kg) were homogenized in 1-kg portions with 5 liters of methanol in a blender for 3 min. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 9,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted, and the sediment was extracted again with 5 liters of methanol with stirring for 60 min. After sedimentation of the insoluble material under the above conditions, supernatants were combined and concentrated by rotatory evaporation. A brownish gluey material (615 g) was obtained.Soxhlet Extraction with ChloroformThe residue from the above was subjected in fractions of 12.5 g to a Soxhlet extraction with 1 liter of chloroform. The procedure was terminated when the chloroform phase in the extracting funnel was no longer brownish in color. The defatted residue (250 g) was then removed from the paper funnel and dried. This residue was extracted with ethanol and gave 45 g after flash evaporation.UltrafiltrationThis material was taken up in ethanol, diluted with water, and subjected to ultrafiltration under the conditions described for compound A. The filtrate with a molecular size <1,000 Da gave 44 g of a powdery dark brown material upon lyophilization.First HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-RP 18The residue was taken up in distilled water and applied to a 20 × 250-ml column filled with Lichrospher 100-18-10-RP-C18 (particle size: 10 μm) of a GAT high pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with LC 1110 HPLC pump, DI 510 interphase, LC 11210 UV-visible detector, LC 1431 organizer, LCD 501 UV-visible detector, and a DP900 chromatography data station. The column was run at 4 ml/min. for 60 min with a 0–100% methanol linear gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the eluate was recorded at 220 nm. Fractions of 4 ml were collected, and the inhibition of 86Rb+ uptake into human red blood cells was measured for the individual fractions after the evaporation of methanol. Fractions with a retention time of 70–100 min were combined and dried (yield: 5.9 g).Second HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-RP 18The fractions with inhibitory action (retention time: 44–49 min from the previous purification step) were dissolved in distilled water and applied again onto the same column. A methanol gradient with a flow rate of 10 ml/min was applied, which increased within 15 min. from 5 to 30% methanol, followed by a steep rise to 95% methanol to 40-min retention time. Fractions (10 ml) were collected. The inhibitor eluted at a retention time of 3–37 min and was dried (yield: 3.2 g).Third HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-RP 18The inhibitor obtained from the previous step was dissolved in distilled water and applied again onto the same column. A linear methanol gradient with a flow rate of 10 ml/min was applied at an initial concentration of 5% methanol, increased to 65% methanol within 25 min, and increased subsequently to 95% methanol within the next 5 min. The inhibitor eluted with a retention time of 21–22 min. The fractions were combined and lyophilized (yield: 127 mg).Fourth HPLC Chromatography on Lichrospher 100-RP 18To refine the purification, the inhibitor was dissolved in distilled water and applied onto the same preparatory column, and a shallow linear gradient from 5 to 35% methanol within 60 min was applied. The inhibitor eluting with a retention time of 58–63 min was evaporated (yield: 6 mg).Fifth HPLC Chromatography on Nucleosil 120-7-C6H5The inhibitor was dissolved in distilled water and applied onto a 4 × 250-mm column filled with Nucleosil 120-7-C6H5 (particle size: 7 μm). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with 5% methanol for 15 min, followed by a linear rise for 10 min to 10% methanol and then by a linear rise to 30% methanol within the next 30 min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the inhibitor was found at 33.7–36.0-min retention time (yield: 1.19 mg).Sixth HPLC Chromatography on a Hypersil Phenyl ColumnTo achieve a better resolution, the sample was rechromatographed on the same type of column (4 × 150 mm) with a smaller particle size (5 μm) using the same gradient. Two peaks were detected with a retention time of 47.2 and 52.3 min. These were collected and evaporated (yield: 71 μg).Seventh HPLC Chromatography on a Nucleosil 100-3 RP 18 ColumnThe fraction with a retention time of 52.3 min from the previous chromatography was dissolved in 100 μl of H2O, and aliquots of 20 μl were chromatographed on a 4 × 250-mm column filled with Nucleosil 100–3 RP 18 (3-μm particle size), and a gradient with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min of 5–95% methanol in 60 min was applied. A single peak with a retention time of 47.2 min was visible at 220 nm, which was again collected by hand and evaporated (yield: 20 μg).DISCUSSIONAdrenals have previously been shown to be a good source for the isolation of inhibitors of the sodium pump (14Tamura M. Lam T.-T. Inagami T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4244-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Tamura M. Naruse M. Sakakibara M. Inagami T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is evident from the above studies that bovine adrenals contain two different inhibitors. However, neither of these is identical with the one described by Tamura et al. as adrexin C (14Tamura M. Lam T.-T. Inagami T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4244-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Tamura M. Naruse M. Sakakibara M. Inagami T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although this compound showed properties similar to ouabain, its molecular weight differed. Inhibitor B, which cross-reacted with antibodies against the cardenolide ouabain was purified 106 times from bovine adrenals. According to the 1H NMR and ESI-MS spectral data, it is indistinguishable from ouabain (Figs. 9 and 10). Even high resolution 1H NMR did not reveal any significant differences from authentic ouabain (Fig. 10). This conclusion is also supported by the biological assays. Inhibitor B inhibited the sodium pumps of human and rat erythrocytes like ouabain and interacted with anti-ouabain antibodies (Figs. 7 and 8). This finding is in contrast to the behavior of the ouabain isomer found in the hypothalamus. It binds with a much higher affinity to the α1 isoenzyme of the rat than the plant-derived ouabain (25Ferrandi M. Minotti E. Salardi S. Florio M. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F739-F748PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, all available data support the conclusion that ouabain and not its isomer was extracted from bovine adrenals. This finding is puzzling insofar as it was reported that both the ouabain-like substances from human plasma and bovine hypothalamus are isomers of ouabain (7Zhao N. Lo L.-C. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Tymiak A.A. Ludens J.H. Haupert Jr., G.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9893-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); this would therefore suggest that bovine plasma may also contain the ouabain isomer as well, although this has not been confirmed to date. Whether bovine adrenals secrete ouabain or its isomer into the plasma will be of considerable interest. From the finding that ouabain-immunoreactive material is released from bovine adrenal cortical cells in tissue culture by ACTH and angiotensin II (10Laredo J. Shah J.R. Lu Z. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Laredo J. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and that the released amount is higher after incubation of the cells with pregnenolone and progesterone, one may conclude that ouabain is synthesized there from these precursors (26Perrin A. Brasmes B. Chambaz E.M. Defaye G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 126: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is stored there. Eventually, this may be valid also for other tissues, since the hypothalamus and adrenal glands of rat and cow are the richest sources of ouabain and proscillaridin A immunoreactivities (27Ludens J.H. Clark M.A. Robinson F.G. DuCharme D.W. Hypertension. 1992; 19: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 2Li, S.-Q., Eim, C., Kirch, U., Lang, R. E., and Schoner, W. (1998) Life Sci., in press. However, one could also envisage the possibility that ouabain is taken up from the gut and accumulated by adrenal cortical cells (28Kitano S. Morimoto S. Fukuo K. Yasuda S. Kaimoto T. Ogiwara T. Ther. Res. 1993; 14: 201-206Google Scholar, 29Hinson J.P. Dawnay A.B. Raven P.W. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 146: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), stored there, and isomerized upon secretion. However, we may not exclude the possibility that species differences exist with respect to the circulating endogenous ouabain in humans and cows. This question can only be resolved by the isolation of endogenous ouabain from bovine plasma.Inhibitor A, which cross-reacted with antibodies against the bufadienolide proscillaridin A but not against ouabain (Fig. 4), is definitely not a classical bufadienolide, since the substance of 600 Da (Fig. 5) has a UV maximum not at 300 but at 250 nm (Fig. 3). Derivatives of cardiotonic steroids with a UV maximum at 250 nm have been described (30Fieser L. Fieser M. Steroide. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1961: 801-892Google Scholar), but the molecular mass and the mass fragmentation pattern of inhibitor A is inconsistent with hitherto known cardiotonic steroids; it is also unlikely that the more hydrophilic inhibitor A is a degradation product of ouabain (inhibitor B). Inhibitor A resembles in its retention time and immunological properties the substance whose concentration was found elevated in humans with increased systolic blood pressure (but not diastolic blood pressure) and hence increased pulse pressure (20Sich B. Kirch U. Tepel M. Zideck W. Schoner W. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Apparently, the type of action of inhibitor A differs from that of ouabain. It is unclear at the present time why several inhibitors of the sodium pump with cardiac glycoside-like action exist (17Lichtstein D. Gati I. Samuelov S. Berson D. Rozeman Y. Landau L. Deutsch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V. Dimitrieva R.I. Am. J. Hyperten. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hilton P.J. White R.W. Lord G.A. Garner G.V. Gordon D.B. Hilton M.J. Forni L.G. McKinnon W. Ismail F.M.D. Keeman M. Jones K. Morden W.E. Lancet. 1996; 348: 303-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Do they address different target isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase in different target cells? Since the cardiac glycoside binding site of the sodium pump has been conserved over the millennia, it has been suggested that endogenous cardiac glycosides may exist. In fact, a material cross-reacting with antibodies against ouabain, digoxin, and digitoxin and inhibiting the sodium pump circulates in increased concentrations in the blood of patients with low renin essential hypertension (1De Wardener H.E.

To clarify the function of RalBP1, we isolated a novel protein that interacts with RalBP1 by yeast two-hybrid screening and designated it POB1 (partner of RalBP1). POB1 consists of 521 amino acids, shares a homology with Eps15, which has been identified as an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor substrate, and has two proline-rich motifs. The POB1 mRNA was expressed in cerebrum, cerebellum, lung, kidney, and testis. POB1 interacted with RalBP1 in COS cells and the C-terminal region of POB1 was responsible for this interaction. The binding domain of RalBP1 to POB1 was distinct from its binding domain to Ral. Ral and POB1 simultaneously interacted with RalBP1 in COS cells. The binding of POB1 to RalBP1 did not affect the GTPase activating activity of RalBP1. Furthermore, POB1 bound to Grb2 but not to Nck or Crk. POB1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS cells upon stimulation with EGF and made a complex with EGF receptor. These results suggest that RalBP1 makes a complex with POB1 and that this complex may provide a link between tyrosine kinase, Src homology 3 (SH3)-containing protein, and Ral.

Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As well as other small G proteins, Ral has the GDP-bound inactive and the GTP-bound active forms. The GDP-bound form of Ral is converted to the GTP-bound form by RalGDS, and inversely the GTP-bound form is changed to the GDP-bound form by RalGAP (3Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We and other groups have found that RalGDS is a putative effector protein of Ras (5Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since RalGDS stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange of Ral (4Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it is possible that there is a new signaling pathway from Ras to Ral through RalGDS. Indeed, it has been shown that RalGDS stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange of Ral in a Ras-dependent manner in COS cells and that a dominant negative form of Ral blocks a Ras-dependent transformation in NIH3T3 cells (8Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been also demonstrated that Ral is required for Src- and Ras-dependent activation of phospholipase D and that it regulates the initiation of border cell migration induced by Ras in Drosophila oogenesis (9Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 10Lee T. Feig L.A. Montell D.J. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 409-418PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that RalGDS and Raf synergistically stimulate cellular proliferation and gene expression (11White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Okazaki M. Kishida S. Hinoi T. Hasegawa T. Tamada M. Kataoka T. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results indicate that RalGDS and Ral act downstream of Ras and mediate Ras functions. However, the mechanism by which Ral regulates cellular functions is not known. One possible clue to clarify the mode of action of Ral is RalBP1 (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol.

RalBP1 has a Ral-binding domain in its C-terminal region and binds to the GTP-bound form of Ral but not to the GDP-bound form. A mutation in the effector loop of Ral impairs its interaction with RalBP1 and RalBP1 inhibits the RalGAP activity for Ral (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Hinoi T. Kishida S. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Matsuura Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19710-19716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RalBP1 is an effector protein of Ral. RalBP1 also has a RhoGAP homology domain in its central region and exhibits the GAP activity for Rac1 and CDC42 but not for RhoA (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R. Tavitian A. Gacon G. Camonis J.H. J. Biol.

Recently we have found that Ral localized to the membrane through its post-translational modification induces translocation of RalBP1 from the cytosol to the membrane and that the post-translational modifications of Rac1 and CDC42 enhance the GAP activity of RalBP1 (17Matsubara K. Hinoi T. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, RalBP1 may link Ral to Rac or CDC42 on the membrane. However, there is no evidence obtained so far that RalBP1 regulates the activities of Rac and CDC42 in intact cells. It is not known whether RalBP1 has additional activities. To gain more insight into the action of RalBP1, we sought to isolate proteins which interact with RalBP1 by yeast two-hybrid screening. We describe here the isolation of a novel RalBP1-interacting protein, which is designated POB1 (partner of RalBP1). POB1 shares a homology with Eps15, which has been identified as an EGF receptor substrate (18Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and has two proline-rich motifs. POB1 and Ral simultaneously interact with RalBP1 on the different sites and these proteins make a ternary complex. Furthermore, POB1 binds to Grb2, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in COS cells in response to EGF, and makes a complex with EGF receptor. These results suggest that RalBP1 and POB1 may provide a link between tyrosine kinase, SH3-containing protein, and Ral.

Yeast strain L40 (MAT a trp1 leu2 his3 ade2 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was used as a host for the two-hybrid screening (27Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown on rich medium (YAPD) containing 2% glucose, 2% Bacto-peptone, 1% Bacto-yeast extracts, and 0.002% adenine sulfate. Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method. Transformants were selected on SD medium containing 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and appropriate amino acids, which were supplemented to SD medium when required. A strain L40 carrying pBTM116HA/RalBP1 was transformed with a human brain cDNA library constructed in pGAD10. pBTM116HA/RalBP1 directs the expression of a fusion between the DNA-binding domain of LexA and the entire RalBP1 from an ADH promoter. Approximately 6 × 106 transformants were screened for the growth on SD plate medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine as evidenced by transactivation of a LexA-HIS3reporter gene and histidine prototrophy. His+ colonies were scored for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids harboring cDNAs were recovered from positive colonies and introduced by electroporation into E. coli HB101 on the M9 plate lacking leucine. HB101 isleuB −, and this defect can be complemented by the LEU2 gene in the library plasmid. Then library plasmids were recovered from HB101 and transformed again into L40 containing pBTM116HA/RalBP1. The nucleotide sequences of plasmid DNAs, which conferred the LacZ+ phenotype on L40 containing pBTM116HA/RalBP1, were determined. The clone identified by the yeast two-hybrid method contained a region that interacted with RalBP1 and the 3′-end but did not contain the 5′-end of an open reading frame. To obtain full-length cDNA, the clone was labeled with random primers and [α-32P]dCTP and used to screen λgt10 human brain cDNA library. However, the initial screening did not identify the 5′-end of the gene. To obtain more 5′ sequence information, the 5′-most 650 nucleotides of the largest clone was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to screen the same library, and a number of positive clones were isolated. All clones, collectively spanning 3.2 kb, were sequenced using double-strand templates and Thermo Sequenase premixed cycle sequencing kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and Hitachi DNA sequencer SQ-5500 (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To construct full-length POB1 cDNA clone, the cDNA fragment containing POB1 codons 10–521 (amino acid numbers) from the initial screening was subcloned into pUC19. The cDNA fragment containing POB1 codons 1–253 (amino acid numbers) from the second screening was jointed to this sequence to obtain pUC19/POB1. Total RNA was extracted from various rat tissues as described (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar).

The GAP activity of RalBP1 for the post-translationally modified Rac1 was measured in the presence of GST-POB1-(375–521) as described (17Matsubara K. Hinoi T. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that physically interact with RalBP1, we conducted a human brain cDNA library screening with the yeast two-hybrid method. From 6 × 106 initial transformants, we identified five positive clones (His+ and LacZ+) and the library plasmids were recovered from the clones. Among these five plasmids, three clones were found to confer both the His+and LacZ+ phenotypes on L40 containing pBTM116HA/RalBP1. The cDNA inserts from these three clones were 1 kb, and all encoded a single sequence containing an open reading frame of 147 amino acids and the consensus sequence for a stop codon. To identify full-length cDNA of this RalBP1-interacting protein, a human brain cDNA library was screened using the cDNA isolated by the yeast two-hybrid method and a number of overlapping positive clones were isolated. The overlapping clones spanned a distance of 3.2 kb and contained an uninterrupted open reading frame of 1563 base pairs, encoding a predicted protein of 521 amino acids with a calculated M r of 57,901 (Fig.1 A). We designated this protein POB1 for partner of RalBP1. The first ATG was preceded by stop codons in all three reading frames and the 5′-noncoding region had a high percentage of GC base pairs (72%). The second amino acid was also Met. The neighboring sequence of the second ATG was consistent with the translation initiation start proposed by Kozak (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar) better than that of the first ATG, but we could not determine which is the first Met. Data bases were searched for related proteins. Besides short human EST sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers; R90985, H44097, T72336, T72376,R88729, H44028, W38942, G27820, N89827, and AA191588), no protein closely related to POB1 was identified. However, the central region of POB1, residues 126–227, shares 37% amino acid identity with residues 111–211 of Eps15, which has been identified as an EGF receptor substrate (18Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C). The C-terminal region has two proline-rich motifs, PPTPPPRP (amino acids 338–345) and PPPPALPPRP (amino acids 374–383), and a putative coiled-coil structure (Fig. 1 B). By Northern blot analysis, a single band was strongly detected in RNA of rat cerebrum, cerebellum, lung, and testis, and weakly in kidney, but not in heart, thymus, liver, spleen, or adrenal gland (Fig.2). This tissue distribution of POB1 was different from that of RalBP1, which is ubiquitously expressed in rat various tissues (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Park S.H. Weinberg R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2349-2355PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether POB1 interacts with RalBP1 in intact cells, we coexpressed HA-POB1 with Myc-RalBP1 in COS cells (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–3). The lower bands, which were seen under POB1, might be its degradation products. When the lysates coexpressing HA-POB1 with Myc-RalBP1 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, both HA-POB1 and Myc-RalBP1 were detected in the RalBP1 immune complex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). Similarly when the same lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, both HA-POB1 and Myc-RalBP1 were detected in the POB1 immune complex (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). Neither HA-POB1 nor Myc-RalBP1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates coexpressing HA-POB1 and Myc-RalBP1 with non-immune immunoglobulin (data not shown). These results indicate that POB1 interacts with RalBP1 in intact cells. By the yeast two-hybrid screening, POB1-(375–521) was identified as a RalBP1-binding domain. We examined whether this domain is essential for the binding of POB1 to RalBP1. Myc-RalBP1 was coexpressed with HA-POB1-(1–374) or HA-POB1-(375–521) in COS cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and5). When the lysates coexpressing Myc-RalBP1 with HA-POB1-(1–374) or HA-POB1-(375–521) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, HA-POB1-(375–521), but not HA-POB1-(1–374), was detected in the RalBP1 immune complex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4 and5). Similarly when the same lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, Myc-RalBP1 was detected in the POB1-(375–521) immune complex but not in the POB1-(1–374) immune complex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that POB1-(375–521) is necessary and sufficient for the binding of POB1 to RalBP1. To examine which region of RalBP1 interacts with POB1, various RalBP1 deletion mutants were purified as MBP fused to proteins and POB1-(375–521) was purified as a GST fused to protein from E. coli (Fig.4 A). After MBP-RalBP1 deletion mutants were incubated with GST-POB1-(375–521), the amylose resin was added. The resin was precipitated by centrifugation, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. POB1-(375–521) interacted with full-length RalBP1, RalBP1-(364–647), and RalBP1-(500–647) but not with RalBP1-(1–210), RalBP1-(210–415), or RalBP1-(391–499) (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the binding of POB1 to RalBP1 is direct and that the C-terminal region of RalBP1 has the POB1-binding domain. It has been shown that the GTP-bound form of Ral binds to the C-terminal region of RalBP1 (RalBP1-(364–647)) (13Cantor S.B. Urano T. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell.

In previous studies we showed that limited proDyn processing by PC1/PC3 at both paired and single basic residues resulted in the formation of 8- and 10-kDa intermediates. Because PC2 is colocalized with proDyn, we examined the potential role of this convertase in cleaving proDyn. PC2 cleaved proDyn to produce dynorphin (Dyn) A 1–17, Dyn B 1–13, and α-neo-endorphin, without a previous requirement for PC1/PC3. PC2 also cleaved at single basic residues, resulting in the formation of the C-peptide and Dyn A 1–8. Only PC2, but not furin or PC1/PC3, could cleave the Arg-Pro bond to yield Dyn 1–8. Structure-activity studies with Dyn A 1–17 showed that a P4 Arg residue is important for single basic cleavage by PC2 and that the P1′ Pro residue impedes processing. Conversion of Dyn A 1–17 or Dyn B 1–13 into leucine-enkephalin (Leu-Enk) by PC2 was never observed; however, Dyn AB 1–32 cleavage yielded small amounts of Leu-Enk, suggesting that Leu-Enk can be generated from the proDyn precursor only through a specific pathway. Finally, PC2 cleavages at single and paired basic residues were enhanced when carried out in the presence of carboxypeptidase (CP) E. Enhancement was blocked by GEMSA, a specific inhibitor of CPE activity, and could be duplicated by other carboxypeptidases, including CPD, CPB, or CPM. Our data suggest that carboxypeptidase activity enhances PC2 processing by the elimination of product inhibition caused by basic residue-extended peptides.

Our data suggest that carboxypeptidase activity enhances PC2 processing by the elimination of product inhibition caused by basic residue-extended peptides. Opioid peptides are produced by the endoproteolytic processing of three distinct polypeptide precursors: proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin (proDyn). 1The abbreviations used are: proDyn, prodynorphin; Leu-Enk, leucine-enkephalin; Dyn, dynorphin; αNE, α-neo-endorphin; PC, proprotein convertase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CP, carboxypeptidase; RIA, radioimmunoassay; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; GEMSA, guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid; PACE, paired amino acid cleaving enzyme; CT, C-terminal; MCA, aminomethylcoumarin. 1The abbreviations used are: proDyn, prodynorphin; Leu-Enk, leucine-enkephalin; Dyn, dynorphin; αNE, α-neo-endorphin; PC, proprotein convertase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CP, carboxypeptidase; RIA, radioimmunoassay; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; GEMSA, guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid; PACE, paired amino acid cleaving enzyme; CT, C-terminal; MCA, aminomethylcoumarin. ProDyn is the precursor of leucine-enkephalin (Leu-Enk) C-terminally extended sequences including dynorphin (Dyn) A 1–17, Dyn A 1–8, Dyn B 1–13, and α-neo-endorphin (αNE) (1Civelli O. Douglass J.O. Goldstein A. Herbert E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4291-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Flanking single and paired basic residue cleavage sites are observed within the proDyn precursor (see Fig. 1). Even though proDyn processing appears to be a complex model to study processing (2Day R. Trujillo K.A. Akil H. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 104/I (1993): 449-470Crossref Google Scholar), it is common for neuropeptide precursors to have multiple cleavage sites. It is interesting to note that in vivo processing of this precursor results in defined sets of neuropeptide products such as Dyn A 1–17 and Dyn B 1–13, but little if any Leu-Enk is ever observed in the same neurons (2Day R. Trujillo K.A. Akil H. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 104/I (1993): 449-470Crossref Google Scholar, 3Khachaturian H. Lewis M.E. Tsou K. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1985; 8: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This suggests that not all apparent basic residue cleavage sites are used within the secretory pathway or that the intracellular processing enzymes responsible for proDyn processing have specific preferences for these processing sites. As with other neuropeptide precursors, the paired basic residues within proDyn are most likely processed by the family of enzymes known as the proprotein convertases (PCs) (4Seidah N.G. Day R.

Akil H. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 104/I (1993): 449-470Crossref Google Scholar). In previous studies we tested the cleavage specificity of PC1/PC3 for proDyn (22Dupuy A. Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Akil H. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Day R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PC1/PC3 cleaved proDyn at both single and paired basic residues to yield processing intermediates of 8 and 10 kDa (Fig. 1). This study suggested that further processing by another enzyme(s) was required to achieve biologically active opioid peptides. Based on the processing profiles of other protein precursors such as proopiomelanocortin (23Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Marcinkiewicz M. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Day R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 563-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we concluded that PC2 was the best candidate to produce the expected final proDyn products. Processing of protein precursors also requires the action of carboxypeptidases to yield a fully mature peptide (28Fricker L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Once endoproteolysis has occurred C-terminal to a single or paired basic residue site, a carboxypeptidase is required for C-terminal trimming of the basic residue(s). Although CPE was long thought to be the only carboxypeptidase to carry out this function within secretory pathways, novel carboxypeptidases have now been discovered that carry out this function, including CPD (29Xin X. Varlamov O. Day R. Dong W. Bridgett M.M. Leiter E.H. Fricker L. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This study focuses on proDyn processing by PC2 and examines the importance of carboxypeptidase activity on the efficiency of PC2 activity. The rat proDyn cRNA probe was transcribed from a BamHI-HincII fragment of 733 nucleotides subcloned into pGEM4. The cRNA for rat PC2, achieved by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from a rat striatum library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) represents a 425-base pair fragment covering the rat sequence from bases 1812 to 2236 (7Seidah N.G. Gaspar L. Mion P. Marcinkiewicz M. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. DNA (N. Y.). 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar).35S-UTP and 35S-CTP (1250 Ci/mmol, Amersham) were used for radioactive label. The in situ hybridization colocalization studies were carried out as described previously (30Schäfer M.K.-H. Day R. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 16-44Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used for these studies. Sections were simultaneously hybridized with an 35S-UTP/35S-CTP-labeled PC2 cRNA probe (specific activity, 2.6 × 105 Ci/mmol) and a digoxigenin-UTP-labeled proDyn cRNA probe. ProDyn mRNA signal appeared as dark blue (or purple) staining, whereas PC2 mRNA appeared as silver autoradiographic grains, which could be revealed as white grains when viewed in dark field light microscope observations. Controls for specificity of hybridization were carried out by pretreatment of brain sections with RNase A or by the use of sense strand probes of the same size and specific activity. No specific labeling was observed in these experiments. Recombinant mouse proPC2 was purified from the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary PC2/7B2 cells as described previously (31Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Three different preparations were used during the course of the work with similar results. Rat proDyn was overexpressed in dhfr− Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described previously (22Dupuy A. Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Akil H. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Day R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). No significant loss of PC2 activity is observed when the enzyme is incubated at temperatures below 42.5 °C (31Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The specific activity of PC2 was 0.9 nmol/h/μg using the Cbz-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin substrate. Recombinant mouse PC1/PC3 and furin were purified from baculovirus (32Boudreault A. Seidah N.S. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 97Google Scholar). Each of these proteins was purified to apparent homogeneity. Analysis was carried out using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie staining or Western blotting using specific antibodies. The peptides Dyn A 1–17, Dyn A 1–8, Dyn A 1–9, porcine leumorphin, Dyn AB 1–32, and Dyn A 2–17 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Dyn A 1–17 peptide analogs (see Fig. 5) were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using Fast-Moc chemistry (33Basak A. Schmidt C. Ismail A.A. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Int. J. Pep. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The following side chain protecting groups were used:tert-butyloxy-carbonyl for Lys, tert-butyl for Tyr and Asp, trityl (triphenylmethyl) for Trp, and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl for Arg side chains, respectively. The crude peptides obtained upon cleavage from the resin and complete deprotection were purified by reverse phase HPLC performed on a semi-prep CSC-Excil C18 column (25 × 1.0 cm, Chromatography Sciences Co., St. Laurent, QC, Canada) using a linear gradient of 20–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were fully characterized by electron spray mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Between 5 and 20 μg of purified recombinant proDyn or various proDyn-derived synthetic peptides were incubated with PC2 (200 ng/reaction). The incubations were carried out in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2and 0.1% Brij-30. Incubation times varied from 30 min to 24 h depending on the experiment. In some experiments different carboxypeptidases were coincubated in the reaction mixture. These included CPE, CPD, CPM (provided by Dr. Lloyd Fricker, Albert Einstein College of Medicine), and CPB (Sigma). The specific activity of CPE was determined using the substrate dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg. 10 ng of CPE completely cleave 50 nmol of Ala-Arg bonds in 1 h. In the described experiments, where CPE was used, excess CPE conditions (>200 ng/24 h incubation) were always added to ensure that all C-terminal basic residues would be cleaved. Similar conditions (>200 ng/reaction) were also applied with the other carboxypeptidases, CPD, CPM, and CPB. To terminate the reaction, the samples were diluted 1:1 (vol:vol) with acidified methanol (0.1 n HCl). The samples were then submitted to gel filtration chromatography or reverse phase HPLC analysis. For HPLC, the samples were injected using an automated injector system (Hitachi L-7200) onto a Beckman 5-μm C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm). The samples were separated using a 15–35% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid increasing at a rate of 0.5%/min. Peaks were detected by UV light at 210 nm and evaluated by peak height. All integrations were performed automatically with the Hitachi D-7000 HPLC System Manager program. HPLC fractions were dried down and submitted to amino acid analysis. Gel chromatography was performed using Sephadex G-50 using a running buffer of 0.1% formic acid with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (34Day R. Akil H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). G-50 fractions were collected, dried, resuspended, and submitted to RIA. For both HPLC and G-50 chromatography peptide standards were run under the same conditions were used to determine the elution times of the peptide of interest. For the G-50 chromatography dextran blue and cobalt chloride were also used as markers of void and total volumes, respectively. The recovery yields for gel chromatography (≥85%) and HPLC analysis (95%) have been determined using radioactively labeled peptides as described previously (34Day R. Akil H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The antibodies for Dyn A 1–17, Dyn A 1–8, Dyn B 1–13, C-peptide, and αNE were generously provided by Dr. Huda Akil (University of Michigan) and have been extensively characterized under RIA conditions (34Day R.

The Dyn B 1–13 and αNE antibodies are C terminus-directed, and under RIA conditions, neither antibody can recognize intermediates containing a hindered antigenic site at the C terminus. The C-peptide antibody recognizes any proDyn-derived intermediate with a C-peptide in its C terminus. The effect of CPE on the hydrolysis of Cbz-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin (MCA) by PC2 was studied in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 6 ng of activated PC2, 200 mm substrate, in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 mm calcium chloride and 0.1% Brij-30. Reactions were carried out in duplicate, and the liberated aminomethylcoumarin was estimated by fluorometry at the time intervals stated. The experiment was repeated once with similar results. In Fig. 2, we provide direct evidence of the colocalization of proDyn and PC2 in the central nervous system. Using a combined in situ hybridization technique, we observed PC2 mRNA within proDyn expressing neurons in the striatum. Other brain regions were also examined, including the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, the hippocampus, and the cortex. In each of these regions, proDyn and PC2 mRNA colocalization was observed. However, anterior lobe gonadotrophs, which are known to express proDyn (38Khachaturian H. Sherman T.G. Lloyd R. Civelli O. Douglass J. Herbert E. Akil H. Watson S.J. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1409-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), co-expressed PC1/PC3 but not PC2. 2R. Day and W. Dong, unpublished observation. To determine whether PC2 was important in the formation of biologically active opioid peptides, we tested the effect of PC2 on proDyn precursor processing in vitro. Purified recombinant proDyn and PC2 were incubated overnight and fractionated using size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3, A andB) and HPLC chromatography (Fig. 3, C,D, E, and F). The same experiment was also carried out in the presence of CPE (Fig. 3 B). The fractions were analyzed with RIAs using well characterized antibodies (34Day R. Akil H. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to different regions of proDyn. The data demonstrated that PC2 could generate each of the biologically active opioid peptides, including Dyn A 1–17 (Fig. 3 D), Dyn B (Fig. 3 E), and αNE (Fig. 3 F), from the proDyn precursor protein. Processing intermediates (10 kDa) were observed (Fig. 3, Aand B), and smaller intermediates such as Dyn AB 1–32 were also identified (data not shown). Because processing of the proDyn precursor was not complete, the values of each of the obtained final opioid products examined vary as seen in Fig. 3 (C,D, E, and F). For example, in the case of Dyn A 1–17, the immunoreactive content varies from 1 to 3 nmol, whereas C-peptide immunoreactivity is in the 20–40-nmol range. It should be remembered that the Dyn A 1–17 peptide was further processed to Dyn A 1–8 and that significant levels of Dyn AB 1–32 were also observed, both peptide species contributing to the lower Dyn A 1–17 immunoreactivity observed in the HPLC fractions collected. In addition three other observations were made: 1) an extensive processing of the proDyn C-peptide was observed (Fig. 3, A,B, and C) providing evidence that PC2 cleaved at single basic residues; 2) Dyn A 1–8 immunoreactivity was detected in the chromatographed samples (data not shown). Processing of Dyn A 1–8 from proDyn requires cleavage at a single basic residue; and 3) coincubation of proDyn and PC2 in the presence of CPE resulted in an enhanced processing efficiency, as observed by the reduced quantities of proDyn high molecular weight intermediates and increased quantities of C-peptide produced (Fig. 3, A and B). The studies described below further explored each of these observations. We first studied the formation of Dyn A 1–8 by PC2 using Dyn A 1–17 as the peptide substrate (Fig. 4). Dyn A 1–17 peptide was incubated with determined amounts of PC2 active enzyme in an overnight incubation. The amount of PC2 activity was measured using a fluorogenic assay with the substrate pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA. Each sample was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC enabling the separation of each of the processed peptides. These experiments were carried out in the absence of CPE, and therefore if cleavage occurred in between the Arg↓Pro site of Dyn A 1–17, we would expect the formation of Dyn A 1–9 and Dyn A 10–17. The data demonstrated that Dyn A 1–17 was cleaved into two distinct peptides, which co-eluted with Dyn A 1–9 and Dyn A 10–17 peptide standards (Fig. 4 B). To obtain unequivocal identification of these peptides, the fractions were collected and submitted to amino acid analysis. The two peaks obtained were identified as Dyn A 1–9 and Dyn A 10–17. There was no evidence for the production of Leu-Enk-Arg-Arg (Dyn A 1–7), demonstrating that PC2 had a cleavage preference for the single basic residue site rather than a paired basic residue site in the Dyn A 1–17 substrate. In Fig.4 C, we tested the specificity of the cleavage reaction using the C-terminal (CT) peptide of 7B2. The CT peptide was shown to be a highly potent (i.e. at nm concentrations) and specific inhibitor of PC2 activity (41Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The CT peptide completely abolished the cleavage of Dyn A 1–17 by PC2. In similar in vitro assays, we tested whether recombinant purified PC1/PC3 or furin could also cleave Dyn A 1–17. The enzymatic activities were matched to that of PC2, based on the fluorogenic assay using the substrate pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA. Neither PC1/PC3 nor furin had any effect on the Dyn A 1–17 substrate, even using long incubation times (>24 h) or higher enzymatic concentrations (6-fold higher levels). To investigate the involvement of amino acids surrounding the single Arg cleavage site, we prepared a series of Dyn A 1–17 synthetic peptide analogs (Fig.5). Cleavage of each peptide was compared with the processing of Dyn A 1–17. The conditions were set such that the measured amount of PC2 activity (based on fluorogenic assay) cleaved 75% of the Dyn A 1–17 peptide. Substitution of Arg9 by Ala9 resulted in the complete lack of cleavage, demonstrating the importance of this basic residue and further confirming the site of PC2 cleavage. It is worth noting that PC2 was still unable to cleave the paired basic amino acid residues to produce Leu-Enk-Arg-Arg from [Ala9]-Dyn A 1–17. The [Lys9]-Dyn A 1–17 analog was inefficiently processed (1.3%), suggesting that a single Lys residues at the P1cleavage position produces a poor substrate. The [Ala6]-Dyn A 1–17 analog was not cleaved by PC2, whereas efficient cleavage of the [Ala7]-Dyn A 1–17 was observed, demonstrating that an Arg in P4 is important for cleavage of Dyn A 1–17, whereas an Arg in P3 is not. These data indicate that the motif RXXR is critical for the processing of Dyn A 1–17. Because a Pro residue at P1′ is predicted to impede processing, we tested an [Ala10]-Dyn A 1–17 analog. This peptide was more efficiently cleaved by PC2 than Dyn A 1–17. Other substitutions, with related Pro analogs, where Pro10 was replaced with DPro10 or hydroxy-Pro10 showed reduced cleavage. We also tested the influence of other basic residues located C-terminal to the cleavage site by synthesizing an [Ala11]-Dyn A 1–17 analog. This peptide analog was cleaved more efficiently by PC2, suggesting that the basic residue (i.e. Lys) at P2′ interferes with PC2 cleavage. Finally, we examined the peptide des[Tyr1]-Dyn A 1–17 (Dyn A 2–17). The Tyr residue is known to be conformationally important for interactions of Dyn A 1–17 with opioid receptors; however, the effect of conformation on processing is unexplored. The data show that des[Tyr1]-Dyn A 1–17 was well cleaved as compared with Dyn A 1–17 and that removal of the Tyr residue had only a minor effect on the ability of PC2 to cleave this peptide. As a comparative measure of PC2 processing at single basic residues, we investigated the single basic residue cleavage in leumorphin (Dyn B 1–29). In this peptide there is no Arg residue in the P4position; however, an Arg is found at P8 (Fig.6). The proDyn C-peptide was cleaved from recombinant proDyn by PC2, and thus we would also expect cleavage of leumorphin by PC2. Dyn B 1–29 was completely cleaved to yield Dyn B 1–14 (i.e. Arg-extended form of Dyn B 1–13) and Dyn B 15–29 (i.e. the proDyn C-peptide). Addition of CPE appears to result in more efficient processing of proDyn by PC2 (Fig. 3, A andB). Further evidence of the enhancement of PC2 processing produced by CPE is provided using the fluorogenic substrate Cbz-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA. This substrate was incubated with PC2 with or without the addition of CPE (Fig. 7). The addition of CPE resulted in a 25% increased PC2 processing efficiency. It was unclear whether this enhancement was due to carboxypeptidase activity or the CPE protein itself. We therefore tested the reversiblity of this effect using the specific CPE inhibitor GEMSA (Fig. 8). This test was carried out using Dyn A 1–17 as the substrate. PC2 cleaved Dyn A 1–17 into Dyn A 1–9 and Dyn A 10–17 (Fig. 8 B). The addition of CPE (Fig.8 C), resulted in the formation of Dyn A 1–8 instead of Dyn A 1–9, as verified by amino acid composition and a shift in retention time. Processing was more efficient in the presence of CPE (Fig.8 C compared with 8B), as determined by the reduced amount of remaining Dyn A 1–17 substrate and the concomitant increase in Dyn A 10–17 product. Based on repeated experiments, Dyn A 1–17 was cleaved with 24 ± 2% (n = 3) better efficiency in the presence of CPE. However, the addition of 100 mm GEMSA to the reaction mixture completely reversed the effect (Fig. 8 D), because only Dyn A 1–9 was formed, and the levels of Dyn A 1–17 substrate remaining were identical to those in Fig. 8 B. The same experiment was repeated using CPE that had been boiled for 5 min, with the result that no enhancement of PC2 processing was observed. Finally, we also tested the effects of other carboxypeptidases including CPD, CPM, and CPB. In all cases, we obtained an identical enhancement of PC2 processing (ranging from 21 to 26%). The above data suggested that CPE was enhancing PC2 processing by its C-terminal trimming activity on the Dyn A 1–9 product. This would also suggest that product inhibition of PC2 was occurring. To examine this possibility, we incubated the substrate Dyn A 1–17 with PC2 with increasing concentrations of exogenous Dyn A 1–9 peptide. We then measured the levels of Dyn A 1–17 remaining, as well as the formation of the Dyn A 10–17 product (Fig. 9). Under the conditions used, initially almost 50% of the Dyn A 1–17 substrate was processed. However, with increasing concentrations of Dyn A 1–9 (50–400 mm), the levels of Dyn A 1–17 processing dropped (as measured by an increase in peak height). Concomitant decreased levels of the Dyn A 10–17 peptide product were also observed (as measured by a decrease in peak height). We further investigated the enhancement effect of CPE on PC2 processing using a more complex peptide that has multiple cleavage sites. Dyn AB 1–32 is an intermediate in the formation of Dyn A 1–17 and Dyn B 1–13. Within this peptide, four potential cleavage sites are found (i.e.two Arg-Arg sites, one Lys-Arg site, and a single Arg) (Fig.10). The incubation of PC2 and Dyn AB 1–32 resulted in the formation of only Dyn A 1–19 (i.e.Lys-Arg extended) and Dyn B 1–13 (Fig. 10 B). We could not detect the formation of either Dyn A 1–9 or"

Lp(a) is a lipoprotein consisting of low density lipoprotein to which is covalently linked a unique protein, apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) (3Scanu A.M. Fless G.M. J. Clin.

Apo(a) is a large, highly polymorphic glycoprotein with sequence homology to plasminogen. Depending on individual alleles, it contains from 12 to 50 copies of a domain which resembles kringle four of plasminogen, plus a single kringle five-like domain, and an inactive protease domain (5McLean J.W.

By competing with plasminogen for fibrin binding through its apo(a) component, Lp(a) can reduce the conversion of plasminogen to the active plasmin and inhibit clot lysis (7Harpel P.C. Gordon B.R.

By a similar mechanism, Lp(a) can reduce plasmin-dependent activation of latent transforming growth factor-β, resulting in smooth muscle cell activation, lipid accumulation, and inflammatory damage to the endothelium (10Grainger D.J.

Transgenic mice expressing the human apo(a) gene are more susceptible to the development of fatty streak-type lesions when fed a high fat diet, and they exhibit prolonged fibrinolysis (12Lawn R.M.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The concentration of Lp(a) in human plasma varies about 1000-fold in the population and is inherited in a Mendelian co-dominant fashion. Roughly 97% of this variation maps to the locus of the apo(a) gene (14Boerwinkle E. Leffert C.C. Lin J. Lackner C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 15DeMeester C.A. Bu X. Puppione D. Gray R.M. Lusis A.J. Rotter J.I. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 287-293Google Scholar, 16Kraft H.G. Kochl S. Menzel H.J. Sandholzer C. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Hence, the regulation of apo(a) gene expression is significant in controlling pathological plasma levels of Lp(a). About one half of the large variation of apo(a) plasma concentration is due to transcription efficiency, and one half to the post-transcriptional effects of size polymorphism (16Kraft H.G. Kochl S. Menzel H.J. Sandholzer C. Utermann G. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Since isoforms of apo(a) with greater numbers of kringle domains transit through the cell less rapidly and efficiently, there is a rough inverse correlation between size of apo(a) isoforms and plasma concentration (17Utermann G. Menzel H. Kraft H. Duba H. Kemmler G. Seitz C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 18White A.L. Hixson J.E. Rainwater D.L. Lanford R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, even within alleles matched for isoform size, there exists a greater than 200-fold range of plasma concentration (19Cohen J.C. Chiesa G. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

Transcription control is a likely cause of this variation. Numerous studies have found a large variation in apo(a) mRNA quantity in humans and primates, which corresponds with plasma concentration in most cases (23Hixson J.E. Britten M.L. Manis G.S. Rainwater D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6013-6016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Koschinsky M.L. Beisiegel U. Henne-Bruns D. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13866-13872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the liver-specific expression of the apo(a) gene is partly mediated by the apo(a) proximal promoter, which is located from −98 to +130 relative to its transcription start site and responds to the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1α (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are several indications that additional transcriptional regulatory elements must contribute to the high levels of apo(a) gene expression: activity of this core promoter is relatively weak in in vitro transfection assays, it does not account for the sex hormone responsiveness of the apo(a) gene, and it contains far less sequence polymorphism than could account for the inherited variation in gene expression, which is known to map to this locus. A further indication that regulatory sequences exist further 5′ to the apo(a) gene comes from transgenic mouse experiments. Deletion of the region 5′ to the apo(a) promoter from a yeast artificial chromosome severely compromises apo(a) expression in transgenic mice compared with a yeast artificial chromosome containing approximately 80 kb of upstream sequence. 2S. Hughes and E. Rubin, personal communication. 2S. Hughes and E. Rubin, personal communication. The apo(a) gene is part of a cluster of genes and pseudogenes on chromosome six which share over 70% sequence identity (28Magnaghi P. Citterio E. Malgaretti N. Acquati F. Ottolenghi S. Taramelli R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Byrne C.D. Schwartz K. Meer K.J. Cheng J.F. Lawn R.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 534-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apo(a) and the plasminogen genes are organized in a head to head configuration separated by about 40 kb. We have systematically tested this entire intergene region for additional apo(a) regulatory elements. In this study, we describe an apo(a) transcription control region (ACR) that is located 20 kb 5′ to the apo(a) transcription start site. The enhancer region contains an essential element responding to the members of the Ets transcription factor family. In addition, the binding of Sp1 as well as several other transcription factors around the Ets site also contributes to maximal enhancer activity. Unexpectedly, the apo(a) enhancer region resides within a LINE element. LINE 1 (L1) elements are long interspersed repeat elements that number from 50,000 to 100,000 in the human genome. Although greater than 90% of them are truncated, full-length L1s are approximately 6 kb in length and contain a 5′-untranslated region with internal transcription regulatory elements, two open reading frames, and a 3′-untranslated region that terminates in a poly(A) tail (30Swergold G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 31Singer M.F. Krek V. McMillan J.P. Swergold G.D. Thayer R.E.

Genomics. 1987; 1: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This is the first report of an L1 element affecting the expression of a flanking gene. In contrast, the corresponding regions from 10 other randomly selected human L1 elements were found to have reduced enhancer activity as well as one or more nucleotide differences in the core Ets binding site sequence. Hence the L1 element upstream of the apo(a) gene may represent a small subset of these repeat elements that have the ability to alter the expression of neighboring genes. Plasmid pGL3-1.4RI was constructed from pGLA1 (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with subsequent manipulation to create a unique EcoRI site and to remove unnecessary polylinker sequences. It contains human apo(a) genomic 5′ sequences from an EcoRI site 1.4 kb upstream of the transcription start site to an MscI site 130 bp downstream of the start site, fused to the luciferase gene in pGL3-basic (Promega). pGL3a is a similar luciferase reporter plasmid containing a fragment of the 5′-genomic sequence used above. It contains the minimal promoter of apo(a) from −98 to +130 (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and derives from pGL3-1.4RI by removal of an EcoRI-PvuII fragment and subsequent regeneration of the EcoRI site. A human genomic DNA library in the BAC plasmid (Genome Systems, Inc.) was screened with probes representing the 5′-flanking regions of apo(a) and plasminogen genes. One of the two positive clones (pBAC2), containing an insert of ∼150 kb, was confirmed to have the entire intergenic region as well as portions of the coding regions of both apo(a) and plasminogen genes by Southern blot analysis with apo(a) and plasminogen cDNA probes. EcoRI restriction fragments of pBAC2 DNA, as numbered in Fig. 1, were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) either directly after digestion of pBAC2 or following PCR amplification. The pBAC2 DNA was also double-digested with SacI and SalI for the purpose of cloning fragments 8b–d into pBluescript (Stratagene), taking advantage of the fact that there is only one SalI site in the entire pBAC2 insert. Fragments cloned into pBluescript were excised with EcoRI, SacI, or KpnI, and subcloned into pGL3a. In most cases, the fragments were initially tested in only one orientation relative to the transcription direction of luciferase based on the convenience of subcloning. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 2 × 105cells were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates 24 h prior to transfection by a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) as we described previously (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were done in triplicate. Briefly, 3 μg of pGL3-based luciferase expression plasmid and 1 μg of the control pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) control plasmid, together with or without 1 and 3 μg of Ets-1 expression plasmid were added to each well covered with 2 ml of culture medium. 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using the Dual Light Kit (Tropix, Inc.) according to the protocol provided. To control for transfection efficiency, results are reported as the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity. Fragments of genomic DNA in reporter plasmids were removed using available restriction sites. Specifically, construct nos. 3 and 6 (Fig. 2) were the result of removing a NheI fragment (one NheI site from the vector upstream of EcoRI, and the second one located at nucleotide 386 of L1, according to the L1 numbering system of Swergold (30Swergold G.D.

Construct nos. 4 and 5 are the internal deletion products of PstI orXhoI fragments, respectively, from construct no. 2. Construct nos. 7 and 8 were generated by cutting with PvuII and EcoRI either the negative or the positive orientation of the fragment 8b-containing plasmid. Construct nos. 9 and 10 were generated by inserting a PCR subfragment of 8b into theEcoRI site in pGL3a in both positive or negative orientations. This fragment was generated with PCR primers L1–3 (gatcgaattcGCTAGCACAGCAGTCTGA) and L1–4 (gtacgaattcAGCTGCGTGCTGGGAGA) to yield the enhancer-containing region corresponding to nucleotides 386–659 of L1 (lowercase letters denote added linker sequences). Site-specific mutagenesis was carried out according to the mismatch PCR primer protocol (33Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides L1–3 and L1–4 as the outside primers. The internal primers contained the mutations described in Fig. 5 A. The fragments were digested withEcoRI and subcloned into pGL3a and confirmed by sequencing prior to transfection assays. To test the enhancer containing fragment 8b with a heterologous promoter, it was ligated into theMluI and BglII sites of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) upstream of the SV40 early promoter. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were prepared as described previously (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprint protection analysis protocols were described previously (34Yang Z.Y. Romeo P.H. Bories D. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2201-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 35Gallarda J.L. Foley K.P. Yang Z.Y. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1845-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The sense strand of oligonucleotide probe (containing site A; underlined) used for gel mobility shift assay is CAAAGCAGCCCGGAAGCTCGAAC. The oligonucleotides containing mu-1, mu-2, and mu-3 used for the competition assays were the same as site A except mutated at the putative Ets site as indicated in Fig.3 A. The DNase I footprint probes were generated from construct nos. 9 and 10 (denoted ACR(+) and ACR(−); plus and minus strands from the positive or negative orientations of ACR) by first end-labeling the MluI site with γ-32P, and the radiolabeled inserts were then released by digestion withBglII. The sequence of the Sp1 oligonucleotide used in the footprint competition assay is aattcGCTGGGGGAGGGGCGCCg. The genetic locus of the apo(a) and plasminogen genes is shown in Fig.1. The apo(a) and plasminogen genes are organized in a head to head configuration with about a 40-kb intergenic region separating them (Fig. 1). This region was isolated in a BAC plasmid clone, designated pBAC2, which contains a 150-kb insert including the whole intergenic region plus parts of the apo(a) and the plasminogen genes (Fig. 1). As described under “Materials and Methods,” fragments encompassing the intergene region were ligated in front of the apo(a) minimal promoter and luciferase reporter cDNA. We previously described the core promoter region that spans nucleotides −98 to +130 relative to the transcription start site of the human apo(a) gene and responds to the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1α (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only two fragments produced activity significantly above the parent reporter plasmid containing only the core apo(a) promoter. One of these contains a previously described plasminogen enhancer located 2 kb upstream of the plasminogen transcription start site (36Meroni G Buraggi G. Mantovani R. Taramelli R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is not surprising to find that it enhances transcription in vitro from both apo(a) and plasminogen core promoters, since the two promoter regions contain about 90% sequence identity. The physiological relevance of the plasminogen enhancer on apo(a) gene expression remains to be evaluated. The most dramatic effector of apo(a) transcription was a 1.8-kb SacI-KpnI fragment that is located about 20 kb upstream of the apo(a) promoter (Fig. 1, fragment 8b; Fig. 2,construct nos. 1 and 2). It coincides with one of the four liver-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites, DH III, reported by Magnaghi et al. (37Magnaghi P. Mihalich A. Taramelli R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This 1.8-kb fragment is capable of enhancing apo(a) transcription in an orientation-independent manner and was therefore studied in detail. To locate the enhancer elements in this region, it was subjected to deletion analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, construct no. 7, deletion of theKpnI-PvuII fragment at the 5′ end of the 1.8-kbSacI-KpnI fragment (orientation relative to the apo(a) gene) resulted in a total loss of the enhancer activity, indicating the presence of essential positive elements within this region. By itself, this KpnI-PvuII fragment is sufficient to confer an over 10-fold activation (Fig. 2, no. 8). A further truncation (no. 6) yields a fragment without activity. We postulated that the functional enhancer domain resides within the 274-bp NheI-PvuII fragment, which gives a greater than 10-fold activation when ligated in either orientation 5′ to the apo(a) core promoter and luciferase cDNA (Fig. 2, nos. 9 and 10). We designated this the apo(a) transcription control region (ACR). Deleting substantial amounts of the 1.8-kb SacI-KpnI fragment downstream of the ACR (construct nos. 4, 5, 8,9, and 10) resulted in an increase of activity compared with the entire fragment, due either to potential silencer elements in these regions or to the nonspecific reduction in luciferase activity caused by increasing the size of the reporter plasmid. Liver-enhanced transcription of the apo(a) gene is determined chiefly by the core promoter region and not the ACR. We had previously shown that the apo(a) core promoter can drive transcription in hepatic HepG2 cells, but not in kidney-derived 293 cells or HeLa cells (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ligated to the core promoter, the ACR is able to direct robust transcription in HepG2 cells, but produces luciferase activity barely above background in 293 kidney cells or HeLa cells. In contrast, when ligated to the SV40 early promoter, it can stimulate transcription in all three cell types (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis surprisingly revealed that the ACR is located in the 5′-untranslated region of a highly repetitive L1 element. The ACR (NheI-PvuII fragment) is located from nucleotide 386–659 relative to the transcription start site of the consensus L1 element reported by Swergold (30Swergold G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This raised the question whether the enhancer activity is specific to ACR or is a universal property of all the L1s. To this end, primers L1–3 and L1–4, designed according to consensus L1 sequences, were used to generate by PCR this 274-nucleotide region from 10 random human L1 elements. When subcloned into the pGL3a expression plasmid, each of the random L1 fragments produced from 20 to 50% of the luciferase activity shown by the ACR construct in transfected HepG2 cells (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the 10 randomly selected L1 fragments revealed several scattered differences, consistent with the estimated 5% sequence difference among human L1 elements. Only two sites (Fig. 5 B,sites A and B, shaded) were found to be consistently different between the ACR and the random L1s. The ACR is the only one that contains a CCCGGAAG in its sequence within site A, while each of the random L1s has either CG,CA, TG, or GG at this position. At site B, the sequence of the ACR is a CA, but isGG in random L1s. (Site A, but not site B, was shown to be functionally active; see below.) Thus, the ACR may represent a genetically different class of L1 element that can serve as a more efficient enhancer of, at least, the apo(a) gene when located in its proximity. The sequence containing the site A, unique to the ACR, resembles the consensus binding site for the Ets family of transcription factors (38Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Three mutations were created to test its importance in enhancing expression from the apo(a) core promoter. As shown in Fig. 3 A, one, two, and five nucleotide substitutions increasingly disrupted the activity of the ACR. The effect of Ets-like proteins as trans-acting factors was demonstrated by co-transfection of the ACR reporter plasmid ACR(−) with an expression plasmid for the Ets-1 protein. The Ets-1 expression plasmid increased ACR-driven luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). However, Ets-1 protein fails to activate the ACR-driven expression to the same extent when the Ets binding site is disrupted. The residual enhancing activity produced by co-transfection with Ets-1 plasmid in this case may be the result of other weak Ets binding sites present in the ACR. Co-transfection of the Ets-1 plasmid had little effect on the activity of the core promoter region contained in pGL3a. These data strongly suggest that members of the Ets transcription factor family are capable of enhancing apo(a) gene expression through site A in the ACR. Further confirmation of the importance of this site was provided by gel mobility shift assays. An oligonucleotide encompassing site A was used as a probe to incubate with nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells (Fig. 3 C). A specific DNA-protein complex was observed that was effectively competed by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild type oligonucleotide (lane 3) but increasingly less so by unlabeled mutant site A oligonucleotides mu-1, mu-2, and mu-3 (lanes 4–6) and an irrelevant oligonucleotide (lane 7), consistent with the importance of an intact Ets-like factor binding site in the apo(a) enhancer. DNase I footprint analysis of the ACR was carried out to identify other DNA binding sites that may contribute to the ACR enhancer activity. Nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells protected eight regions of the 274-nucleotide ACR region from digestion with DNase I (Figs. 4 and5). Computer analysis of the ACR sequence revealed similarity to the consensus binding sites of transcription factors in most of the protected regions: AP-4 (footprint I); Sp1 (footprints II, V, andVI); CRE-BP (III); HNF-3β (III,VII), Ets-1 (IV); and Oct-1 (VIII). Footprint IV co-localizes with site A, the previously identified putative Ets binding site. A hallmark of Ets binding to the major groove of DNA is a DNase I protection region in the sense strand and a hypersensitive site on the antisense strand, similar to the pattern seen in Fig. 4 (38Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The specificity of footprints II, V, and VI was demonstrated by a competition assay. When 100-fold unlabeled oligonucleotide that spans the footprint II region (named Sp1 oligo, since it matches the Sp1 consensus binding site, see Refs. 39Briggs M. Kadonaga J. Bell S. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar and 40Kadonaga J. Carrier K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) was incubated together with the ACR probe (sense strand) and nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells, footprints II, V, and VI were abolished, confirming the specific occupancy of these sites by Sp1-related proteins in HepG2 nuclei (Fig.4, lanes 8 and 9). Thus, in addition to the Ets protein, transcription factor Sp1 is implicated in binding to the ACR. The identity of other binding proteins in this region awaits confirmation. To assess the effects of the other footprint binding sites within the ACR, we subjected the entire ACR to further deletion and mutagenesis analysis. Mutations were created in these sites and tested in transfection assays in HepG2 cells. Fig. 5 A shows each of the DNase I-protected sites boxed and numbered from I toVIII with mutations shown underneath in lowercase letters for base substitutions or as a line denoting a deletion mutation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, mutations of footprints II, III-2, and VI, as well as deletion of the first 50 nucleotides, which eliminates all of footprint I and most of footprint II, do not cause a significant reduction in luciferase expression, compared with those of the wild type ACR construct. Deletion of the region including footprints VII and VIII also had no significant effect (data not shown). (It is noteworthy that the mutation in footprint VI alters site B, which was earlier noted to be one of the two sites where the sequence of the ACR differed from the 10 random L1 examples.) In contrast, destruction of the binding sites for footprints III-1, III-3, IV, and V significantly reduce the enhancer activity. The identity of the transcription factors which bind to footprint III-1 and III-3 are unknown. Footprint IV represents the target recognition site for a member of the Ets family, while footprint V is a likely target of an Sp1-related protein. We report the screening of the 40 kb that lie between the 5′ ends of the human apo(a) and plasminogen genes for cis elements other than the apo(a) core promoter that regulate the expression of the apo(a) gene in an in vitro system. We have discovered an apo(a) transcriptional control region (ACR), located midway between the apo(a) and the plasminogen genes, that is able to confer a greater than 10-fold activation when linked in either orientation to the apo(a) minimal promoter. Sequence analysis of the ACR revealed it to be part of a LINE repeat element, whose members number up to 100,000 in the human genome. Functional analysis of 10 randomly selected, corresponding regions of other human L1 elements show that they are less efficient than the ACR in enhancing the activity of the apo(a) core promoter, and that they contain sequence differences in a site corresponding to the consensus target of the Ets family of transcription factors. We also inspected 60 additional L1 sequences available in GenBankTM, and found that they differ from the ACR in the Ets target sequence. Mutagenesis showed this Ets binding site to be indispensable for the apo(a) enhancer activity. Co-transfection of an Ets-1 expression plasmid caused a dose-dependent activation of ACR-driven expression, further implicating the role of these trans-acting proteins. DNase I footprint analysis and further site-directed mutagenesis indicate the involvement of additional factors including Sp1 in the ACR transcription enhancer activity and suggest likely interactions between several DNA binding proteins in the ACR. Previous data from our laboratory have shown that the apo(a) minimal promoter is mediated by a liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1α and can confer liver specific expression (27Wade D.P. Lindahl G.E. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19757-19765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, both promoters and more distant enhancer elements control the tissue specific expression of genes. In the case of apo(a), the ACR does not appear to be liver-specific, suggesting that the apo(a) proximal promoter is sufficient to determine tissue specificity of its expression. (Liver represents the sole organ of significant apo(a) production; much reduced levels of its mRNA have also been detected in brain and in testes of rhesus monkeys (41Tomlinson J.E. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but upon liver transplant, human subjects entirely convert their isoform of circulating apo(a) from recipient to donor phenotype (42Kraft H.G. Menzel H.J. Hoppichler F. Vogel W. Utermann G. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).) The ACR may function only by increasing the expression level of the rather weak, but tissue-specific apo(a) promoter. One example of an interplay between liver-specific and nonspecific elements of an opposite type is found in the apolipoprotein E gene, where tissue specificity is determined by a hepatic control region that is located 19 kb from the start of the apoE gene (43Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of other genes are now known to be controlled by remote transcription elements located thousands of nucleotides from transcription start sites (43Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K. Marcigliano A. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The function of the ACR must ultimately be evaluated in its normal genomic contextin vivo. We have begun to engineer transgenic mice with mutagenized and normal regions of the human apo(a) locus in yeast artificial chromosomes. Human subjects can also be screened for polymorphisms or mutations in this region which can be shown to effect apo(a) expression. Based on functional criteria and on comparison to the sequence of other L1 elements, the most notable feature of the ACR is the presence of an Ets family target site. Evidence for its functional importance derives from footprint, gel shift, and mutagenesis data, and the effect of co-transfection with an Ets-1 expression plasmid. Ets is an oncogene that was first discovered in avian erythroleukemia virus to encode a transcription factor that is capable of activating erythrocyte-specific gene expression. It is now known that there is a family of Ets-like transcription factors with a variety of tissue distributions and target genes. For example, the thrombopoietin gene, which is predominantly expressed in liver, contains a functional Ets-binding site that is regulated by a ubiquitously expressed Ets-related transcription factor, E4TF1, in hepatocytes (47Kamura T. Handa H. Hamasaki N. Kitajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11361-11368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to clarify which member(s) of the Ets family are responsible for binding to the ACR in hepatocytes. Ets proteins have been reported to act synergistically with other transcription factors, including Sp1, in the regulation of many viral and cellular genes (48Dittmer J. Pise-Masison C.A. Clemens K.E. Choi K.S. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4953-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 49Block K.L. Shou Y. Poncz M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although an intact Ets binding site is essential for the enhancer activity of the ACR, our data indicate that binding sites for Sp1 as well as other transcription factors also contribute to the optimal function of this apo(a) gene enhancer. The fact that the ACR resides within the 5′-untranslated region of a LINE sequence may have significant implications for the functions of L1 elements, as well as for the regulation of the apo(a) gene. The nearly 100,000 L1 long interspersed repeats comprise an estimated 5% of the human genome. Roughly 10% of these represent full-length, 6-kb elements, while only an estimated 30–60 are active elements that are capable of transposition via reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate (50Sassaman D.M. Dombroski B.A. Moran J.V. Kimberland M.L. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Gabriel A. Swergold G.D. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The LINE sequence within the apo(a) locus appears to be full-length. However, it does not meet the criteria of a mobile L1 element, as it contains numerous stop codons in both consensus open reading frames necessary for such activity. Nor is it a member of the Ta subclass of L1 elements to which most of the mobile elements belong (50Sassaman D.M. Dombroski B.A. Moran J.V. Kimberland M.L. Naas T.P. DeBerardinis R.J. Gabriel A.

Biol. 1988; 8: 1385-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although it is unable to code for active mobility proteins, our data indicate that this particular L1 element is capable of interacting with DNA binding proteins and influencing the expression of an adjacent gene. It has been proposed that methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the 5′ region of L1 sequences interferes with their expression (52Hata K. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Methylation at such sites may interfere with the interaction of DNA-binding proteins such as Ets (53Umezawa A. Yamamoto H. Rhodes K. Klemsz M. Maki R. Oshima R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Southern blotting with methylation-sensitive and insensitive restriction enzymes and a probe 5′ to the apo(a) gene L1 element indicate that the CpG dinucleotide in the Ets binding site (site A) is unmethylated in human liver cells (data not shown). This is consistent with an in vivointeraction of an Ets family protein with this site. There have been several reported cases in which de novoinsertions of L1 sequences in either the germline or somatic cells have interrupted genes and caused human disease (54Kazazian H.H. Wong C.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 643-645PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, we describe the first example of a LINE element that acts as a cellular enhancer to stimulate the expression of a nearby gene. In a related example, a subclass of Alu DNA repeats has been found to function as an estrogen receptor-dependent enhancer (59Norris J. Fan D. Aleman C. Marks J.R. Futreal P.A. Wiseman R.W.

This raises the possibility that L1 elements may serve as potentially mobile gene control elements that could influence the evolution of gene expression in mammals, as well as help to control the expression of the potentially atherogenic apo(a) gene."

This polydispersity has been believed to be one of the typical features of the mucin mRNAs, but until now, its origin has remained unexplained. In the work described in the present paper, we investigated two possible kinds of explanation for this phenomenon: namely that the extensive polydispersity results from a biological mechanism or that it is artifactual in origin. The data obtained, as a result of improving the purification and blotting methods, allowed us to show that in all of the tissues analyzed, each of the genes, MUC2–6, expresses mRNAs that are stable and are of an unusually large size to be found in eukaryotes (14–24 kilobases).

The full-length cDNA sequence of MUC7 has been published recently (5Bobek L.A. Tsai H. Biesbrock A.R. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20563-20569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheMUC7 gene encodes a small secreted mucin expressed by submandibular and sublingual glands. MUC7 mRNA is 2.4 kb in length. This messenger appears as a distinct and moderately polymorphic band, most individuals exhibiting a unique allelic form corresponding to six repeats in their repetitive domains (5Bobek L.A. Tsai H. Biesbrock A.R. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20563-20569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bobek L.A. Liu J. Sait S.N.J. Shows T.B. Bobek Y.A. Levine M.J. Genomics. 1996; 31: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the genes MUC2–6 is at different stages of progress. The complete structure of MUC2 cDNA is known and published spanning 15,563 base pairs (9Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MUC2tandem repeat domain is polymorphic, and variations in length of theMUC2 mRNA might be expected among individuals; however, the MUC2 message is not limited to two allelic forms of one transcript but is very often polydisperse by Northern blot analysis (10Gum J.R.

The central exon of this gene, encoding the whole tandem repeat domain, was completely sequenced recently and is 10,713 base pairs in length (13Desseyn J.-L. Guyonnet-Dupérat V. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Laine A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3168-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MUC5B shows the same polydisperse signal on Northern blots as the MUC2 probe (14Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet Dupérat V. Laine A. Van-Seuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P. Aubert J.P.

No other precise information is available for any of these genes on the genomic organization, the existence of alternative splicing, or the number and the length of their messenger RNAs. In our previous studies, as mentioned for MUC2, we reported smears or very wide bands on Northern blot analyses of the three mucin genes we cloned: MUC4 (16Porchet N. Nguyen V.C. Dufossé J.

Many reports on mucin transcripts have emphasized the polydispersity of the signal observed by Northern blot analyses, and this polydispersity has been considered as one of the typical characteristics of the mucin mRNAs. Two kinds of hypotheses have been proposed to explain these polydisperse signals: those that propose a biological origin due for example to rapid turnover, the existence of several related genes encoding similar transcripts varying in length, or the occurrence of alternative splicing; and those that suggest an artifactual origin due to specific properties of the mucin transcripts such as their unusual length and thus sensitivity to mechanical damage or a particular conformation due to a large tandem repeat domain that perturbs the migration of the molecules in electric fields. To elucidate this phenomenon, we chose three different approaches. (i) We determined the half-life of secreted mucin transcripts (MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, andMUC5B) expressed by the HT29-MTX cell line cultured in the presence of actinomycin D with or without cycloheximide and compared it with that determined for MUC1. (ii) We studied the heterogeneity of mucin messenger RNAs isolated from polysome preparations from the HT29-MTX cell line and from human colonic mucosa and compared the patterns given by nuclear, cytoplasmic, and total RNA preparations by Northern blot analysis. (iii) We explored the hypothesis that conventional methods of mRNA purification are not adapted to the study of very large mucin messenger RNAs, and we developed a modified protocol for the extraction and purification of mucin transcripts with the aim of reducing mechanical degradation. Moreover, we improved the blotting method and investigated the efficiency of poly(A)+ selection. The data obtained allowed us to conclude that all the tissues analyzed express MUC mRNAs that are stable and of unusually large size to be found in eukaryotes (14–24 kb) and in most cases show allelic length variations. We demonstrate that these variations are directly related to the variable number of tandem repeat polymorphisms seen at the level of the DNA. Parental HT29 cells selected by adaptation to 10−5m methotrexate (HT29-MTX) were obtained from Drs T. Lesuffleur and A. Zweibaum (Unité INSERM 178, Villejuif, France) (37Lesuffleur T. Barbat A.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% inactivated bovine fetal serum. 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY) and grown at 37 °C in 10% CO2, 90% air atmosphere. The medium was changed daily. Cells were maintained in culture until day 16, before the addition of 8 μg/ml actinomycin D (Boehringer Mannheim). In some experiments, protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) 2 h before the addition of actinomycin D (39Pasleau F. Grooteclaes M. Gol-Winkler R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 849-854PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA from HT29-MTX cells was extracted using the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride ultracentrifugation method as described previously (40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot and by dot blot using previously described technical procedures (15Desseyn J.-L. Aubert J.-P. Van Seuningen I. Porchet N. Laine A. J. Biol.

Total RNA was hybridized with the following repetitive mucin probes: MUC2 (10Gum J.R. Byrd J.C. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Lamport D.T.A. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

Aubert J.P. Porchet N. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A MYC probe was used as a control of actinomycin D activity (43Dani C. Blanchard J.M. Piechaczyk M. Sabouty E. Marty L. Jeanteur P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and a 28 S rRNA probe was used as a quantitative reference marker for measurement of mucin mRNA half-life. After the hybridization and washing steps, the intensity of the radioactive signal was analyzed by using the PhosphorImager 445SI (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and the ImageQuantTM program. Hybridization of the samples with 28 S rRNA was used as a control for the amount of total RNA analyzed in each assay. The relative mucin mRNA/28 S rRNA levels were expressed as the percentage of the corresponding value measured in untreated cells (100% at 0 h) and plotted against the time (hours) after Act D treatment. Between the successive hybridization steps, removal of the probe was achieved by two washings for 15 min in 0.1% SDS at 90 °C. Complete removal of each probe was checked by using the PhosphorImager. Normal tissues were obtained from uninvolved areas of surgical specimens, and immediately following surgery, they were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Tissues specimens were collected in accordance with the local ethical committee. We adapted a protocol that combined two procedures published previously (44Laine R.O. Shay N.F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Zalesna G. Tsukuda H. Okazaki K. Slomiany B.L. Slomiany A. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 775-784PubMed Google Scholar), which we applied to tissues (∼0.5 g) or to cells (108 cells). Solid tissue was taken from liquid nitrogen storage, whereas the HT29-MTX cells were harvested at day 16 and used immediately for polysome isolation (two 75-cm2 flasks). To minimize RNase contamination, all glassware was heated at 180 °C for 2 h, and all buffers were prepared using sterile 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and were autoclaved, except for the magnesium acetate stock solution, which was sterilized by filtration before use. All experiments were performed at 4 °C. The biological material was homogenized in liquid nitrogen in 10 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNasin, and 0.25 m sucrose. The homogenate was gently thawed and disrupted with 10 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Cell lysis was monitored by using trypan blue dye. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and a pellet of nuclei was thus obtained. The supernatant was carefully and gently removed and layered over 3 ml of a 1 m sucrose solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 unit/μl RNasin. Ultracentrifugation was performed at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 3 h at 4 °C, resulting in a polysomal fraction (pellet) and a cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant). The three different fractions containing nuclear, polysomal, and cytoplasmic RNAs, respectively, were resuspended in guanidinium isothiocyanate solution and stored at −80 °C. Purification of RNA was performed from these three fractions as described above. Large RNAs were extracted from different human tissues (bronchus, antrum, fundus, colon) using an improved method we developed, derived from the guanidinium isothiocyanate protocol (40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar) as follows. Guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer (4 m) was prepared by dissolving 23.6 g of guanidinium isothiocyanate, 73.5 mg of sodium citrate, and 250 mg of sodium N-lauroylsarcosine in 50 ml of water, treated with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate, and it was then autoclaved. 2-Mercaptoethanol was added to 100 mm before use. The cesium chloride cushion (5.7 m) was prepared by dissolving 24 g of cesium chloride in 25 ml of 0.1 mEDTA, pH 7.5, treated with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate, and then autoclaved. Tissue (optimal weight of 1 g) was ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and mixed with 10 ml of guanidinium isothiocyanate buffer, still in liquid nitrogen. The homogenate was then allowed to thaw gradually at room temperature, during which time the guanidinium isothiocyanate and 2-mercaptoethanol efficiently solubilized the tissue mixture. The homogenate obtained was then transferred onto 3.2 ml of 5.7 m cesium chloride cushion followed by ultracentrifugation for 16 h at 29,500 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet of total RNA was very carefully resuspended in 0.1 × Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS by using wide mouth pipettes and avoiding all shear forces. RNA was purified by the addition of two volumes of chloroform/n-butyl alcohol (4:1) mixture; the tubes were mixed by gentle inversion, and vortexing was strictly avoided. The top aqueous phase, which contained the RNA, was carefully removed with wide mouth pipettes and transferred to a fresh tube, and the RNA was precipitated by adding 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, at −80 °C for 15 h. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the pellet of RNA was washed with ice-cold 95% ethanol and then 100% ethanol, centrifuged as above, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The RNA pellet was very carefully resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by measuring theA 260 of an aliquot, and the final preparation was stored at −80 °C. Extreme care was taken at each step during the experiments to prevent any risk of mechanical degradation. Homogenization, the use of syringes, and vortexing were strictly avoided. RNA samples (the optimal quantity was 10 μg) were denatured in loading buffer containing 50% formamide, 18% deionized formaldehyde, and 0.02 m MOPS; heated at 68 °C for 10 min; and then fractionated through a 0.9% agarose denaturing gel (13 × 18 × 0.3 cm) containing 18% formaldehyde and 0.02 m MOPS. The gel running buffer was 0.02 m MOPS, pH 7.0. The electrophoresis was performed for 16 h at 30 V. Prior to transfer, the gel was soaked for exactly 20 min in 0.05 n NaOH (this time is optimal for a 3-mm-thick gel). The gel was then rinsed in RNase-free water and soaked for 45 min in 20 × SSC (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred onto HybondTM-N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.) via vacuum blotting (1 h in 20 × SSC) and immobilized by baking at 80 °C in a vacuum for 30 min and by exposure to UV light for 4 min. Standard RNA markers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). TheapoB-100 DNA fragment cloned in pUC9 was purchased from ATCC (number 57699) and used as a probe. All of the probes used MUC1 (3Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N.

These probes were used at 1 × 106 cpm/ml.

For comparison, RNA was also isolated by other methods: methods using guanidinium isothiocyanate-ultracentrifugation (40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar), guanidinium isothiocyanate- phenol/chloroform (47Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

We also tested commercial poly(A+) preparations and Northern blots (multiple-tissue Northern blot) purchased from CLONTECH. For polymorphism studies, DNA and RNA were prepared from the same tissue specimens. DNA from three individuals was prepared from colon mucosae. Tissues were ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, mixed with 40 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA), and then purified as described by Jeanpierre (49Jeanpierre M.

DNA was digested with the following restriction endonucleases:EcoRI/PstI, BglII, andHinfI, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gels and then transferred onto HybondTM-N+ membranes by vacuum blotting and immobilized by exposure to UV light for 3 min.

S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5173) Google Scholar) or using the Poly(A)tract® mRNA Isolation System obtained from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. To demonstrate the possible role a rapid turnover of mucin mRNA may have in leading to the polydisperse pattern shown on Northern blots, we blocked the synthesis of mRNA using actinomycin D (Act D), which is a transcription inhibitor. HT29-MTX cells were harvested at various times from 3 to 24 h after Act D treatment, and total RNA was extracted according to Ref. 40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar. The RNA transcripts in each sample were analyzed by Northern blotting and hybridized with probes for MUC2, MUC3, MUC5AC, andMUC5B. Several experiments were performed using different times of treatment with Act D. In the first experiment, the treatment time with Act D was 3 and 9 h. For RNA from cells cultured without Act D (T), the hybridization signal appeared in most cases as a band with a smear as described previously"

We have developed a yeast-based assay in which the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating pheromone-induced MAPK pathway relied on co-expression of K-Ras and Raf-1. Radicicol, an antifungal antibiotic, was found to inhibit the K-ras signaling pathway reconstituted in yeast. In K-ras-transformed, rat epithelial, and K-ras-activated, human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, radicicol inhibited K-Ras-induced hyperphosphorylation of Erk2. In addition, the level of Raf kinase was significantly decreased in radicicol-treated cells, whereas the levels of K-Ras and MAPK remained unchanged. These results suggest that radicicol disrupts the K-Ras-activated signaling pathway by selectively depleting Raf kinase and raises the possibility that pharmacological destabilization of Raf kinase could be a new and powerful approach for the treatment of K-ras-activated human cancers.

The Ras and Raf protooncogene products are key proteins involved in the transmission of many proliferative signals. They serve as intermediates in this signaling pathway by connecting upstream tyrosine kinases with downstream serine/threonine kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MEK, same protein as MAPK kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (same protein as MAP kinase); hsp90, heat shock protein 90; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MEK, same protein as MAPK kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (same protein as MAP kinase); hsp90, heat shock protein 90; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. or MAPK kinase (MAPKK). A similar MAPK signaling pathway also exists in the mating pheromone-responding, signaling cascade of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This signaling pathway consists of the Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3/Kss1 kinase, which are homologs of MAPKK kinase, MAPKK, and MAPK, respectively (1Erede B. Levin D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that expression of mammalian H-Ras and Raf-1, together with Ste7P368, rescued the defect in mating pheromone signal transduction because of STE11 deficiency (2Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Erede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the present study, we modified this in vivo system by substituting the K-Ras for H-Ras, because K-ras is the most frequently activated ras gene in human cancer (3Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, more important as a target for cancer therapy than H-ras or N-ras. Using this modified yeast assay, we screened for inhibitors that block the Ras–Raf pathway reconstituted in S. cerevisiae and have identified radicicol (Fig. 1) as a candidate inhibitor of the Ras–Raf signaling pathway. Radicicol (Fig. 1), a macrocyclic antifungal antibiotic originally isolated from the fungus Monosporium bonorden (4Delmotte P. Delmotte-Plaquee J. Nature. 1958; 171: 344Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar), is a potent tranquilizer of low toxicity (5McCapra F. Scott A. Delmotte P. Delmotte-Plaquee J. Bhacca N.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1964; 15: 869-875Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Mirrington R.N. Ritchie E. Shoppee C.W. Tayler W.C. Sternhell S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1964; 7: 365-370Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and an inhibitor of in vivo angiogenesis (7Oikawa T. Itoh H. Ashino H. Toi M. Tomonaga T. Morita I. Morita S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 241: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Radicicol induces reversal of the transformed phenotype of src-transformed cells (8Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1992; 56: 538-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and has also been reported to inhibit the phosphorylation and protein kinase activity of pp60v- src. It does not inhibit the serine/threonine kinases, such as protein kinase C and protein kinase A (9Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Fukui Y. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6926-6930PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hall T.J. Schaeublin M. Missbach M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Pillay I. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1487-1499PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the inhibitory activity of radicicol against Src kinase, there is evidence that radicicol suppresses transformation by the ras oncogene. Decreased MAPK activity accompanies morphological reversion of H-ras-transformed cells by radicicol (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar). However, radicicol does not inhibit the kinase activity of MAPKK or MAPK in vitro (13Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Moroy K. Hattori S. Nishida E. Fukui Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest that radicicol does not directly inhibit the MAPK or MAPKK activity inras-transformed cells but inhibits MAPK activation by unknown mechanisms. Our findings pertaining to radicicol as an inhibitor of the K-Ras signaling pathway in yeast mutants prompted us to examine its effect on K-ras-transformed mammalian cell lines. Our present data reveal that radicicol inhibits ras-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK in K-ras-transformed rat epithelial cell lines and, further, that disruption of the K-Ras signaling pathway is due to the destabilization of Raf protein by radicicol. The plasmid pVT-VKR expresses Kirstein sarcoma virus ras gene from the ADHpromoter. It was constructed by ligating theStuI-BamHI fragment of pHN12 (14Tamaoki T. Mizukami T. Perucho M. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into thePvuI-BamHI site of pVT101-L in which thePvuI site was blunt-ended. pVT101-L is a YCp-based plasmid containing the LEU2 selectable marker (15Vernet T. Dingard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). pADU-Raf contains c-Raf-1 controlled from the ADH1 promoter. pNC318-P368 carries the STE7P368 allele controlled from the CYC1promoter. Strain SY1984-RP is SY1984 (MATα leu2 ura3 trp1 ste11Δ his3ΔFUS1::HIS3) transformed with pADU-Raf and pNC318-P368 (2Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Erede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Yeast strains expressing K-Ras and Raf-1 were obtained by transducing pVT-VKR into strain SY1984-RP. Yeast cells were grown in the synthetic medium SC, which is SD 2% glucose, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid containing appropriate auxotrophic supplements (16Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 178-180Google Scholar). SC lacking amino acids or other nutrients (e.g. SC-ura, which lacks uracil) was used to select transformants. Yeast transformation was performed by the method of Itoh et al. (17Itoh H. Fukada Y. Maruta K. Kimura K. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast strain SY-1984-RP carrying pVT-VKR was grown at 30 °C to stationary phase in SC-Ura-Trp-Leu. Agar plates were prepared by adding 50 μl of the above culture to 50 ml of SC agar lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ura. Paper discs soaked in drugs were placed on agar plates, the plates were inoculated at 30 °C for 3 days, and the diameters of the zones of growth inhibition were measured. The antibodies used were phospho-specific MAPK antibody, phospho-specific MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) antibody, pan-MEK1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs), Erk2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), MEK-1 and MEK-2 antibodies (Transduction Laboratories), c-K-ras(Ab-1) antibody (Oncogene Science), and Raf-1(C-12), A-Raf(C-20), and B-Raf(C-19) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NRK and KNRK5.2 cells were obtained from Dr. David A. Johnson. PSN-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Ken Yamaguchi. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. KNRK5.2 cells (1 × 105) or PSN-1 cells (1 × 105) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Approximately 8 h later, various amounts of radicicol were added to each well without adding any fresh medium, and the cells were cultured for a further period of 40 h. To examine the growth inhibitory effect of radicicol, cells were dispersed by trypsin-EDTA, and cells in the suspension were counted by an F-520 cell counter. Generally, 24-well tissue culture plate cells were used for each sample. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed by the addition of 20 μl/well of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Cells were lysed for 10 min on ice and clarified by centrifugation. 10 μg of total cell lysate from each sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. For detection, the blots were incubated with the appropriate ECL secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Ig antibody) and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Films were scanned into a Macintosh computer and analyzed by using NIH Image software. Kirstein sarcoma virus rasgene was expressed together with c-Raf-1 and Ste7P368 in aste11-disrupted mutant strain having a mating pathway-responsive reporter gene (FUS1::HIS3). Consistent with our previous results obtained for H-Ras (2Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Erede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), expression of K-Ras in this strain conferred a His+ phenotype, indicating that Raf was activated by K-Ras in S. cerevisiae and transmitted the signal to the yeast pheromone-responding MAPK pathway. Using this K-Ras expressing mutant strain, we screened our chemical library for compounds that could inhibit the K-Ras signaling pathway reconstituted in yeast. One compound, radicicol (Fig.1), was found to have such an activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the yeast strain expressing K-Ras and Raf-1 could grow in agar medium lacking exogenous histidine, but its growth was inhibited by radicicol as evidenced by a halo of growth inhibition around the paper disc soaked with radicicol. When histidine or alanine was added to the drug-containing paper disc and incubated for 2 days, the halo of growth inhibition by radicicol disappeared upon exogenous addition of histidine but not alanine. One simple explanation of these results was that growth inhibition by radicicol was due to the inhibition of the K-Ras-MAPK pathway in the mutant yeast strain. We could exclude the possibility that radicicol inhibited some enzyme associated with histidine biosynthesis because radicicol was not active against a yeast two-hybrid strain that also had a HIS3 reporter gene and has been used previously to detect the interaction between SNF1 and SNF4 (18Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4796) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Raf-1 required the co-expression of activated Ras for rescuing Ste11 deficiency but that an activated form of Raf-1 (RafΔN) alone could compensate for Ste11 deficiency (2Irie K. Gotoh Y. Yashar B.M. Erede B. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1994; 265: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of radicicol on the growth of the mutant expressing RafΔN (Fig. 2 B). Radicicol was effective in growth inhibition of this mutant strain. Similar results were obtained for two different mutant strains and suggested that the molecular target of radicicol in yeast could be a molecule that is uniquely common between the two strains. Such a molecule might include, for example, Raf-1 itself, factors downstream of Raf-1 in the pathway, or a protein that could interact with and regulate Raf-1 kinase. Based upon the effects of radicicol on yeast signal transduction, we decided to examine its effect on the K-ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway in cultured mammalian cells. To this end, the cell line KNRK5.2 was selected for further analysis. KNRK5.2 was derived from the rat kidney epithelial cell line, NRK, by transfection of an activated K-ras gene cloned from the human colon carcinoma cell line, SW480. Immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific Erk2 antibody revealed that the K-ras-transformed cell line, KNRK5.2, had a marked elevation in the level of phosphorylation of Erk2, whereas NRK cells had no phosphorylation signal (compare Erk2 and phospho-Erk2 signal in lanes 1 and 2, Fig.3 A). Thus, the K-Ras signaling pathway was constitutively activated in this cell line. We examined the effect of radicicol on K-ras-induced phosphorylation of Erk2. Cells were treated with varying amounts of radicicol for 40 h, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific Erk2 antibody. Radicicol inhibited phosphorylation of Erk2, as revealed by the decrease in the phospho-Erk2 band. This was also evident from the decrease in the phospho-Erk2 band, which migrated slightly more slowly than unphosphorylated Erk2 in gels immunoblotted with anti-Erk2 antibody (Fig. 3). Intracellular amounts of Erk2 protein remained relatively unchanged with increasing concentrations of radicicol. Inhibition of Erk2 phosphorylation by radicicol was quantitated by calculating the relative amount of phospho-Erk2 to total Erk2 protein as a function of drug concentration. The IC50 for Erk2 phosphorylation was 1.1 μm, which was comparable with the IC50for cell growth inhibition, 0.89 μm (Fig. 3 B). Radicicol also inhibited K-Ras-dependent phosphorylation of Erk2 in K-ras-transformed rat 3Y1 fibroblasts with an IC50 of 0.78 μm (data not shown). It has previously been reported that immunoprecipitated MAPK from radicicol-treated H-ras-transformed fibroblasts showed decreased activity in MAPK assays employing myelin basic protein as a substrate (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar). The present results were consistent with this and indicated that the decreased MAPK activity was due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of MAPK by radicicol. As previously reported for H-ras-transformed fibroblastic cell lines (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Moroy K. Hattori S. Nishida E. Fukui Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), radicicol caused a morphological reversion of K-ras-transformed epithelial cells to a more normal phenotype (Fig. 4). Morphological reversion was apparent at drug concentrations as low as 0.625 μm. At this drug concentration, radicicol did not inhibit phosphorylation of Erk2. Therefore, morphological changes appeared to be more sensitive to radicicol than the inhibition of phosphorylation of Erk2. To gain further insight into the inhibition of K-ras-dependent Erk2 phosphorylation in radicicol-treated KNRK5.2 cells, we examined the level of Raf-1 and MEK1/2 by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). Raf-1 protein levels were significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of radicicol. The relative amount of Raf-1 protein, compared with Erk2 protein, at each drug concentration was calculated, and the IC50 value of Raf-1 depletion was determined to be 3.1 μm. Besides Raf-1, Raf is known to have two other isoforms, A-Raf and B-Raf. B-Raf was not expressed in KNRK5.2 cells, as determined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). A-Raf was expressed and its levels were significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of radicicol (Fig. 5). IC50 values for A-Raf and Raf-1 depletion were 5.7 and 5.0 μm, respectively. Thus, radicicol induced the destabilization of all isoforms of Raf protein expressed in KNRK5.2 cells. To clarify the relationship between the inhibition of phosphorylation of Erk2 and Raf depletion, we examined the time dependence of both events in the presence of 10 μm radicicol. Raf-1 depletion and Erk2 phosphorylation inhibition occurred with similar kinetics (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that radicicol inhibited Erk2 phosphorylation by depleting Raf kinase in KNRK5.2 cells. As evidenced by the decrease in the MEK signal detected by the anti-MEK antibody (which can recognize MEK doubly phosphorylated at Ser-217 and Ser-221), radicicol also inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK without affecting the level of MEK protein significantly (Fig. 3). The simplest interpretation of these results was that the inhibition of MEK phosphorylation was due to the depletion of Raf kinases. The effect of radicicol on Raf depletion in KNRK5.2 cells was reversible (Fig. 7). Cells were treated initially for a period of 24 h with radicicol, which significantly depleted Raf-1 protein and inhibited Erk2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Radicicol was then removed, and the cells were washed and incubated in drug-free media for a further 24-h period. Removal of radicicol restored both Erk2 phosphorylation and levels of protein Raf-1. Therefore, continuous exposure to radicicol was required to attenuate Raf-1 protein expression. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of radicicol to inhibit the anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of the human bladder carcinoma cell line, EJ, that harbors a point mutationally activated allele of endogenous H-ras oncogene and the human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080, with a point mutationally activated allele of N-ras oncogene (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar). Given our present findings in K-ras-transformed NRK cells, we wanted to extend our observation to human tumor cell lines in which the endogenous K-ras gene was activated by a point mutation. The human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, PSN-1, has a Gly to Val mutation at amino acid 12 in its K-ras gene (19Yamada H. Yoshida T. Sakamoto H. Terada M. Sugimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of PSN-1 cell lysate revealed the presence of the phosphorylated form of Erk2, indicating the activation of the K-Ras signaling pathway in cells (Fig. 8). Radicicol inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of Erk2 with an IC50 of 1.2 μm. Interestingly, Erk1 was minimally phosphorylated in the PSN-1 cell line. Depletion of Raf-1 was also observed in radicicol-treated PSN-1 cells. Although the level of MEK1/2 remained unchanged in radicicol-treated KNRK5.2 cells (Fig. 3), a slight decrease in the level of MEK1/2 was observed in PSN-1 cells treated with radicicol. In PSN-1 cells, endogenous K-Ras protein was fully farnesylated, and it migrated to the same position as a standard sample of farnesylated K-Ras protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8, the level of K-Ras protein in PSN-1 cells remained unchanged in the presence of different concentrations of radicicol. These observations further supported our conclusion obtained from the KNRK5.2 cell study that the primary target of radicicol in the K-Ras signaling pathway was, in fact, the Raf-1 kinase. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that Raf functions downstream of Ras in many signaling pathways, and activation of Ras leads to constitutive activation of a downstream phosphorylation cascade comprising Raf proteins, MAPKK and MAPK. A small molecule inhibitor of Ras–Raf signal transduction could not only be a valuable tool in elucidating that signal transduction pathway but could also have a therapeutic potential. We have developed a yeast assay system in which the yeast pheromone-induced MAPK pathway is dependent upon co-expression of K-Ras and Raf-1. Using this system, we have screened for inhibitors of the Ras signaling pathway reconstituted in yeast and rediscovered radicicol as an inhibitor of the Ras pathway. Radicicol inhibited the K-Ras signaling pathway in mammalian epithelial cells as well. Although radicicol has been shown to inhibit activation of MAPK in H-ras-transformed fibroblastic cell lines (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar), the precise mechanism by which radicicol disrupts Ras signal transduction has not been unambiguously determined. Radicicol did not affect the biochemical function of Ras protein, such as GTP binding or membrane localization (13Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Moroy K. Hattori S. Nishida E. Fukui Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it inhibited neither MAPKK nor MAPK in enzyme assays using purified enzyme from Xenopus oocytes (13Kwon H.J. Yoshida M. Moroy K. Hattori S. Nishida E. Fukui Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our present results clearly demonstrate a molecular mechanism by which radicicol inhibits the Ras signaling pathway. Radicicol inhibits K-Ras-dependent phosphorylation of MAPK through the destabilization of Raf protein in a K-ras-transformed rat kidney epithelial cell line and in K-ras-activated human pancreatic carcinoma cells. The level of Ras and MAPK did not change in the cells treated with radicicol. Depletion of Raf-1 by radicicol can also explain why radicicol is active against the yeast mutant strains expressing Raf-1ΔN. Selective destabilization of Raf was also reported for the benzoquinone ansamycin family antibiotic, geldanamycin (20Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 21Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although both geldanamycin and radicicol have a macrocyclic moiety in their structure, radicicol differs structurally from ansamycin family antibiotics. Raf is known to exist as part of a multimolecular complex that contains hsp90, Cdc37/p50, and other proteins (22Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Huchington K.A. Perdew G.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wartmann M. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex may function as a transportosome directing Raf to its proper subcellular localization. Geldanamycin has been shown to bind directly to hsp90 and disrupts the complex of which it is a part (20Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Raf-hsp90 association by geldanamycin leads to destabilization of Raf protein. In KNRK5.2 cells, we also found that geldanamycin caused a depletion of Raf protein and inhibited the phosphorylation of Erk2 (data not shown). These results are similar to those observed for radicicol. Therefore, it is possible that radicicol may affect hsp90, which in turn regulates the stability of Raf kinases. This prompted us to study whether radicicol could bind hsp90. Our preliminary data show that radicicol binds specifically to the chaperone protein hsp90. Furthermore, radicicol is able to compete for binding with geldanamycin to hsp90. Taken together, destabilization of Raf kinases by radicicol may result from the ability of the drug to inhibit the binding of hsp90 to Raf kinases. Thus, radicicol is the first non-benzoquinone ansamycin capable of binding to hsp90 and interfering with its function. Radicicol has been reported to inhibit Mos-induced MAPK activation (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar). Since Raf is probably not involved in this activation, molecular target(s) for the inhibition of Mos-stimulated MAPK activation could be some other factor(s), which could potentially interact with hsp90. The present observation that radicicol induced morphological reversion of KNRK5.2 cells at concentrations that were lower than those that affected the Raf-MAPK pathway also implies the presence of molecular target(s) that are not involved in the linear pathway from Ras to MAPK but are associated with cell morphological changes. There is increasing evidence that Ras may mediate its action by stimulating multiple downstream targets, of which Raf is only one. Oncogenic Ras activation of Rac1 and RhoA, coupled with activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway, is required to trigger the full morphologic and mitogenic consequence of oncogenic Ras transformation (24Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 25Pendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J.

Dominant inhibitory mutants of Rac1 and RhoA block oncogenicras-transforming activity and partially reverse the morphology of ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. On the other hand, activated Rac1 and RhoA further enhance oncogenicras-mediated morphologic transformation and cell motility (27Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Thus, Rac- and Rho-induced changes in actin cytoskeleton could contribute significantly to oncogenic transformation of fibroblastic cells. If the same were true in epithelial cells, morphological reversion of KNRK5.2 cells at lower concentrations of radicicol may be due to the inhibition of some molecule(s) in the signaling pathway involving Rac and/or Rho. One of the components that links Ras and Rho is p120 Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The N-terminal region of GAP has been shown to regulate cytoskeletal structure and cell adhesion (28McGlade J. Brunkhorst B. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Settleman J. Dedhar S. Rozakis-Adcock M. Chen L.B. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3073-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and it is the site of interaction with two cytoplasmic phosphoproteins, p190 and p62 (29Ellis C. Morgan M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 30Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). GAP-associated p190 protein itself functions as a GTPase activation protein for Rho (31Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). GAP-associated protein p62, which has recently been cloned and renamed as p62 dok, is a novel protein with features of a signaling molecule in a pathway downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (33Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 34Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It should be noted that radicicol has previously been shown to inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 dok inras-transformed NIH3T3 cells (12Zhao J.-F. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 161-173PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with previous studies, radicicol might cause morphological reversion of KNRK5.2 cells by interfering with the interaction of hsp90 with some tyrosine kinase that is involved in the phosphorylation of p62 dok. Several lines of evidence show that inhibition of the function of Raf could lead to the disruption of an aberrant mitogenic signal originating from an activated ras gene. A loss-of-function mutation of the raf gene in Caenorhabditis elegans suppresses the phenotype resulting from an activatedras gene (35Han M. Golden A. Han Y. Sterberg P.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted against raf have been shown to suppress the growth ofras-activated human tumors inoculated into nude mice (36Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Geiger T. Muller M. Fabbro D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar,37Monia B.P. Sasmor H. Johnston J.F. Freier S.M. Lesnik E.A. Muller M. Geiger T. Altmann K.H. Moser H. Fabbro D. Proc.

Our present results support the notion that Raf is a crucial pharmacological target for human malignancy that is closely associated with ras gene activation and highlight the possibility that pharmacological destabilization of Raf protein could be one potential approach for inhibiting the function of Raf in K-ras-activated human cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2055224057,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a prevalent X-linked neuromuscular disease for which there is currently no cure. Recently, it was demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model that utrophin could functionally compensate for the lack of dystrophin and alleviate the muscle pathology (Tinsley, J. M., Potter, A. C., Phelps, S. R., Fisher, R., Trickett, J. I., and Davies, K. E. (1996) Nature 384, 349–353). In this context, it thus becomes essential to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms presiding over utrophin expression in attempts to overexpress the endogenous gene product throughout skeletal muscle fibers. In a recent study, we showed that the nerve exerts a profound influence on utrophin gene expression and postulated that nerve-derived trophic factors mediate the local transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene within nuclei located in the postsynaptic sarcoplasm (Gramolini, A. O., Dennis, C. L., Tinsley, J. M., Robertson, G. S., Davies, K. E, Cartaud, J., and Jasmin, B. J. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8117–8120). In the present study, we have therefore focused on the effect of agrin on utrophin expression in cultured C2 myotubes. In response to Torpedo-, muscle-, or nerve-derived agrin, we observed a significant 2-fold increase in utrophin mRNAs. By contrast, CGRP treatment failed to affect expression of utrophin transcripts. Western blotting experiments also revealed that the increase in utrophin mRNAs was accompanied by an increase in the levels of utrophin. To determine whether these changes were caused by parallel increases in the transcriptional activity of the utrophin gene, we transfected muscle cells with a 1.3-kilobase pair utrophin promoter-reporter (nlsLacZ) gene construct and treated them with agrin for 24–48 h. Under these conditions, both muscle- and nerve-derived agrin increased the activity of β-galactosidase, indicating that agrin treatment led, directly or indirectly, to the transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene. Furthermore, this increase in transcriptional activity in response to agrin resulted from a greater number of myonuclei expressing the 1.3-kilobase pair utrophin promoter-nlsLacZ construct. Deletion of 800 base pairs 5′ from this fragment decreased the basal levels of nlsLacZ expression and abolished the sensitivity of the utrophin promoter to exogenously applied agrin. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of an N-box motif contained within this 800-base pair fragment demonstrated its essential contribution in this regulatory mechanism. Finally, direct gene transfer studies performed in vivo further revealed the importance of this DNA element for the synapse-specific expression of the utrophin gene along multinucleated muscle fibers. These data show that both muscle and neural isoforms of agrin can regulate expression of the utrophin gene and further indicate that agrin is not only involved in the mechanisms leading to the formation of clusters containing presynthesized synaptic molecules but that it can also participate in the local regulation of genes encoding synaptic proteins. Together, these observations are therefore relevant for our basic understanding of the events involved in the assembly and maintenance of the postsynaptic membrane domain of the neuromuscular junction and for the potential use of utrophin as a therapeutic strategy to counteract the effects of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a prevalent X-linked neuromuscular disease for which there is currently no cure.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 1The abbreviations used are: DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; C-Ag12,4,8, recombinant neural agrin; C-Ag12,0,0, recombinant muscle agrin; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction, RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). is the most severe and prevalent neuromuscular disease affecting 1 in 3,500 male births (1Emery A.E. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1991; 1: 19-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This disease is characterized by repeated cycles of muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration with an eventual failure to regenerate, thereby leading to a loss of muscle mass and function. The genetic defect underlying DMD, located on the short arm of the X chromosome, prevents the production of dystrophin, a large cytoskeletal protein of the spectrin superfamily (2Hoffman E.P Knudson C.M Campbell K.P. Kunkel L.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that, in muscle, dystrophin is located at the cytoplasmic face of the sarcolemma where it links the intracellular cytoskeleton network to the extracellular matrix via a complex of dystrophin-associated proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 4Matsumura K. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 1994; 17: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J. Zuellig R.A. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kunkel L.M. Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several years ago, an autosomal homologue to dystrophin was identified on chromosome 6q24 (8Love D.R. Hill D.F. Dickson G. Spurr N.K. Byth B.C. Marsden R.F. Walsh F.S. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This gene, now referred to as utrophin, presents a genomic organization similar to that of the dystrophin gene, indicating that both genes evolved from an ancestral duplication event (9Pearce M. Blake D.J. Tinsley J.M. Byth B.C. Campbell L. Monaco A.P. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cloning of a full-length cDNA and subsequent analysis of its deduced amino acid sequence revealed, in fact, that utrophin shares considerable identity with dystrophin, particularly in the actin binding domain and carboxyl terminus (10Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J. Roche A. Fairbrother U. Riss J. Byth B.C. Knight A.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Suthers G.K. Love D.R. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, in comparison to high molecular mass isoforms of dystrophin, which are predominantly expressed in brain and muscle, utrophin displays a ubiquitous pattern of expression since it can be detected in most tissues (11Khurana T.S. Hoffman E.P. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16717-16720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Love D.R. Morris G.E. Ellis J.M. Fairbrother U. Marsden R.F. Bloomfield J.F. Edward Y.H.

Dickson G. Morris G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1695-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In normal skeletal muscle, expression of utrophin is known to be influenced by the state of differentiation and innervation of muscle fibers. In developing myotubes, for example, utrophin is first localized to the entire length of the sarcolemma (14Takemitsu M. Ishiura S. Koga R. Kamakura K. Arahata K. Nonaka I. Sugita H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Khurana T.S. Watkins S.C. Chafey P. Chelly J. Tome F.M. Fardeau M. Kaplan J. Kunkel L.M. Neuromuscul.

Sci. 1994; 122: 162-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following the establishment of synaptic contacts, utrophin becomes highly enriched within the postsynaptic membrane domain of the neuromuscular junction (18Fardeau M. Tome F.M. Collin H. Augier N. Pons F. Leger J. Leger J.L. C. R. Acad. Sci. 1990; 311: 197-204PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, several studies have shown that in dystrophic muscles, utrophin expression is not restricted to postsynaptic compartments, since it extends well into extrasynaptic regions of adult muscle fibers (14Takemitsu M. Ishiura S. Koga R. Kamakura K. Arahata K. Nonaka I. Sugita H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Helliwell T.R. Nguyen T.M. Morris G.E.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such modulations in the pattern of expression indicate that distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms must exist to maintain the uneven distribution of utrophin along normal adult muscle fibers and to alter its levels and localization in developing and diseased muscles. Despite these recent advances, however, our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms presiding over utrophin expression in muscle is clearly lacking. A better understanding of these mechanisms appears important particularly since up-regulation of utrophin is currently envisaged as a therapeutic strategy to prevent the relentless progression of DMD (24Tinsley J.M. Potter A.C. Phelps S.R. Fisher R. Trickett J.I. Davies K.E. Nature. 1996; 384: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 25Gramolini A.O. Jasmin B.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this context, we have recently shown that the nerve exerts a profound influence on utrophin gene expression (26Gramolini A.O. Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S. Cartaud J. Davies K.E. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8117-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since our previous experiments also demonstrated that nerve-derived electrical activity is not a key factor regulating utrophin expression (27Jasmin B.J. Alameddine H. Lunde J.A. Stetzkowksi-Marden F. Collin H. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Tome F.M.S. Parry D.J. Cartaud J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we postulated in these initial studies that nerve-derived trophic factors likely mediate the local transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene within nuclei of the postsynaptic membrane domain (26Gramolini A.O.

In the present study, we have therefore determined the effects of nerve-derived trophic factors on utrophin expression in cultured myotubes. A preliminary account of this work has previously appeared in abstract form (28Gramolini A.O. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S. Davies K.E Cartaud J. Jasmin B.J. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 535Google Scholar). C2 cells were cultured on Matrigel-coated (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) 35-mm culture plates and kept at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 292 ng/ml l-glutamine until they reached confluence. At this stage, the concentration of horse serum was reduced to 5%, and fetal bovine serum was eliminated to promote myotube formation. Myoblasts were allowed to fuse into multinucleated myotubes for 3–4 days and were then used for experiments. To examine the effects of nerve-derived trophic factors, 0.1 μm rat CGRP (Sigma) or 10 ng/ml purifiedTorpedo agrin (29Cartaud A. Ludosky M.A. Haasemann M. Jung D. Campbell K. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1837-1846PubMed Google Scholar) was added directly to the culture medium for 24–48 h. Additionally, the effects of 1 nm recombinant neural (C-Ag12,4,8) or muscle (C-Ag12,0,0) isoforms of agrin were also examined (30Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Differentiated C2 myotubes were treated with 10 ng/ml Torpedo or recombinant agrin for 24–48 h. Cultures were subsequently fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Clusters of AChR were visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-bungarotoxin used at a final concentration of 4 ng/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following thorough washing with PBS, the myotubes were covered with a glycerol:PBS solution and a coverslip, and they were then examined by epifluorescence using a Zeiss photomicroscope. For the determination of agrin-induced AChR clusters, the numbers of myotubes and AChR aggregates were determined in 10 fields of view per culture at a 400 × magnification as described in detail in Gee et al. (31Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Cell. 1994; 77: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A minimum of four cultures were quantitated for each experimental condition. Photographs were taken with Kodak T-MAX 400 black and white films. C2 myotubes were treated with agrin for 48 h, washed in PBS, and then solubilized in RIPA (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.14m NaCl, and 0.025% NaN3) (32Springer T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore M.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C until analysis. The resulting pellet was further solubilized in RIPA containing 5% SDS. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C. The concentration of SDS-solubilized protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent protocol (BCA; Pierce). Equivalent amounts of cell extracts (70 μg) were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sigma). To ensure that equivalent amounts of proteins were loaded for each sample, membranes were also stained with Ponceau S (Sigma). Membranes were subsequently incubated with monoclonal antibodies directed against either utrophin (MANCHO-7; kindly supplied by Dr. Glen Morris, N.E. Wales Institute, UK), α-actinin (Sigma), or sarcomeric myosin (MF-20) (33Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase and revealed via chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (NEN Life Science Products). Membranes were then exposed onto BioMax autoradiographic films (Eastman Kodak Co.), developed, and scanned at 200 dots/inch using a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet 4C. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, cells were scraped into 1 ml of Trizol. Following addition of 200 μl of chloroform, the samples were mixed vigorously and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous layer was then transferred to a fresh tube, and 500 μl of ice-cold isopropanol were added. For RNA precipitation, the isopropanol mixture was spun, and the resultant pellets washed twice with ice-cold 75% ethanol. For all samples, total RNA was redissolved into 20 μl of RNase-free water. From each of these stocks, the RNA was further diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/μl, and only 2 μl of this dilution were used for RT-PCR as described in detail in Jasmin et al.(27Jasmin B.J. Alameddine H. Lunde J.A. Stetzkowksi-Marden F. Collin H. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Tome F.M.S. Parry D.J. Cartaud J.

Briefly, a RT master mix was prepared containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 × PCR buffer II (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 50 units of reverse transcriptase, and 2.5 mm of random hexamers (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit; Perkin-Elmer Corp.). The master mix was aliquoted, and the appropriate RNA sample was subsequently added. Negative controls consisted of RT mixtures in which the RNA sample was replaced with RNase-free water. RT was performed for 45 min at 42 °C, and the mixture was heated to 99 °C for 5 min to terminate the reaction. Complementary DNAs encoding utrophin and dystrophin were specifically amplified using primers designed on the basis of available mouse cDNA sequences (27Jasmin B.J. Alameddine H. Lunde J.A. Stetzkowksi-Marden F. Collin H. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Tome F.M.S. Parry D.J. Cartaud J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Amplification of the selected cDNAs was performed in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) by adding 4 μl of the RT mixture to 16 μl of a PCR master mix. Each cycle of amplification for utrophin cDNAs consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. For dystrophin amplification, each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by primer annealing and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The number of cycles for utrophin and dystrophin was 26 and 44, respectively. PCR products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The 100-bp molecular mass marker (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to estimate the molecular mass of the PCR products. Quantitative PCR experiments were performed to determine strictly the relative abundance of transcripts following different experimental treatments. These experiments were carried out using either one of two methods. In one case, 1.5 × 106 cpm per sample of 32P end-labeled primers were added to the PCR master mix. PCR products were visualized and carefully excised from the agarose gel with the use of a scalpel. The level of radioactivity present in these gel bands was determined by Cerenkov counting. Alternatively, PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels containing the fluorescent dye Vistra Green (Amersham Corp.), and the labeling intensity of the PCR product, which is linearly related to the amount of DNA, was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Several human utrophin promoter-reporter gene constructs were used in these experiments (35Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These 1.3- and 0.5-kb promoter fragments were inserted upstream of the reporter geneLacZ and a nuclear localization signal (26Gramolini A.O. Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S. Cartaud J. Davies K.E. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8117-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additionally, two other 1.3-kb constructs were generated with mutations of the N-box. The 1.3-kb HindIII human utrophin promoter clone (35Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Deconinck A.E. Davies K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was digested with XhoI and PstI liberating a 300-bp fragment containing the N-box, which was then further cloned into pBSSKII(−) (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) generating the clone pBSXP. Mutagenesis was performed using Quick Change (Stratagene) essentially following the manufacturer's instructions except for using clonedPfu polymerase (Stratagene). Two pairs of complementary primers were generated with a single or double point mutation in the N-box (N5F, 5-U-GTG GGG CTG ATC TTC CAG AAC AAA GTT GC; N5R, 5-U-GCA ACT TTG TGG AAG ATC AGC CCC AC; N34F, 5-U-GGG GCT GAT CTT TTG GAA CAA AGT TGC TGG G; and N34R, 5-U-CCC AGC AAC TTT CTT CCA AAA GAT CAG CCC C). pBSXP was used as the template for synthesis of the mutations using these oligonucleotide primer pairs. Following 15 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 7 min, the wild-type plasmid template was destroyed using the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease DpnI. The mutant plasmids were cloned and sequenced to verify the addition of the mutations in the N-box and to confirm that no new mutations had been introduced into other sequences. The 300-bp XhoI/PstI was released and used to replace the equivalent nonmutated fragment at the same sites in the plasmid 1.3-kb nlsLacZ (26Gramolini A.O. Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S.

The new promoter mutant/reporter constructs were then sequenced to check for no further mutations. For transfection and direct gene transfer experiments, plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen mega-prep procedure (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). C2 myoblasts were transfected with 3 μg of the appropriate utrophin promoter-reporter gene construct using the mammalian transfection system-calcium phosphate kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Once the cultures became confluent, the medium was switched to the differentiation medium (see above) to stimulate myotube formation. Three to 4 days later, agrin was added to the medium for 48 h. Levels of β-galactosidase activity were then determined using either a histochemical staining procedure (26Gramolini A.O. Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S. Cartaud J. Davies K.E. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8117-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or a biochemical assay (Promega β-galactosidase enzyme system). For the biochemical assays, the levels of β-galactosidase activity were normalized according to a cotransfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid (Promega) and protein content. In these experiments, the cotransfected CAT plasmid allowed for the correction of any variation due to differences in transfection efficiency between culture wells. CAT activity was determined using a CAT enzyme assay system (Promega) while protein content was determined by the BCA method (see above). For direct gene transfer into mouse tibialis anterior muscles, experiments were performed as described previously (26Gramolini A.O. Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S. Cartaud J. Davies K.E.

Briefly, 25 μl of DNA solution (2 μg/μl) were injected directly into the muscles of 4-week-old mice. Muscles were excised 2 weeks following injection and they were quickly frozen in melting isopentane precooled with liquid nitrogen. Cryostat tissue sections were then processed for β-galactosidase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry (26Gramolini A.O. Dennis C.L. Tinsley J.M. Robertson G.S. Cartaud J. Davies K.E.

The position of blue myonuclei clusters, indicative of utrophin promoter activity and designated as an event, was determined and compared with the presence of neuromuscular junctions using the quantitative procedure recently established by Duclert et al. (36Duclert A. Savatier N. Schaeffer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Paired Student's t tests were performed to evaluate the effects of agrin on utrophin expression. These tests were used to strictly compare the effects of agrin-treatedversus nontreated myotubes. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. throughout. In an initial series of experiments, 3–4-day-old myotubes were treated with agrin purified from Torpedoelectric tissue or with recombinant agrin isoforms in attempts to identify putative extracellular cues capable of regulating utrophin gene expression. As expected, agrin treatment increased the number of AChR clusters present on the surface of these C2 myotubes (Fig.1). Quantitative analyses revealed that the number of AChR clusters per myotube increased by approximately 15-fold (p < 0.05) following Torpedo agrin treatment (Fig. 1). Immunofluorescence experiments using the monoclonal antibody MANCHO 7 showed that utrophin was present at these AChR clusters but only at the largest ones (data not shown). As expected, treatment of myotubes with the predominant isoform of agrin expressed in muscle (C-Ag12,0,0) failed to induce the formation of AChR clusters above the levels normally detected in nontreated cultures. Next, we examined whether agrin treatment which not only led to AChR clustering but also to the reorganization of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton, also influenced expression of utrophin in C2 myotubes. To this end, myotubes were treated with agrin and 48 h later, they were solubilized sequentially in RIPA containing either 0.1% or 5% SDS (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western blotting experiments showed that agrin treatment increased the levels of utrophin in 0.1% SDS-extracted proteins (Fig.2 A). Ponceau staining of the membranes prior to immunoblotting confirmed that an equal amount of proteins had been loaded in each lane of the gel (data not shown). To further ensure that similar amounts of proteins were present in each lane, the same membranes were also processed to determine the levels of sarcomeric myosin and α-actinin. In these experiments, we observed that the amount of sarcomeric myosin (Fig. 2 A) and α-act"

Here we have studied the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) in the regulation of gelsolin-actin interactions in neutrophils. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activityin vivo by wortmannin did not affect the dissociation of actin-gelsolin (1:1) complexes induced by neutrophil stimulation withN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Guanosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS) indirectly promoted the dissociation of actin-gelsolin complexes in a cell-free system using neutrophil cytosol, and this effect was blocked by the GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (Rho-GDI). The GTPγS-loaded iα2 and the β1γ2 subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Giα2 and Gβ1γ2) also triggered actin-gelsolin dissociation in a Rho-GDI-sensitive manner. GTP-loaded activated Rac, but not activated Rho, induced the dissociation of cytosolic actin-gelsolin complexes. The guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac was increased by addition of GTPγS-loaded Giα2or Gβ1γ2 to neutrophil cytosol. These findings suggest that activation of Rac by G-protein-coupled receptors in neutrophils triggers uncapping of actin filaments, independently of PI 3-kinase."

To determine whether activation of JNKs by hypertonicity is isoform-specific, renal inner medullary collecting duct cells were stably transfected with cDNA's encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms, and the expressed kinases were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Whereas both recombinant kinases were equivalently expressed, only immunoprecipitates from the HA-JNK2 cells displayed hypertonicity-inducible JNK activity. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative JNK2 (HA-JNK2-APF) in stable clones inhibited hypertonicity-induced JNK activation by 40–70%, whereas expression of dominant-negative JNK1 (HA-JNK1-APF) had no significant inhibitory effect. Independent HA-JNK2-APF (but not HA-JNK1-APF) clones displayed greatly reduced viability relative to neomycin controls after 16 h of exposure to 600 mosm/kg hypertonic medium with percent survival of 20.5 ± 2.7 and 31.5 ± 7.3 for two independent HA-JNK2-APF clones compared with 80.1 ± 1.0 for neomycin controls (p < 0.001, n = 5, mean ± S.E.). However, neither JNK mutant blocked either regulatory volume increase or hypertonicity-induced enhancement of uptake of inositol, an organic osmolyte putatively involved in long term adaptation to hypertonicity.

The cells of the inner medulla of the mammalian nephron are uniquely exposed to large fluctuations in extracellular tonicity due to the changes that occur during diuretic and antidiuretic states. One means of adaptation to a hypertonic environment that has been well described is the intracellular accumulation of “non-perturbing” osmolytes that occurs either by uptake via sodium-coupled transporters (1Handler J.S. Kwon M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1449-C1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by the generation of sorbitol through the action of aldose reductase on glucose (2Smardo Jr., F.L. Burg M.B. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C776-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process involves increased transcription of transporter genes (3Uchida S.A. Yamauchi A.S. Preston A.S.

Chem. 1995; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In this regard, cells of renal origin display osmotic activation of multiple members of the MAP kinase family, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAP kinases (9Itoh T.

J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F304-F311Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that induction of osmolyte transport by hypertonicity is not significantly impacted by pharmacologic inhibition of the ERK pathways (11Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F304-F311Google Scholar). The marked activation of the JNKs and more modest activation of p38 MAP kinase (11Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F304-F311Google Scholar), which is the mammalian counterpart of the osmoregulated HOG-1 in yeast (12Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), highlights the JNK pathway as being of significance with regard to osmoregulation in the kidney. However, the existence of three distinct JNK genes with several splice variants produced from each gene hampers the clear dissection of the role of JNK in osmoregulation in eukaryotic cells, since different isoforms may play different physiological roles. For example, in small cell lung cancer cells both JNK1 and JNK2 are activated by exposure to UV light but only the JNK1 isoform appears to regulate UV-induced apoptosis (13Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Additionally, whereas JNK activation has been linked to induction of apoptosis in some cell types (14Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), its physiological role in the cellular response to osmotic challenge has not yet been elucidated. The present study was therefore undertaken to define the JNK isoforms regulated by hypertonicity in renal inner medullary collecting duct cells and to determine whether such activation plays a role in cellular adaptation to a hypertonic environment. Cell culture media and serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant GST-c-Jun(1–79) and ATF-2NT(1–254) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Studio City, CA), respectively, as described previously (15Abdel-Hafiz H.A.-M.

IMCD-3 cells were cultured for 24 h in virus-containing conditioned medium that had been filtered through a 0.45 μ filter and supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene. Positive infectants were selected in 500 μg/ml G418, cloned, and further characterized by Western blots using anti-HA antisera, as well as by kinase activity assay (see below). Experiments were performed on cells that had been passaged less than 6 times. To determine activity of transfected HA-JNK's, IMCD-3 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in DMEM:F-12 medium alone or medium supplemented with 150 mmNaCl (600 mosm final). They were then washed three times in isosmotic phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.2–0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min (10,000 × g) to remove nuclei and cell debris, and the supernatants were adjusted to 100–200 μg of protein in 0.5 ml, to which was added 5 μl of mouse monoclonal antiserum directed against the influenza HA epitope (Boehringer Mannheim), and 100 μl of 10% protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia). After 2 h of rocking incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mmMgCl2, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol), and 100 μg/ml recombinant NH2-terminal domain of ATF-2 (ATF-2NT) (6Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the lysates were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and subsequently subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and followed by autoradiography. The bands corresponding to phosphorylated ATF-2NT were excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Assessment of kinase inhibition by HA-JNK-APF constructs was carried out similarly, except that 100 μl of 10% GST-c-Jun-agarose beads were used in place of anti-HA antiserum and ATF-2 peptide, and the final ATP concentration was 20 μm. JNK activity was also assessed following fractionation on Mono Q fast performance liquid chromatography as described previously (11Berl T. Siriwardana G. Ao L. Butterfield L.M. Heasley L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F304-F311Google Scholar). Portions of cell lysates prepared as described above (0.5 ml, 1.0–1.5 mg of protein) were applied to a Pharmacia HR5/5 Mono Q anion exchange column equilibrated in 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 0–600 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and 20-μl aliquots were mixed with 20 ml of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 mm[γ-32P]ATP (5,000 counts/min−1pmol−1), 50 mg/ml IP-20 (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD), and 100 μg/ml recombinant ATF-2NT. The IP-20, a protein kinase A inhibitor, is routinely included in all protein kinase assays. The kinase reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated with 10 μl of SDS sample buffer, and ATF-2NT phosphorylation was assessed following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by liquid scintillation counting of the excised ATF-2NT bands. Subconfluent IMCD-3 cells on 12-well tissue culture plates were treated for 16 h with 1 ml of DMEM:F-12 medium or medium to which sufficient NaCl had been added to bring final osmolality to 400, 500, or 600 mosm/kg. Supernatants were collected, and remaining adherent cells were lifted in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 5 mg/ml porcine trypsin and an appropriate amount of NaCl so that the trypsin solution was isotonic with the treatment medium. Cell suspensions were washed once with the isotonic Hank's balanced salt solution and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 0.4% trypan blue immediately before counting on a hemocytometer. Inositol uptake was measured as in Veis et al. (23Veis J. Molitoris B. Teitelbaum I. Mansour J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F619-F625PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, IMCD-3 cells were treated for 16 h with inositol-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, fraction V (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), after which 5 μl of [3H]inositol (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) was added into 0.5 ml of medium for 2 h. The cells were then vigorously washed three times in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and separate aliquots of the supernatant were either counted in a liquid scintillation counter or analyzed for protein concentration. Cell volume regulation was studied by observing the mean cell volume at various times after hypertonic treatment. Approximately 10 million cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM to inactivate trypsin, centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000 × g, and resuspended in 4 ml of buffer E, consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 140 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmKH2PO4, and 300 mm glucose and having an osmolarity of approximately 300 mosm. After 30 min of equilibration, sufficient NaCl was added to bring the osmolarity to 600 mosm/kg, and the mean cell volume of 10,000 cells per time point was measured using a Coulter Multisizer, Coulter Sample Stand II, and Multisizer AccuComp version 1.19 software, utilizing an aperture tube diameter of 100 μm. Changes in cell volume over time are expressed as relative volume by normalizing to mean cell volume measurements taken on cells before addition of hypertonic NaCl. To ascertain whether the activation of JNK by hypertonicity is isoform specific, we prepared IMCD-3 cell clones stably expressing HA-tagged JNK1 and JNK2. The expression of both HA-tagged JNK isoforms was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1 A). However, whereas neither the neomycin control (devoid of HA-tagged JNK) nor HA-JNK1 was stimulated by hypertonicity, the HA-JNK2 showed a consistent activation in each of three experiments; one is shown in Fig. 1 B. A similar specificity was noted for activation of HA-JNK2 and not HA-JNK1 by UV light. 2P. Wojtaszek and T. Berl, unpublished observations. To characterize the role of JNK2 in response to osmotic stress, we developed stably transfected IMCD-3 cell clones expressing nonphosphorylatable mutants of JNK1 (JNK1-APF) and JNK2 (JNK2-APF). In these mutants, the phosphorylation site, Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY), is altered to Ala-Pro-Phe (APF), rendering the expressed kinase incapable of being phosphorylated, and hence incapable of being activated (18Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 24Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These constructs are predicted to behave as competitive inhibitors of activation of cellular JNK1 and JNK2, respectively, by competing for binding of upstream MAP kinase kinases which normally phosphorylate and thereby activate the JNKs. Fig. 2 A shows the expression of these constructs in two clones each of HA-JNK1-APF and HA-JNK2-APF.To demonstrate whether these constructs inhibit hypertonicity-stimulated JNK activity, GST-c-Jun was employed in JNK activity assays of lysates of cells exposed to hypertonicity. Utilization of this substrate measures activity of all JNK isoforms. Activation of GST-c-Jun phosphorylation in HA-JNK1-APF clones was not significantly different from that of the neomycin controls (Fig.2 B), which is the predicted result if JNK1 is not osmotically regulated, as the results in Fig. 1 suggest. In contrast, HA-JNK2-APF clones consistently displayed a significant inhibition of hypertonicity-induced GST-c-Jun phosphorylation. Two independent stable HA-JNK2-APF clones displayed mean inhibitions of 42 ± 15% and 48 ± 17%, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 2 B(n = 3, mean ± S.E.). It was important to confirm that the apparent inhibition of JNK activity observed by immunoprecipitation truly reflected inhibition of endogenous JNK activity and was not simply the result of an excessive amount of dominant-negative JNK saturating the GST-c-Jun beads used in the JNK binding assay. Therefore, lysates from cells subject to hypertonicity were also fractionated by Mono Q fast performance anion exchange liquid chromatography, and the JNK activity in the fractions was measured. Consistent with the percent inhibition by JNK2-APF observed in the GST-c-Jun binding assay, Fig. 2 C shows a 50% inhibition of hypertonicity-stimulated ATF-2NT phosphorylation in the JNK2-APF clone 9, but not in the neomycin control or the JNK1-APF clone 5. These experiments thus support the above observation that JNK2 is responsible for the majority of hypertonicity-induced JNK activity. If JNK1 activation played a significant role in this response, it would be expected that HA-JNK1-APF would at least partially block phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun in lysates from hypertonically exposed cells. However, only HA-JNK2-APF expression resulted in inhibition of hypertonicity-stimulated phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun, suggesting that JNK2 is the primary source of hypertonicity-stimulated JNK activity. Interestingly, in yeast lacking HOG1 MAP kinase, which is required for growth on hypertonic medium, expression of JNK1 but not JNK2 rescues hypertonic growth (19Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This suggests that functions of different JNK isoforms may not be dictated by amino acid sequence similarityper se but rather by another factor such as differential affinity for specialized upstream MAP kinase kinases or downstream targets. To determine if JNKs play a protective role in cellular adaptation to hypertonicity, we investigated the possibility that the presence of the dominant-negative JNK could impact on cell survival after osmotic challenge. Fig. 3 summarizes the survival data in which we employed two distinct stable clones each of HA-JNK1-APF and HA-JNK2-APF and assayed cell survival after hypertonic challenge utilizing trypan blue exclusion assay. Both JNK2-APF clones displayed decreased survival relative to neomycin controls and to JNK1-APF clones, which were not significantly different from controls. After 16 h at 500 mosm/kg, the two HA-JNK2-APF clones displayed percent survival values of 62.8 ± 3.1 and 68.2 ± 1.9 compared with 82.6 ± 2.8 for neomycin controls (p < 0.01, n = 5, mean ± S.E.), and at 600 mosm/kg, 20.5 ± 2.7 and 31.5 ± 7.3 compared with 80.1 ± 1.0 for neomycin controls (p< .001, n = 5, mean ± S.E.). It is also of note that inhibition of the ERK pathway with PD098059 or of the p38 MAP kinase pathway with SB203580 did not alter the ability of cells to survive osmotic challenge.2 Finally, staining with acridine orange:ethidium bromide revealed that the process leading to cell death was clearly necrosis and not apoptosis. 3P. Wojtaszek, P. Squier, J. J. Cohen, and T. Berl, unpublished observations. The adaptive response to hypertonicity involves increases in cellular content of organic osmolyte transporters leading to enhancement in the uptake of solute (23Veis J. Molitoris B. Teitelbaum I. Mansour J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F619-F625PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether dominant-negative JNK2 may confer sensitivity to hypertonic challenge by interfering with hypertonicity-stimulated organic osmolyte uptake. However, HA-JNK2-APF stable transfectants displayed initial rates of inositol uptake after 16 h in a hypertonic environment at a level comparable to that of neomycin controls (Fig. 4). These studies were done at 500 mosm/kg in view of the sensitivity of the transfected cells to prolonged incubations at higher tonicity (see above and Fig. 3). Furthermore, inositol uptake measurements were normalized per milligram of cell protein, and the culture dishes were vigorously washed three times with isotonic buffer before lysis to avoid interference by protein from nonviable cells in the protein determination assay. These results do not entirely rule out the role for JNK activation in initiating the transcription of sodiummyo-inositol transporter genes, as the residual JNK activity (Fig. 2, B and C) could be sufficient to initiate the process. However, since the degree of inhibition of cellular JNK2 activity in these mutants is sufficient to increase cell lethality after hypertonic challenge both at 500 and 600 mosm/kg, it would be predicted that if a primary function of JNK2 was to activate inositol uptake, some decrement in inositol uptake would be observable in these experiments. In addition to these physiological measurements, Kultz et al. (25Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that dominant-negative mutants of JNK1 and of p38 MAP kinase fail to block activation of an osmotic response element reporter gene construct when transiently transfected into renal PAP-HT25 cells. Our experiments complement these observations, since failure to observe transcriptional activation of the osmotic response element did not exclude the possibility that JNKs act at a site distal to transcription of transporter genes to modulate osmolyte uptake. By examining the final step in sodium myo-inositol transport, the present experiments suggest that the JNK pathway is not involved in regulation at any step in the process. Another characteristic of cell adaptation to hypertonicity is the regulatory volume increase, by which a cell recovers from osmotic shrinkage and regains the volume it displayed before hypertonic treatment. To determine if the JNK2 pathway might contribute to this process, control and JNK-APF cells were subjected to 600 mosm/kg, and their cell volume was monitored with a Coulter Multisizer. Fig. 5 shows that both neomycin and JNK2-APF cells regained their original volume by 20 min, and that the JNK2-APF cells were not significantly different from controls in either time course or extent of regulatory volume increase. Similar data were obtained with the JNK1-APF clones, as well as with neomycin, JNK1-APF, and JNK2-APF cells treated with the ERK inhibitor PD098059 or the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580.2 These data suggest that the mechanism by which JNK2-APF sensitizes cells to killing by hypertonicity does not involve the cell's ability to carry out regulatory volume increase, and in addition, that neither the JNK, ERK, or p38 pathways play a significant role in this process. Whereas these experiments address primarily volume-regulatory mechanisms by which a cell responds to hypertonic stress, it is likely that other systems also play a role in survival of hypertonicity. For example, several groups (26Kojima R. Randall J. Brenner B.M. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12327-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Sheikh-Hamad D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Peters E.M. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F28-F34PubMed Google Scholar) have described members of the heat shock protein 70 superfamily that are up-regulated by exposure to hypertonic NaCl. The hypothesis that these heat shock proteins carry out an osmoprotective function, and that the JNK2 pathway may be involved in their regulation, is presently under investigation. Alternatively, JNK2 may activate as yet unidentified factors that stabilize the cellular machinery to the intracellular ionic changes that occur during osmoregulation. In summary, we have for the first time determined that osmotic activation of JNK activity in renal inner medullary collecting duct cells is isoform-specific, with the major regulated form identified as JNK2. We have also dissociated JNK2 from the adaptive response that recruits sodium myo-inositol transporters and from the ability to carry out regulatory volume increase, but have defined a crucial role for JNK2 in the survival of inner medullary collecting duct cells in a hypertonic environment. We are grateful to Drs. Rick Roman and Greg Fitz, Department of Gastroenterology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, for assistance with cell volume measurements."

Cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl modification experiments demonstrate that the loop connecting transmembrane segments 1 and 2 (loop b) is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, as previously modeled. A mutation in loop b, asparagine 101 to cysteine (N101C), renders the exchanger insensitive to regulation by cytoplasmic Na+ and Ca2+. Nearby mutations at residue threonine 103 (T103C or T103V) increase the apparent affinity of the exchanger for cytoplasmic Na+ and also produce a significant Li+ transport capacity. The evidence suggests that the region at the interface of cytoplasmic loop b and transmembrane segment 2 is important in Na+ transport and also in secondary regulation. Thus, this region may form part of the link between the ion translocation pathway formed by the transmembrane segments and regulatory sites that have previously been localized to loop f.

Thus, this region may form part of the link between the ion translocation pathway formed by the transmembrane segments and regulatory sites that have previously been localized to loop f. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger transports one Ca2+ across the cell membrane in exchange for three Na+ and is important in maintaining Ca2+homeostasis in many cell types, including muscle, nerve, and epithelium. In cardiac muscle, Na+/Ca2+exchange has been well characterized as the primary mechanism for extrusion of the Ca2+ that enters the cell to initiate contraction. Na+/Ca2+ exchange is therefore essential to cardiac relaxation, and an understanding of the function and regulation of this protein is essential to understanding the basis of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity can be readily observed using inside-out giant excised patches in which “reverse” exchange is initiated by applying Na+ to the intracellular surface. This generates an outward current as intracellular Na+ is exchanged for extracellular Ca2+. This protocol, and other studies, have demonstrated that the exchanger is subject to modulation by several cytoplasmic factors, including Na+ and Ca2+. Secondary Na+ regulation is demonstrated by rapidly raising the intracellular Na+ concentration to activate outward Na+/Ca2+ exchange current. Current peaks and then declines over several seconds to a reduced steady-state level. The extent and rate of this partial inactivation are dependent on the concentration of intracellular Na+. This regulatory process has been referred to as Na+-dependent inactivation (1Matsuoka S. Hilgemann D.W. J. Physiol. 1994; 476: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by intracellular Ca2+ has been observed in several preparations. For example, squid axon and mammalian cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchangers have an absolute requirement for intracellular Ca2+. The stimulatory effect of intracellular Ca2+ is most easily demonstrated by measuring reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Under these conditions, the nontransported regulatory Ca2+ is on the opposite side of the membrane from the transported extracellular Ca2+. When NCX1 is expressed in oocytes, a reduction in the intracellular Ca2+ markedly decreases subsequent Ca2+ influx via reverse exchange (3Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These and other regulatory effects can be abolished by partial proteolysis with chymotrypsin (2Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Based on hydropathy analysis, the exchanger is modelled to consist of 11 transmembrane segments with a large intracellular loop (loop f) between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (Fig. 1). The extracellular location of the amino terminus (4Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the intracellular location of loop f (6Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Physiol. 1993; 265: C748-C756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been experimentally verified. Also, loop e, between transmembrane segments 4 and 5, appears to be extracellular, based on the glycosylation of an exchanger truncated at that site (5Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Friedlander M. Biochem. Biomed. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The transmembrane segments are essential for ion transport, whereas loop f is involved in regulation (6Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and that another portion of loop f is involved in the binding of regulatory Ca2+ (Fig. 1) (3Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A.

Binding of regulatory Ca2+decreases Na+-dependent inactivation (11Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and mutations in the endogenous XIP region alter the kinetics of Ca2+ regulation (9Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Other mutagenesis studies have implicated the involvement of two highly conserved and internally homologous regions (the α-repeats) in ion transport (12Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the molecular details of ion transport are unknown, as are the mechanisms by which loop f interacts with the transmembrane segments to effect regulation. We used substituted cysteine mutagenesis and sulfhydryl modification reagents to determine the membrane topology and explore the function of residues modelled to be at the interface of loop b and transmembrane segment 2. Wild-type NCX1 mutants were expressed in Xenopusoocytes, and Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was measured as 45Ca2+ uptake into intact oocytes or as Na+i-activated outward current in giant patches excised from oocyte membranes. We show that this region is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and may form part of the link between transport and regulation. Mutations in the wild-type exchanger were generated using the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corp.). cRNA was synthesized with mMessage mMachine (Ambion) and injected intoXenopus laevis oocytes. Na+/Ca2+exchange activities were measured after incubation of the oocytes for 3–6 days at 17–19 °C. To directly measure 45Ca2+ fluxes, oocytes were first loaded with Na+ by incubation in ice-cold Barth's solution containing 20 μm nystatin, 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide for 10 min. Oocytes were then washed four times in 4 ml of 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and placed into45Ca2+ uptake medium containing either NaCl (90 mm) (to measure nonspecific Ca2+ uptake) or KCl (90 mm) (to measure Na+gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake) and 10 μm CaCl2, 6.4 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4, and 6 μCi/ml45CaCl2 for 10 min, at which time Ca2+ uptake was still in a linear phase. Unincorporated45Ca2+ was then removed by washing the oocytes four times in 10 ml of ice-cold 90 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA. Oocytes were individually placed into scintillation vials and dissolved in 0.25 ml of 1 m NaOH at 100 °C for 20 min. Scintillation fluid (10 ml) was added, and the amount of45Ca2+ uptake was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The small nonspecific Ca2+ uptake was subtracted from the Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ uptake as a measure of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. We have previously used this technique extensively to quantitate Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (6Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

To investigate the effects of extracellular sulfhydryl reagents NEM, MTSES, and MTSET, oocytes were preincubated with reagents (10 mm) for 10 min and then washed four times. To determine the effects of intracellular sulfhydryl reagents, 100 mm MTSES or MTSET was injected into oocytes 10 min before measuring45Ca2+ uptake to produce an estimated cytoplasmic concentration of 10 mm (assuming an intracellular oocyte volume of 0.5 μl). MTS reagents were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. Na+/Ca2+ exchange current was measured under voltage clamp in inside-out membrane patches using the giant excised patch technique (2Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen.

Pipettes were filled with the following external solution: 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine·2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 30 mm HEPES, 8 mmCaCO3, 2 mm Ba(OH)2, 2 mm Mg(OH)2, 0.025 mm ouabain, 0.05 mm niflumic acid, 30 mm TEAOH. The bath, or cytoplasmic, solution contained 100 mm2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, 20 mmCsOH, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mmMg(OH)2, 20 mm TEAOH, and 100 mmCsOH, NaOH, or LiOH. CaCO3 was added to give the indicated free Ca2+ concentration. In experiments involving deregulation of the exchanger by partial proteolysis, 1 mg/ml chymotrypsin was added to a cytoplasmic solution containing 0 Na+ and 1 μm free Ca2+. All solutions were pH 7.0, membrane holding potential was 0 mV, and experiments were conducted at 34–35 °C. Data summaries are presented as an average of nexperiments ± S.E. Results from 6–8 oocytes were averaged for each experiment measuring 45Ca2+ flux. Fig. 1 shows a model for the Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein, based primarily on hydropathy analysis. Loop b consists of amino acids 63–101 and is modeled to be on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. To determine the orientation of loop b with respect to the membrane, we used substituted cysteine mutagenesis. Specifically, residues modeled to be near the surface of the membrane were mutated to cysteine, and the mutants were exposed to sulfhydryl modifying reagents that form covalent bonds with accessible cysteines. We then examined the effects on exchange activity of membrane-permeable reagents and of impermeable reagents applied either extracellularly or intracellularly. The wild-type and mutated canine NCX1 exchangers were expressed inXenopus oocytes. Amino acids Ser-100, Asn-101, Leu-102, Thr-103, and Ala-106 were each individually mutated to cysteine. The mutant T103V (12Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was also examined in this study. Fig.2 shows the activity of each of the mutants relative to the wild-type exchanger. Except for mutant N101C, which had a wild-type level of activity, all of the mutants displayed approximately half the activity of the wild-type exchanger. This may reflect either a reduction in the level of protein expression or a direct effect of the mutation on exchange activity. The membrane-permeable reagent NEM had no significant effect on the wild-type exchanger but inhibited each of the cysteine mutants except A106C (Fig. 3). T103C was inhibited least. T103C and A106C were modeled to be within the membrane, and may be less accessible, even to membrane-permeable sulfhydryl reagents, than the other cysteine mutants. The effects of intracellular or extracellular application of MTSET or MTSES are illustrated in Fig. 4. MTS reagents have been used extensively in sulfhydryl modification experiments (14Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 15Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Kurz L.L. Zuhlke R.D. Zhang H.J. Joho R.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 900-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These relatively large, charged molecules (MTSET is cationic, and MTSES is anionic) are membrane-impermeable. The MTS reagents were either applied extracellularly, by incubating oocytes in medium containing 10 mm reagent, or applied intracellularly, by injecting 100 mm MTS solution into the oocyte for an estimated cytoplasmic concentration of 10 mm. The wild-type exchanger is relatively insensitive to either MTSET or MTSES, although intracellular MTSET caused a modest stimulation (Fig.4). Extracellular applications of MTSET or MTSES had no substantial effects on any of the cysteine mutants. On the other hand, intracellular application of MTSET or MTSES inhibited mutants S100C and L102C. Mutant T103C may also be modestly inhibited by intracellular MTSES. The results verify that the loop b-transmembrane segment 2 interface is located at the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. The results also suggest that the region is functionally significant because the activity of mutants was inhibited by sulfhydryl modifications. Further investigation showed that two mutations in this region had important effects on specific aspects of Na/Ca exchange function. Mutant N101C showed altered sensitivity to intracellular Na+ and Ca2+, which suggests that loop b is involved in secondary regulation by these factors. Fig.5 A illustrates the regulatory effects of intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ on wild-type Na+/Ca2+ exchange current. Current is activated by application of intracellular Na+; the slow decay is due to the secondary inhibitory effect of Nai+(2Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). When intracellular Ca2+ is removed, the current is further inhibited, demonstrating the Ca2+ regulatory effect. These regulatory effects are also characteristic of cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity measured in situ (1Matsuoka S. Hilgemann D.W. J. Physiol. 1994; 476: 443-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both of these effects are abolished following partial proteolysis of the exchanger by chymotrypsin. Fig. 5 B shows that N101C has altered regulatory properties. There was no decay in current amplitude after current was activated by raising Nai+, and when Cai2+ was lowered to 0, there was only a small reduction in current amplitude. In a series of experiments, the wild-type Na+/Ca2+exchange current decayed to 43 ± 4% of peak after Na+-dependent inactivation (n = 5), but decay of N101C current was insignificant (n = 8). Removal of regulatory Ca2+ reduced the wild-type current by 55 ± 5% even after Na+-dependent inactivation, but it reduced the N101C current by only 24 ± 4%. N101C appeared to function like the wild-type exchanger after deregulation by chymotrypsin. In preliminary experiments, exchangers S100C and L102C displayed normal regulatory properties. Although mutant N101C resembles the chymotrypsin-treated wild-type exchanger in terms of a lack of sensitivity to regulatory ions, chymotrypsin digestion still stimulates the current of N101C. This stimulation was small in the experiment shown in Fig. 5 B, but in other experiments, the stimulation was more substantial (97 ± 14%; n = 5). Interestingly, chymotrypsin also abolished NEM inhibition of N101C, as shown in Fig.6. In the experiment shown in Fig.6 A, outward current activated by raising cytoplasmic Na+ was inhibited by NEM applied in the cytoplasmic solution, and this inhibitory effect was irreversible. The results indicate that NEM modified the cysteine introduced at residue 101 in such a way as to interfere with exchange, consistent with the data shown above (Fig. 3). When the exchanger was partially proteolyzed by cytoplasmic chymotrypsin and then exposed to NEM, no inhibitory effect was seen (Fig. 6 B). The preceding results indicate that mutation N101C alters the response of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger to regulatory ions. We also find that mutations in putative transmembrane segment 2, near loop b, affect ion translocation properties. Mutation of threonine 103 modifies the dependence of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger on cytoplasmic monovalent cations. Fig.7 shows the dependence of outward Na+/Ca2+ exchange current on cytoplasmic Na+ concentration. The excised patches were first exposed to chymotrypsin to remove complicating regulatory effects in these experiments. The wild-type Nai+ dependence was sigmoidal, with half-maximal activation at 16 mmNai+. The Nai+ dependence for mutant T103V was shifted to the left, with half-maximal activation at lower Nai+ (8 mm) and with a decreased Hill coefficient. Mutant T103V thus has a higher apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+ and an apparent decreased cooperativity of Nai+-binding. The observed increase in apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+ raised the possibility that mutant T103V might also have an altered selectivity for monovalent cations. We tested this possibility using 45Ca2+ flux measurements. Oocytes were loaded with Li+ in place of Na+, and 45Ca2+ uptake was measured. The T103V mutant is capable of a greater Li+-dependent45Ca2+ uptake than the wild-type exchanger (Fig. 8). Similar results were seen after loading with K+ or Cs+ (data not shown). Mutant T103V therefore appears to have a reduced selectivity for Na+ over other monovalent cations and may be capable of translocating other monovalent cations besides Na+ in exchange for Ca2+. An alternative possibility is that T103V could support a higher level of Ca2+/Ca2+ exchange than does the wild-type exchanger, so that increased extracellular45Ca2+ would be taken up in exchange for endogenous intracellular Ca2+, irrespective of the internal monovalent cation. In this case, there would be no associated membrane current, because Ca2+/Ca2+ exchange is not electrogenic. However, in voltage clamp experiments (Fig.9), Li+ activates a significant, concentration-dependent, outward current in oocytes expressing T103V. The wild-type exchanger shows no change in current when Lii+ is applied. Neither Na+nor Li+ activated significant outward current in control water-injected oocytes (data not shown). The ability of K+to activate currents was not tested, although Cs+ did not appear to do so (Fig. 9). Ca2+/Ca2+ exchange may have been the prominent mode of 45Ca2+uptake for T103V when oocytes were loaded with these monovalent cations (see “Discussion”). A summary of the dependence of outward membrane current on [Na+]i or [Li+]ifor mutant T103V is shown in Fig. 10. The estimated K½ for Na+ is 8 mm, and for Li+, it is 100 mm. Thus, in addition to an apparent increase in affinity for Nai+ (Fig. 7), T103V displays a significant Lii+-dependent current. Mutant T103C has similar properties (data not shown). In this study, we have investigated a previously unexamined region of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein. Mutations in loop b and the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 2 verify that this region is located at the cytoplasmic face and suggest that it is involved in ion translocation and regulation by cytoplasmic factors. The transmembrane segments of the Na+/Ca2+exchange protein have been assigned based on hydropathy analysis of the amino acid sequence (13Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Previous results support the extracellular assignment of the amino terminus (4Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and loop e, between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 (5Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Friedlander M. Biochem. Biomed. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the intracellular assignment of loop f, between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (6Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F.

In this study, mutants S100C and L102C, located in loop b, were sensitive only to intracellular application of membrane-impermeable reagents MTSET and MTSES, thus assigning these residues to the intracellular surface. These results extend our understanding of the structure of the exchanger by assigning loop b, between transmembrane segments 2 and 3, to the inside of the cell. These results were dependent upon the fact that none of the sulfhydryl modifying reagents we used inhibited the wild-type exchanger. It appears that the endogenous cysteines are inaccessible to modifying reagents or that the accessible cysteines are not intimately involved in exchanger function. An alternative, though unlikely, interpretation is that the mutations in loop b induce a conformational change that exposes a native cysteine to cytoplasmic MTS reagent. We are in the process of constructing a cysteine-less mutant to investigate this possibility. There are two interesting points in the effect of the membrane-permeable reagent NEM on the loop b mutants. First, the effect of NEM was reduced as the mutations were introduced further into transmembrane segment 2 (Fig. 3). This may be an indication that the mutated residues with reduced NEM sensitivity are in the transmembrane segment as modeled. Second, mutants N101C and T103C are sensitive to inhibition by NEM but not by the MTS reagents. Thus, these two residues are solvent-accessible but are more restricted to chemical reaction than residues Ser-100 or Leu-102. There may perhaps be local hydrophobic or steric constraints preventing reaction with the MTS reagents. Secondary regulation by cytoplasmic Na+ and Ca2+ has previously been localized to functional sites in loop f, but no other regions of the exchanger were implicated in the regulatory process. Mutations in the endogenous XIP region (Fig. 1) can remove Na+-dependent inactivation but not Ca2+ stimulation (9Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of amino acids 562–685 has the opposite effect (6Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), removing Ca2+stimulation but not Na+-dependent inactivation. A functionally important binding site for regulatory Ca2+has been identified at amino acids 371–508 (10Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some mutations in loop f alter both Na+ inhibition and Ca2+stimulation, indicating that the two processes interact (9Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Loop f must exert regulatory effects on transport by influencing the transmembrane segments that catalyze ion translocation. We show here that a mutation in loop b (N101C) interferes with secondary regulation by Na+ and Ca2+. Two explanations are considered. First, the residue at position 101 may interact with loop f. Mutating residue Asn-101 to cysteine may then alter interaction between loops b and f and block regulation. Second, the mutation may alter the protein conformation so that loop f is no longer able to appropriately influence, and regulate, the transmembrane segments. We are unable to distinguish these possibilities. Nevertheless, in both cases, the interface of loop b and transmembrane segment 2 is identified as a key site in the coupling of regulation to translocation. We explored the possibility that the cysteine introduced in N101C interrupts regulatory mechanisms by forming an internal disulfide bond with a native cysteine. We found that the reducing agent dithiothreitol does not restore regulation to the mutant as would be expected under these circumstances (data not shown). Thus, it does not appear that disulfide bond formation is the cause of loss of regulation in N101C. Partial proteolysis by cytoplasmic chymotrypsin, which removes secondary regulatory effects of intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ in the wild-type Na+/Ca2+exchanger, also prevents the inhibitory effect of the sulfhydryl reagent NEM on N101C. Proteolysis may remove secondary regulation in the wild-type exchanger by disrupting the interaction between regulatory sites in loop f and the translocation pathway. It is thought that the major site for proteolysis of the exchanger is within loop f (17Iwata T. Galli C. Dainese P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fact that proteolysis removes the NEM effect on mutant N101C suggests a functional relationship between loops b and f. Again, the relationship could be either a direct or an indirect interaction. The cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 2 appears to play a role in the translocation of Na+ ions. Mutant T103V shows an increased apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+ and also seems to support Li+/Ca2+ exchange. T103C has identical characteristics, but mutant N101C does not show any Li+-activated current (data not shown). The Li+-activated current of mutant T103V is relatively small. At 100 mm activating ion, the Li+-activated exchange current is about 20% of Na+-activated exchange current. Because mutant T103V has a higher affinity for Na+than the wild-type exchanger, the possibility arises that contaminating Na+ in the cytoplasmic Li+ solution could activate significant current in the mutant but not the wild-type exchanger. This is unlikely because we used 99.95% pure LiOH, and 2–3 mm contaminating Na+ would have to be present in the 100 mm Li+ solution to produce a contamination artifact. The 45Ca2+ flux measurements show that mutant T103V transports Ca2+ ions across the membrane without requiring a Na+ gradient (Fig. 8), and the Li+-activated outward current indicates that an electrogenic process accompanies this Ca2+ transport (Fig.9). This suggests that mutant T103V can directly catalyze Li+/Ca2+ exchange. Other Na+transporters, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger (18Terzic A. Kurachi Y. Molecular Physiology and Pharmacology of Cardiac Ion Channels and Transporters. Kluwer, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 555-561Google Scholar), the Na+/K+ ATPase (19Skou J. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 95-100Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (20Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can substitute Li+ for Na+ to varying degrees. However, this is the first report of a plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger capable of Li+transport. The relative level of Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange may also be higher for mutant T103V than for the wild-type exchanger. When45Ca2+ uptake was measured in the presence of a Li+ gradient (Fig. 8), 45Ca2+ flux is due to a combination of Li+/Ca2+ exchange and Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange (external45Ca2+ exchanging for internal endogenous Ca2+). On the other hand, Li+-induced currents (Fig. 9) are due only to Li+/Ca2+ exchange (Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange is not electrogenic). For mutant exchanger T103V, the 45Ca2+ flux into Li+-loaded oocytes was about 80% of that into Na+-loaded oocytes, but the Li+-induced current was only about 20% of the Na+-induced current. Thus, Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange activity of T103V appeared to be much more robust than that of the wild-type exchanger. In parallel experiments (not shown; n = 2), Li+-loaded oocytes were diluted into45Ca2+ uptake medium containing K+(Li+ gradient present) or Li+ (no Li+ gradient). 45Ca2+ uptake levels for the wild-type exchanger were 33 and 27%, respectively, of that obtained in the presence of a Na+ gradient. For mutant T103V, these values were 107 and 173%. These results are consistent with the idea that the level of Ca2+-Ca2+exchange is greater in mutant T103V than in the wild-type exchanger. The data in Fig. 10, showing the relative transport activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and Li+/Ca2+ exchange for T103V, were fit well with a simple model. Using a sequential Na+/Ca2+exchange cycle to represent the wild-type exchanger, we added low-affinity Li+ binding and Li+/Ca2+ exchange. In this model, the best fit is produced when Li+ binds with a K½ of 100 mm and the Li+ translocation rate is 40% of the Na+ translocation rate. It is possible that residue Thr-103 is part of a Na+ binding site and that the mutation increases the affinity of the site for Na+ and also for Li+. It is striking to note the proximity of the residue to α-repeat 1 (Fig. 1), which begins at alanine 106. The α-repeats are highly conserved among different isoforms of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and play an important role in function (12Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The functional map of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange protein is augmented by the data presented here. Loop b has been localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and assigned a potential role in secondary regulation of the exchanger by cytoplasmic factors. The cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 2 may have an important functional role in the transport of Na+. The loop b-transmembrane segment 2 interface could be an important structural link between ion translocation and regulation."

In addition, the CD spectrum of a tryptic peptide of the α-subunit containing the M1 segment is also consistent with a largely α-helical structure. However, secondary structure analysis of the α-M1 CD spectrum indicates the presence of other structures, suggesting that the M1 segment may represent either a distorted α-helix, likely the consequence of several proline residues, or may not be entirely α-helical.

Each of the subunits associate about a central axis to form a cation-selective ion channel (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J.

The AChR is the best characterized member of a family of ligand-gated ion channels that includes the γ-aminobutyric acid type A, the glycine, and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptors (recent reviews include Refs. 5Smith G.B.

In the postsynaptic membrane, about half of the mass of the AChR projects extracellularly beyond the lipid bilayer. This projection, which is made up of the hydrophilic, amino-terminal half of each AChR subunit, contains the agonist binding sites and sites ofN-linked glycosylation, whereas about 30% of the AChR is within the bilayer and the remaining portion is in the cytoplasmic domain (8Mitra A.K.

Hydropathy profiles indicate that each subunit contains four hydrophobic segments 20–30 amino acids in length, designated M1–M4, that were proposed to be membrane-spanning α-helices (11Noda M.

Heinemann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although the transmembrane disposition of each of these segments has been fairly well established (reviewed in Ref. 15Cont-Tronconi B.M. McLane K.E. Raftery M.A. Grando S.A. Protti M.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 69-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the nature of their secondary structure is at present controversial. Based on recent electron microscopy results (Refs. 10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar and 16Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar; 9-Å resolution), the transmembrane structure of the AChR is proposed to consist of a ring of five α-helices surrounded by a rim of β-strands. The five helices, which are associated at the central axis, lining the pore of the ion channel, are presumed to be made up of M2 segments from each subunit, based upon results of photoaffinity labeling studies done with non-competitive antagonists and functional studies of AChRs with mutations within M2 (reviewed in Refs. 17Changeux J.P. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiery A. Bertrand D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 395-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and18Karlin A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Since no additional α-helices were apparent in the rim of electron density flanking the M2 helices, the remaining transmembrane structure, which would be made up of the M1, M3, and M4 hydrophobic segments, was assumed to be organized as β-sheets (see also Ref.19Gorne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Kaduk C. Naumann D. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies using several different photoactivatable hydrophobic probes have identified amino acid residues in contact with the lipid bilayer in the M3 and M4 segments of each of the AChR subunits (20Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B.

Biophys J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 152aGoogle Scholar); from the periodicity of labeled residues, it was concluded that each of these segments is organized as a transmembrane α-helix. The structure of the AChR was also examined using a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange and FTIR spectroscopy (24Baenziger J.E. Méthot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presence of an exchange-resistant pool of α-helical peptides was interpreted as providing evidence for a predominantly α-helical secondary structure of the AChR transmembrane domains. The simplest interpretation of these studies is that the hydrophobic segments M1–M4 in each of the AChR subunits are organized as a bundle of four membrane-spanning α-helices. Determining the structure of individual transmembrane segments in each of the AChR subunit remains an important goal. This is particularly true if, as the former set of studies suggest, the AChR membrane-spanning domains comprise both α-helical and β-sheet type structures. In the present study, we isolated peptides that contained one or more transmembrane segments of the AChR and determined the secondary structure of the lipid reconstituted peptide using both CD and FTIR spectroscopy. The largely α-helical nature of each of these peptides provides additional support for a model of the transmembrane region of the AChR that comprises membrane-spanning α-helices. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease was purchased from ICN Biochemicals andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin from Worthington Biochemical Corp. Genapol C-100 (10%) was purchased from Calbiochem. Asolectin, a crude soybean lipid extract, was from Avanti Polar Lipids. Spectra/Por Dispo Dialyzers (molecular weight cut-off = 2000) were from Spectrum. AChR-rich membranes were isolated from the electric organ of T. californica (Aquatic Research Consultants, San Pedro, CA) according to the procedure of Sobelet al. (25Sobel A. Weber M. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (26Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol.

AChR subunits were resolved by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 1.5-mm-thick 8% polyacrylamide gels with 0.33% bis(acrylamide). Typically, 10–12 mg of AChR membranes were resolved on a single 1.5-mm gel, with 40–50 mg processed in a single experiment. Polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 (0.25% w/v in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and destaining in 25% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Gels were soaked in distilled water overnight and individual AChR subunit bands excised. For the AChR α-subunit, the excised gel pieces were transferred to the wells of individual 15% mapping gels (26Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol.

The α-subunit was proteolytically digested in the gel with S. aureus V8 protease and following staining and destaining the V8 fragments α-V8–10 (Asn339–Gly437) and α-V8–20 (Ser173–Glu338) were excised (21Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). AChR subunits and V8 proteolytic fragments were isolated from the excised gel pieces by passive elution (21Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The eluate was filtered and the protein concentrated using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon). Excess SDS was removed by acetone precipitation (overnight at −20 °C). Receptor subunits, α-V8–10, and α-V8–20 were proteolytically digested and peptides purified using protocols similar to those reported previously (21Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For trypsin digestion, acetone-precipitated AChR subunits and V8 protease fragments were resuspended in a small volume (∼100 μl) of buffer (100 mmNH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.8). The SDS concentration was then reduced by diluting with buffer without SDS, and Genapol C-100 (Calbiochem) was added, resulting in final concentrations of 0.02% SDS, 0.5% Genapol C-100, and 1–2 mg/ml protein. Trypsin was added up to a total of 1:5 (w/w) enzyme to substrate ratio for intact subunits (∼1 mg of protein) and to 1:1 (w/w) for α-V8–10 and α-V8–20. The digests were incubated at room temperature for 3–4 days and the resulting peptides separated on 1.5-mm-thick small pore Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Following staining and destaining of a strip of each Tricine gel, selected fragments were excised based upon previous results (21Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and with the aid of prestained low molecular weight standards (Life Technologies, Inc.). Isolated fragments were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Brownlee Aquapore C4 column (100 × 2.1 mm). Solvent A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and Solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol. The flow rate was maintained at 0.2 ml/min and 0.5-ml fractions collected. Prior to injection, material isolated from excised gel pieces was filtered, the protein concentrated using a Centricon-3 (Amicon), and the material then spun briefly (15,000 rpm for ∼10 s) in a table-top microcentrifuge to sediment any insoluble material. Peptides were eluted with a nonlinear gradient from 25% to 100% Solvent B in 80 min. The elution of peptides was monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm. Peptide containing HPLC fractions were pooled and dried by vacuum centrifugation. Peptides were resuspended in 1 ml of 2% octyl-β-glucoside and asolectin lipid in 2% sodium cholate added to achieve an estimated lipid to peptide molar ratio of ∼15:1. The octyl-β-glucoside and sodium cholate were removed by dialysis using Spectra/Por CE Dispo Dialyzers (molecular weight cut-off, 2000) for 2 days against phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate, 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). Each sample was concentrated to 200 μl using a Centricon-3 and stored at −80 °C. A small aliquot of each sample was subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis to confirm the identity of the peptide and estimate its concentration. An additional aliquot was labeled with the hydrophobic photoreagent [125I]TID. The labeled peptide was resolved on a 1.0-mm-thick Tricine gel and the dried gel subjected to autoradiography. Labeling with [125I]TID served as an additional test of peptide purity and to confirm that no significant peptide aggregation (irreversible) had occurred. CD spectra were measured with a AVIV 60DS spectropolarimeter in a rectangular quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm path length. Repetitive scans (5–10 scans) were recorded and averaged at 25 °C with a 1-s integration time, a 0.1-nm step size, and a 1.5-nm bandwidth. The spectra were collected in phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate, 5 mm NaCl, pH 7.0). The protein concentration in the samples was determined by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Spectra of peptide-free lipid vesicles prepared in parallel with the lipid-peptide samples and were used to correct for background lipid absorbance and scattering. Secondary structure estimations were obtained by spectral deconvolution using the Prosec program (AVIV Instruments) using the four-basis spectra set (α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and other) of Chang et al.(31Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). FTIR spectra were acquired using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique on an FTS-40 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadium telluride detector. The spectrometer was purged with dry air (dew point −100 °C) from a Balston air dryer (Balston, Haverhill, MA). FTIR spectra were obtained at a resolution of 2 cm−1 with a minimum of 256 scans/spectrum. Samples were prepared by spreading an aliquot of the reconstituted peptide on the surface of a 50 mm × 20 mm × 2-mm germanium ATR crystal (Harrick, Ossining, NY). Bulk solvent was evaporated with a gentle stream of N2 gas and the ATR crystal immediately installed in an ATR liquid sample cell. Evaporation of the bulk1H2O solution was required to obtain a protein signal of reasonable strength relative to the overlapping absorbance of1H2O. After data acquisition, samples were exposed to 2H20 buffer (5 mmphosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, pH 6.6). The bulk solvent was evaporated by flowing N2 gas through the ATR sample compartment, and spectra of the deuterated peptides were recorded. Spectral deconvolution was performed using GRAMS/386 version 1 (Galactic Industries, Salem, NH) and a γ = 3.5 and a smoothing factor of 0.2. Prior to deconvolution, all spectra were examined for the presence of water vapor as described by Reid and Baenziger (32Reid S.E. Moffatt D.J. Baenziger J.E. Spectrochim. Acta. 1996; 52: 1347-1356Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Beckman Instruments (Porton) model 20/20 protein sequencer using gas phase cycles (Texas Tech Biotechnology Core Facility). Peptide aliquots (∼5–10 μl) were immobilized on chemically modified glass fiber discs (Beckman Instruments), which were used to improve the sequencing yields of hydrophobic peptides (33Pedersen S.E. Sharp S.D. Liu W.S. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10489-10499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were subjected to 10 sequencing cycles and Initial yield (I o) and repetitive yield (R) were calculated by nonlinear least squares regression of the observed release (M) for each cycle (n): M= I o R n (phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives of Ser, Thr, Cys, and His were omitted from the fit). Peptides containing the transmembrane segments M2-M3 (Met249–Arg307), M1-M2-M3 (Lys216–Arg307) of the AChR β-subunit, the M4 segment of the α- and γ-subunits (Tyr401–Gly437, Val446–Arg485, respectively), and the M1 segment (Ile210–Lys242) of the α-subunit were isolated from proteolytic digests of receptor subunits. Subunit digests were resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE, and bands corresponding to these selected fragments were excised on the basis on their known electrophoretic migration (20Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 21Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34White B.H.

Peak HPLC fractions (arrow) were pooled, the solvent removed, the peptide resuspended in detergent (octyl-β-glucoside), and reconstituted into asolectin (a crude soybean lipid extract) vesicles. The identity and concentration of each reconstituted peptide was assessed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. For each peptide, any secondary sequences (peptides) that were detected were present at 1/10 to 1/20 the amount of the primary sequence. An aliquot of each peptide was labeled with the hydrophobic photoreagent [125I]TID and the labeled peptide resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE. For each peptide, a single band was apparent in the corresponding autoradiograph and migrating with the appropriate apparent molecular weight. [125I]TID-labeled peptide also provided a means of verifying that the peptide had not undergone any significant (irreversible) aggregation.Figure 3Reverse-phase HPLC purification and CD spectra of the transmembrane fragment α-M1. Panel A, AChR-rich membranes (∼50 mg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and each of the AChR subunits isolated. For the α-subunit, α-V8–20 (Ser173–Glu338) was isolated from a limited “in gel” digest of the intact subunit (see “Experimental Procedures”). The α-V8–20 fragment was then digested in solution with trypsin, and the digest resolved on 1.5-mm-thick 16.5% T, 6% C Tricine SDS-PAGE gels. The tryptic gel fragment α-T-4K was isolated and further purified by reverse-phase HPLC (see Fig. 1 legend) with the elution of the peptide monitored by absorbance at 210 nm (solid line). The α-T-4K fragment elutes at about 85 min (seearrow), and the fragment identity (Ile210–Lys216, α-M1) was subsequently confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.Panel B, HPLC-purified fragment α-T-4K (α-M1) was reconstituted into lipid (asolectin) vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the CD spectrum measured (in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm sodium chloride buffer, pH 7.0). The α-T-4K (10 μm) peptide contains the transmembrane segment M1 of the α-subunit, and the final CD spectrum was obtained by averaging over five scans with background subtracted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CD measurements provide a convenient method of looking at the overall secondary structure of a given protein or peptide, from which the relative contributions of different secondary structures can be estimated (35Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 36Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 161-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, the CD spectra of membrane proteins is complicated by the fact that the spectra often exhibit various degrees of distortion in shapes, intensities, etc., that result from optical artifacts of differential light scattering and adsorption flattening (reviewed in Ref. 37Park K. Perczel A. Fasman G.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1032-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is therefore important that secondary structure estimations be interpreted qualitatively. Fig. 2 shows the CD spectra of peptides β-M2-M3, β-M1-M2-M3, α-M4, and γ-M4 reconstituted into asolectin lipid vesicles (lipid:protein ratio, ∼15:1). In each sample, minima are observed at approximately 208 and 222 nm that are characteristic of α-helical structure. Similar CD spectra (data not shown) were obtained for these same peptides reconstituted into octyl-β-glucoside (2% w/v) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (10 mm) micelles. Micellar SDS is considered to be a good membrane-mimetic solvent (38Li S.C. Deber C.M. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 515-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For example, synthetic peptides of transmembrane segments of bacteriorhodopsin retain their α-helical structure in SDS (40Ozawa S. Hayashi R. Masuda A. Iio T. Takahashi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 41Lomize A.L. Pervushin K.V. Arseniev A.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, it should also be said that there exists considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of predicting the correct structure of a peptide in any single solvent environment (42Waterhous D.V. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2121-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To qualitatively estimate the amount of peptide present in the α-helical state, the CD spectra were deconvolved using the basis spectra of Chang et al. (31Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The Chang et al.basis spectra were derived from linear analysis of the CD spectra from 16 globular proteins with high resolution crystal structures. The spectral deconvolution results are summarized in TableI. For each peptide, α-helix was the predominant secondary structure conformation (e.g.β-M2-M3, 85% α-helix, 15% β-turn).Table ISummary of secondary structure results derived from CD spectraα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnOther%%%%β-T-8K (M2-M3)85—15—β-T-10K (M1-M2-M3)80—20—α-T-4K (M4)87—13—γ-T-5K (M4)80—119 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 B shows the CD spectrum of the reconstituted α-M1 peptide (Ile210–Lys242). Although the spectrum exhibits minima at approximately 208 and 222 nm characteristic of α-helical structure, the minimum at 208 nm is substantially reduced in magnitude. The results of spectral deconvolution (TableII) indicate that the peptide is largely α-helical (56%) but that there is also a substantial amount of non-helical structure present (44%).Table IISecondary structure analysis of the CD spectrum of α-M1 peptideα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnOther%%%%α-T-4K (M1)56—1529 Open table in a new tab Representative FTIR spectra for the transmembrane peptide γ-M4 (γ-T-5K) recorded in both1H2O and 2H2O are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. The amide I band (1600–1700 cm−1) is due predominantly to the stretching vibration of the peptide carbonyl, the frequency of which is highly sensitive to hydrogen bonding and thus protein secondary structure (43Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). In 1H2O, the amide I band for γ-M4 is roughly symmetric with an intense peak maximum centered near 1656 cm−1. Two weak shoulders are also located near 1677 and 1627 cm−1. The spectral shape and peak maximum are both highly characteristic of peptides in an α-helical conformation, which suggests that γ-M4 adopts a predominantly α-helical secondary structure. However, peptides in a solvent exposed “random coil” conformation can also vibrate in the 1655 cm−1 region in 1H2O. To distinguish between the contributions of α-helical and random structures to the 1655 cm−1 maximum, spectra were recorded after exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O. The exchange of peptide hydrogens for deuterium leads to a shift in intensity from the 1656 cm−1 down to both 1653 cm−1 and roughly 1640 cm−1. The former shift in intensity from near 1656 cm−1 down to 1653 cm−1 is highly characteristic of the up to 5 cm−1 downshifts in frequency that have been observed upon exposure of other α-helical peptides to 2H2O (24Baenziger J.E. Méthot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Baenziger J.E. Chew J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3617-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, the shift in frequency from near 1656 cm−1 down to near 1640 cm−1 is highly characteristic of the downshifts in frequency of random coil. The strong intensity at 1653 cm−1 in2H2O further supports the predominantly α-helical nature of the γ-M4 polypeptide. Similar spectral changes were observed upon transfer of the peptide β-T-8K (β-M2-M3) from1H2O to 2H2O. To quantify the relative amounts of secondary structure in both the transmembrane segments γ-M4 and β-M2-M3, the spectra were curve fit according to the procedure described by Méthot et al.(45Méthot N. McCarthy M.P. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7709-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The resulting curve fit spectra are shown in Fig.5 and the numerical secondary structure estimates presented in Table III. The curve fit data suggest a predominance of α-helical secondary structure (65% and 75% for γ-M4 and β-M2-M3, respectively) in agreement with the qualitative analyses of the FTIR spectra. However, the curve fit may actually underestimate the percentage of α-helices for two reasons. 1) Residual intensity remains in the amide II band near 1547 cm−1 in both sets of spectra recorded in2H2O (data not shown), indicating that there are unexchanged peptide hydrogens. Although it is standard practice to fit the α-helical band as one peak, the broad absorbance centered near 1653 cm−1 may actually contain unresolved vibrations due to both protonated and deuterated α-helices. Curve fitting either spectra of γ-M4 or β-M2-M3 with two α-helical bands due protonated and deuterated α-helices would likely increase the estimated proportion of α-helices at the expense of random coil. 2) Deposition of the peptide-lipid bilayers on the planar surface of the ATR crystal should lead to planar orientation of the samples. The intrinsic dichroism of the ATR crystal will reduce slightly the intensity of vibrations oriented predominantly perpendicular to the ATR surface relative to those vibrations that are randomly oriented. This could lead to a slight reduction in the intensity of the α-helical vibrations, as is observed in spectra of intact nAChR recorded using the ATR versus the transmission techniques (45Méthot N. McCarthy M.P. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7709-7717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 46Méthot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15142-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Note we attributed the vibration near 1627 cm−1 to β-sheet. However, the α-helical protein myoglobin absorbs in this region of the spectrum, despite a complete absence of β-strands. In addition, bands near this region have also been attributed to denatured and"

Determining how p70 and p80 interact with each other and with DNA termini or with specific sequences is critical to understanding the functions of Ku in DNA repair, V(D)J recombination, and transcriptional activation. To better understand the role of p70/p80 dimerization in DNA binding, p70 deletion mutants expressed in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses were used to identify functional sites of the p70 subunit. K562 (human erythroleukemia, from the American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda ovary) cell line was obtained from the ATCC and maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect tissue culture medium supplemented with 3.3 g/liter TC yeastolate, 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolyzate (University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Culture Facility), 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin. The construction of transfer vectors and recombinant baculoviruses expressing full-length human Ku p70 and p80 has been described (11Wang J. Dong X. Stojanov L. Kimpel D. Satoh M. Reeves W.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, p70 and p80 Ku cDNAs were subcloned into a modified baculovirus transfer vector pVLB4-mp53 (11Wang J. Dong X. Stojanov L. Kimpel D. Satoh M. Reeves W.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) based on pVL1392 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and pBlueBacHisA (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). The recombinant vectors express Ku proteins fused to an N-terminal polyhistidine sequence and enterokinase cleavage site. Transfer vectors were co-transfected with linearized wild-type baculovirus (BaculoGoldTM, PharMingen), into Sf9 cells. Recombinant baculovirus clones were selected by end point dilution assay. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing the full-length p80 or p70 are designated p80-bv and p70-bv, respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing mutant p70 proteins were constructed in the same manner. A cDNA sequence encoding p70 amino acids 1–600 (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp.

For co-infection, Sf9 cells were infected with two recombinant baculoviruses each at m.o.i. of 10. 72 h after infection, recombinant p70 or p80 Ku proteins were identified in Sf9 cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using human autoimmune serum and specific monoclonal antibodies. Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the human Ku antigen were characterized previously (1Reeves W.H. Wang J. Ajmani A.K. Stojanov L. Satoh M. Zanetti M. Capra J.D. The Antibodies.

Murine mAbs specific for the polyhistidine tag HIS (IgG2a) and anti-Xpress (IgG1) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and Invitrogen Corp., respectively. Immunoblot analysis of the recombinant p70 and p80 proteins from Sf9 cells or Ku proteins from K562 cells was performed using human autoantibodies or murine mAbs as described (11Wang J. Dong X.

Cleared lysate was incubated for 2 h with mAb-coated protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1.5m NaCl NET-Nonidet P-40 buffer (1.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) and once with NET buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The p70/p80 Ku heterodimer from K562 cells was affinity purified onto mAb 162-coated protein A-Sepharose beads as described (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protease V8 (Boehringer Mannheim), trypsin-TPCK (Millipore Corporation, Freehold, NJ), or chymotrypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ) was then added to the beads at 2 to 200 μg/ml in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 22 °C. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with NET-Nonidet P-40 buffer and once with NET buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The nitrocellulose membrane was probed with N3H10 to detect the p70 remaining associated with p80 in the 162 immunoprecipitates. The sizes of p70 fragments were determined by comparing with molecular weight standards. Whole-cell extracts were prepared from Sf9 or K562 cells as described (12Danska J.S. Holland D.P. Mariathasan S. Williams K.M. Guidos C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5507-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 25 mmKCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA), and pellets were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/100 μl in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and then adjusted to 0.5m KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. After centrifuging (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was recovered, diluted to 0.1 m KCl by adding 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and stored at −80 °C. Preparation of the DNA probe used for the DNA immunoprecipitation assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was described previously (8Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 564-base pair linear double-stranded DNA fragment generated by HindIII digestion of bacteriophage λ DNA (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was end-labeled with [32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) using Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim). For gel shift assays, the radiolabeled probe was purified using a Geneclean III kit from Bio 101 (Vista, CA). The binding of radiolabeled DNA to affinity purified Ku antigen on protein A-Sepharose beads was measured as described (8Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell extract from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses was immunoprecipitated with 3 μl of mAbs 162, N3H10, 111, or anti-Xpress ascites. Approximately equal amounts of the different Ku proteins were bound to the beads, as determined by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining in preliminary experiments. Beads were washed with 1.5m NaCl NET-Nonidet P-40 buffer followed by the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl instead of 1.5 m NaCl. Radiolabeled DNA probe (25 ng) was added for 1 h, and the beads were washed again with NET-Nonidet P-40 buffer. DNA bound to the purified Ku antigen was recovered by digesting the beads with proteinase K, and an aliquot of the supernatant was used for scintillation counting. A gel mobility shift assay for determining Ku DNA end binding activity (13Han Z. Johnston C. Reeves W.H. Carter T. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14098-14104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. Radiolabeled DNA was incubated with whole-cell extracts in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 μg of closed circular plasmid φX174 Rf I DNA (New England Biolabs as a nonspecific inhibitor) at 22 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 22 °C for 4 h at 100 V. The gel was dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C. For supershift experiments, mAbs (1 μl of ammonium sulfate precipitated ascitic fluid at ∼1 mg/ml) were added to the binding mixture 5 min after adding probe and incubated for an additional 30 min at 22 °C before electrophoresis. The human p70 and p80 Ku proteins assemble into heterodimers in human cells as well as insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing the human Ku subunits (11Wang J. Dong X. Stojanov L. Kimpel D. Satoh M. Reeves W.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of p70 protein contains a leucine zipper-like sequence (15Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its role in interactions with p80 is not established. In the present study, dimerization of full-length p80 with p70 deletion mutants in extracts from co-infected Sf9 cells was investigated using the following criteria: 1) co-immunoprecipitation of p70 by anti-p80 mAbs and vice versa, and 2) immunoprecipitation of both p70 and p80 by mAb 162, which recognizes the p70/p80 heterodimer but not the individual subunits. To help define the role of the leucine zipper-like sequence of p70 identified previously (15Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in dimerization, deletion mutants were constructed (Fig.1 A) and co-expressed with full-length p80 in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system. Expression was verified by immunoprecipitation using a polyhistidine-specific mAb (Fig. 1 B). To detect heterodimer formation, the p70 mutants were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p80 mAb 111 (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with previous observations (11Wang J. Dong X. Stojanov L. Kimpel D. Satoh M. Reeves W.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), full-length p70 was co-immunoprecipitated by mAb 111. Mutant p70 proteins 330–609, 380–609, and 430–609 also were co-immunoprecipitated by mAb 111. In contrast, the mutant proteins 480–609 and 505–609 were not co-immunoprecipitated. These data suggest that a dimerization domain is located on the C-terminal portion of p70 (amino acids 430–609) and that the leucine zipper-like region (amino acids 483–504) is not sufficient for dimerization with p80. To further localize this domain, a second panel of deletion mutants (Fig. 2 A) was co-expressed with p80. As before, protein expression was verified by immunoprecipitating with anti-Xpress (Fig. 2 B,Xpress), and dimer formation was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitating with mAb 111 (Fig. 2 B,111). Although deletion of amino acids 601–609 abrogates the DNA binding activity of p70 in immunoprecipitation and Southwestern blot assays (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), deleting this sequence had no apparent effect on dimerization (Figs. 3, A andB, 1–600 and 430–600). The mutants 1–542 and 430–542 also dimerized efficiently with p80. Unexpectedly, so did the 430–482 fragment (Figs. 2, A and B). These data indicate that the leucine zipper-like sequence of p70 was not required for dimerization with p80 and that the minimal dimerization site is located on amino acids 430–482.Figure 3p70 contribution to mAb 162 recognition of Ku.

Location of the p70 leucine zipper-like sequence is indicated by cross-hatching. B, immunoprecipitation. Sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing full-length p80 plus p70 deletion mutants 1–433, 430–609, 430–542, and 461–542, respectively. The cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, and extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-polyhistidine mAb (HIS) that recognizes the N-terminal histidine tag of the recombinant p80 protein, as well as the p70 deletion mutants, or with mAb 162 (specific for the dimer of p70 with p80). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Position of full-length p80 is indicated by anarrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The p70/p80 heterodimer is recognized specifically by mAb 162 and protected from dissociation in the presence of 1.5 m NaCl and detergent (16Wang J. Satoh M. Pierani A. Schmitt J. Chou C.H. Stunnenberg H.G. Roeder R.G. Reeves W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3223-3233PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that mAb 162 may bind to an antigenic determinant near the p70/p80 dimerization site. The relationship of the epitope recognized by 162 to the dimerization site identified in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2 was investigated by immunoprecipitating p70 deletion mutants co-expressed with full-length p80 (Fig. 3 A). The level of recombinant protein expression was verified by anti-Xpress antibody (Fig.3 B). mAb 162 immunoprecipitated full-length p80 when it was co-expressed with p70 mutant 430–609, but not 1–433, localizing the mAb 162 epitope to the C-terminal portion of p70. Further deletions revealed that mAb 162 could immunoprecipitate p80 when it was co-expressed with 430–542 but not with 461–542. mAb 162 did not immunoprecipitate p80 or any of the p70 deletion mutants when expressed alone in Sf9 cells (Ref.16 and data not shown). These data indicate that mAb 162 recognizes an epitope formed by p80 plus amino acids 430–542 of p70. This region overlaps the C-terminal dimerization domain identified in Figs. 1 and 2 as well as a strongly basic sequence adjacent to a leucine zipper-like region. To further verify the results obtained using recombinant baculoviruses directing the synthesis of p70 and p80, dimerization was evaluated in human K562 cells. Ku heterodimer was affinity purified onto beads with mAb 162, followed by protease treatment of the beads. mAb 162 recognizes an epitope comprised of p70 plus p80 and stabilizes the dimer under dissociating conditions. Since the binding of antibodies frequently protects proteins from proteolytic cleavage (17Davidson H.W. Watts C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Schwyzer M. Weil R. Frank G. Zuber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5627-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we expected that the dimerization site-associated epitope recognized by 162 might be protected from degradation. The p70 fragments retained on mAb 162 beads after protease treatment were analyzed by Western blot using mAb N3H10 (Fig.4). The calculated sizes of the smallest p70 fragments recognized by N3H10 after trypsin or chymotrypsin digestion were 14 and 16 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4, lower arrow in each lane). Since the N3H10 epitope has been localized to amino acids 529–541 of p70, 2J. Wang, unpublished data. these studies lend further support to the idea that a dimerization site is located near the C terminus of p70. The identification of a p80 dimerization domain near the C terminus of p70 did not exclude the possibility that additional sequences also could mediate interactions between p70 and p80. To examine that possibility, p70 mutant 1–433 (Fig.5 A) was co-expressed with p80, followed by immunoprecipitation with mAb 111. This fragment dimerized with p80 (Fig. 5 B). Mutants 1–214 and 1–115 also were co-immunoprecipitated by mAb 111, but mutants 244–433 and 116–266 were not, suggesting that the second dimerization domain is located on the N-terminal portion of p70 (Fig. 5 A). Thus, two discrete domains mediate interactions of p70 with p80. Of note, mAb 162 did not recognize the dimer of p80 with p70 (1–433) (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that it is specific for the C-terminal dimerization site. Since it has been reported that p70/p80 dimerization is critical for the DNA binding activity of Ku in gel shift assays (9Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but not DNA immunoprecipitation or Southwestern blot assays (5Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Allaway G.P. Vivino A.A. Kohn L.D. Notkins A.L. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 168: 747-755Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we examined the role of each of the two dimerization sites in the interaction of Ku with DNA. The C-terminal portion of p70 binds readily to linear dsDNA fragments in a DNA immunoprecipitation assay (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In agreement with those previous observations, recombinant full-length p70 (1–609) bound linear dsDNA comparably with recombinant p70/p80 dimer (Fig.6 B). As shown previously (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), deleting the C-terminal 9 amino acids (mutant 1–600) reduced the DNA binding activity (Fig. 6 A). The importance of an intact C terminus was underscored by the fact that p70 mutants 380–609 and 430–609 had DNA binding activity similar to that of wild-type p70/p80 heterodimer (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with this observation, p70 mutants lacking larger portions of the C terminus had low DNA binding activity (Fig. 6 B, mutants 1–542, 1–115, and 430–600). Mutants 430–542 and 430–482 also had little binding activity (not shown). Unexpectedly, when p80 was co-expressed with mutant construct 1–542, DNA binding activity was restored to nearly normal, whereas partial restoration was seen with 1–600 and 1–115 (Figs. 6 A and B). However, dimerization with p80 had no effect on the DNA end binding activity of p70 mutant 430–600 (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with previous observations (5Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Allaway G.P. Vivino A.A. Kohn L.D. Notkins A.L. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 168: 747-755Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), p80 alone did not bind DNA (not shown), indicating that there was little or no dimerization of the recombinant human p80 with endogenous insect p70. Together, these results strongly suggest that, like dimerization, the binding of Ku to DNA in immunoprecipitation assays is mediated by two separate sites. One site, located at the C terminus of p70, does not depend on interactions with p80. The second, N-terminal, site requires dimerization of p80 with the N-terminal dimerization domain of p70. Different requirements for p80 have been found in gel mobility shift assays (dimerization-dependent) than in immunoprecipitation or Southwestern blot assays (dimerization-independent). To investigate the basis for this discrepancy, binding of recombinant human Ku to DNA was investigated in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 7) using the same probe as in the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6). Consistent with previous findings (9Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), recombinant Ku heterodimer expressed in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses bound DNA efficiently, whereas full-length free p70 and p80 both failed to bind DNA in the gel shift assay (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, p70 mutant 1–600 with an intact N-terminal and partially deleted C-terminal DNA binding domain did not bind DNA alone, whereas upon dimerization with p80, DNA binding activity was restored (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, the multi-band pattern visible on the gel (Fig. 7 A, 1–600/p80 lane) suggests that dimerization also restores the internal translocation property of Ku (19de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A similar, but possibly smaller, effect was seen in the DNA immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6 A). The p70 mutants 1–542 and 430–609, each carrying one of the two DNA binding domains, did not bind DNA in gel shift assays, even after dimerization with p80 (Fig.7 A). Binding of the recombinant mutant Ku antigens p70/p80 and 1–600/p80 to DNA was verified by supershift assays using anti-Ku mAb 162 and an antibody to the polyhistidine tag of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 7 B). Taken together, the data suggest that Ku DNA binding activity in the gel shift assay requires that both the N- and C-terminal DNA binding domains of p70 be intact. Since p80 is needed for activity of the N-terminal DNA binding site, it is required for binding in the gel shift assay. Finally, the data suggest that dimerization can compensate partially for deletion of a portion (amino acids 601–609) of the C-terminal DNA binding site, even though the intact site binds DNA independently of p80. Binding of Ku to DNA is a critical step in the targeting and activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (1Reeves W.H. Wang J. Ajmani A.K. Stojanov L. Satoh M. Zanetti M. Capra J.D. The Antibodies. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1997: 33-84Google Scholar, 2Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Weaver D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 29-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of DNA binding by Ku has not been defined completely. In this study, two regions of p70 mediating dimerization with p80 were defined, each of which is located in close proximity to one of the two DNA binding sites (Fig. 8). The existence of multiple dimerization and DNA binding sites may explain some of the previous discrepancies regarding the interaction of Ku with DNA. The C-terminal DNA binding domain of p70 corresponds to the minimal domain mapped previously (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal, p80-dependent domain may explain the p80 dependence of DNA binding in gel shift assays (9Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One of the main findings of the present study was that p70 has two dimerization sites. One site, localized to amino acids 430–482, is contained within the C-terminal 20-kDa portion of p70, a region implicated previously in subunit interaction using the yeast 2-hybrid system (10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This region does not contain the leucine zipper-like motif near the C-terminal end of p70 (amino acids 483–504), consistent with the previous observation that a leucine zipper-like motif of p80 is not required for interaction with p70 (10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The C-terminal interaction domain of p70 is related to the epitope recognized by mAb 162 (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4), which is specific for the p70/p80 dimer and stabilizes the dimer under dissociating conditions (16Wang J. Satoh M. Pierani A. Schmitt J. Chou C.H. Stunnenberg H.G. Roeder R.G. Reeves W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3223-3233PubMed Google Scholar). The p70 sequence recognized by mAb 162 (amino acids 430–542) and the dimerization domain mapped using recombinant baculovirus-expressed proteins (amino acids 430–482) correlate well. Limited protease digestion confirmed the importance of this region in dimerization in mammalian cells. More recently, autoantibodies were identified in autoimmune disease patients' sera that, like mAb 162, also recognize and stabilize the p70/p80 heterodimer (11Wang J. Dong X. Stojanov L. Kimpel D. Satoh M. Reeves W.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1344-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these sera appeared to recognize a different epitope than that bound by mAb 162 since they do not compete with mAb 162 for binding to Ku. This raises the possibility that additional subunit interaction domains may be present. The identification of a second dimerization site on amino acids 1–115 of p70 (Fig. 5) is consistent with that possibility. The corresponding dimerization sites of p80 have yet to be defined precisely although the C-terminal 32 kDa of p80 has been reported to exhibit p70 binding activity (10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). More precise localization of the p70 interaction sites on p80 is in progress. The role of the leucine zipper-like motif of p70, if any, remains to be determined. The present studies show conclusively that this region is not required for p70-p80 interactions. Other data suggest that it is not required for interactions of p70 with p90vav (20Romero F. Dargemont C. Pozo F. Reeves W.H. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase contains an extensive leucine zipper-like sequence (21Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) that possibly might interact with the leucine zipper-like motif of p70. Alternatively, this sequence might interact with other proteins or not be of functional significance. Controversy remains about the role of p80 in DNA binding. Gel shift assays suggest that dimerization of p70 with p80 is required for DNA binding (9Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, DNA immunoprecipitation and Southwestern blot assays suggest that p70 by itself interacts with DNA termini, whereas p80 does not (5Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Allaway G.P. Vivino A.A. Kohn L.D. Notkins A.L. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 168: 747-755Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present data may explain this discrepancy. DNA immunoprecipitation assays indicate that two different regions of p70 are involved in DNA binding. One is the previously identified C-terminal DNA binding site (7Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This site is carried by p70 mutant 430–609, and its DNA binding activity is unaffected by dimerization with p80 (Fig. 6). However, in agreement with previous gel mobility shift data (9Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), neither free p70 nor the 430–609 mutant bound DNA in the gel shift assay (Fig. 7). Moreover, dimerization of the 430–609 mutant with p80 did not restore DNA binding activity. DNA binding activity in the gel shift assay also depended on a second site localized to amino acids 1–542 of p70 (Fig. 6). Unlike the C-terminal DNA binding domain, activity of this N-terminal DNA binding domain required dimerization with p80 via the N-terminal subunit interaction domain (Fig. 6). A shorter fragment (p70 amino acids 1–115) also appeared to have weaker, p80-dependent binding activity. Interestingly, although similar in its requirement for p80 binding, the p70 (1–542)-p80 dimer failed to bind DNA in the gel shift assay (Fig. 7) despite significant binding in the DNA immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6). The present studies have not addressed the question of how DNA interacts with this domain. One possibility is that both p70 and p80 participate. Alternatively, the interaction with DNA could be mediated by a conformation of p70 that depends on the binding of p80 or vice versa. Further studies will be needed to address this issue. We conclude that Ku antigen has at least two domains involved in DNA binding. One of these, the C-terminal portion of p70, does not require interactions with p80. The other forms upon dimerization of p70 (amino acids 1–542) with p80. Neither domain by itself is sufficient for DNA binding activity in gel mobility shift assays, but together they confer activity. Interestingly, although deletion of p70 amino acids 601–609 abrogates p80-independent DNA binding activity of the C-terminal DNA binding site, this activity apparently can be restored by dimerization with full-length p80, since the p70 (1–600)-p80 complex was active in the gel shift assay (Fig. 7). The discrepancy between the gel mobility shift assay and DNA immunoprecipitation may reflect the ability of the latter assay to detect lower affinity interactions between Ku and DNA than detected by the gel shift technique. Alternatively, the conditions used for the gel shift assay may induce conformational changes that alter the binding of free p70 to DNA. The DNA binding of both full-length p70 and the C-terminal portion of p70 clearly is conformation-sensitive since a prolonged renaturation step is required after transfer of the denatured proteins to nitrocellulose membranes to demonstrate binding in Southwestern blot assays (6Allaway G.P.

Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that free p70 is masked by other proteins or nucleic acids in the crude extracts utilized for gel shift assays. In contrast, p70 is affinity purified onto beads in the DNA immunoprecipitation assay, and the high salt pre-washing of the beads prior to DNA binding could release these inhibitory factors. The complexity of the interaction between p70 and p80 and between Ku and DNA may be important for the various functions ascribed to Ku antigen. In addition to its role in end binding during DNA double strand break repair and V(D)J recombination (22Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), Ku antigen has sequence-specific DNA binding activity and may be involved in transcriptional activation (4Griffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or repression (24Kuhn A. Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Grummt I.

The N-terminal acidic domain of p70 identified by sequence analysis (15Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has strong transcriptional activation activity (10Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) although Ku also may repress transcription (24Kuhn A. Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Grummt I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Kuhn A. Stefanovsky V. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the portions of Ku mediating end binding activity are the same as those responsible for sequence-specific binding. Previous studies suggest that the C-terminal DNA binding domain of p70 binds preferentially to DNA ends (8Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, we have not yet examined whether the p80-dependent DNA binding site identified here displays a similar preference for ends, nor have we investigated the role of the two DNA binding sites in sequence specific DNA binding to the LTR sequence of mouse mammary tumor virus (4Griffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Pope L. Hache R.J.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The answer to these questions may help to further define the mechanisms by which Ku autoantigen functions in DNA repair and transcriptional activation/repression. Ku antigen may be one of a number of multifunctional DNA binding proteins involved in transcription as well as other aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, such as DNA synthesis or repair (26DePamphilis M.L. Cell. 1988; 52: 635-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These distinct functions potentially could be mediated by different DNA binding sites or interaction states of the p70 and p80 subunits. We thank Dr. Mark Knuth (Promega Inc.

https://openalex.org/W2076314091,"We have been interested in understanding how the estrogen receptor (ER) binds estrogens and discriminates between different classes of steroids with closely related structures. Using insights from our prior studies on ER and from sequence comparisons of steroid receptors, we identified three residues in the hormone-binding domain of the human ER, Leu345, Thr347, and Glu353, that we considered were likely to be involved in steroid A-ring recognition and therefore estrogen versusandrogen discrimination. We then tested the effect on ER activity of mutating these ER residues to the corresponding androgen receptor residues. Specifically, we examined the ability of the mutant receptors to bind and be activated by 17β-estradiol and three different androgens. No change in receptor activity was observed with the T347N mutation, while the L345S mutation greatly reduced ER activity in response to all ligands. Interestingly, the E353Q substitution behaved as expected, causing a 9-fold reduction in the transactivation potency of estradiol and a concomitant 10–140-fold increase in the transactivation potency of different androgens. These reciprocal changes in the transcriptional effectiveness of estrogens and androgens correlated with a decreased affinity of the E353Q ER for estradiol binding and an increased affinity for androgen binding. Therefore, amino acid Glu353 appears to be playing a significant role in binding the A-ring phenolic group of estradiol and in receptor discrimination between estrogens and the most closely structurally related steroids, androgens. Based on this data and our earlier observations, we propose a model for the orientation of ligand within the binding pocket of ER in which the A-ring 3-phenol of estradiol is hydrogen bonded to Glu353 in helix-3 and the 17β-hydroxyl of estradiol is hydrogen bonded to His524 in helix-11. Our findings with estrogen and androgen suggest that this orientation of the steroid in the ligand-binding pocket, with the steroid A-ring in contact with helix-3 and the D-ring in contact with helix-11 residues, is likely to be general for all the steroid hormone receptors.

Our findings with estrogen and androgen suggest that this orientation of the steroid in the ligand-binding pocket, with the steroid A-ring in contact with helix-3 and the D-ring in contact with helix-11 residues, is likely to be general for all the steroid hormone receptors. The distinctive biological effects of the different classes of steroid hormones were recognized early in this century, when the basic physiology of the endocrine system was being elucidated. Despite their overall structural similarity, each class of steroid hormones does have characteristic structural features. In this regard, the estrogens (C18 steroids) have a characteristic aromatic A-ring with a phenolic hydroxyl at C-3, which uniquely distinguish them from the other four steroid classes, androgens, progestins, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids, all of which are 3-keto steroids. Among the latter, the structural differences are principally in their C- and D-rings. The androgens (C19 steroids) are identical to the estrogens in this region, whereas the progestins and corticosteroids (C21 steroids) all have distinctive hydroxylation and/or oxidation patterns in their C- and D-rings. The steroid hormones are now known to act through specific receptors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, many of whose members have been cloned within the last decade (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar, 2Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These complex proteins have separate DNA-binding and hormone-binding domains and act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Despite their similar structures, each of the ligands acts specifically through its own receptor in vivo. The specificity of the estrogen receptors for estrogens is particularly strong. Nearly all good ligands are A-ring phenols, whereas those lacking this group, including androgens, corticosteroids, and progestins, are extremely poor ligands (6Anstead G.M. Carlson K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Steroids. 1997; 62: 268-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Conversely, among receptors for the 3-ketosteroids, less specificity in binding between the four classes of ketosteroids is observed (7Ojasoo T. Raynaud J.P. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4186-4198PubMed Google Scholar). Direct sequence comparison of the ligand-binding domains of the steroid receptors now reveals that the 3-ketosteroid receptors are more closely related to each other than they are to the estrogen receptor (8Laudet V. Hanni C. Coll J. Catzeflis F. Stehelin D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). We have been intrigued by the structural features of the estrogen receptor, as well as the other steroid receptors, that underlie their ability to discriminate among ligands from the different steroid hormone classes. To gain a better understanding of the interactions between receptor and hormone, we have taken a structure/sequence-guided mutagenesis approach to study how estrogen receptor-α (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; AR, androgen receptor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; E2, 17β-estradiol; ERE, estrogen response element; HBD, hormone-binding domain; norT, 19-nortestosterone; T, testosterone; THC, tetrahydrochrysene. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; AR, androgen receptor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; E2, 17β-estradiol; ERE, estrogen response element; HBD, hormone-binding domain; norT, 19-nortestosterone; T, testosterone; THC, tetrahydrochrysene. discriminates between estrogens and androgens. Because androgens differ from estrogens only in the A-ring region (Fig. 1), we felt a comparison between these classes of ligands would be most direct and informative. We focussed our attention to defining the regions of ER most likely to discriminate between estrogens and androgens, that is, A-ring binding. In this study, we selected three residues in ER that we considered likely to determine ligand A-ring specificity, Leu345, Thr347, and Glu353, and used site-specific mutagenesis to replace them with the corresponding residues in the androgen receptor (AR). We then investigated the ability of the mutant receptors to bind and be activated by estradiol and a set of three androgens. The greatest shift in specificity occurred with the E353Q substitution, which caused an 9-fold reduction in interaction with estradiol and a 10–140-fold increase in interaction with different androgens. Mutations at the other positions, as well as combinations of these mutations, had less pronounced effects on ligand discrimination. We conclude that the interaction of the C-3 phenolic hydroxyl group of estradiol directly with Glu353 in ER is a major determinant of ER's specific recognition of estrogens. By analogy, we would expect that the interaction of the 3-keto group in the other steroid hormones with the corresponding glutamine residue is a major determinant of the recognition of the 3-ketosteroids by their corresponding receptors.

Plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified either by CsCl gradient centrifugation (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N Y1989Google Scholar) or by Qiagen plasmid preparation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA.) Ligands, 17β-estradiol, testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and 19-nortestosterone were obtained from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and VENT DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Cell culture media, calf serum, and other reagents for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Sigma. For Western blot analysis, nitrocellulose membrane was obtained from Millipore (Marlborough, MA), anti-ER H226 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Geoffrey Greene (University of Chicago), and rabbit anti–rat IgG was purchased from Zymed (San Francisco, CA). Radioisotopes for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays, sequencing, hormone binding assays, and Western blotting were purchased from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA) and Amersham. Plasmids pCMV5-E353Q, pCMV5-L345S, pCMV5-T347N, pCMV5-T347N,E353Q, and pCMV5-L345S, pCMV5-L3455,T347N,E353Q were constructed using oligonucleotide-directed single-stranded DNA mutagenesis as described (13Kunkel T.A.

The oligonucleotides used were as follows: E353Q, 5′-GCAGACAGGCAGCTGGTTCAC-3′; L345S, 5′-CGATGATGGGATCTCTGACCAACCTG-3′; T347N, 5′-CGATGATGGGCCTTTTAAACAACCTGGCAGACAG-3′; T347N, E353Q, 5′-CGATGATGGGCCTTTTAAACAACCTGGCAGACAGGCAGCTGGTTCACATG-3′; L345S,T347N,E353Q, 5′-CGATGATGGGATCTTTAAACAACCTGGCAGACAGGCAGCTGGTTCACATG-3′. All constructs were sequenced (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham) to confirm the presence of the mutation. Plasmids pET15b-ER and pET15b-E353Q were generated by polymerase chain reaction cloning of the wild type and E353Q hormone-binding domain sequences into the vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI). Polymerase chain reaction primers were NdeF, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGAAAACAGCCTGGCCTTGTCCCTG-3′, and S554R, 5′-GAATGGATCCTCAGCTAGTGGGCGCATGTAGGCG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed with VENT DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, with 300 μm dNTPs, 0.5 μm primers, 100 ng of template, 2 mm MgSO4, and 1 unit of polymerase in 100 μl total volume. Reactions were heated to 95 °C for 5 min followed by three rounds of 95 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4.5 min, and 10 rounds of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4.5 min with a final extension time of 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting fragment was then digested with BamHI and NdeI and cloned into theBamHI and NdeI sites of pET15b. COS and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (14Ekena K. Weis K.A. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol.

All transfections were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Chen C. Okoyama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). For transactivation studies, cells (in 10-cm plates) were transfected with 100 ng of ER expression plasmid, 0.8 μg of pCMVβ, 2.0 μg of (ERE)2-pS2-CAT reporter plasmid, and pTZ19R carrier plasmid to 15 μg of total DNA. ER activity was determined by CAT activity of whole cell extracts normalized to β-galactosidase activity from the co-transfected pCMVβ plasmid (18Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10880-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts for Western blots and hormone binding studies were prepared from COS cells or from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with 10 μg of ER expression plasmid, 0.6 μg of pCH110, and 4.4 μg of pTZ19R/10-cm plate (14Ekena K. Weis K.A. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20053-20059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested in TNE (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA), centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then subjected to three rounds of freezing on dry ice/ethanol and thawing on ice followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Western blot analyses were performed as described (19Wrenn C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

Nitrocellulose blots were probed with anti-hER antibody H226 at 2.0 μg/ml. This antibody detects an epitope in the N-terminal A/B domain of the ER. Blots were then incubated with rabbit anti-rat IgG (1 μg/ml) followed by 125I-conjugated protein A. The amount of extract loaded onto the gel for each receptor was normalized for transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase activity. Estradiol hormone binding assays and Scatchard analyses were performed as described previously (14Ekena K. Weis K.A. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20053-20059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol.

Relative binding affinity measurements were determined, with slight modifications, as previously reported (22Katzenellenbogen J.A. Johnson Jr., H.J. Myers H.N. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The tritiated tracer, [3H]estradiol (51 Ci/mmol), was used at 2 nm to give the assay greater sensitivity to measure the low affinity of the androgens to wild type ER. COS cell extracts containing full-length wild type or mutant ER were diluted with TG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) to ∼1 nm receptor concentration. The protein solution was incubated with buffer alone or with several concentrations of unlabeled competitor, together with 2 nm[3H]E2 at 0 °C for 18–21 h. The protein was stable under these conditions. Free ligand was removed using the hydroxylapatite assay (23Williams D. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The unlabeled competitors were diluted into 1:1 dimethylformamide:TG buffer to ensure solubility; the final concentration of dimethylformamide in the assay was 7%. All data are reported relative to E2 which is set at 100%. Fluorescence spectra were acquired on a Spex Fluorolog 2 (model IIIC) instrument using Spec DM3000 software. The data was collected at 4 °C, in a ratio mode, using photomultiplier correction and 2.5-mm slits. Excitation was 379 nm. Unliganded ER fluorescence was subtracted as background. The ER hormone-binding domains were expressed in Escherichia coliin a pET15b vector, using standard methods (Novagen) (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N Y1989Google Scholar) and purified by batchwise adsorption onto a nickel resin, according to the manufacturers suggestions (Qiagen). HBDs were diluted to 6 nm in TG buffer and incubated for 60 min at 0 °C with 2 nm tetrahydrochrysene (THC)-nitrile (24Hwang K.-J. O'Neil J.P. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 1262-1271Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Hwang K.-J. Carlson K.E. Anstead G.N. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11536-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or no ligand for background. The free THC-nitrile was not removed since under these conditions nearly all of the ligand is bound. Spectra were measured at several ratios of ER to THC-nitrile to establish that free ligand was not affecting the position of the bound fluorescence peak. In our recent studies of ligand-receptor contact sites (14Ekena K. Weis K.A. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20053-20059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Ekena K. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5069-5075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we used alanine scanning mutagenesis over a 21-residue region of ER to identify likely ER-ligand contact points. This region of the ER hormone-binding domain (HBD) is now thought, based on comparisons with the retinoic acid receptor-retinoic acid (27Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) and the thyroid hormone receptor-triiodothyronine (28Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) HBD crystal structures, to form a portion of helix-11 and the loop between helix-11 and -12. When we investigated the footprint of ligand contacts for four ER ligands that had very similar A-ring structures but differed substantially in their D-ring regions, we found that each ligand had a unique, characteristic footprint (26Ekena K. Weis K.E. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5069-5075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that helix-11 in ER formed a portion of the ligand-binding pocket that accommodated the D-ring region of estradiol and related estrogens. Interestingly, sequence similarity in the helix-11 region of different steroid receptors is low, consistent with a requirement to accommodate hormones that have different and distinctive patterns of D-ring polar functions, suggesting that all the steroids may bind to their receptors in this orientation. If the steroids bind with their D-rings near helix-11 and then orient the rest of their structure along the same axis as does the ligand in the retinoic acid receptor-retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor-triiodothyronine crystal structures (27Renaud J.-P.

Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), then the A-rings would extend toward and contact portions of helix-3 and -5. We searched the sequences of the steroid receptors over these regions for potential A-ring C-3 recognition/discrimination sites, amino acid differences likely to reflect the characteristic functional difference between binding a 3-phenolic versus a 3-keto steroid (Fig.1). Because the steroid hormone receptor sequences in helix-5 are highly conserved, we did not select any sites in that helix. We chose to investigate three sites in helix-3 which are highlighted in the sequence alignments shown in Fig. 2. These sites appear to represent positions where the ER residue is of a different character (presumably selected to favor interaction with a 3-phenol) from that at the corresponding position in the sequence the other four steroid receptors (presumably selected to favor interaction with a 3-keto group). Leucine 345 in ER is replaced by a smaller, more polar residue (serine or threonine) in the other receptors. Similarly, threonine 347 in ER is replaced by an asparagine, and glutamate 353 in ER is replaced by a glutamine. At the other positions shown in Fig. 2, the residues in ER versus the other four receptors are either identical or highly homologous, or they show no systematic change between the receptor classes. The glutamate versus glutamine substitution at position 353, in particular, represents the type of change expected for recognizing the functional group difference between estrogens and 3-ketosteroids at the ligand C-3 position. The glutamate of ER, a strong hydrogen bond acceptor, would pair well with the strong hydrogen bond donor phenol of estrogens. Conversely, the good hydrogen bond donor glutamine is matched with the good hydrogen bond acceptor 3-keto function in the ligands for androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors (AR, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, Fig.3). Using site-directed mutagenesis of the ER cDNA, we mutated Leu345, Thr347, and Glu353 of the HBD to match the AR amino acid sequence; serine, asparagine, and glutamine, respectively. We generated three single amino acid substitutions, as well as a double and a triple mutation. We then tested the ability of the mutant ERs to activate transcription in response to E2, as well as three androgens, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone (T), and 19-nortestosterone (norT) (Fig. 1). These results are shown in Figs.4 and 5, and in Table I. Transcriptional activity was measured in ER-negative human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with an ER expression vector and an estrogen response element (ERE)-containing reporter gene construct, (ERE)2-pS2-CAT. Activity was measured over a range of ligand concentrations (1 × 10−12-1 × 10−5m) to assess the potency and efficacy of these different ligands to induce transcriptional activity of the wild type and mutant ERs.Figure 5Response to 17β-estradiol (panel A), testosterone (panel B), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (panel C), and 19-nortestosterone (panel D) of wild type ER and ER mutants.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows the ability of the wild type ER and the different ER mutants to be activated by estradiol (E2). For wild type ER, E2 was a 50,000-fold more potent ligand than the androgens (Fig. 4, panel A). However, all the ligands, at high concentrations, activated wild type receptor to the same maximal level. The T347N mutation had no effect on ER's ability to be activated either by estrogens or androgens, and the transactivation curves closely paralleled those seen with wild type ER (Fig. 4 A). As our model predicted, the E353Q mutation proved most interesting (Fig. 4 B). E353Q was 9-fold less sensitive to E2than was the wild type ER. More striking, this mutant was 13-, 25-, and 143-fold more sensitive than wild type ER to the androgens (see TableI), and maximal transcriptional activity was again elicited by these ligands. Conversely, the L345S mutation greatly diminished the effectiveness of all the ligands (Fig. 4 C). For E2, the dose-response curve was shifted markedly to the right, and the maximal transcriptional ability of the ER in response to E2 was also diminished. Likewise, no activation by androgens was obtained. Despite the fact that the E353Q ER responded better to androgens than did wild type ER and that T347N ER showed ligand response identical to that of wild type ER, the combination of these two mutational changes in the ER (Fig. 4 D, denoted TE-NQ ER) resulted in a receptor that was only activated by very high concentrations of E2. This double mutant exhibited little to no change in androgen responsiveness compared with wild type. The triple mutant, with changes at amino acids 345, 347, and 353 (Fig. 4 D, denoted LTE-SNQ), also showed poor response to E2 and the same response as wild type ER to androgens. In Fig. 5, the data are arranged to show how the receptors respond to each of the ligands tested. Response to estradiol was best with the wild type and T347N ERs, followed by E353Q ER, and then L345S, with the double and triple mutants showing a 105-fold reduced transactivation effectiveness of estradiol (Fig. 5 A). Response to the three androgens (Fig. 5,panels B-D) was best with the E353Q ER. The androgens were approximately 20-fold less effective with the two other single or the double mutant ERs. Of note, the L345S receptor showed no stimulation by any of the androgens, yet was moderately responsive to estradiol (Fig.4 C). To determine whether protein stability and/or expression levels contributed to any of the differences in observed transactivation, we performed Western blot analyses. The ERs were expressed in COS cells, and extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibody specific for the ER. Each of the mutant receptors was expressed at levels very similar to that of wild type ER (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when the ERs were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells or in the presence of 10−6m E2 or 10−5m DHT. Transactivation data showed that the E353Q mutation caused a 9-fold decrease in potency of the natural ligand 17β-estradiol, while the potencies of the androgens were increased 10–140-fold. To establish whether these shifts were the result of corresponding changes in ligand binding affinities, we examined the effect of the E353Q mutation on ligand binding by both direct and competitive hormone binding studies. In the direct binding studies, extracts from cells transfected with wild type or E353Q ER expression vector were incubated with varying concentrations of [3H]E2 or [3H]E2 plus a 100-fold excess of unlabeled E2. The level of ER-bound E2 was determined, and Scatchard analyses were performed. The K d determined for wild type receptor was 0.055 ± 0.027 nm (n = 4); E353Q ER had aK d of 0.16 ± 0.08 nm(n = 4) (data not shown). In the four experiments, E353Q ER had a 3.1 ± 1.5-fold lower affinity"

We have employed an interaction cloning strategy to identify xSmad2-binding proteins and found that calmodulin directly associated with Smads. xSmad2, generated either byin vitro translation or by overexpression in COS cells, specifically bound to calmodulin-agarose; the association was calcium-dependent and required xSmad2 N-terminal residues. In the same assay, xSmad1 and hSmads 2, 3, and 4 also bound to calmodulin-agarose. Furthermore, a calmodulin antagonist, W13, increased expression of the activin-inducible transcriptional reporter, 3TP-Lux, whereas overexpression of calmodulin suppressed this reporter. These observations demonstrate that Smad proteins interact with calmodulin in a calcium-dependent way through conserved N-terminal amino acids and suggest a role for calmodulin in regulating Smad function.

Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Extensive searches to identify receptor substrates by two-hybrid analysis have provided little insight into the mechanism of signal transmission. However, genetic analysis of bothDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans has led to the identification of a family of intracellular molecules that are required for signal propagation by TGFβ family members. Smad (a combination of the gene names from C. elegans, Sma, and Drosophila, Mad) homologs have now been identified in vertebrates including frogs, mice, and humans (1Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,2Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Functional analysis in Xenopus laevis indicates that overexpression of Smad2 mimics the effects of activin, whereas overexpression of Smad1 recapitulates bone morphogenetic protein effects (3Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar); this result suggests that different ligands selectively employ specific Smads. The primary structure of the Smads, which contain highly conserved N-terminal and C-terminal domains separated by a divergent linker region, does not provide any clue as to the biochemical function of this family of molecules (1Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 2Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of Smad2 indicates that this molecule is rapidly phosphorylated in response to both activin and TGFβ on extreme C-terminal serine residues (6Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed affinity-purified GST-Smad2 fusion protein can be phosphorylated by TGFβ receptor complexes immunoprecipitated from cultured cells, suggesting that Smad2 may be a direct receptor target (6Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad2 in vivo correlates with its nuclear accumulation (6Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar); the C-terminal domain of Smad2 expressed alone is constitutively localized in the nucleus (7Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of both Smad1 and Smad4 has shown that the conserved C-terminal domain is capable of inducing transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (8Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Cárcamo J. Harland R.M. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar); based on the sequence conservation of this domain, it is expected that the other Smads may also demonstrate this function. Activin and TGFβ also lead to the specific association of Smad2 and Smad4 as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured cells following ligand binding (9Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Smad2 has been identified as a component of an activin-specific transcriptional complex (4Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 10Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), and there is now evidence that Mad directly binds DNA via its conserved N-terminal domain (11Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the proposal that activin stimulates Smad2 phosphorylation via ActR complexes, which leads to nuclear accumulation and complex formation with Smad4 and participation in transcriptional activation of activin-responsive genes. To identify proteins that physically and functionally interact with Smad2, we screened a bacteriophage expression library using radiolabeled Smad2 as probe. We have identified calmodulin as a Smad2-interacting protein; we demonstrate that the association is calcium-dependent and requires amino acids between Ile77 and Ala208 in the N-terminal half of Smad2. We also provide evidence that calmodulin can influence gene expression from an activin and TGFβ-responsive promoter. Purified activin A was generously provided by Dr. Yuzuru Eto and by the National Institutes of Health Hormone Distribution Program, NIDDK, NHPP, NICHHD, and the USDA (lot 15365-36(1)). 4,5-Dihydro-2-[6-hydroxy-2-benzothiazolyl]-4-thiazolecarboxylic acid (d-Luciferin),N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W13),N-(4-aminobutyl)-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W12), thrombin, and calmodulin-agarose were obtained from Sigma. For expression in E. coli, xSmad2 cDNAs were subcloned into the vector pGEX-2T, which was modified to include a consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation site. For expression in mammalian cells, xSmad cDNAs provided by Jon Graff were subcloned into the vector pcDNA1 (InVitrogen) or into pcDNA1 modified to contain three iterations of the HA epitope tag at the C terminus of the protein (12Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); CaM cDNA (CaM A, locus MUSCAM, accession number M27844) was also subcloned into pcDNA1; a genomic CaM clone was provided by Tony Means. ActR DNAs and p3TP-Lux were as described (12Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). xSmad2 mutants and truncations were generated by polymerase chain reaction; all subclones were fully sequenced. Expression vectors for hSmads 2, 3, and 4 tagged with the FLAG epitope at the C terminus were generously provided by Dr. Rik Derynk. A λ EXlox cDNA library from a 16-day mouse embryo was screened essentially as described (13Margolis B. Young R.A. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1-14Google Scholar). Phage were plated to yield 40,000 plaques/150-mm plate and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h before being overlaid with nitrocellulose circles impregnated with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Following an additional 12 h at 37 °C, filters were washed and probed as described (13Margolis B. Young R.A. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1-14Google Scholar). The xSmad2 probe was expressed in and purified fromEscherichia coli as a GST fusion protein by standard methods (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) and cleaved from GST by incubation with thrombin before labeling as described (13Margolis B. Young R.A. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 1-14Google Scholar). The labeled probe was then separated from unincorporated 32P on Sephadex G-50 Fine, Quick Spin Columns (Boehringer Mannheim) before incubation with the filters. Positive clones were plaque purified, and phage were converted to plasmids prior to double-stranded sequencing by standard methods (Sequenase version 2, U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham Corp.). Smads, generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), were mixed with 50 μl of either calcium or EGTA buffer-washed calmodulin-agarose in 500 μl of either calcium or EGTA buffer. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking before being washed five times in the corresponding buffer. Bound protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and visualized by fluorography. Buffer consisted of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and either 0.2 mm CaCl2 or 100 mm EGTA, with a mixture of protease inhibitors. The L17 cell line was cultured and transfected as described (12Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of the p3TP-Lux reporter plasmid and combinations of 0.5 μg of calmodulin and 0.5 μg of ALK DNAs as indicated. Cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase. Following transfection, cells recovered for 30 h and were then stimulated with 2 nm activin A, or 100 pm TGFβ in 0.25 ml of minimum essential medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum (v/v) with or without increasing amounts of W12 or W13 as indicated to induce transcription of 3TP-Lux. Luciferase activity was measured in 40 μl of a 200-μl lysate and normalized to β-galactosidase activity measured in 20 μl of lysate as described (12Willis S.A. Zimmerman C.M. Li L. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that functionally interact with xSmad2, we screened a bacteriophage expression library of 16-day mouse embryo cDNA using radiolabeled xSmad2 as probe. Screening of 1.5 × 106 total plaques resulted in the isolation of seven cDNAs encoding xSmad2-binding proteins. Partial cDNA sequencing indicated that all seven were CaM; five different cDNAs representing three CaM genes were recovered (Fig. 1). The longest cDNAs included the entire CaM coding region plus 57 5′ nucleotides that encode 19 additional amino acids. Two cDNAs encoded CaM lacking only the initial methionine, whereas one cDNA encoded only the 122 C-terminal amino acids of CaM (of 148 total), indicating that this region is sufficient for interaction with xSmad2. The longest CaM cDNAs were also tested for interaction with two additional probes in this assay. One probe was a xSmad2 point mutant, G421D, which has been observed to result in a null phenotype in bothC. elegans and D. melanogaster. The second probe consisted of only the C-terminal domain of xSmad2 between amino acids 261 and 467. Although xSmad2 (G421D) associated with phage-encoded immobilized CaM just as full-length wild-type xSmad2, the C-terminal domain of xSmad2 never associated with CaM in this assay. To determine whether xSmad2 associates with CaM in vitro, we tested xSmad2 for binding to CaM-agarose affinity resin. xSmad2, tagged with three iterations of the HA epitope at its C terminus, was transcribed and translated in vitro with [35S]methionine and then mixed with CaM-agarose in the presence of calcium or EGTA. xSmad2 was retained on CaM-agarose in the presence of calcium but not in its absence. xSmad2 was also retained on CaM-agarose in the presence of calcium when a peptide corresponding to the HA epitope was included in the binding reaction but not when a known CaM-binding peptide was present (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained using xSmad2 generated by overexpression in COS cells (data not shown). The slight difference in mobility of in vitro transcribed/translated Smads following incubation in the binding mixture compared with input (Figs. 2 and3) was not apparent when Smads were generated by overexpression in COS cells; furthermore, this difference was not dependent on Ca2+ or CaM, nor was it the result of phosphorylation.Figure 3Localization of CaM-binding region of xSmad2. A, deletion mutants of xSmad2 were tested for binding to CaM-agarose as described in the legend for Fig. 2.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used the same assay to determine whether other members of the Smad family of proteins associate with CaM. xSmads 1 (Fig.2), 8, and 9 tagged with the triple-HA epitope at the C termini and hSmads 2, 3, and 4 C-terminally tagged with the FLAG epitope all behaved similarly to xSmad2 with respect to calcium-dependent binding to CaM-agarose. These observations indicate that Smads can physically associate with CaM in a calcium-dependent manner. To determine which region of xSmad2 is responsible for binding to CaM, we generated deletion mutants encoding either the conserved N-terminal domain with the linker region (amino acids 1–263) or the conserved C-terminal domain (amino acids 261–467) of the molecule and tested these proteins for association with CaM as described above. In the presence of calcium, both wild-type xSmad2 and xSmad2-N were retained on CaM-agarose, whereas xSmad2-C was not (Fig. 3). This observation is consistent with the earlier observation that the purified radiolabeled C-terminal domain of xSmad2 did not bind phage-encoded CaM on nitrocellulose filters. To further localize the CaM-binding domain of xSmad2, we used additional deletion mutants that lack increasing amounts of the N terminus; xSmad2 mutants lacking the initial 26 (xSmad2 ΔN25), 76 (xSmad2 ΔN75), or 208 amino acids (xSmad2 ΔN208) were tested for binding to CaM (Fig. 3). Wild-type xSmad2, xSmad2 ΔN25, and xSmad2 ΔN75 all were retained on CaM-agarose, whereas xSmad2 ΔN208 was not. Therefore, xSmad2 interacts with CaM through amino acids between Ile77 and Ala208 in the N-terminal half of xSmad2. Because CaM physically associates with Smads and may therefore regulate Smad function, we tested whether CaM could modulate expression of an activin-responsive reporter gene. L17 mink lung epithelial cells stably transfected with the type I activin receptor, ALK4, were treated with a calmodulin antagonist,N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W13) or its 10-fold less active chemical analog,N-(4-aminobutyl)-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W12) as a negative control. Activin responsiveness was evaluated by measuring expression of an activin-inducible reporter gene, 3TP-Lux. In the absence of calmodulin inhibitor, a 4-fold activin-dependent increase in luciferase expression from 3TP-Lux was observed. Similarly, at all doses of W12, activin treatment resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in luciferase expression with no changes in overall levels of luciferase expression relative to cells not treated with inhibitor. In contrast, treatment with W13 resulted in a dose-dependent proportional increase in overall luciferase expression both in the presence and the absence of activin (Fig.4 A). Because inhibition of CaM function led to increased luciferase expression from 3TP-Lux, we tested the effect of overexpression of CaM in the same assay. L17 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the indicated type I receptor serine kinases and CaM. Following treatment with either activin or TGFβ, luciferase expression was measured as described. Activin treatment of cells expressing only ALK4 resulted in a 10-fold induction of luciferase; although cells expressing both ALK4 and CaM responded to activin in a similar manner, overall expression of luciferase was reduced 2-fold (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of cells expressing ALK5 with TGFβ yielded similar results; with no exogenous CaM, luciferase expression was induced 10-fold, whereas CaM overexpression reduced overall luciferase expression 2-fold (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrate that CaM can negatively regulate gene expression from an activin- and TGFβ-responsive promoter. Smad proteins are responsible for mediating signals initiated by specific receptor serine kinases (RSKs) in response to activin and other TGFβ-related ligands. The central role of this family of molecules in RSK signaling is highlighted by the observation that cells compromised for either Smad2 or Smad4 activity are resistant to RSK activation. Because 1) Smads accumulate in the nucleus following ligand treatment, 2) Smad2 has been identified as a component of activin-dependent DNA-binding complexes, 3) Mad binds DNA directly, and 4) Smads1 and 4 can support transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, Smads are thought to act as transcriptional regulators. We have shown that Smads are capable of interacting with CaM; the interaction is dependent on calcium and requires at least residues between Ile77 and Ala208 in the N-terminal portion of Smad2. This region contains a putative (residues Leu123 to Trp132) 1-5-10 basic amphiphilic α-helix, which is a known CaM target motif (15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and may be responsible for mediating this interaction. We have also shown that CaM can modulate gene expression from an activin- and TGFβ-responsive promoter. These results demonstrate that CaM can function as a negative regulator of activin signaling, possibly through physical association with Smad proteins. CaM is the primary intracellular receptor for calcium ions and mediates the effects of signals that cause intracellular calcium flux (16James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Calcium-saturated CaM binds to and regulates a wide variety of well characterized enzymes, in addition to structural proteins of the cytoskeleton and transcription factors (16James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM can stimulate transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, cAMP response element-binding protein, and serum response factor indirectly via activation of CaM-dependent kinases (17Bachs O. Agell N. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and can inhibit specific members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors by direct protein-protein interaction (18Corneliussen B.

The mechanism of transcriptional inhibition of the CaM-sensitive class of bHLH proteins involves direct binding to the bHLH domains, which interferes with dimerization and prevents DNA binding (20–22). A recent report demonstrates that Mad is capable of direct sequence-specific DNA binding via an N-terminal domain requiring residues between 120 and 159 (11Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This region corresponds to that of Smad2 which is required for CaM binding, and suggests that CaM may also inhibit Smad2 by interfering with DNA binding. Alternatively, CaM may interfere with assembly of the transcriptional complex formed in response to activin, which includes Smad2 and a winged helix DNA-binding protein, FAST-1 (4Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 10Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although CaM is found throughout the cell, it is also possible that CaM regulates the subcellular distribution of Smads. The potential role of calcium as a mediator of activin signaling has been investigated, but no consensus has been reached (5Mathews L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 310-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We measured intracellular calcium in L17 cells stably transfected with ALK4 and did not observe any change when they were assayed under conditions identical to those that yielded induction of luciferase expression from 3TP-Lux (data not shown). The precise mechanism by which CaM negatively regulates gene expression from activin-responsive promoters remains to be elucidated; however, the identification of a calcium-dependent physical association between Smads and CaM suggests complex regulation of Smad function. Biochemical analysis of the role of CaM in regulating Smad2 activity will provide additional insight into the process of activin signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W1998819113,"ATP hydrolyzing activity of a mutant α3β3γ subcomplex of F0F1-ATP synthase (ΔNC) from the thermophilicBacillus PS3, which lacked noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites, was inactivated completely soon after starting the reaction (Matsui, T., Muneyuki, E., Honda, M., Allison, W. S., Dou, C., and Yoshida, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8215–8221). This inactivation is caused by rapid accumulation of the “MgADP inhibited form” which, in the case of wild-type enzyme, would be relieved by ATP binding to noncatalytic sites. We reconstituted F0F1-ATP synthase into liposomes together with bacteriorhodopsin and measured illumination-driven ATP synthesis. Remarkably, ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase catalyzed continuous turnover of ATP synthesis while it could not promote ATP-driven proton translocation. ATP synthesis by ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase, as well as wild-type enzyme, proceeded even in the presence of azide, an inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis that stabilizes the MgADP inhibited form. The time course of ATP synthesis by ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase was linear, and gradual acceleration to the maximal rate, which was observed for the wild-type enzyme, was not seen. Thus, ATP synthesis can proceed without nucleotide binding to noncatalytic sites even though the rate is sub-maximal. These results indicate that the MgADP inhibited form is not produced in ATP synthesis reaction, and in this regard, ATP synthesis may not be a simple reversal of ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolyzing activity of a mutant α3β3γ subcomplex of F0F1-ATP synthase (ΔNC) from the thermophilicBacillus PS3, which lacked noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites, was inactivated completely soon after starting the reaction (Matsui, T., Muneyuki, E., Honda, M., Allison, W.

The F0F1-ATP synthase is a ubiquitous enzyme in plasma membranes of bacteria, inner membranes of mitochondria, and thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts which utilizes a transmembrane electrochemical potential difference of protons (ΔμH+) 1The abbreviations used are: ΔμH+, transmembrane electrochemical potential of protons; bR-F0F1 liposomes, proteoliposomes reconstituted from bacteriorhodopsin and F0F1-ATP synthase; FCCP, carbonylcyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; ΔNC, F0F1-ATP synthase or its subcomplex containing the mutant α subunits with the four point mutations αK175A/αT176A/αD261A/αD262A; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. for ATP synthesis (1Boyer P.D.

It can be reversibly separated into a hydrophilic, water-soluble F1 part and a hydrophobic, membrane-embedded F0 part. F0 conducts protons across the membrane. F1, also called F1-ATPase, has a subunit composition of α3β3γδε and shows strong activity of ATP hydrolysis. According to the crystal structure of the major part of beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), α and β subunits are alternatively arranged to form a hexagonal cylinder with a central cavity through which coiled-coil α helices of the γ subunit penetrate. F1-ATPase was recently proven to be a “rotary motor enzyme”, the first ever found in the biological world; the γ subunit rotates within an α3β3 hexagon during ATP hydrolysis (4Duncan T.M.

The F1-ATPase has six nucleotide binding sites. Three of them are catalytic and located mainly on the β subunits. The other three, called noncatalytic sites, are mainly located on the α subunits. The function of the noncatalytic site had been obscure but recent studies indicated its regulatory role as follows. During multiple turnover of ATP hydrolysis, MgADP is prone to be entrapped in a catalytic site producing the MgADP inhibited form of the enzyme, which is inactive in ATP hydrolysis. ATP binding to the noncatalytic sites causes release of this inhibitory MgADP from the affected catalytic site and relieves the enzyme from the MgADP inhibited form (7Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B.

In steady-state catalysis of ATP hydrolysis, the relative population of the MgADP inhibited form of F1-ATPase is in an equilibrium determined between entrapping inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site and releasing inhibitory MgADP by ATP binding to noncatalytic sites. Azide inhibits ATPase activity of F1-ATPase by stabilizing the MgADP inhibited form (7Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Fitin A.F. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,15Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Results obtained for a mutant (ΔNC) α3β3γ subcomplex from the thermophilicBacillus PS3 provided strong evidence for the proposed role of noncatalytic sites (16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ΔNC enzyme is a quadruple mutant (αK175A/αT176A/αD261A/αD262A) and completely lacks the ability to bind ATP (and ADP) to the noncatalytic sites. One may predict that, with the noncatalytic sites being empty, this mutant cannot release entrapped inhibitory MgADP from a catalytic site, and all enzyme molecules fall into the MgADP inhibited form rapidly during catalytic turnover. Indeed, the ΔNC enzyme hydrolyzed ATP at an initial rate similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, but it decayed rapidly to an inactivated form. In the presence of ATP, the ΔNC enzyme did not release preloaded inhibitory [3H]ADP, whereas the wild-type enzyme did (16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of nucleotide to noncatalytic sites seems to be essential for continuous catalytic turnover of ATP hydrolysis by F1-ATPase. The occurrence of the MgADP inhibited form during ATP hydrolysis reaction has been taken as established but the occurrence of it during ATP synthesis reaction has been questioned by Syroeshkin et al. (17Syroeshkin A.V. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using beef heart submitochondrial particles in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of oligomycin, they tested the effect of azide on ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, ATP synthesis was not inhibited by azide, whereas ATP hydrolysis was strongly inhibited. Different azide sensitivity of ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis was also reported for chloroplast thylakoid membranes (18Wei J. Howlett B. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 72-79Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This indicates that generation of the MgADP inhibited form is avoided in ATP synthesis reaction, and Syroeshkin et al.(17Syroeshkin A.V. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have suggested a possibility that ATP synthesis catalyzed by submitochondrial particles is not a simple reversal of ATP hydrolysis. Since they have used submitochondrial particles and monitored ATP hydrolysis and synthesis indirectly by pH change, questions have remained, such as is the reaction kinetics of azide-insensitive ATP synthesis the same as that in the absence of azide, are there special protein components that are responsible for the azide-insensitive ATP synthesis, and is this a phenomenon universal in any F0F1-ATP synthases? A direct measurement with purified enzyme is expected to lead to a more definite conclusion. Continuous turnover of ATP synthesis by the purified F0F1-ATP synthase was measured with reconstituted proteoliposomes (19Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 67: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In that experiment, thermophilic F0F1-ATP synthase was incorporated into membranes of liposomes together with bacteriorhodopsin. Under illumination, bacteriorhodopsin pumped protons into proteoliposomes and established a stable ΔμH+, and the F0F1-ATP synthase catalyzed continuous synthesis of ATP for several hours. Considerable improvement of this assay system was made recently (20Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and a biphasic time course of ATP synthesis by thermophilic F0F1-ATP synthase under constant ΔμH+ was found; a first phase with a basic reaction rate accelerated to a second phase with a maximum rate (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Labeling experiments with 2-N 3-[α-32P]ATP revealed that ATP binding to a noncatalytic site was responsible for the shift from the first phase to the second phase during catalysis (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we have further extended the versatility of the assay system to be applicable for the F0F1-ATP synthase assembled from subcomplexes and subunits. We assembled the ΔNC α3β3γ subcomplex into F0F1-ATP synthase and used it for the preparation of bacteriorhodopsin-F0F1-ATP synthase proteoliposomes (bR-F0F1 liposomes). If the ATP synthesis reaction by F0F1-ATP synthase is just the reverse reaction of ATP hydrolysis, the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase cannot catalyze continuous ATP synthesis because of rapid accumulation of the MgADP inhibited form due to defective noncatalytic sites. However, the result showed that the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase was capable of ATP synthesis, whereas it could not mediate ATP-driven proton translocation. ATP synthesis, either by the wild-type or the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthases, proceeded in the presence of azide. These results indicate that the MgADP inhibited form is not generated during multiple turnover of ATP synthesis, and in this sense, the reaction pathway of ATP synthesis is not just the reversal of that of ATP hydrolysis. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, β-octylglucopyranoside was from Nacalai, Bio-Beads SM-2 were from Bio-Rad, and luciferin/luciferase kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Authentic F0F1-ATP synthase was purified from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 as described previously (23Sone N. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7917-7923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F0 was obtained from urea-treated F0F1-ATP synthase by centrifugation (24Okamoto H. Sone N. Hirata H. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6125-6131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type (specific activity, about 1.8 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min at 40 °C at pH 7.3) and the ΔNC α3β3γ complexes were purified from overexpressed Escherichia coli cells strain JM103 (uncB-uncD) (25Monticello R.A. Angov E. Brusilov W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3370-3376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the plasmids pKABG1 (16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and pKABG1αk175A/αT176A/αD261A/αD262A, respectively (16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Over-expressed δ and ε subunits of Bacillus PS3 F1-ATPase were isolated from E. coli strain JM109 carrying the pKD2 plasmid and strain BL23 carrying the pTE2 plasmid, respectively (26Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored as ammonium sulfate precipitates at 4 °C. F1-ATPase was assembled from the wild-type or ΔNC α3β3γ complex and the isolated δ and ε subunits, and excess free subunits were removed by centrifugal filtration (26Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To assemble F0F1-ATP synthase further, 85 μg of F1-ATPase (a 2.5-fold molar excess to F0assuming molecular mass ratio of F1 and F0, 2.7:1) was mixed with 12.5 μg of F0 suspended in 10 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0) and incubated on ice for 1 h. This mixture was used directly for reconstitution into liposomes. In the case of authentic F0F1-ATP synthase, 45 μg of F0F1-ATP synthase, an amount equivalent to 12.5 μg of F0, was used for proteoliposome reconstitution. Protein concentration was determined by the bischinchonic acid (BCA) method (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). F0F1-ATP synthase and bacteriorhodopsin were incorporated into membranes of liposomes according to the method described previously (20Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, liposomes consisting of 90% phosphatidylcholine and 10% phosphatidic acid were formed by reversed phase evaporation. Purple membranes from Halobacterium halobium were solubilized by overnight incubation with 2% Triton X-100. For reconstitution of proteoliposomes, 4 mg of liposomes (250 μl) were mixed with 600 μl of the reaction buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 50 mmNa2SO4, 50 mmK2SO4), 40 μl of 20% (w/v) Triton X-100, 50 μl of bacteriorhodopsin solution (4 mg/ml), and 15 μl of the authentic F0F1-ATP synthase (3 mg/ml) in 20 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, 1.5% (w/v) β-octylglucopyranoside or an equivalent amount of assembled F0F1-ATP synthase. The resultant clear solution was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then 40 μl of 14.8% (w/v) β-octylglucopyranoside was added. After a 2-min incubation, 10 μl of 20 mm pyranine solution in ethanol and wet Bio-Beads (80 mg) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature while stirring. Addition of Bio-Beads and the 1-h incubation with Bio-Beads was repeated three times. The proteoliposomes were washed twice with the reaction buffer by centrifugation (30 min, 150,000 × g), and the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of the reaction buffer. A 200-μl aliquot of the prepared proteoliposomes (bR-F0F1 liposomes) was mixed with 600 μl of the reaction buffer, and 2 mm (final concentration) ADP was added. The reaction mixture was preilluminated by three 300 W slide projectors for 15 min on a magnetic stirrer at 40 °C. When indicated, different concentrations of ADP and potassium phosphate buffer were used. The reaction was started by addition of 2 mm (final concentration) MgSO4. At 15-min intervals, 50 μl-aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped by addition of the same volume of 4% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of ATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay method using a luminescence reader BLR201 (Aloka). When the effect of azide was tested, bR-F0F1 liposomes were incubated with 5 mm (final concentration) sodium azide for 20 min at 40 °C prior to initiation of pre-illumination. When indicated, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (final concentration, 5 μm) was added directly before initiation of the ATP synthesis assay. Activity of ATP synthesis was expressed as amounts of synthesized ATP per mg of F0F1-ATP synthase per min. When the dependence of ATP synthesis activity on Pi and ADP concentrations was analyzed, K m and V max values were calculated from a Hanes-type plot. ATP-driven proton translocation into bR-F0F1 liposomes was detected by decrease of pyranine fluorescence (20Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with an FP 777 fluorometer (Jasco) equipped with a stirring facility. An aliquot of 150 μl of bR-F0F1 liposomes (about 5 μg of F0F1-ATP synthase) was preincubated at 40 °C in 2 ml of the reaction buffer supplemented with 7 mmMgCl2, and a base line was monitored for 2–3 min. The reaction was started by adding 5 mm ATP. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 460 and 510 nm, respectively. Excess fluorescence from pyranine molecules not entrapped into bR-F0F1 liposomes was quenched by addition of 20 mm p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide. When the effect of azide was tested, bR-F0F1 liposomes were preincubated at 40 °C for 20 min with 5 mm sodium azide. Since an assay for ATP synthesis by F0F1-ATP synthase assembled from F0- and F1-ATPase has not been reported previously, we have optimized the assay procedures. An attempt to reconstitute bR-F0F1 liposomes by adding F1-ATPase to bacteriorhodopsin-F0proteoliposomes did not give optimal results probably because of incomplete binding of F1-ATPase to membrane-embedded F0. We mixed F0 and F1-ATPase and then reconstituted proteoliposomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1, the assembled wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase catalyzed ATP synthesis efficiently, a rate of ∼90% of the authentic enzyme. ATP synthesis by the authentic F0F1-ATP synthase proceeded in two phases (Fig. 1, closed circles) (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the assembled wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase also showed a biphasic kinetic (Fig. 1, open circles). A first phase with a basic rate in the initial 20 min was accelerated 1.7–1.8-fold to a second phase with a maximum rate, and it continued for 60 min without deceleration. In agreement with the reported values (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the activities of ATP synthesis of the authentic F0F1-ATP synthase were 130 nmol of ATP/mg/min (first phase, 0–5 min) and 230 nmol of ATP/mg/min (second phase, 40–60 min). The activity of the assembled F0F1-ATP synthase was 110 nmol of ATP/mg/min (first phase) and 190 nmol of ATP/mg/min (second phase). These values (turnover rate, 1 to ∼2 ATP/sec/enzyme) were about 10–20% of the ATP hydrolysis activity by the same F0F1-ATP synthase in bR-F0F1-liposomes (1.5–2.5 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg/min). This relatively low activity of ATP synthesis is attributable to the limited ΔμH+attainable with bacteriorhodopsin as analyzed in a previous paper (20Pitard B. Richard P. Dunach M. Girault G. Rigaud J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis by the assembled ΔNC (Fig. 1) and the assembled wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase (Fig.2 B) was completely suppressed by addition of the uncoupler FCCP. Hereafter, we describe only the properties of the assembled enzyme.Figure 2Effect of azide on ATP synthesis. A, ATP synthesis by ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase in the presence or absence of 5 mm sodium azide.B, ATP synthesis by wild-type (WT) F0F1-ATP synthase in the presence and absence of 5 mm sodium azide. bR-F0F1liposomes were preincubated at 40 °C for 20 min in the presence or absence of 5 mm sodium azide before preillumination. When indicated, 5 μm FCCP was added. Other experimental details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To our surprise, the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase could catalyze ATP synthesis at a rate (90 nmol of ATP/mg/min) only slightly slower than the rate of the first phase of the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase (Fig. 1, open squares). Therefore, occupation of a noncatalytic site by ATP (or ADP) is not a prerequisite for catalytic turnover of ATP synthesis. Interestingly, the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase showed a monophasic, linear time course. Richard et al. (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that, when ATP synthesis by the authentic F0F1-ATP synthase was initiated by addition of 2 mm ADP together with 10 μm ATP, it started at a maximum velocity from the beginning without the first phase, and kinetics apparently turned to be monophasic. The monophasic kinetic of ATP synthesis by the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase did not change when 10 μm ATP (and 2 mm ADP) was added to the reaction mixture before the ATP synthesis reaction was started (data not shown). The ΔNC α3β3γ subcomplex is unable to catalyze steady-state ATP hydrolysis due to rapid accumulation of the MgADP inhibited form during catalytic turnover (16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase can catalyze continuous ATP synthesis as described above, indicating that the MgADP inhibited form may not be generated during ATP synthesis. Then, it is interesting to test the effect of azide on ATP synthesis. As shown in Fig.2 A (closed squares), ATP synthesis by the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase was hardly inhibited by 5 mm sodium azide (85–90 nmol of ATP/mg/min). The wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase also synthesized ATP in the presence of 5 mm azide (Fig. 2 B, open triangles). The initial rate of ATP synthesis is nearly the same as the value obtained for the enzyme in the absence of azide (100 nmol of ATP/mg/min). However, ATP synthesis in the presence of 5 mm azide did not show the typical second phase, and the acceleration was only 1.2-fold. Higher concentrations of azide up to 10 mm did not change the kinetics and rate of ATP synthesis (data not shown). The dependence of rates of ATP synthesis on the concentration of ADP and Piby the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase was almost the same as that of the first phase of the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase. They show a Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with apparentK m (Pi), 8.9 mm(ΔNC) and 6.3 mm (wild-type) (Fig.3 A), and apparentK m (ADP), 0.30 mm (ΔNC) and 0.41 mm (wild-type) (Fig. 3 B). Similar dependence of the ATP synthesis rates on the concentrations of ADP and Pi was observed for the catalysis of the second maximum phase by the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase except that the apparent V max value was 1.7-fold of that of the first phase. Furthermore, the first phase of ATP synthesis in the presence of 5 mm azide by the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase was characterized by similar kinetic parameters, apparentK m (Pi), 7.5 mmand apparent K m (ADP), 0.31 mm (Fig. 3, A and B). The same preparation of bR-F0F1 liposomes used for ATP synthesis assay of the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase could not promote ATP-driven proton translocation (Fig.4), as expected from the fact that the ΔNC α3β3γ subcomplex could not catalyze steady-state ATP hydrolysis (16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The bR-F0F1liposomes prepared with the same procedures using the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase could translocate protons driven by ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of 5 mm azide, proton translocation by the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase started at a slow initial rate, and it was stopped completely in a couple of min. Since it has been known that ATP hydrolyzing activity of the wild-type F1-ATPase in the presence of azide is also subjected to turnover-dependent inactivation (8Fitin A.F. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), this observation is reasonably interpreted as the result of azide-facilitated accumulation of the MgADP inhibited form during turnover of ATP hydrolysis. The mutant ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase, which lacks the ability to bind adenine nucleotide to noncatalytic nucleotide binding sites, can still synthesize ATP at a rate comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1). Thus, nucleotide binding to noncatalytic sites is not a prerequisite for ATP synthesis. Related to this conclusion, Weber et al. (29Weber J. Bowman C. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21045-21049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) observed that E. coli cells carrying mutant F0F1-ATP synthase (αD261N/αR365W) with impaired noncatalytic sites grew well on succinate plates. Although their mutant showed normal ATP hydrolyzing activity and hence the growth on succinate was not surprising, their observation is consistent with our conclusion. An optional role of noncatalytic sites in ATP synthesis could be related to the rigid structure of the α subunit. In the crystal structure of mitochondrial F1-ATPase (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), noncatalytic sites on the three α subunits are all occupied by AMP-PNP while they are all empty in the crystal structure of the α3β3subcomplex of thermophilic F1-ATPase (30Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika M. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure. 1997; 6: 825-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the structure of the α subunit of the former is very similar to that of the α3β3 subcomplex, indicating that the structure of the α subunit is not changed significantly by the binding of adenine nucleotide, which is always in the “closed” structure (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). This is in sharp contrast to the structure of β subunits which changes from “open” to “closed” form by nucleotide binding. One may raise questions from observations reported here. Why can ATPase-inactive ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase be active in ATP synthesis, and why can F0F1-ATP synthase synthesize ATP in the presence of azide, an inhibitor of ATPase activity? In both instances, rapid accumulation of the MgADP inhibited form during turnover of ATP hydrolysis is responsible for the absence of steady-state ATPase activities (8Fitin A.F. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). But, in the ATP synthesis reaction, generation of the MgADP inhibited form is apparently avoided, and therefore, the reaction kinetics are obviously different from those in ATP hydrolysis. Continuous ATP synthesis is measurable only in the presence of ΔμH+, whereas ATP hydrolysis is usually assayed in the absence of ΔμH+. The straightforward explanation of our observation is that ΔμH+ somehow directly blocks the generation of the MgADP inhibited form. Another possibility is that ΔμH+increases binding affinity of Pi to F0F1-ATP synthase. This assumption has some experimental support (31Rosing J. Kayalar C. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2478-2485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Choate G.L. Hutton R.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Feldman R. Sigman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12178-12183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and constitutes a part of the binding change mechanism (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Because the binding order of ADP and Pi to F0F1-ATP synthase is random (34Perez J.A. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10503-10518Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), there are two pathways between F0F1(MgADP·Pi) and F0F1. In the absence of ΔμH+(Fig. 5 A), a significant fraction of the ATP hydrolysis reaction proceeds through the pathway F0F1(MgADP·Pi) → F0F1(MgADP) → F0F1, and the MgADP inhibited form (F0F1*(MgADP)) is produced from F0F1(MgADP). With increased affinity of Pi to F0F1 in the presence of ΔμH+ (Fig. 5 B), the reaction pathway F0F1 → F0F1(Pi) → F0F1(MgADP·Pi) becomes dominant, and the relative population of F0F1(MgADP) decreases. In addition, binding affinity of Pi to F0F1(MgADP) to form F0F1(MgADP·Pi) may also be increased, and the population of F0F1(MgADP) further decreases. As a consequence, generation of F0F1*(MgADP) is suppressed. The azide-insensitive ATP synthesis by submitochondrial particles has been analyzed by Syroeshkin et al. (17Syroeshkin A.V. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They proposed that ΔμH+-driven ATP synthesis is not a simple reversal of ATP hydrolysis and assumed the existence of “synthase” and “hydrolase” states of F0F1-ATP synthase. Our results provide strong evidence for their proposal. In addition, it is now clear that endogenously bound nucleotide at the noncatalytic site is not directly related to the difference between synthase and hydrolase, that purified F0F1-ATP synthase made up from eight kinds of subunits is by itself responsible for the azide-insensitive ATP synthesis, and that this phenomenon is probably universal in any F0F1-ATP synthases. According to our explanation as described above, the synthase state may be the state of F0F1-ATP synthase in which the generation of the MgADP inhibited form is blocked or the affinity of Pi binding to the enzyme is greatly enhanced by the imposed ΔμH+. The ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase synthesized ATP with a linear time course at a rate corresponding to the first phase of ATP synthesis by the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase (Fig. 1). This observation means that nucleotide binding to noncatalytic sites is necessary for the shift from the first phase to the second maximum phase of ATP synthesis and provides other evidence for the previous conclusion made by Richard et al. (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that the shift from the first to the second maximum phase is triggered by the ATP binding to noncatalytic sites. ATP synthesis by wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase in the presence of azide obeyed a nearly monophasic time course similar to that by the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase (Fig. 2 B). Addition of azide to the ΔNC F0F1-ATP synthase did not change the kinetics, that is the effect of azide and that of deficient noncatalytic sites are not additive. This implies that azide blocks a step in sequential events from ATP binding to the noncatalytic site to propagation of rate acceleration. Based on a labeling experiment during preincubation with 2-azido-[α-32P]ADP, Richard et al. (22Richard P. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21571-21578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggested that the rate acceleration of ATP synthesis by ATP binding to noncatalytic site is not related to the release of inhibitory MgADP. Therefore, azide possibly inhibits the shift from the first phase to the second maximum phase in a manner that is probably different from its previously known mechanism, stabilization of the MgADP inhibited form. Actually, because K m values of the catalysis of the second maximum phase of the wild-type F0F1-ATP synthase are almost identical to that of the first phase and only V max was increased (Fig. 3), rate acceleration may occur at the step F0F1(MgADP·Pi) → F0F1(MgATP). We are indebted to H. Noji and Y. Kato for productive discussion."

We have mutagenized residues 122–133 of human PCNA. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near-homogeneity. The interactions of the mutants with antibody 74B1 were examined; mutation of Gly-127 abolished the recognition by antibody 74B1 in a Western blot analysis, confirming the epitope assignment of 74B1. Mutations of Val-123, Leu-126, Gly-127, and Ile-128 affected the ability of PCNA to stimulate DNA synthesis by pol δ in several different assays. These mutations affected the interactions between PCNA and pol δ as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These mutants were also affected in their abilities to form a ternary complex with a DNA template-primer, as determined by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays.

Studies of in vitro SV40 replication has established the role of pol δ, as well as an understanding of the complex number of proteins that are involved in eukaryotic DNA replication (2Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is now considered that pol α is involved in the lagging-strand synthesis, while pol δ is involved in leading-strand synthesis and also for completion of lagging strand synthesis (2Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A key element of the function of a replicative DNA polymerase is the ability for extended processive synthesis of DNA. This ability is conferred on replicative polymerases by accessory proteins, which function as molecular sliding clamps. These clamps form toroidal rings that encircle the DNA strand and also interact with the polymerase. This function in Escherichia coli is fulfilled by the β subunit (3McHenry C.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 5119-5550Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and in mammalian cells by PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), which is an essential factor for the eukaryotic DNA replication and functions as a processivity factor for pol δ (4Tan C.K.

The basis for the functions of the sliding clamps of both E. coli and PCNA has been elucidated by the determination of their crystal structures, which reveals them to be toroidal proteins that encircle the DNA strand (6Kong X.P.

Each subunit consists of two structurally equivalent domains giving the trimer a six-fold symmetry. PCNA is loaded onto double-stranded DNA by the action of RF-C (8Lee S.H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by the loading of pol δ through an interaction between PCNA and pol δ to form a ternary pol δ-PCNA-template-primer complex. However, little is known about the structural elements involved in the interaction of PCNA with pol δ.PCNA is also implicated in DNA repair (9Nichols A.F. Sancor A.

A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The latter is a cell cycle checkpoint protein, which inhibits cyclin-dependent protein kinases, and has also been shown to inhibit DNA synthesis in vitro (12Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 13Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.Q Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the latter effects has been shown to be due to the ability of p21 to bind directly to human PCNA (hPCNA); p21, however, does not inhibit the repair functions of pol δ (14Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 15Shivji M.K.K. Grey S.J. Strausfeld U.P. Wood R.D. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1062-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A more recent study showed that a peptide derived from the C terminus of p21 when added at higher levels inhibited both DNA replication and nuclear excision repair (16Pan Z.Q Reardon J.T. Li L. Flores-Rozas H. Legerski R. Sancer A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22008-22016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The nature of the interaction of p21 with PCNA has been determined at the atomic level by solution of the three-dimensional structure of a complex of hPCNA with a 22-residue peptide derived from the C terminus of p21 (17Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar).Recently, we reported that an inhibitory monoclonal hPCNA antibody (74B1), inhibits the ability of hPCNA to stimulate DNA synthesis catalyzed by pol δ in vitro using poly(dA)·oligo(dT) as a template. The epitope of this antibody has been mapped to residues 121–135 of human PCNA (18Roos G. Jiang Y. Landberg G. Nielsen N.H. Zhang P. Lee M.Y.W.T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 226: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows that this region is located in the loop that connects the two conformationally conserved domains in the PCNA monomer (17Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a mutational study of this loop region to investigate the structural basis for the interactions of hPCNA with pol δ by the use of site-directed mutagenesis in combination with electrophoretic mobility shift, processivity gel, and ELISA assays.DISCUSSIONWe have systematically mutated each of the residues between 122 and 133 to further define the structural elements in PCNA that are involved in its interaction with pol δ. The choice of this region was based on our previous assignment of the epitope of the inhibitory monoclonal antibody 74B1 to amino acid residues 121–135 of hPCNA by the use of peptides (18Roos G. Jiang Y. Landberg G. Nielsen N.H. Zhang P. Lee M.Y.W.T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 226: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm that this was a rational basis for the functional evaluation of the mutants, we first characterized their immunochemical properties. Our results confirm the assignment of the epitope of antibody 74B1. One of the 12 PCNA mutants, G127A, could not be Western blotted with the 74B1 antibody (Fig. 2). This lack of interaction of the mutant G127A with the monoclonal antibody 74B1 provides solid evidence that the region between residues 122–133 of hPCNA indeed harbors the epitope for 74B1. The ELISA assays showed that within this connector loop region, residues Asp-122, Glu-124, and Gly-127 to Glu-130 are also involved in the interaction between antibody 74B1 and hPCNA. It is surprising that mutation of the Gly-127 exhibited such a pronounced effect on the interaction between hPCNA and pol δ. However, any mutation of glycine, because of the insertion of a large R group, may be sufficient to disrupt the local structure of the epitope that is required for interaction with the monoclonal antibody. Thus, our findings confirm the epitope assignment of monoclonal antibody 74B1 and extend our previous work, in terms of the interpretation of the inhibitory effects of this antibody as being due to its binding to a region involved in protein-protein interaction with pol δ. These findings are significant because the inhibition of PCNA stimulation of pol δ by this antibody can now be confirmed to be due to its direct interference with the binding of PCNA to pol δ.The analysis of the effects of mutations on residues 122–133 in the interdomain connector of PCNA on the interaction with pol δ was examined in this study at several levels. These studies provide further evidence that this region of hPCNA is directly involved in binding to pol δ. Mutation of Gly-127 and Ile-128 resulted in severe defects in the stimulation of pol δ. Two other mutants, V123A and L126S, exhibited less severe defects in the stimulation of pol δ activity. This loss of activity was established to be due to a weakened interaction between pol δ and PCNA by an ELISA assay in the case of Gly-127 and Ile-128. EMSAs that measured the ability of the PCNA and pol δ to form a ternary complex with a model substrate template proved to be a much more sensitive index of the effects of mutant on PCNA-pol δ interactions, as complex formation was lost with the same four mutants but also with P129A, L126S, and V123A. Our findings are summarized in Table I. This shows quite clearly that mutations of Gly-127 and Ile-128 had a pronounced impact on the ability of human PCNA to stimulate the human pol δ activity. A possible explanation for the pronounced impact of mutation of Gly-127 is that it causes a change in the local structure of the interdomain connector loop of hPCNA, which makes this region of hPCNA less accessible to pol δ. The interaction profile of the PCNA mutants with monoclonal antibody 74B1 is consistent with this explanation.Table ISummary of mutations in the interdomain connector loop that affect PCNA functionMutantImmunoreactivityDNA synthesisPCNA-pol δ interactionsp21 bindingWestern blotELISAPolyd(A)/oligo(dT)M13PAGEELISAEMSAD122A−+−−−−−ApbsV123A−−+++++++−+++SHPE124Q−+−−−−−ApbsQ125E−−−−−−−ApbsL126S−−++++++−+++LHPG127A++++++++++++++++++++ApbsI128A−+++++++++++++++LHPP129A−+−−−−+++LHPE130Q−+−−−−−−Q131E−−−−−+++++YesE132Q−−−−−+++++−Y133F−−−−−+−LHP Open table in a new tab The loss of the ability of the PCNA mutants to stimulate in vitro DNA synthesis catalyzed by pol δ could be due to (i) the disruption of the trimer formation of hPCNA, (ii) inhibition of the RF-C-catalyzed loading of PCNA onto DNA, (iii) prevention of the binding of pol δ to the hPCNA, or (iv) interference in the translocation of the PCNA-pol δ complex along the DNA template. Chemical cross-linking assays showed that the first possibility is unlikely, and in addition, the CD spectrum of the hPCNA mutants essentially showed no secondary structural changes due to mutations. The PCNA mutants showed similar functional behavior with respect to the RF-C-catalyzed loading of PCNA onto DNA, with either the poly(dA)·oligo(dT) assays or the M13 template-primers, indicating that the inability of the four PCNA mutants to stimulate pol δ was not due to a loss in the interaction between RF-C and PCNA, because RF-C is not required in the poly(dA)·oligo(dT) assays. It is also unlikely that the loss in the ability to stimulate DNA synthesis is the result of interference in the translocation of PCNA clamp or pol δ along the DNA template because EMSA and ELISA assays showed unequivocally that the defect of these four PCNA mutants were a consequence of the loss of the binding of pol δ to PCNA.The formation of ternary pol δ-PCNA-template-primer complexes was not detected using the hPCNA mutants, V123A, L126S, G127A, I128A, P129A, Q131E, and E132Q (Fig. 7). The stability of the pol δ-PCNA-template-primer complex is determined by two factors: the interaction between pol δ and PCNA, and the interaction between the pol δ-PCNA complex and the DNA template-primer. Disruption of either interaction could lead to the dissociation of the pol δ-PCNA-template-primer complex. As expected, the four PCNA mutants (V123A, L126S, G127A, and I128A) that displayed a severe loss in their ability to stimulate pol δ activity fell within this group, indicating that the loss of these four PCNA mutants in the stimulation of pol δ activity was the result of an altered interaction with pol δ. However, mutants P129A, Q131E, and E132Q, which are still functional in the stimulation of pol δ activity, showed loss of function in this assay. It is possible that even if the interactions between the pol δ-PCNA complex and the DNA template-primer were weakened such that they were not detected by EMSA, they might still be sufficient to stimulate DNA synthesis effectively.The crystal structure of hPCNA complexed with a 22-residue peptide derived from the C terminus of cell-cycle checkpoint protein p21 (residues 139–160) has been solved recently (17Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). This reveals that the p21 peptide forms an extended contact with the interdomain connecting loop (17Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

First, the formation of an anti-parallel β sheet structure between residues 152–160 of p21 and residues 119–127 of PCNA. Following this region of interaction, there is a second major interaction involving residues Leu-126, Ile-128, and Tyr-133 of the PCNA loop. These three residues, together with Met-40, Val-45, Leu-47, Pro-234, Tyr-250, Ala-252, and Pro-253, form a large hydrophobic pocket that interacts with residues 147–151 (MTDFY) of p21. Gly-127, Ile-128, and Pro-129 form one edge of a binding cleft in the large hydrophobic pocket into which the side chains of Met-147, Phe-150, and Tyr-151 of p21 are inserted. There is a small hydrophobic pocket, formed by residues Leu-121 and Val-123 of the PCNA loop, which interacts with Ile-158 of the p21 peptide (17Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). When the interaction sites of p21 are listed against the mutants of PCNA that affect its interaction with pol δ (Table I), it is seen that there is a very close correlation between the residues whose mutation are strongly affected and those involved in the PCNA/p21 peptide interaction. There is strong evidence that the effects of p21 on the inhibition of DNA pol δ activity is mediated by a competition with PCNA (12Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 13Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.Q Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The current information of the p21-PCNA structure is thus highly relevant, as it leads to a reasonable proposition that the binding of pol δ to PCNA may involve similar interactions as with p21 to PCNA, namely interaction of an extended region of peptide sequence with the interdomain loop via formation of an anti-parallel β sheet structure and possibly interaction with the two hydrophobic pockets. The proposal that a short peptide sequence of pol δ is involved in the interaction with PCNA is supported by experiments showing that a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 129–149 of pol δ is able to inhibit PCNA activation of pol δ (32Zhang S.J. Zeng X.R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This sequence is part of a conserved region in the N terminus between yeast, mammalian, Epstein-Barr, and herpes viral DNA polymerases (33Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Toomey N.L. Zhu L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).There have been several other mutational studies of PCNA, which, however, have not provided information on the role of the interdomain connector loop in the interaction with pol δ. A systematic analysis based on the mutation of 29 charged residues of hPCNA to alanine on the basis that alteration of charged residues might have the least effect on the structure of PCNA has been reported (28Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Eight of the mutants (Lys-13, Lys-14, Lys-20, Lys-77, Lys-110, Arg-146, Arg-149, and Lys-217) showed defects in the stimulation of pol δ; these residues are located in the helices on the inner surface of the PCNA toroid. Of the residues mutated that lie on the outer surface of PCNA, effects on pol δ activity were observed with Asp-41, Arg-64, and Asp-122. The activities reported for the stimulation of pol δ were <50% for the Asp-41 and between 50 and 80% for the Arg-64 and Asp-122 mutants. The latter is one of the residues we mutated; however, we did not observe significant effects in any of the functional assays. A mutational analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA in which 21 pairs of proximal charged residues were mutated has also been reported (34Ayyagar R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this study, the D41A/D42A mutation exhibited a reduced activity with pol δ. Two double mutants in the loop region, K127A/E129A and E129A/E130A, displayed no phenotypic defects. Arroyo et al.(35Arroyo M.P. Downey K.M. So A.G. Wang T.S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15971-15980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have mutated Schizosaccharomyces pombe PCNA, choosing 7 residues in the loop regions of PCNA that are conserved in S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, rice, and human PCNA. Their results showed that mutation of S. pombe Leu-2 and Arg-64 resulted in reduced abilities to stimulate pol δ, and they concluded that these residues may play a role in interaction with pol δ. The agreement between the fission yeast and the study of hPCNA that Arg-64 is involved is of interest, as mutation of Asp-63 of hPCNA had no effect (28Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These studies show some agreement regarding the effects of Asp-41 and Arg-64 on PCNA stimulation of pol δ. Asp-41 is located in the loop between β sheets βC1 and βD1 of hPCNA, which forms one edge of the large hydrophobic pocket of hPCNA. Arg-64 is located in the loop between β sheets βE1 and βF1 of hPCNA, which provides residues that form one edge of the small hydrophobic pocket of hPCNA. Mutation of D41A could cause local structure perturbations of the large hydrophobic pocket, whereas mutation of R64A could affect the local structure of the small hydrophobic pocket, which includes Ala-67 and Gly-69. While a direct interaction between residues Asp-41 and Arg-64 with pol δ is not excluded, these findings provide provocative evidence that the hydrophobic pockets that are involved in p21 binding may also be important in the binding of pol δ. Leu-2 in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae PCNA is not conserved in hPCNA where it is a phenylalanine residue. In both S. cerevisiae and human PCNA, this residue is buried but is adjacent to residues that form the small hydrophobic pocket (7Krishna T.S.R. King X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), Fen1 homologues in yeast (RTH1, RAD2, rad2, and rad13), and human XP-G. 2L. S. Cox, personal communication. All these proteins bind to the same site in PCNA and have the consensus sequence QGRLDXFF (37Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cdc27, a putative third subunit of DNA polymerase δ in the fission yeast (38Hughes D.A. MacNeill S.A. Fantes P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39MacNeill S.A. Reynolds M.S. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), also contains a similar sequence motif. Deletion or mutation of this motif in Cdc27 abolishes PCNA binding in vitro and Cdc27 also binds to the interdomain connector loop region of PCNA. 3S. A. MacNeill, personal communication. In p21, the cognate sequence QTSMTDFY (residues 144–151) is contained within the binding site with PCNA (17Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), and as discussed above, the Met, Phe, and Tyr residues interact with the large hydrophobic pocket. The question raised in relation to our studies is whether the N2 region of pol δ also contains a sequence that can be recognized as a member of the consensus. There is no obvious strong relationship; however, the N2 region (33Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Toomey N.L. Zhu L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) contains the highly conserved feature of 3 adjacent aromatic residues, IHGFAPYFY (residues 141–149), which could potentially serve the same role of providing a hydrophobic interaction with PCNA.Current research now provides a structural basis for the findings that PCNA interacts with a number of other proteins in the form of the identification of a putative peptide motif for PCNA binding (36Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Curr. Biology. 1995; 5: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 37Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S.

Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the existence of a putative third subunit (Cdc27) of yeast pol δ that binds to PCNA3 raises the issue of redundancy in the binding of the pol δ holoenzyme to PCNA, since our studies indicate that the catalytic subunit of pol δ (p125) interacts directly with PCNA. An additional issue is whether it is p125 or the third subunit (or both) that is responsible for the functional interaction of pol δ with PCNA. The enzyme we used in this study was purified by the immunoaffinity chromatography and gel filtration, and may contain other components besides the two subunit form that is isolated after stringent conventional chromatography (19Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 4P. Zhang and M. Y. W. T. Lee, manuscript in preparation. In our hands, the pol δ p125 subunit overexpressed in Sf9 cells could be stimulated only 5-fold with PCNA in the presence of recombinant p50 expressed inE. coli (40Sun Y. Jiang Y. Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zou Y. Li B.Q. Toomey N.L. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13013-13018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Polymerase δ obtained by co-expression of the p125 and p50 subunits (pol δ core) in the baculovirus system could be stimulated by PCNA at most 8-fold, far less than the stimulation obtained by the holoenzyme prepared from the immunoaffinity column.4 Thus, it is possible that the full functional effects of PCNA on pol δ may involve multi-point interactions. That these interactions may involve the same site on PCNA is feasible, since its trimeric structure should contain three binding sites.In summary, we have obtained mutational evidence for the localization of the region of PCNA that is involved in binding to pol δ to the interdomain connector loop of PCNA. This evidence is consistent with, and strengthened by, a previous analysis of the epitope of an inhibitory antibody. In addition, the recent molecular analysis of the p21-PCNA interaction site, which is also localized to the interdomain connector loop, provides a basis for the prediction that pol δ may interact in a similar way, and a rational mechanism for the ability of p21 to inhibit DNA synthesis.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated a common ancestry of the enzyme with those from oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes, suggesting that the cDNA encoded the chloroplast enzyme. The catalytic domain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, generating a product capable of cleaving the thylakoid-transfer domain from a chloroplast protein.

Antibodies to the overexpressed polypeptide cross-reacted with a 30-kDa thylakoid membrane protein. In plants, chloroplast proteins that function in the thylakoid lumen are generally initially synthesized in the cytoplasm as precursors with amino-terminal presequences, which are responsible for the transport of the precursors into the thylakoid (1Smeekens S. de Groot M. van Binsbergen J. Weisbeek P. Nature. 1985; 317: 456-458Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The presequence consists of two distinct domains (2Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The first, the envelope-transfer domain, is responsible for the transport of the precursor across the chloroplast membrane into the stroma, where a soluble stromal processing peptidase usually removes this domain, producing an intermediate form of the protein. The second domain of the presequence then directs the transport of the intermediate form across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen where the thylakoidal processing peptidase (TPP) 1The abbreviations used are: TPP, thylakoidal processing peptidase; IPTG, isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; iOE23, stromal intermediate of the 23-kDa extrinsic polypeptide of Photosystem II from wheat; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: TPP, thylakoidal processing peptidase; IPTG, isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; iOE23, stromal intermediate of the 23-kDa extrinsic polypeptide of Photosystem II from wheat; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. removes the thylakoid-transfer domain to produce the mature form of the protein (3Hageman J. Robinson C. Smeekens S. Weisbeek P. Nature. 1986; 324: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thylakoid lumen proteins processed by TPP include plastocyanin and the 33-, 23-, and 16-kDa extrinsic proteins of Photosystem II (4James H.E. Bartling D. Musgrove J.E. Kirwin P.M. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19573-19576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TPP is a thylakoid membrane protein with its active site located at the lumenal face (5Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.D. Williams R.S. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18128-18132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since TPP cleaves a signal or leader peptide from a precursor protein, it can be referred to as a signal or leader peptidase and belongs to the family of Type I leader peptidases (6Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Members of this family include the leader peptidases from Escherichia coli and the cyanobacterium Phormidium laminosum, where the enzyme also processes polypeptides of the cyanobacterial thylakoid lumen (7Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12073-12080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Packer J.C.L. André D. Howe C.J. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An inhibitor of the E. coli enzyme has recently been shown to inhibit the cyanobacterial and chloroplast enzymes (9Barbrook A.C. Packer J.C.L. Howe C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity has been shown to be very similar between the plant TPP and the cyanobacterial enzyme (10Wallace T.P. Robinson C. Howe C.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the specificity of plant TPP has been shown to be virtually identical to that of the E. colileader peptidase, as certain thylakoid lumen precursors have been found to be cleaved at the same sites by the E. coli leader peptidase and TPP, and certain bacterial leader peptides are also cleaved at the same sites by TPP and the E. coli leader peptidase (11Halpin C. Elderfield P.D. James H.E. Zimmermann R. Dunbar B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3917-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The structures of the bacterial leader peptides and the thylakoid-transfer domain have similar features. These include a positively charged amino-terminal region, a hydrophobic central core and a polar carboxyl-terminal region in which the −3 and −1 residues relative to the cleavage site are short uncharged amino acids (12Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12152-12156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acid sequences among the Type I leader peptidases shows the presence of a few highly conserved regions, and site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli leader peptidase shows particular serine and lysine residues to be involved in the catalytic activity (13Black M.T. Munn J.G.R. Allsop A.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Black M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4957-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tschantz W.R.

Other prokaryotic and mitochondrial leader peptidases are believed to contain such a catalytic dyad, although the homologous subunits of the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase contain a histidine residue at the equivalent position to the lysine (reviewed in Ref. 16Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A major hindrance to studies of the plant TPP has been the lack of a cloned gene or cDNA, which has been largely due to the difficulty of purifying the protein (17Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16386-16390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report the isolation and sequence analysis of a cDNA for a TPP precursor from Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the cDNA encodes the chloroplast enzyme. A region encoding the catalytic domain of the enzyme was expressed in E. coli, and catalytic activity of the expressed protein was demonstrated using a precursor of a thylakoid lumen protein. Antibodies to the overexpressed domain cross-reacted with a thylakoid membrane protein, confirming the identification of the cDNA as encoding the chloroplast protein. A partial cDNA clone 177H22T7 that showed regions of sequence similarity to well conserved blocks of amino acid sequence found among Type I leader peptidases from different organisms was identified from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University (18Newman T. de Bruijn F.J.

The probe was labeled with fluorescein using a random prime labeling system (Amersham). DNA preparation, digestion, and library screening were carried out as described in Ref. 19Sambrook J.

A positively hybridizing phage was isolated and excisionin vivo used to generate a plasmid pBKC1 containing the cDNA insert. Automated sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer 373 DNA sequencing system. Amino acid sequences were aligned by CLUSTALW (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55629) Google Scholar) and edited by eye to exclude unreliably aligned residues. Phylogenetic trees were generated using SEQBOOT, PROTPARS, PROTDIST, FITCH, and CONSENSE programs from the PHYLIP3.5 package (21Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and SPLITSTREE version 1.0 (22Huson D.H. SPLITSTREE Version 1.0 FSP Mathematisierung. Universitat Bielefeld (E-mail:[email protected]), Bielefeld, Germany1994Google Scholar). With PHYLIP tree-building programs 100 bootstrap samples were used for analysis to assess sampling errors. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out (usingTaq DNA polymerase from Life Technologies, Inc. and following the manufacturer's instructions) on pBKC1 using (BamHI sites underlined) a sense primer 5′AAAGGATCCAAAGTCGATTCCTTCAACG and an antisense primer 5′AAAGGATCCTGGTTTTGCACAATCTTGTGC to amplify the catalytic domain (residues 177–340 of the precursor protein). The polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into the BamHI site of pET16b-kan, a vector comprising the IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase-dependent expression vector pET16b (Novagen) with a kanamycin resistance cassette added (Carl Webster, Department of Plant Sciences, Cambridge, United Kingdom), making the construct pET-TPP558. E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS containing pET-TPP558 was grown at 37 °C overnight in LB medium containing 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. A 100-fold dilution of this culture was grown at 37 °C until an A 600 between 0.4 and 0.5 (measured in a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer) was reached before adding IPTG to a final concentration of 2 mm, followed by further cell growth at 37 °C for 5 h. From a 10-ml culture, cells were pelleted, washed in sterile distilled water, resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and then lysed by sonication. To obtain soluble material, the cell extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay, and 10-μg samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS and silver staining (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar, 24Wray W.

The overexpressed protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) and eluted with an imidazole step gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity of eluted fractions was monitored by SDS-PAGE. A cDNA clone for the stromal intermediate of the 23-kDa extrinsic polypeptide of Photosystem II from wheat (iOE23) was linearized and transcribedin vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (25Bassham D.C.

A 12,000 ×g supernatant fraction containing 20 μg of total protein was taken from an induced culture of E. coli containing the plasmid pET-TPP558 as described above. This was incubated with 3 μl of radiolabeled iOE23 translation product at 30 °C for 2 h in a final volume of 23 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.15% Triton X-100. As a control a similar incubation was carried out using a supernatant fraction prepared in the same way from cells containing the pET16b-kan vector rather than the construct pET-TPP558. The processing reactions were terminated by addition of 1 volume of sample buffer (8% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.01% w/v bromphenol blue, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and 2-mercaptoethanol to 10% v/v followed by boiling for 3 min. Samples were analyzed in 15% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. Pea (Pisum sativum var. Feltham First) seedlings were grown for 8–10 days in Levington compost (Fisons, Ipswich, United Kingdom) in a greenhouse with supplementary lighting providing photosynthetically active radiation of 125 μmol photons m−2 s−1 for 16 h per day. Intact chloroplasts were prepared as described in Ref. 26Mould R.M. Gray J.C. Celis J.E. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York1997: 286-292Google Scholar and lysed by resuspension in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at a final chlorophyll concentration of 2 mg/ml. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.15% v/v Triton X-100 at a final chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated on a rotating mixer for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was stored at −80 °C and used within 1 week. Intact pea chloroplasts were prepared as described in Ref. 26Mould R.M. Gray J.C. Celis J.E. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York1997: 286-292Google Scholar, except that a 35% Percoll cushion was used. Chloroplasts were then resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The stroma was separated from the thylakoid pellet, which was washed three times in lysis buffer. A Triton X-100 extract was prepared from the thylakoids by addition of 0.25% v/v Triton X-100 to a concentration of 2.5 mg of detergent/mg of chlorophyll, incubation for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating mixer, and centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples corresponding to 20 μg of chlorophyll were analyzed by 15% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Polypeptides from polyacrylamide gels were transferred to Hybond™ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham) using a Bio-Rad semidry electrophoretic transfer cell. Immunochemical detection was carried out with antibodies to the overexpressed catalytic domain of TPP raised by UltraClone Ltd. (Wellow, Isle of Wight) at a dilution of 1:3000 and donkey anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate and ECL (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A cDNA clone, 177H22T7, was identified in the AIMS Arabidopsis EST data base as showing sequence similarity to the leader peptidase of the cyanobacterium P. laminosum. The cDNA clone was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, and the insert was fully sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence showed regions that are highly conserved among other Type I signal peptidases. However, the insert did not encode a full-length cDNA, as judged by the lack of a potential initiation codon. The insert was excised from the vector and used to screen an A. thalianavar. Columbia library (PRL2, obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) containing cDNA derived from mixed tissues inserted into λZipLox (18Newman T. de Bruijn F.J. Green P. Keegstra K. Kende H. McIntosh L. Ohlrogge J. Raikhel N. Somerville S. Thomashow M. Retzel E. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). One positive clone was identified from 50,000 plaques screened. Excision in vivo generated a plasmid designated pBKC1 with an insert of 1784 base pairs, which was fully sequenced (GenBank™/EBI accession number Y10477). From the sequence, an open reading frame was identified that could encode a protein of 340 amino acids and a molecular mass of 37.9 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the putative A. thaliana TPP was aligned with those of the leader peptidases from E. coli and the cyanobacteria P. laminosum and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Fig. 1). Blocks of conserved amino acid sequence were found, with the A. thalianasequence showing 34, 38, 39, and 42% identity to the catalytic domains of the E. coli, P. laminosum, and the twoSynechocystis sp. PCC6803 leader peptidases, respectively. These regions included the conserved serine and lysine residues believed to function in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The phylogenetic relationship of the predicted sequence from A. thaliana to other Type I signal peptidase sequences was examined. A distance matrix method indicated a specific grouping of the plant TPP sequence with the cyanobacterial sequences with high (95%) bootstrap significance (Fig.2). When other tree selection criteria such as parsimony (21Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and Split-decomposition (22Huson D.H. SPLITSTREE Version 1.0 FSP Mathematisierung. Universitat Bielefeld (E-mail:[email protected]), Bielefeld, Germany1994Google Scholar) were used, congruent results were obtained. Given the proposed origin of chloroplasts from oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes, this strongly indicates that the cDNA obtained is for the chloroplast enzyme. A 558-base pair DNA fragment encoding the putative catalytic domain of the A. thaliana TPP (from residues 177–340) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the expression vector pET16b-kan as described above, making the construct pET-TPP558. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with this plasmid or pET16b-kan as a control and induced with IPTG as described above. After induction, cells were lysed and the polypeptide profiles compared by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). A polypeptide with a mobility corresponding closely to the expected size (∼22 kDa) was present in the lysate from cells containing pET-TPP558 (lane 1) but not from those containing pET16b-kan (lane 2), indicating that expression of the domain had occurred. The catalytic activity of the overexpressed protein was tested using the stromal intermediate of the 23-kDa extrinsic component of Photosystem II from wheat. Radiolabeled protein was incubated with extracts containing 20 μg of total protein prepared from induced E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cultures containing pET-TPP558 or pET16b-kan, or a TPP preparation made from pea chloroplasts, and the products analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 4). Incubation with the extract from cells containing pET-TPP558 generated a polypeptide of lower molecular mass (lane 2), which had the same mobility as that generated by incubation with TPP prepared from chloroplasts (lane 4). The extract from control cells containing pET16b-kan did not produce this polypeptide (lane 3). The overexpressed domain was therefore shown to be catalytically active. Western blots of chloroplast fractions were probed with antibodies raised to the overexpressed catalytic domain to test the predicted thylakoid location of the TPP and to determine the size of the mature protein. The antibodies detected a protein with a mobility corresponding to a size of approximately 30 kDa in a chloroplast preparation (Fig.5, lane 1). This protein was absent from the stromal fraction (lane 2), but present in the thylakoid fraction (lane 3). Treatment with Triton X-100 solubilized some, but not all, of the protein (lanes 4 and5). A cDNA encoding a putative A. thaliana TPP was identified and shown to encode highly conserved regions found among other Type I leader peptidases. Phylogenetic analysis of the putative TPP indicated a common ancestry with cyanobacterial TPP to the exclusion of those from other bacteria and mitochondria. This is consistent with the putative TPP being a chloroplast enzyme and the belief that important elements of the protein translocation machinery of chloroplast thylakoids are derived from those in the oxygenic prokaryote that gave rise to chloroplasts by endosymbiosis (27Howe C.J. Barbrook A.C. Packer J.C.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of the predicted translation product is not conserved in other leader peptidases and is presumably an envelope-transfer domain for chloroplast import. It shows characteristic features of such sequences, including a large number of serine and threonine residues, although the cleavage site cannot be deduced from the sequence alone, as such sites have rather relaxed sequence requirements (28von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 29Gray J.C. Row P.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 243-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot (30Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17168) Google Scholar) (not shown) identified a putative transmembrane region, which is marked in Fig. 1. This is consistent with the demonstration that TPP is an integral membrane protein (5Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.D. Williams R.S. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18128-18132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that the chloroplast TPP belongs to the class of enzymes (including those of cyanobacteria) with a single transmembrane span, rather than two as in E. coli. Twenty residues NH2-terminal to the putative transmembrane domain is a stretch (residues 121–139) very rich in charged (mainly acidic) amino acids. The rest of the protein COOH-terminal to the transmembrane domain contains the catalytic site and presumably protrudes into the thylakoid lumen. Serine and lysine residues corresponding to those at positions 90 and 145, respectively, in theE. coli leader peptidase sequence are conserved. This strongly indicates that the A. thaliana enzyme uses the serine-lysine catalytic dyad mechanism believed to operate in the enzymes from prokaryotes and mitochondria, but not the endoplasmic reticulum (16Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 28-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The operation of the serine-lysine mechanism is consistent with our recent report that an inhibitor of the E. coli enzyme also inhibits the cyanobacterial and chloroplast enzymes (9Barbrook A.C. Packer J.C.L. Howe C.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The -GDNR- motif of uncertain function is also conserved (residues 288–291) in A. thaliana. The catalytic domain of the enzyme was expressed in E. coli, and shown to retain catalytic activity, by the ability to process the intermediate form of the 23-kDa extrinsic polypeptide of Photosystem II. It is not clear why the catalytic activity of the overexpressed domain was low. It may be that in vivo the translocation pore serves to hold the substrate in the correct configuration for peptidase action. Antibodies to the overexpressed protein bound to a 30-kDa thylakoid protein, which could be partially solubilized with Triton X-100, as with the bona fide TPP (17Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16386-16390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the identification of the cDNA described here. The size of this protein is large enough to include the acidic stretch, which is presumably exposed in the stroma. The function of this region remains to be determined. It may be involved in interactions with other components of the protein translocation machinery. We thank Dr. J. C. L. Packer for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1980113077,"We have previously shown that treatment with okadaic acid (OA) followed by heat shock (HS) (termed OA → HS treatment) leads to rapid transactivation of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein gene (grp78) in 9L rat brain tumor cells. A cAMP-responsive element-like (CRE-like, TGACGTGA) promoter sequence and a protein kinase A signaling pathway are involved in this induction, and activation of both CRE binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) is required in the above process. Herein, we report that transactivation of grp78, as well as phosphorylation/activation of ATF-2, can be completely annihilated by SB203580, a highly specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Activation of p38MAPK by OA → HS is also substantiated by its own phosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK activating protein kinase-2 in cells subjected to this treatment. The involvement of p38MAPK in the activation of ATF-2, which leads to the transactivation of rat grp78, is confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a probe containing the CRE-like sequence as well as by transient transfection assays with a plasmid containing a 710-base pair stretch of the grp78promoter. Together with our previous studies, these results led us to conclude that phosphorylation/activation of CREB upon OA → HS treatment is mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, whereas that of ATF-2 is mediated by p38MAPK. The transcription factors may bind to each other to form heterodimers that in turn transactivate grp78 by binding to the CRE-like element. This suggests that distinct signaling pathways converge on CREB-ATF-2, where each subunit is individually activated by a specific class of protein kinases. This may allow modulation ofgrp78 transactivation by diverse external stimuli.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GRP78 is constitutively expressed, and its expression is enhanced up to 20-fold in cells under a variety of stressful conditions that deplete glucose or intracisternal calcium or otherwise disrupt glycoprotein trafficking (3Prostko C.R.

The above changes lead ultimately to accumulation of underprocessed or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and result in the induction of GRP78 (9Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). This protein is also induced by ethanol via a mechanistic pathway different from that of the “classical inducers” (10Hsieh K.-P. Wilke N. Harris A. Miles M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2709-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By contrast, GRP78 is usually not induced by heat shock (HS) alone (11Watowich S.S. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12Chen K.-D. Chu J.-J. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mammalian grp78 promoter, lacking any heat shock element, is regulated by a complex interplay of severalcis-elements and protein factors binding to these sites (6Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the highly conserved 36-base pair region within the mammalian grp78 promoter consists of CCAAT-like sequences flanked by GC-rich motifs that are important for basal and enhanced expression of this gene. Using this region as a probe for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), at least two specific protein-DNA complexes are detected in the nuclear extracts of HeLa cells (14Liu E.S. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5425-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Wooden S.K. Li L.-J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, transactivation of grp78 by several chemical stressors is found to correlate with changes in the activities of protein kinases and phosphatases (18Resendez Jr., E. Ting J. Kim K.S. Wooden S.K. Lee A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2145-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Koong A.C. Auger E.A. Chen E.Y. Giaccia A.J. Radiat.

It should also be noted that the induction of grp78 expression by the classical inducers is slow and requires several hours of sustained treatment with lag phases of 3 h to more than 24 h. We have demonstrated that okadaic acid (OA), a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, enhances the expression of GRP78 (8Hou M.-C. Shen C.-H. Lee W.-C. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as well as potentiates the expression of GRP78 in heat-shocked 9L rat brain tumor (RBT) cells (12Chen K.-D. Chu J.-J. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When followed by heat shock at 45 °C for 15 min, GRP78 is induced within 60 min treatment with a low dose (200 nm) of OA compared with prolonged treatment of several hours with classical inducers (12Chen K.-D. Chu J.-J. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To understand the signal transduction mechanism involved in the rapid induction of GRP78, we determined the functionality of the cis-acting CRE-like element of rat grp78 promoter in cells treated sequentially with OA and heat shock (OA → HS, treatment of 200 nm OA followed by heat shock at 45 °C for 15 min). We found that OA → HS-induced GRP78 expression is regulated by binding of protein factors in nuclear extract to the CRE-like element. The transcription factors that interact with the grp78 CRE-like element have been identified as activating factor-2-cAMP responsive element binding protein (ATF-2-CREB) heterodimers and CREB homodimers, by antibody interference and supershift assays (17Chen K.-D. Hung J.-J. Huang H.-L. Chang M.D.-T. Lai Y.-K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In eucaryotic cells, transcriptional regulation upon stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway is mediated by a family of cAMP-responsive nuclear factors including CREB and ATF-2. These factors contain the basic domain/leucine zipper motifs and bind as homo- or heterodimers to CRE or CRE-like elements (21Tamai K.T. Monaco L. Nantel F. Zazopoulos E. Sassone-Corsi P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 121-139PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of CREB to CRE is insufficient to induce transcription. Activation of transcription requires the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 (21Tamai K.T. Monaco L. Nantel F. Zazopoulos E. Sassone-Corsi P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 121-139PubMed Google Scholar, 22Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The transcription factor ATF-2 can not only efficiently form DNA binding homodimers but also dimerize efficiently with numerous members of the ATF family and the Jun/Fos family (24Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 25Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Stimulation of ATF-2-dependent transactivation requires the phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr-69 and Thr-71, presumably by the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal protein kinase (27Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 28van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that ATF-2 is efficiently phosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and that enhancement of ATF-2-dependent gene expression by p38MAPKβ (one of the p38MAPKisoforms) is approximately 20-fold higher than that of other MAPKs tested (29Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). p38MAPK belongs to the MAPK family which is activated through phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues in response to mitogens or stress. Distinct MAPK cascades can be activated independently and simultaneously (30Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). p38MAPK is a potent activator of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), which phosphorylates the small heat shock protein (HSP27) (31Rouse J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Besides MAPKAPK-2, activated p38MAPK phosphorylates transcription factors, including ATF-2, Max, CREB-homologue/growth arrest DNA damage 153 (CHDP/GADD153), important in the regulation cell growth and apoptosis (34Molnar A.

A related compound, SB203580, inhibits p38MAPK with an IC50 of 0.6 μm and exhibits no effect even at 100 μm on the activities of 12 other protein kinases tested, including extracellular-regulated protein kinase-2 and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-N-terminal protein kinase (36Cuenda A.

Herein we report that grp78 transcription induced by OA → HS in 9L RBT cells is p38MAPK-dependent by using the highly specific p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580. The OA → HS-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation is regulated by p38MAPK activity. This activation is blocked by prior incubation with SB203580. These results point to a novel p38MAPK signaling pathway leading to the rapid transactivation of grp78 in 9L RBT cells. Moreover, the synergistic action of PKA as well as p38MAPK on regulation of rat grp78 are discussed. OA was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cultureware was obtained from Corning (Corning, NY), and culture medium components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [35S]Methionine (specific activity >800 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol), and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection kit were from Amersham Corp. (Buckinghamshire, UK). Polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated CREB (specific for Ser(P)-133-CREB) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies for GRP78, p38MAPK, phosphorylated p38MAPK, CREB, and ATF-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Chemicals for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. Other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma. SB203580 was a kind gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (King of Prussia, PA). 9L RBT cells, derived from rat gliosarcoma (48Weizsaecker M. Deen D.F. Rosenblum M.L. Hoshino T. Gutin P.H. Baker M. J. Neurol. Sci. 1981; 224: 183-192Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), were a gift of Dr. M. L. Rosenblum (University of California at San Francisco) and were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to each experiment, stock cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks or 6-well plates at a density of 4–6 × 104 cells per cm2. Exponentially growing cells at 80–90% confluency were used. For drug treatment, OA and SB203580 stock solutions were diluted with culture medium to the desired concentration before adding to the cells, and the treatment was performed at 37 °C. For heat shock, cells in flasks or plates were sealed with Parafilm and submerged in a water bath pre-set at 45 ± 0.1 °C for 15 min. To study the combined effects of OA and heat shock (OA → HS treatment), cells were preincubated with 200 nm OA for 1 h and then heated at 45 °C for 15 min in the presence of the drug. Alternatively, the cells were treated according to various protocols as described below and in the figure legends. Alterations of protein synthesis and phosphorylation were revealed by [35S]methionine and [32P]orthophosphate labeling, respectively. In vivo 32P labeling was performed with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate in 1 ml of labeling medium (phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% FCS) for 1 h prior to various treatments in the presence of the isotope. Synthesis of GRP78 protein in the treated cells was revealed by [35S]methionine labeling. After treatments, cells were washed twice and incubated with fresh medium at 37 °C for 8 h before labeling with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine in 1 ml of medium for 1 h. After labeling, cells were washed with PBS, lysed in sample buffer (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), and subjected to electrophoresis as described previously (8Hou M.-C. Shen C.-H. Lee W.-C. Lai Y.-K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 50Lai Y.-K. Lee W.-C. Chen K.-D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, dried, and processed for autoradiography. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates were resolved using a mini-gel apparatus (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA). After electrophoresis, the proteins were electro-transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Super, Amersham Corp.) and probed with antibodies against p38MAPK, phosphorylated p38MAPK, GRP78, CREB, phosphorylated CREB, and ATF-2, separately. The immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). Total RNA was isolated from 9L cells according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (51Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, cells (5 × 106) were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in 1.5 ml of RNA extraction buffer (0.5% sarcosyl, 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mm sodium citrate). Total RNA was extracted by sequential addition of one-tenth volume of 2m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, an equal volume of water-saturated phenol, and two-tenths volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) followed by precipitation of the aqueous phase with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The RNA pellets were then re-dissolved in 0.3 ml of extraction buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol) and precipitated again with isopropyl alcohol. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. An equal amount of total RNA isolated from different treatment conditions was blotted onto the nylon membrane and fixed by using an ultraviolet (UV) cross-linker (Stratagene). Template for the GRP78 hybridization probe was a polymerase chain reaction product from isolated 9L genomic DNA. Polymerase chain reaction primers for producing the GRP78 probe were 5′-TCGTGGCTCCTCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAACCACCATGCCTA-3′ according to the exon 1 of rat grp78 gene. Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotide probe was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). GRP78 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.). Following prehybridization, hybridization, and autoradiography, membranes were stripped off probes by boiling in 0.1 × SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.01% SDS for 20 min and then rehybridized with other probes. Autoradiograms were quantified by densitometric scanning in two-dimensional mode (Molecular Dynamics). The construction of pGRP78-BGL plasmid was derived from ligation of a rat grp78 promoter fragment with the pβgal-Promoter reporter vector (CLONTECH). The pβgal-Promoter vector contains the SV40 early promoter inserted upstream of the lacZ gene. A 0.7-kilobase pairBglII/KpnI fragment derived from ratgrp78 promoter containing the CRE-like element (17Chen K.-D. Hung J.-J. Huang H.-L. Chang M.D.-T. Lai Y.-K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BglII/KpnI vector to generate pGRP78-BGL. A negative control that lacked eucaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences (pβgal-Basic) was also included. For transfection experiments, 9L cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 mg/liter l-glutamine, and antibiotics. The cells were transfected by LipoTAXITM mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1.2–3.0 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish 16 h before transfection and were incubated in 3 ml of serum-free DMEM containing LipoTAXI transfection reagent for 4 h under standard growth conditions (5% CO2 in humidified incubator at 37 °C). After transfection, DMEM containing 20% serum was added to the tissue culture dish and further incubated for 24 h. The cells were then subjected to OA → HS treatment with or without preincubation with SB203580. Subsequently, the cells were solubilized in extraction buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the cell lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase with o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (Sigma, 4 mg/ml in 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mNa2CO3, and the enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm. β-Galactosidase activity is expressed as units (nmol of o-nitrophenol formed per min) per mg of cell lysate. The averaged value obtained from three negative controls was subtracted from each experimental result before presentation. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Roy et al. (52Roy R.J. Gosselin P. Guerin S.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (17Chen K.-D. Hung J.-J. Huang H.-L. Chang M.D.-T. Lai Y.-K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, approximately 5 × 108 cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × gfor 8 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and centrifuged. Cells were suspended in 4 ml of nuclear extraction buffer I (250 mmsucrose, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mmspermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) and homogenized by a Dounce grinder with 3 strokes. Nonidet P-40 was then added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the mixture was incubated on ice for about 5 min. Following another round of homogenization (6 more strokes), nuclei and cell debris were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × gfor 8 min as described previously. Nuclei were washed with 5 ml of buffer I and centrifuged as above. The nuclei were then lysed by incubating the sample on ice for 5 min in 1 packed cell volume of nuclear extraction buffer II (buffer I supplemented with 350 mm KCl), followed by a 25-stroke homogenization. The homogenate was transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) for 90 min at 4 °C and then stored frozen at −70 °C until use. CRE-like element binding activities of the nuclear extracts were determined by EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotide as probes. The CRE-like oligonucleotide probe was prepared by annealing 5′-GCGTACCAGTGACGTGAGTTGCGGAGG-3′ with its complementary strand, followed by end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Each gel shift reaction was carried out in a 20-μl volume in the presence of binding buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Nuclear extract was added to the binding buffer, and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. After incubation, the DNA probe (2 × 104 cpm for each reaction) was added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% (40:1) polyacrylamide gel which had been pre-run for 30 min in 0.5 × TBE buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) at 150 V. 4% nondenaturing PAGE was run at 150 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For in vivo meta"

Cdc42D118A,C188Sp and its guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24p displayed a temperature-dependent interaction in the two-hybrid system, which correlated with the temperature dependence of the cdc42 D118A phenotype and supported a Cdc24p sequestration model for the mechanism ofcdc42 D118A action.

The establishment of cell polarity is crucial for the control of many cellular and developmental processes, such as the generation of cell shape, the intracellular movement of organelles, and the secretion and deposition of new cell surface constituents (1Drubin D.G.

The mechanics of cell polarity initiation during the mitotic cell cycle can be divided into three sequential phases: (i) nonrandom bud site selection; (ii) organization of proteins at the bud site; and (iii) bud emergence and polarized growth. Genetic and biochemical studies have identified over 25 proteins, including several GTPases and components of the actin cytoskeleton, that are involved in the regulation of the cell polarity pathway in S. cerevisiae (1Drubin D.G.

At least six members of the Ras superfamily of GTPases (Rsr1p/Bud1p, Cdc42p, Rho1p, Rho2p, Rho3p, and Rho4p) are involved in controlling cell polarity in S. cerevisiae. These proteins are active when in the GTP-bound state and inactive in the GDP-bound state (8Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 9Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The activity of these GTPases is controlled by regulatory proteins, such as guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, as well as by the intracellular localization of the GTPase. Rsr1p/Bud1p is a member of the Ras subfamily and is responsible for bud site selection at one of the two cell poles, but it is not required for bud emergence or polarized cell growth (10Bender A.

O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data included the observation that the cdc42 G12Vmutation resulted in dominant lethality and large, multibudded cells, suggesting that the mutant protein was activated (GTP-bound) and constitutively interacting with downstream effectors of the pathway. These effectors may include Cla4p, Ste20p, and/or Skm1p, three S. cerevisiae members of the Pak family of protein kinases that interact with GTP-bound Cdc42p (25Ottilie S. Miller P.J. Johnson D.I.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In contrast, thecdc42 D118A mutant exhibited a temperature-dependent, dominant negative phenotype, suggesting that Cdc42D118Ap was inactive (GDP-bound) but could bind and sequester a cellular factor necessary for the budding process (16Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 35Ziman M. Johnson D.I. Yeast. 1994; 10: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A candidate for this cellular factor was Cdc24p due to its ability to multicopy-suppress thecdc42 D118A mutation and because acdc24 ts cdc42 ts double mutant displayed synthetic lethality (35Ziman M. Johnson D.I. Yeast. 1994; 10: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc24p showed limited amino acid sequence similarity with the Dbl proto-oncoprotein, which acts as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for human Cdc42p (36Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence indicated that Cdc24p catalyzes guanine-nucleotide exchange on Cdc42p in vitro (37Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In localization studies, S. cerevisiae Cdc42p was found to be targeted to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of secretory vesicles that are found at the site of bud emergence, to the tips and sides of enlarging buds, and to the tips of mating projections in α-factor arrested cells (38Ziman M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. O'Brien J.M. Botstein D. Johnson D.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cdc42p contains the C-terminal Lys183-Lys-Ser-Lys-Lys-Cys-Thr-Ile-Leu sequence that is modified by geranylgeranylation at the Cys residue, which is necessary for its anchoring within the plasma membrane (38Ziman M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. O'Brien J.M. Botstein D. Johnson D.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 39Finegold A.A. Johnson D.I. Farnsworth C.C. Gelb M.H. Judd S.R. Glomset J.A. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4448-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This prenylation is deemed necessary because the cdc42 C188Smutation resulted in a nonfunctional protein that fractionated almost exclusively into soluble pools (16Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 38Ziman M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. O'Brien J.M. Botstein D. Johnson D.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and because thecdc42 C188S mutation can suppress thecdc42 G12V, cdc42 Q61L, andcdc42 D118A lethal mutations (16Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, whether geranylgeranylation is necessary and sufficient for Cdc42p targeting to the sites of polarized growth is unknown. The polybasic domain of four lysine residues that is next to the prenylated Cys residue is another possible localization determinant. Similar domains in the K-Ras protein are important for membrane targeting; altering these Lys residues to Gln results in delocalized K-Ras proteins (40Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar,41Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanisms of action of thecdc42 D118A and cdc42 G12Vmutations, the interactions between Cdc42D118Ap and Cdc24p were examined in the yeast two-hybrid protein system, and extragenic and intragenic suppressors of the cdc42 G12Vallele were characterized. The data support the hypothesis that thecdc42 D118A dominant negative phenotype is due to sequestration of Cdc24p away from endogenous Cdc42p and suggest that the nature of the cdc42 G12V growth and morphological phenotypes is due to improper interactions with the Skm1p and Cla4p protein kinases at the plasma membrane. Two Cdc42 effector domain mutations were also identified that either suppressed thecdc42 D118A phenotype or disrupted Cdc42D118Ap-Cdc24p two-hybrid interactions, suggesting that Cdc24p may interact with Cdc42p through its effector domain. Enzymes, dideoxy sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction kits and other reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources and used as specified by the suppliers. [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 5-Fluoroorotic acid was obtained from American Biorganics, Inc. (Niagara Falls, NY).

(Lewisville, TX). Protein determinations were performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and immunoblots were developed using either the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.) or Renaissance system (NEN Life Science Products). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and glass beads (425–600 μm) were obtained from Sigma. Cdc42p-specific antibodies were isolated and purified as described previously (16Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell.

Plasmid pRS315(GAL1/10) was constructed by blunt-ending the 685-base pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment from pBM272 containing the divergent GAL1/10promoters with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and inserting it into the unique SmaI site of pRS315. Plasmid pPGK2 was constructed by inserting the PGK promoter from plasmid pPGK on a XhoI plus SalI fragment into the unique SalI site of a derivative of pRS425, which had the BamHI to HindIII fragment from its multiple cloning site removed. 2P. Miller and D. I. Johnson, unpublished results. Plasmid pPGK2E, which has the unique EagI site of pPGK2 removed, was constructed by cleaving pPGK2 with EagI, blunt-ending with S1 nuclease, and religating with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmids pPGK2-CDC42 and pPGK2E-CDC42 were constructed by inserting a PCR-generated CDC42 gene contained on a BamHI plus HindIII fragment into either pPGK2 or pPGK2E that had been digested with BamHI plus HindIII. pGAD2F-CDC24 was constructed by inserting the ∼4-kilobase pair BamHI plusHindIII fragment from pRS315(CDC24-B), which was blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, into pGAD2F that had been digested with BamHI and blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. SKM1 (Ref. 32Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession numberX69322) was isolated from W303–1A genomic DNA by PCR using the 5′-primer TCCCCCGGGCATATGAAGGGCGTAAAAAAG (underlined sequence is a NdeI site and contains theSKM1 start codon; double underlined sequence is aSmaI site) and the 3′-primer GCTCTAGACTCGAGACATAACGCGAAGCAAACG (underlined sequence is a XhoI site; double underlined sequence is a XbaI site; nonunderlined sequence is the reverse complement of +144 to +163 downstream of the SKM1stop codon). The resulting 2547-base pair PCR fragment was digested with SmaI plus XbaI and inserted intoSmaI plus XbaI-digested pTZ18U (54Rokeach L.A. Haselby J.A. Hoch S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4832-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To generate a skm1::HIS3 disruption, theSmaI-XhoI fragment containing HIS3from plasmid pJJ215 was blunt-ended with Klenow fragment and inserted into the blunt-ended unique StuI site at +241 of theSKM1 coding region in pTZ18U(SKM1). The resulting plasmid was digested with SmaI plus XbaI, releasing a 3.86-kilobase pair skm1::HIS3 fragment that was used to transform the diploid strain HD2 to His+. Sporulation and tetrad analysis of stable His+transformants yielded His+ haploid cells in which theskm1::HIS3 allele had replaced a wild-typeSKM1 allele at its chromosomal location, which was confirmed by DNA-DNA blot hybridization (data not shown). The PCR mutagenesis protocol was based on the Zhou et al. (55Zhou Y. Zhang X. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) protocol previously described. Plasmid pRS315(cdc42 D118A, C188S) was amplified under essentially standard reaction conditions (reaction volume was 200 μl; reaction conditions were 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 50 μm each dNTP, 2 fmol of template, 50 pmol of each primer, and 5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase; cycle profile (30 cycles total) was 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min) on a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler model 480. The 5′- and 3′-primers were, respectively,GAATTCAAGCTTCGTATTAGGTCTTCC (underlined sequence is an EcoRI site; double underlined sequence is aHindIII site; nonunderlined sequence is −20 to −6 upstream of the CDC42 start codon), and CGCGGATCCGGGCATATACTAATATG (underlined sequence is aBamHI site; nonunderlined sequence is the reverse complement of +2 to +18 downstream of the CDC42 stop codon). The pool of PCR fragments was digested with NdeI plusBamHI (the NdeI site is at the CDC42start codon) and directionally inserted into NdeI plusBamHI-digested pAS1-CYH2. The pool of pAS1-CYH2(cdc42 D118A,C188S,X (X is any possible new mutation) plasmids was amplified in E. coli and transformed into S. cerevisiae HF7c cells already containing pGAD2F(CDC24). Plasmid pAS1-CYH2(cdc42 D118A,C188S) was obtained using the same procedure; the entire coding region was sequenced to confirm the presence of only those two mutations and no other spurious mutations. The introduction of the T35A mutation into the wild-type,cdc42 G12V, or cdc42 D118Amutant gene was accomplished by a modified Kunkel method of site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (16Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The starting templates were uracil-containing single-stranded DNA isolated from E. coli CJ236 cells containing pRS315(CDC42), pRS315(cdc42 G12V), or pRS315(cdc42 D118A). The nucleotide sequence of the T35A mutagenic primer was GTTCCAGCAGTGTTCG (underlined G is A in the wild-type sequence). pGAL versions of the new double mutants were constructed using the same method as the original pGAL single mutants (16Ziman M. O'Brien J.M. Ouellette L.A. Church W.R. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3537-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); the pRS315 double-mutant plasmids were digested with HpaI to delete CDC42upstream sequences, and the 685-base pairEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pBM272 containing the divergent GAL1/10 promoters was blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and inserted into this uniqueHpaI site. A PCR approach was employed to generate the Cdc42T35A,D118A,C188S triple mutant for use in two-hybrid protein studies. The starting template was 100 ng of pRS315(cdc42 T35A,D118A) and the nucleotide sequence of the C188S mutagenic primer was CGCGGATCCGACTACAAAATTGTAGATTTTTTACTTTTCTTGATAACAGG (Cys188 to Ser; underlined G is C in the wild-type sequence; the double underlined sequence is a BamHI restriction site). The mutagenic primer was used as the 3′-primer in the PCR reaction with the same 5′-primer used in the PCR mutagenesis reactions (see above). Primers were used at a final concentration of 0.1 nm in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. The PCR cycling parameters were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, followed by a 5-min extension reaction at 72 °C. The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI plus BamHI (the NdeI site is at theCDC42 start codon) and directionally inserted intoNdeI plus BamHI-digested pAS1-CYH2. Introduction of the K183–187Q mutations into either the wild-type orcdc42 G12V mutant gene was accomplished using a PCR approach. The nucleotide sequence of the K183–187Q mutagenic primer was CGCGGATCCGACTACAAAATTGTACATTGTTGACTTTGCTGGATAACAGG (lysine 183, 184, 186, and 187 to Gln; underlined G bases are T in the wild-type sequence; the double underlined sequence is aBamHI restriction site). The mutagenic primer was used as the 3′-primer in the PCR reaction with the same 5′-primer used in the PCR mutagenesis reactions (see above). Template for the PCR reaction was 1 μg of either YEp351(CDC42) to generate thecdc42 K183–187Q quadruple mutant or pRS315(cdc42 G12V) to generate thecdc42 G12V,K183–187Q quintuple mutant. Primers were used at a final concentration of 0.1 μm in a final reaction volume of 100 μl, and the PCR cycling parameters were as described above. The mutant genes were placed under the control of thePGK promoter by digesting the resulting ∼600-base pair PCR products with HindIII plus BamHI and inserting into HindIII plus BamHI-cleaved pPGK2. For all mutant genes, the entire coding region for each mutant gene was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation(s) and the absence of any spurious mutations. The two-hybrid interaction methodology has been described (44Feilotter H.E. Hannon G.J. Ruddell C.J. Beach D.

To overcome the myelosuppression observed by chemotherapeutic alkylating agents, one approach is to increase the level of DNA repair proteins in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Toward this goal, we have constructed a human fusion protein consisting of O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase coupled with an apurinic endonuclease, resulting in a fully functional protein for bothO 6-methylguanine and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site repair as determined by biochemical analysis. The chimeric protein protected AP endonuclease-deficient Escherichia coli cells against methyl methanesulfonate and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) damage. A retroviral construct expressing the chimeric protein also protected HeLa cells against 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and methyl methanesulfonate cytotoxicity either when these agents were used separately or in combination. Moreover, as predicted from previous analysis, truncating the amino 150 amino acids of the apurinic endonuclease portion of theO 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-apurinic endonuclease protein resulted in the retention ofO 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase activity but loss of all AP endonuclease activity. These results demonstrate that the fusion of O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase and apurinic endonuclease proteins into a combined single repair protein can result in a fully functional protein retaining the repair activities of the individual repair proteins. These and other related constructs may be useful for protection of sensitive tissues and, therefore, are candidate constructs to be tested in preclinical models of chemotherapy toxicity.

An example of this would be the severe bone marrow toxicity seen with the use of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) 1The abbreviations used are: BCNU, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; APE, AP endonuclease; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BER, base excision repair; MPG, methyl DNA glycosylase. that is commonly used to treat brain tumors, lymphomas, breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers (1Carter S.K. Schabel Jr., F.M. Broder L.E. Johnston T.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1972; 16: 273-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The toxicity to bone marrow cells is most likely due to low levels of existing DNA repair activities that would otherwise help to protect cellular DNA from the damaging consequences of BCNU treatment (2Gerson S.L. Trey J.E. Miller K. Berger N.A. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). One strategy to overcome this limited DNA repair capacity is to transduce bone marrow cells with specific genes that encode repair enzymes that act on the DNA lesions produced by BCNU or other alkylating agents. This has recently been accomplished with murine and human bone marrow cells by retroviral-mediated transduction of human O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), an activity that repairs BCNU-generated chloroethyl groups at the O 6 position of guanine (3Allay J.A. Dumenco L.L. Koc O.N. Liu L. Gerson S.L. Blood. 1995; 85: 3342-3351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Moritz T. Mackay W. Glassner B.J. Williams D.A. Samson L.

Blood. 1996; 87: 1957-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alkylating agents are known to generate multiple DNA adducts by reacting with cellular DNA (7$$Google Scholar). These agents can alkylate all four bases of DNA at the nitrogens or oxygens as well as the sugar phosphates of the DNA backbone. However, the distribution of the adducts at the various sites depends on both the chemical structure of the alkylating agent and the alkyl group itself. One of the sites,O 6-methylguanine, preferentially pairs with thymine during DNA replication rather than cytosine, resulting in a GC to AT transition (7$$Google Scholar, 8Brent T. Dolan M. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Hall J. Karran P. Laval F. Margison G.P. Montesano R. Pegg A. Potter P. Singer B. Swenberg J. Yarosh D. Biochemistry. 1988; 85: 1759-1762Google Scholar). Furthermore, BCNU-induced DNA adducts such as a chloroethyl group at the O 6-position can initiate the subsequent formation of an interstrand cross-link by rearranging to produce an ethyl bridge between N1 of guanine and N3 of cytosine in the opposite strand (9Gonzaga P.E. Potter P.M. Niu T.Q. Yu D. Ludlum D.B. Rafferty J.A. Margison G.P. Brent T.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6052-6058PubMed Google Scholar). Interstrand DNA cross-links are particularly cytotoxic because they disrupt DNA replication (10Erickson L.C. Laurent G. Sharkey N.A. Kohn K.W. Nature. 1980; 288: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Repair of this lesion is distinct, since it involves the direct reversal of the damaged adduct by MGMT (11Robins P. Harris A.L. Goldsmith I. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7743-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,12Samson L. Derfler B. Waldstein E.A. Genetics. 1986; 83: 5607-5610Google Scholar). Another important product of attack on DNA by alkylating agents isN 3-methyladenine, which is cytotoxic (13Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 236: 77-84Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, N-alkylpurines are indirectly mutagenic because their removal, either as a spontaneous chemical reaction or by the action of DNA glycosylases, results in the formation of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites (14Mitra S. Kaina B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 109-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Although AP sites normally prevent DNA replication, they can also lead to mutations (16Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The accumulation of N-alkylpurines may also contribute to other biological effects such as induction of chromosomal aberrations as well as the aging process (17Gensler H.L. Bernstein H. Q. Rev. Biol. 1981; 56: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The major AP endonuclease in humans (18Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 19Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) has been identified to contain two nonoverlapping domains of activity (20Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). One is for the DNA repair activity associated with APE, where amino acid sequences at the C terminus have been shown to be essential for AP endonuclease activity (21Barzilay G. Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D.

Amino acid sequences at the N terminus are required for the redox regulation of different transcription factors such as Fos, Jun, Myb, activating transcriptionfactor 1 (ATF-1), ATF-2, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and p53 (20Xanthoudakis S.

A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Since alkylating agents are known to generate many different types of DNA modifications, we hypothesized that added protection to nontarget tissues could be achieved via linking human MGMT together with a number of other DNA repair enzymes to form a protein that recognized a broad spectrum of DNA lesions. As a model of this general approach we first linked the human APE to MGMT, thereby providing for the repair not only of O 6 modifications of guanine but also an activity directed toward baseless sites and modified 3′ termini in DNA. All of these lesions are a consequence of chloroethylnitrosourea (CNU)-generated DNA damage. We have also demonstrated, contrary to initial reports (28Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), that deletion of the first 150 amino acids results in the complete loss of AP endonuclease activity in fusion or nonfusion APE proteins. The data generated provides evidence that by combining domains of DNA base excision repair (BER), enzymes can be used to generate multiactive, highly efficient DNA repair protein(s) for gene therapy. This approach may allow the use of gene transfer to modulate DNA repair in the setting of high dose chemotherapy, with multiple chemotherapeutic agents, thus diminishing dose-limiting cytotoxicity. Enzymes and chemicals were purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc., Life Technologies, Inc., New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Promega (Madison, WI), Boehringer-Mannheim, and Sigma.

DNA sequencing was performed in the macromolecular facility in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencing system and fluorescent labeling. DNA isolation, RNA isolation, Northern and Western blot analysis, SDS-PAGE, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein production and purification were performed as has been previously described (29Wilson III, D.M.

O 6-Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase activity using the 18-mer oligonucleotide assay was performed as described (5Maze R. Carney J.P. Kelley M.R. Glassner B.J. Williams D.A. Samson L. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, the abasic assay utilized a 37-bp 5′32P-end-labeled duplex DNA fragment (AP-37mer) as described previously (32Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 1 pmol of 5′ end-labeled AP-37mer, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and the protein of interest. The DNA reaction products were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography for visualization and densitometric analysis using the Sigma Scan software package (Jandel Scientific). Cell culture and cell protection assays for Escherichia coli or HeLa cells has been described (5Maze R. Carney J.P. Kelley M.R. Glassner B.J. Williams D.A. Samson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar). THE MGMT-APE or MGMT-dl151APE (deletion of the first 150 amino acids of APE fused with full-length MGMT) fusion constructs were constructed using the overlapping thermocycle amplification technique (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar, 35Morgan S.E. Kelley M.R. Pieper R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19802-19809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial cDNA clones of human MGMT and human APE were used as templates for PCR (1 × Mg2+- free Tfl buffer, 1.5 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 15 pmols each of 5′ primer and 3′ primer, 1 unit of Tfl DNA polymerase (Promega)) in a thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA) using the human MGMT (5′ primer, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACAAGGATTGT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CTTTTTCCCACGCTTCGGGTTTCGGCCAGCAGGCGG-3′) and human APE (5′ primer, 5′-CCGCCTGCTGGCCGAAACCCGAAGCGTGGGAAAAAG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-GGCCGTCGACATCACAGTGCTAGG-3′) primer sequences. The PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel, and fragments (652 bp for MGMT and 986 bp for APE) were gel-purified by centrifugation through glass wool. The MGMT and APE fragments were combined in a second PCR reaction to amplify a 1,603-bp MGMT-APE product utilizing the MGMT 5′ primer with the APE 3′ primer under the following cycling conditions (95 °C for 10 min, 72 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles to step 3 and a final 72 °C for 10 min). The PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel. The 1.6-kb MGMT-APE fragment was gel-purified, double-digested with EcoRI andSalI, and ligated into the EcoRI/SalI site in pGEX4T-1 (Pharmacia) using T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies). After transformation into HB101 competent cells, the colonies containing pGEX4T-MGMT-APE were confirmed by PCR and restriction endonuclease digestion. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the integrity of the MGMT and APE sequences. The other construct, MGMT-dl151APE, was constructed in a similar manner. The deletion of the first 150 amino acids of the human APE was performed using PCR and primers that contained the carboxyl end of MGMT and APE nucleotide sequences starting at amino acid 151 of the APE protein sequence (5′ primer starting at amino acid 151 of APE; 5′-CCGCCTGCTGGCCGAAACCATGATCAGGAAGGCCGG-3′). The amplified products were purified and combined, and overlapping PCR was performed as described above. The 1.2-kb human MGMT-dl151APE-purified fragment was double-digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into the EcoRI/SalI cloning site in pGEX4T. Positive colonies were confirmed by PCR and restriction digestion and sequenced as described above. The MGMT-APE and MGMT-dl151APE chimeric sequences were removed from the pGEX4T constructs by XhoI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated into the EcoRI/XhoI cloning site of the retroviral vector MSCV2.1 (generous gift of Dr. Robert Hawley). HB101 cells were transformed with MSCV2.1 MGMT-APE, and MGMT-dl151APE ligation products and positive clones were identified by PCR and restriction digestion. Retroviral producer cells were generated by the transfection of 2 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) added to the Lipofectin transfection reagent (Life Technologies) into GP+AM12 (an amphotropic retrovirus packaging cell line) cells (36Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. Virology. 1988; 167: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Clones were selected using 0.75 mg/ml G418 (dry powder; Life Technologies), and individual clones were titered on NIH3T3 cells. High titer clones were used to infect HeLa cells in α-modified Eagles's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 10 μg/ml polybrene. After infection, HeLa cells were selected for G418 resistance, as above. Individual clones were isolated and examined for expression using Northern and Western blot analysis. HeLa cells containing each construct were plated into a 6-well plate (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and cultured overnight at 37 °C at 5% CO2. The next day, the cells were washed and treated for 1 h with 0–150 μm BCNU (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and 0–2 mm methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; Aldrich). Seven days later the viability of the cells was determined using trypan blue stain and compared with untreated cells and cells with vector alone. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific) software package (t test and ANOVA). The MGMT-APE fusion was constructed using the overlapping PCR technique that has been previously used in our laboratory (35Morgan S.E. Kelley M.R. Pieper R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19802-19809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, we separately amplified the human MGMT and human APE cDNA sequences (Fig.1). The 5′ primer of the MGMT includedEcoRI sequences for subsequent cloning into pGEX4T, and the 3′ MGMT primer contained an additional 18 nucleotides of the 5′ end of the APE coding region. The 5′ primer for the APE PCR included 18 nucleotides from the 3′ coding region of the MGMT cDNA, with the stop codon removed and the 3′ primer-included sequences for the restriction enzyme SalI (Fig. 1). These PCR products (653 bp for MGMT and 986 bp for APE) were purified and combined in a second PCR reaction to amplify a 1603-bp human MGMT-APE product by utilizing the MGMT 5′ primer with the APE 3′ primer. All amplifications were kept under 30 cycles, and large amounts of template were used to decrease the possibility of PCR-induced nucleotide changes. The PCR products were purified, and the 1.6-kilobase human MGMT-APE fragment was double-digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated into the EcoRI/SalI cloning site in pGEX 4T-1. After transformation into competent cells, the colonies containing pGEX 4T-1 MGMT-APE were confirmed by PCR and restriction digest, and DNA sequencing was used to confirm the integrity of the human MGMT and APE sequence. Another construct containing the full-length MGMT coding region, but only amino acids 151–318 of the APE coding region, was made in a similar fashion. This construct was made following the initial reports of AP endonuclease activity residing in the carboxyl region downstream of amino acid 150 (20Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). However, subsequent to this report, it is clear that only the first 60 amino acids can be deleted without significant loss of AP endonuclease activity (21Barzilay G. Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); our results are presented below. The full-length human chimeric MGMT-APE pGEX4T construct (MGMT-APE) and MGMT with the deleted APE (MGMT-dl151-APE) were transfected into E. coli ada − ogt − (GWR111) cells, and expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The 18-mer oligonucleotide assay was employed on the cell extract to determine the activity of the MGMT portion of the chimeric constructs (35Morgan S.E. Kelley M.R. Pieper R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19802-19809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wilson III, D.M. Tentler J.J. Carney J.P. Wilson T.M. Kelley M.R. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the GWR111 cells are devoid of O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase activity as expected, whereas the selected full-length chimeric clone was as active as the nonchimeric human MGMT clone. The selected MGMT-dl151APE clone was also fully active forO 6-methylguanine repair (Fig. 3). Additional clones were assayed, and similar results were found (data not shown). The chimeric MGMT-APE and MGMT-dl151APE constructs were transfected into E. coli RPC501 (xth −,nfo-1 −), which is deficient for the two major AP endonucleases in E. coli, exonuclease III (xth) and endonuclease IV (nfo-1). The fusion protein was overexpressed, and the soluble supernatant was applied to a glutathione-agarose column and washed, and the purified MGMT-APE protein was eluted with glutathione. This resulted in homogenous preparations of fusion proteins as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concomitantly, APE and dl151APE constructs were prepared in a similar fashion as we have previously reported (32Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A 37-mer oligonucleotide with a uracil at position 21 in the32P-labeled strand was annealed with the complementary unlabeled oligonucleotide and treated with uracil glycosylase to create an AP site in place of the uracil. This assay is similar to the one used for the 8-oxoguanine repair analysis (Yacoub et al.(32Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)). As can be seen from Fig.4 A, dilutions of the chimeric MGMT-APE protein (lanes 6–8) were equally as effective on the AP substrate as APE alone (lanes 2–4). We did not detect any APE activity using this assay with the MGMT-dl151APE construct (data not shown). To confirm that the deleted APE was inactive due to the deleted amino acids and not due to the addition of the MGMT moiety to the carboxyl region, we compared nonfusion APE and dl151APE using the AP oligonucleotide assay (Fig. 4 B). We did not see any activity with the dl151APE protein (Fig.4 B). Activity in this assay is demonstrated by the concentration of the 37-mer (upper band) to a 21-mer (lower band). Subsequently, the MGMT-dl151APE served as a negative control for chimeric AP endonuclease function. In additional experiments, we pretreated the MGMT-APE chimeric protein with unlabeledO 6-methylguanine oligo substrate that was used in the MGMT assay and then performed the AP assay to ascertain whether the stoichiometric transfer of the methyl group from the DNA to the MGMT portion of the chimeric protein would hinder AP activity. We found no diminution of APE function in this assay (data not shown). To verify the activity of the chimeric protein in cells and not just in biochemical analyses, two experiments were performed using E. coli cells that are deficient in AP endonuclease activity. E. coliRPC501(xth −, nfo −) cells with the MGMT-APE and MGMT-dl151APE chimeric constructs in pGEX, as described above, were used on gradient plates with either MMS or H2O2 (32Yacoub A. Augeri L. Kelley M.R. Doetsch P.W. Deutsch W.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The length of the cell growth along the gradient is a measure of the resistance or the strain to the agent. Using MMS, the MGMT-APE fully protects the AP endonuclease-deficient cells when compared with wild-type levels (Fig.5 A, lane 3), whereas the MGMT-dl151APE or the dl151APE shows no protection (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and 5). From the data, it is clear that the chimeric MGMT-APE affords as much protection against MMS as APE alone. APE has previously been shown to protect cells against H2O2 damage (15Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 18Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Using the gradient plate assay but with the DNA damaging agent H2O2 (Fig. 5 B), the MGMT-APE chimera was shown to protect to nearly wild-type levels. Once again, the MGMT-dl151APE is deficient in its ability to protect from damage requiring AP endonuclease activity. In the biochemical and E. coli protection studies described, the chimeric MGMT-APE protein was attached at the amino end to GST, which did not affect either MGMT or APE activity. This suggests that additional repair proteins may be added in lieu of the GST moiety to our construct in future experiments. Having concluded that the chimeric MGMT-APE protein was fully functional for MGMT and APE activity in biochemical andE. coli complementation assays, we proceeded to determine the functionality of the chimera in mammalian cells. The chimeric construct was transfected using Lipofectin transfection reagent into GP+AM12 cells and selected using G418. Individual clones were isolated, expression of the chimeric gene was assessed using Northern blot analysis (data not shown), and virus supernatant was used to infect HeLa cells. After infection, HeLa cells were selected for G418, individual clones were analyzed for RNA (Northern) and protein expression (Western), and two HeLa cell clones were selected for survivability assays in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were treated for 1 h with either 75 or 150 μm1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-nitrosourea, 1 or 2 mm MMS, or a mixture of 0.5 mm MMS and 75 μm BCNU. 7–10 days later the viability of the cells was determined using trypan blue stain and compared with untreated cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the chimerics have a 2-fold (83 and 92% versus 44%) survival enhancement over the HeLa cells alone at the lower BCNU dose, whereas at 150 μm, there is a 4–8-fold enhancement (43 and 86%versus 11%). For the MMS protection, there was roughly a 10-fold protection level at both the 1 mm (39 and 47%versus 4%) and 2 mm (12 and 10%versus 1%). The protection afforded by the chimeric construct against a dual exposure of MMS and BCNU was, again, roughly 10-fold (26 and 31% versus 3%) (Fig. 6). Chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer treatments, including dose intensification protocols, typically result in dose-limiting damage to nontarget tissues including bone marrow. A number of studies have utilized MGMT for protection against alkylating DNA damage, particularly in protocols using chloroethylnitrosoureas, which lead to modifications of the O 6-methylguanine residue leading to cross-linking and cytotoxicity. However, there exist two problems with this protective gene therapy paradigm; first, alkylating agents create damage at numerous other sites in DNA besides the mutagenic O 6-alkylguanine and these other sites, such as N3-alkyl-adenine or N3-alkyl-guanine, can be cytotoxic. Second, although MGMT may afford protection against cytotoxicity resulting from chloroethylnitrosourea cross-linking via the O 6-methylguanine lesion, the lack of corrective repair of the other DNA lesions after alkylation damage may have long term effects on the cell, resulting in mutations that could lead to subsequent cell transformations. Moreover, the overexpression of MGMT in cells with little or reduced levels of endogenous MGMT may allow cells to escape the cytotoxicity from agents causing cross-linking, but these cells may then have an increased mutational load due to the lack of repair of the other mutagenic lesions. Therefore, the data presented in this manuscript represents our initial attempts to couple direct reversal repair (MGMT) with members of the BER pathway. We have begun these long term investigations coupling MGMT with APE for several reasons. The first step in the BER pathway involves the removal of the damaged base by a glycosylase such as MPG, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond that links a base to the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone of DNA. This enzymatic activity results in the generation of an AP site. Although overexpression of MPG might be a logical starting point for coupling MGMT with the BER pathway, we have decided not to initially study the mammalian MPG gene since data by other investigators clearly demonstrate that the overexpression of the MPG gene, by itself, may lead to genetic instability. For example, studies have indicated that the overexpression of MPG results in an imbalance in the BER pathway, leading to a large number of AP sites and gapped intermediates. These alterations lead to the formation of chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, and can block the entry of cells into replication after the exposure to alkylating agents (39Kaina B. Fritz G. Coquerelle T. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1993; 22: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,40Coquerelle T. Dosch J. Kaina B. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the overexpression of MPG does not lead to increased resistance to alkylating agents (39Kaina B. Fritz G. Coquerelle T. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1993; 22: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and MPG activity does not appear to be the rate-limiting step in the BER pathway (41Ibeanu G. Hartenstein B. Dunn W.C. Chang L.Y. Hofmann E. Coquerelle T. Mitra S. Kaina B. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1989-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Given this data on MPG, we elected to move one step downstream in the BER pathway and use an APE. This choice was also supported by previous antisense studies that targeted the level of APE in mammalian cells and have demonstrated that these APE− cells become more sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as MMS and H2O2 (42Ono Y. Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Ohmoto T. Akiyama K. Tsutsui K. Seki S. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 86: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as well as bleomycin, menadione, and paraquat (43Walker L.J. Craig R.B. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These results suggest that APE or downstream members of the BER pathway (DNA β-polymerase or ligase) are the rate-limiting steps for base damage repair (44Yen L. Woo A. Christopoulopoulos G. Batist G. Panasci L. Roy R. Mitra S. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We also chose to fuse MGMT with APE, in that order, due to previous data demonstrating the carboxy 25 amino acids of MGMT and approximately 60 amino acids of APE are dispensable for the DNA repair functions of these proteins (21Barzilay G. Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Morgan S.E. Kelley M.R. Pieper R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19802-19809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated and confirmed these properties using biochemical analyses on the fused MGMT-APE protein (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, we have shown that the chimeric protein can rescue AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli cells back to wild-type levels after alkylating and oxidizing mutagen administration (Figs. 4 and 5). We have also demonstrated the protective ability of our constructs in mammalian cells (Fig. 6). Although very promising, we feel the real advantage of our chimeric constructs will not be fully appreciated until we conduct long term animal studies showing bone marrow protection and mutation reduction following chloroethylnitrosourea and other alkylating agent administration. Two other points are worth discussing. First, previous studies by us have demonstrated that APE levels are higher in primary bone marrow progenitor cells (CD34+) or hematopoietic cell lines that represent progenitors (HL-60) and decline as these cells mature and undergo apoptosis (Kelley and co-workers (33Robertson K.A. Hill D.P. Xu Y. Liu L. VanEpps S. Hockenbery D.M. Park J.R. Wilson T.M. Kelley M.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar)). 2D. A. Williams and M. R. Kelley, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, we have shown that APE levels also decline in HL-60 cells as they differentiate but can be maintained using retroviral constructs of APE (data not shown). Therefore, even though APE already exists in progenitor cells, gene therapy may allow protective effects in the maturing and developing blood cells. This is important as it demonstrates the ability to overcome endogenous regulatory events leading to decreased APE levels in the cells (33Robertson K.A. Hill D.P. Xu Y. Liu L. VanEpps S. Hockenbery D.M. Park J.R. Wilson T.M. Kelley M.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 443-449PubMed Google Scholar, 45Izumi T. Henner W.D. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14679-14683Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A second important element of these studies demonstrates the ability of an enhanced protective effect of the chimeric MGMT-APE when cells were challenged with two distinctly different alkylating agents, BCNU and the classic alkylator, MMS. Although we 3W. K. Hansen, W. A. Deutsch, Y. Xu, D. A. Williams, and M. R. Kelley, unpublished data. and others (46Tomicic M. Eschbach E. Kaina B. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have been unable to use expression constructs of APE alone to demonstrate an enhanced protective effect in mammalian cells, surprisingly we see protection when APE is expressed as a chimera. (However, APNI, the major yeast AP endonuclease and member of the EndoIV family has been used successfully in cell protection studies (46Tomicic M. Eschbach E. Kaina B. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). This may be attributable to the chimeric protein escaping normal protein-protein interactions due to the fusion of the MGMT moiety onto the amino end of APE. APE has been suggested to form a complex with other BER proteins (47Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the amino region of APE has been shown to interact with other proteins, either on a functional level (25Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G.K. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 48Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 387: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 49Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) or through binding (26Qin J. Clore G.M. Kennedy W.P. Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 613-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Hirota K. Matsui M. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Therefore, the addition of MGMT onto the amino end of APE may disrupt these interactions via altered folding or other similar mechanisms. This disruption of interactions hypothesis will be tested using a chimeric construct with MGMT fused onto APE missing its NH2-terminal 60 amino acids in which DNA repair activity is reduced by only 20%, but the loss of redox activity is complete. 4W. K. Hansen, W. A. Deutsch, Y. Xu, D. A. Williams, and M. R. Kelley, manuscript in preparation. Because of the multifunctional nature of APE, this latter construct will be of importance to compare with the full-length MGMT-APE chimera. The data presented here demonstrate the feasibility of combining DNA repair proteins into multifunctional repair enzymes. We have shown that the fusion of MGMT with APE results in a fully functional chimeric protein in which the individual activities of both MGMT and APE remain unaffected as shown in biochemical tests and E. coli and mammalian cell protection studies. The fusion construct may be useful in protection of primary bone marrow cells in vivo from simultaneous sequential exposure to different alkylating agents used in dose-intensive chemotherapy protocols.

https://openalex.org/W2059554650,"Laboratory studies show that the reaction of short-lived O2(B3Sigmau) molecules (lifetime approximately 10 picoseconds) with N2 and the photodissociation of the N2:O2 dimer produce NOx in the stratosphere at a rate comparable to the oxidation of N2O by O(1D). This finding implies the existence of unidentified NOX sinks in the stratosphere. The NO2 observed in this experiment is isotopically heavy with a large 15N/14N enhancement. However, photodissociation of this NO2 unexpectedly produced NO molecules with a low 15N/14N ratio. The diurnal odd-nitrogen cycle in the stratosphere will be marked by a complex isotope signature that will be imprinted on the halogen and HOX catalytic cycles."

The factor X-derived peptides G366YDTKQED373(G) (peptide 1), I422DRSMKTRG430 (peptide 2), and (G)L238YQAKRFKV246(G) (peptide 16, residues in parentheses added to the natural sequence) were previously characterized for their ability to inhibit 125I-factor X binding to CD11b/CD18 on chemoattractant-stimulated monocytes or PMN (17Altieri D.C.

Keck protein chemistry facility at Yale University, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized for amino acid composition by mass spectrometry. The factor X peptide (G)L73EGFEGKN80(G) (peptide 25) was used as a control. 2 mg of peptide 16 were iodinated with 5 mCi of Na125I by the IODO-GEN method for 45 min at 4 °C, followed by separation of free from peptide-bound radioactivity by gel filtration over a Bio-Gel P-2 column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.2. Anti-CD18 mAbs 60.3 and IB4 were obtained from ATCC. Nonbinding mAb 14E11 was used as a negative control.

The effect of the various factor X peptides on monocyte procoagulant activity was determined by a one-stage sensitive clotting assay using a factor VII- and factor X-deficient plasma (Sigma) as described (17Altieri D.C.

Duplicate wells were washed in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, post-coated with 10 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) for 90 min at 37 °C, rinsed, and mixed with increasing concentrations of 125I-peptide 16 (8–62.5 μg/ml) in PBS, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm CaCl2and 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 22 °C. At the end of the incubation, wells were washed twice in PBS, pH 7.2, amputated, and counted in a γ counter. Specific binding was calculated in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled peptide 16 or control peptide 25 added at the start of the incubation. Alternatively, increasing concentrations of 125I-fibrinogen (10–150 μg/ml) were incubated with CD11b I domain-coated wells in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 22 °C, before determination of specific binding. For all experiments, nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled fibrinogen and subtracted from the total to calculate net specific binding. In peptide inhibition experiments, CD11b I domain-coated plates were preincubated with increasing concentrations (0.1–1000 μg/ml) of fibrinogen-derived P1 peptide KYG190WTVFQKRLDGSV202 (18Altieri D.C.

Wells were mixed with 125I-fibrinogen (25 μg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 22 °C, before determination of specific binding. In another series of experiments, serum-free THP-1 cells (1.5 × 107/ml) were stimulated with 10 μm fMLP in the presence of increasing concentrations of 125I-factor X and 2.5 mm CaCl2 and a single concentration of control peptide or the three factor X inhibitory peptides (17Altieri D.C.

After a 20-min incubation at 22 °C, free and cell surface-bound radioactivity was separated by centrifugation through a mixture of silicone oil (Dow-Corning, New Bedford, MA) at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 22 °C, and specific binding was determined as described above. Binding data were analyzed by the Lineweaver-Burke plot as described (16Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7007-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serum-free suspensions of THP-1 or MLT cells (5 × 106/ml) were labeled with 0.5 mCi of 51Cr (Na2CrO4, du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, DE) for 2 h at 37 °C with a final incorporation of 0.7–2.1 cpm/cell, washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640. MLT or 10 μmfMLP-stimulated THP-1 cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations (60–1000 μg/ml) of factor X peptide 1, 2, or 16 or control peptide 25. After a 30-min incubation at 22 °C,51Cr-labeled cells (1 × 105) were added to resting or cytokine-activated (100 units/ml TNFα for 4 h at 37 °C) HUVEC monolayers for 1 h at 22 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. After washes, attached cells were solubilized in 15% SDS, and radioactivity associated under the various conditions was determined in a scintillation β-counter. The number of attached cells was calculated by dividing the cpm harvested by the cpm/cell. In other experiments, 51Cr-labeled THP-1 cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of factor X peptides (10–1000 μg/ml) or 25 μg/ml anti CD18 mAbs 60.3 and IB4 or control mAb 14E11. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, control or anti-CD18-treated cells were added to confluent monolayers of ICAM-1 transfectants or wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells, with determination of cell adhesion after a 1-h incubation at 22 °C. For transendothelial cell migration, HUVEC were grown to confluency onto gelatin-coated porous transwell membranes (8-μm diameter; Costar, Cambridge, MA) and stimulated with 100 units/ml TNFα for 4 h at 37 °C prior to the experiment. PMN (1 × 107/ml) were preincubated with 500 μg/ml factor X peptide 16 or control peptide 25 for 30 min at 22 °C, stimulated with 10 μmfMLP in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, and added (1 × 106) to HUVEC for increasing time intervals (30–120 min) at 37 °C. At the end of each incubation, migrated PMN were recovered from the bottom well, washed, stained with 0.2% trypan blue, and counted microscopically. Before each experiment, the integrity of the endothelial cell monolayer was confirmed by methyl green staining and fluorescence microscopy. Previous data suggested that binding of factor X to CD11b/CD18-expressing monocytes is mediated by three spatially distant sites in the ligand catalytic domain (17Altieri D.C. Etingin O.R. Fair D.S.

Preincubation of THP-1 cells with a saturating concentration of each of the three implicated sequences inhibited factor X-dependent monocyte procoagulant activity by 60–70% in a time-dependent reaction (not shown) and in agreement with previous observations (17Altieri D.C.

In contrast, the factor X peptides G366YDTKQED373(G) (peptide 1) or I422DRSMKTRG430 (peptide 2), which have been demonstrated (17Altieri D.C. Etingin O.R. Fair D.S. Brunck T.K. Geltosky J.E.

At variance with the effect on monocytic cell adhesion, none of the factor X peptides, including peptide 16, decreased attachment of CD11b/CD18− T cells (MLT) to TNFα-activated endothelium under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of monocytic cell adhesion to HUVEC by the factor X peptide (G)LYQAKRFKV(G) was specific and dose-dependent (Fig.2 A), whereas control peptide 25 was ineffective (Fig. 2 A). In other experiments, the factor X peptide 16 specifically inhibited fMLP-stimulated PMN transendothelial cell migration at all time intervals tested (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Effect of factor X peptide (G)LYQAKRFKV(G) on leukocyte-endothelial interaction and transendothelial cell migration.

After washes, cells were solubilized and counted. Data are the means ± S.D. of two independent experiments.

Increasing concentrations of peptide 16 blocked the adhesion of fMLP-stimulated THP-1 cells to monolayers of ICAM-1 transfectants in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of ∼50 μg/ml (Fig.3 A). A comparable degree of inhibition was observed in control experiments after THP-1 cell preincubation with anti-CD18 mAbs IB4 and 60.3 but not with control mAb 14E11 (Fig. 3 B). In direct binding studies,125I-peptide 16 bound to immobilized recombinant CD11b I domain in a specific and concentration-dependent reaction was competitively inhibited by >90% by a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled peptide 16 but not by control peptide 25 (Fig.4). The effect of factor X sequence (G)LYQAKRFKV(G) on CD11b I domain recognition of fibrinogen was also investigated (11Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-fibrinogen to isolated recombinant I domain was specific and saturable, in agreement with previous observations (11Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, increasing inhibitory concentrations of peptide 16 or control factor X peptide 25 failed to reduce 125I-fibrinogen binding to isolated CD11b I domain (Fig. 5). In contrast, increasing concentrations of fibrinogen-derived P1 peptide (γGly190–Val202) inhibited binding of125I-fibrinogen to isolated I domain in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of ∼4–6 μm (Fig. 5), in agreement with previous observations (18Altieri D.C.

All three factor X peptides (G)LYQAKRFKV(G) (peptide 16), GYDTKQED(G) (peptide 1), and (G)DRSMKTRG (peptide 2) inhibited binding of125I-factor X to fMLP-stimulated THP-1 cells equally well in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown) and in agreement with previous observations (17Altieri D.C. Etingin O.R. Fair D.S. Brunck T.K. Geltosky J.E. Hajjar D.P. Edgington T. Science. 1991; 254: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, analysis of binding data by the Lineweaver-Burke plot revealed that only the factor X sequence (G)DRSMKTRG inhibited ligand binding in a genuine competitive manner, as judged by the nearly identical y′ intercept values determined in the presence (y = 4.8) or in the absence (y = 4.32) of antagonist (Fig.6). In contrast, the factor X sequences GYDTKQEDG and (G)LYQAKRFKV(G) inhibited factor X binding to CD11b/CD18 in noncompetitive manner, with 4–5-fold differences in the predictedy intercept values in control curves (y = 4.32) or in the presence (y = 21.7; Ref. 18Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of these inhibitors (Fig. 6). In this study, we have shown that a factor X sequence, (G)L238YQAKRFKV246(G), exerted a dual anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effect by blocking monocyte procoagulant activity and inhibiting leukocyte-endothelium interaction. This pathway involved peptide engagement of a discrete ICAM-1-binding site on CD11b I domain with indirect disruption of a distant factor X-binding region in the holoreceptor. Through its promiscuous ligand repertoire (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar), CD11b/CD18 mediates a variety of cell adhesive interactions and functions as a procoagulant receptor via its high affinity recognition of factor X (9Altieri D.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that this interaction may also participate in leukocyte adhesion mechanisms has been postulated. Previously, interruption of CD11b/CD18-dependent coagulation prevented thrombin-dependent chemotaxis (21Grandaliano G. Valente A.J. Abboud H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and monocyte adhesion (22Sugama Y. Tiruppathi C. Janakidevi K. Andersen T.T. Fenton II, J.W. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Shankar R. de la Motte C.A. Poptic E.J. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13936-13941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to virally infected endothelium (17Altieri D.C. Etingin O.R. Fair D.S. Brunck T.K. Geltosky J.E. Hajjar D.P. Edgington T. Science. 1991; 254: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, an adhesive determinant of Bordetella pertussis, filamentous hemagglutinin, was recently shown to contain sequences homologous to the three factor X regions inhibiting ligand binding to CD11b/CD18 (20Rozdzinski E. Sandros J. van der Flier M. Young A. Spellerberg B. Bhattacharyya C. Straub J. Musso G. Putney S. Starzyk R. Tuomanen E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptidyl mimicry of these regions produced a potent anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory effect by blocking leukocyte-endothelium interaction in vitro and reducing neutrophil accumulation in the colony-stimulating factor in an in vivo model of bacterial meningitis (20Rozdzinski E. Sandros J. van der Flier M. Young A. Spellerberg B. Bhattacharyya C. Straub J. Musso G. Putney S. Starzyk R. Tuomanen E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of this anti-inflammatory pathway was not elucidated. Here, at variance with the anti-adhesive functions of all three factor X homologous sequences (20Rozdzinski E. Sandros J. van der Flier M. Young A. Spellerberg B. Bhattacharyya C. Straub J. Musso G. Putney S. Starzyk R. Tuomanen E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a single factor X peptide (G)L238YQAKRFKV246(G) (peptide 16) acted as a potent antagonist of leukocyte-endothelium interaction and transendothelial cell migration. Three independent lines of evidence indicate that this anti-adhesive effect resulted from peptide engagement of an ICAM-1-binding site on CD11b I domain (10Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 11Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25866-25871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). First, this peptide had no effect on CD11b/CD18− T cell (MLT) adhesion to endothelium. Second, binding of monocyte THP-1 cells to monolayers of ICAM-1 transfectants was equally well inhibited by factor X peptide 16 or by anti-CD18 mAbs. Thirdly, direct radiolabeled peptide binding studies demonstrated that this sequence physically interacted with CD11b I domain. The use of a small synthetic peptide, like peptide 16, to probe the CD11b/CD18 ligand repertoire allowed delineating a more precise functional map of CD11b I domain. Consistent with the differential pattern of inhibition obtained with I domain epitope-mapped mAbs (10Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the ability of this peptide to disrupt an ICAM-1-binding site without affecting the recognition of fibrinogen postulates the existence of physically separate subdomains mediating a nonoverlapping recognition of these two ligands. This is at variance with previous studies of site-directed mutagenesis, in which single amino acid changes in the CD11b metal ion-dependent adhesion site (15Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) suppressed the receptor recognition of fibrinogen, ICAM-1, and C3bi (12Kamata T. Wright R. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12531-12535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the ability of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site to transduce conformational effects in spatially distant ligand-binding sites (see below) without affecting subunit assembly or receptor surface expression. A potential model of how perturbation of a discrete I domain region,i.e. ICAM-1 site, could indirectly modulate ligand binding to the holoreceptor was provided by dissecting the factor X interaction with CD11b/CD1. Although three spatially distant sites in factor X indistinguishably blocked ligand binding and monocyte procoagulant activity (17Altieri D.C. Etingin O.R. Fair D.S. Brunck T.K. Geltosky J.E. Hajjar D.P. Edgington T. Science. 1991; 254: 1200-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), only one of these regions, I422DRSMKTRG430, was a genuine competitive inhibitor of this interaction. The other two factor X peptides, including peptide 16, were noncompetitive antagonists, thus potentially disrupting a secondary docking during receptor-ligand interaction. This suggests that binding of the anti-adhesive sequence (G)LYQAKRFKV(G) to an ICAM-1 recognition site on CD11b I domain may induce a conformational change in the holoreceptor with disruption of a distant factor X-binding pocket. Consistent with this hypothesis,125I-factor X did not specifically associate with recombinant isolated CD11b I domain (11Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the present studies, the intact macromolecule did not affect leukocyte-endothelium interaction. 2M. Mesri, J. Plescia, and D. C. Altieri, unpublished observations. Altogether, these data suggest a more dynamic role of β2 integrin I domains, not only in providing physical interacting site(s) for ligand recognition, but also in regulating the state of receptor activation (24Landis R.C. Bennet R.I. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and ligand binding affinity (25Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In summary, these data underscore the role of the CD11b I domain in multiple regulation of ligand binding and identify a factor X sequence that, similarly to its prokaryotic homologue (20Rozdzinski E. Sandros J. van der Flier M. Young A. Spellerberg B. Bhattacharyya C. Straub J. Musso G. Putney S. Starzyk R. Tuomanen E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), displayed potent anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. The availability of a small and high affinity probe like peptide 16 should facilitate the identification of the complementary ICAM-1-binding site on CD11b and define its role in leukocyte traffic and recirculation (4Carlos T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2113578709,"We characterized the in vitro fusion of endosomal compartments from Dictyostelium discoideum. Fusion activity was restricted to early compartments, was dependent on cytosolic proteins, and was activated by GTP and guanosine 5′-O(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). This stimulation suggests the involvement of a small G protein, which we propose to be Rab7 on the basis of the strong inhibitory effect of anti-Rab7 antibodies. It is noteworthy that in the presence of GTPγS, the concentration of ATP-Mg2+ could be reduced to less than 1 nm without loss of fusion activity. Under these conditions, competing residual ATP with adenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-Mg2+ also failed to inhibit endosome fusion. The presence of an ATP-depleting system alone blocked fusion probably because endogenous GTP was removed by coupling through NDP kinase. Moreover, whether ATP was present or not, GTPγS-activated fusion was equally sensitive to anti-Rab7 antibodies or N-ethylmaleimide and was restricted to early compartments. These results show that soluble ATP-Mg2+ is not needed for endosome fusion. Since homotypic fusion of endosomes inD. discoideum has been shown to depend on the ATPaseN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (Lenhard, J. M., Mayorga, L., and Stahl, P. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem.267, 1896–1903), the nucleotide exchange on theN-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor must take place before GTPγS activation in this system.

Endocytosis is the process by which eukaryotic cells internalize, sort, and digest extracellular molecules (pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis) or particles (phagocytosis). In wild-type Dictyostelium discoideum, living on soil bacteria, phagocytosis is very active, but fluid phase uptake is almost undetectable. In contrast, axenic mutant cell lines such as Ax-2 exhibit intense pinocytosis in parallel with normal phagocytic behavior. Pinocytosis in D. discoideum Ax-2 strain should therefore be considered as a deregulated phagocytosis, whose defect is as yet unknown. Although initial findings argued in favor of clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated internalization (1O'Halloran T.J. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it has recently been shown that most of the fluid ingested by Ax-2 is contained in intracellular structures similar to phagosomes (2Hacker U. Albrecht R. Maniak M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, D. discoideum is a very attractive organism to study the intracellular fate of phagosomes, because of the ease of biochemical experiments, the existence of a whole series of endocytosis mutants, and the possibility of genetic engineering. In mammalian cells, phagosomes become acidic and progressively acquire hydrolytic enzymes from primary lysosomes to eventually constitute phagolysosomes (3Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In D. discoideum, the internalized material similarly passes into an acidic, hydrolase-rich compartment, but, contrary to mammalian lysosomes (which can retain the ingested material for expanded time periods (4Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 482-525Crossref Scopus (1235) Google Scholar)), undigested material transits through a less acidic postlysosomal compartment before egestion (5Aubry L. Klein G. Martiel J.L. Satre M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 861-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Padh H. Ha J. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6742-6747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An understanding of how the material is carried along these successive compartments could be brought about by the in vitro study of the different steps of the phagocytic pathway and by the identification of the proteins responsible for membrane recognition and fusion. Of central importance in this respect has been the discovery by Rothman and co-workers of the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). 1The abbreviations used are: NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; b-HRP, biotinylated horseradish peroxidase; GDPβS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thio)-diphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-(3-thio)-triphosphate; A-485, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. First isolated on the basis of its capability to restore intra-Golgi transport after treatment by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), this ATPase has now been shown to participate in almost all intracellular vesicle fusion events (7Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In its ATP-bound form, NSF binds to membranes via soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) and acts upon a complex made by integral membrane proteins specific for the donor and acceptor compartments called v- and t-SNAREs (SNAPreceptors). It is currently proposed that hydrolysis of ATP by NSF drives the rearrangement of SNAREs, which actually permits membrane fusion and the dissociation of the SNARE complex (8Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). The binding of ATP by NSF is therefore a prerequisite of membrane fusion. The small GTP-binding proteins of the Rab subfamily also play a crucial role in the fusion process. The most widely held model states that for each intracellular membrane fusion event, activation of a specific Rab protein is needed (9Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that Rab proteins regulate the rate of formation of the SNARE complexes (10Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2875-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab 9 are known to be involved in the endocytic pathway and regulate the shuttling of recycling vesicles, early endosome fusion, early endosome to lysosome transport, and lysosome to Golgi transit (13Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In D. discoideum, only Rab7 and to a lesser extent Rab4 have been shown to be present in the endocytic pathway (14Temesvari L. Rodriguez-Paris J. Bush J. Steck T.L. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25719-25727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Adessi C. Chapel A. Vincon M. Rabilloud T. Klein G. Satre M. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like mammalian endosomes, D. discoideum endosomes are able to fuse in vitro, reproducing two characteristic features of mammalian endosome fusion, namely sensitivity to GTPγS and inhibition by NEM (16Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of mammalian NSF could reverse this inhibition, which showed that the general fusion machinery described above is conserved in the D. discoideum endocytic pathway. In this study, we established an in vitro fusion assay using partially purified D. discoideum endocytic vesicles and cytosol and determined the nucleotide requirements of early endosome fusion. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), avidin, GTP, GDP, GDPβS, GTPγS, ATP, ATPγS, creatine phosphate, and creatine phosphate kinase were from Boehringer Mannheim. 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (A-485) was from Molecular Probes. Other biochemical reagents and chemicals were from Sigma and Prolabo. Biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (b-HRP) was synthesized by coupling biotinamidocaproateN-hydroxysuccinimide ester to HRP (17Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The substitution level was six biotins for one HRP. D. discoideum strain Ax-2 was grown at 21 °C in shaken suspensions (175 rpm) in axenic medium (18Watts D. Ashworth J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Amoebas (5 × 106 to 1.2 × 107cells·ml−1) were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunostaining. Rab7 was detected by purified polyclonal anti-Rab7 antibodies described in this study and HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad), revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Corp.) on Kodak X-Omat AR films. Unless specified, all experiments were performed on ice. All data are representative of at least two independent experiments. Avidin- or b-HRP-loaded endosomes were prepared in parallel from the same batch of cells. Amoebas (1 × 108 cells·ml−1) were incubated for 5 min at 21 °C in axenic medium containing either b-HRP or avidin (1 mg·ml−1). Internalization of the markers was stopped by the addition of 5 volumes of ice-cold washing buffer (200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA-KOH, 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). Cells were washed twice in washing buffer and resuspended in breaking buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, and 5 μg·ml−1pepstatin in washing buffer) at 3·108cells·ml−1. After breaking by six strokes in a ball bearing cell cracker (19Balch W. Rothman J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). When fusion between whole endocytic compartments was assayed, PNSs at this stage were used. To prepare early endosomes, 3 ml of PNS was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient formed by layering 1 ml of 54%, 4 ml of 40%, and 4 ml of 30% sucrose (w/w) in breaking buffer. After centrifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), the early endosomes were collected at the 30–40% interface of the gradient, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. 1010 cells were harvested and broken as described above except that the breaking buffer was supplemented with 500 mm KCl to extract peripheral membrane-bound proteins. The resulting PNS was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g (1 h, 4 °C) to remove the membrane components. The supernatant was filtrated through a gauze, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 70% saturation. After 1 h at 4 °C, the precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold cytosol buffer (10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA-KOH, 1 mm DTT, 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). The cytosol was dialyzed twice against cytosol buffer, cleared by centrifugation (400,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and stored at −80 °C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Labsystem) were coated for 3 h at 37 °C with 3 μg/well of monoclonal anti-avidin WC19.10 antibodies (Sigma) in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.0. The plates were washed with PBS-Tween (150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and blocked with 300 μl/well of 0.1 mg·ml−1 bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween for 1 h at 37 °C. The processed plates were washed again and used within 2 h. Fusions between purified endosomes were conducted in 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA-KOH, 200 mmsucrose, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Avidin and b-HRP-loaded D. discoideum endosomes (5 μl each) were mixed in a 50-μl total volume with biotinylated insulin (0.1 mg·ml−1), an ATP-regenerating (200 μmATP-Mg2+, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 85 units·ml−1 creatine phosphate kinase, pH 7.4) or ATP-depleting (10 mm glucose, 2.2 units·ml−1hexokinase or 10 units·ml−1 apyrase) system, andD. discoideum cytosol (10 μl). Except where otherwise stated, the final concentration of cytosolic or membrane-bound proteins was 0.8 mg·ml−1 or 0.4–0.8 mg·ml−1, respectively, and the ATP-depleting system consisted of hexokinase and glucose. Fusions between whole endosomal compartments contained in PNS were conducted in the same way except that 40 μl of both b-HRP- and avidin-loaded D. discoideum PNS were mixed in a total reaction volume of 120 μl, KCl was omitted, and MgCl2 was raised to 3 mm. After 60 min of incubation at 21 °C, the assay was stopped by the addition of one volume of ice-cold 2% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The samples were then loaded into the wells of an anti-avidin-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. The b-HRP-avidin complexes were allowed to bind for 2 h at 21 °C or overnight at 4 °C, and the wells were washed twice in PBS-Tween. To measure the amount of immobilized b-HRP, 100 μl of HRP substrate (0.1 mg·ml−1 tetramethylbenzidine, 0.6% H2O2, in 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0) was added to each well. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and the optical density was measured at 450 nm. Fusion efficiency was defined as the ratio of the amount of b-HRP immobilized in the fusion assay to the amount of potentially immobilizable b-HRP, obtained in a separate reaction where biotinylated insulin was omitted. After 2 min of incubation at 21 °C, a portion of an endosome fusion assay was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C), and free ATP in the supernatant was separated from protein-bound ATP by ultrafiltration on a 10-kDa cut-off Ultrafree Millipore filter. The ATP concentration in the filtrate was directly assayed with an LKB 1250 luminometer using a luciferase-luciferine assay (Sigma). D. discoideum rab7 was amplified from a vegetative cell library (kindly given by Dr. Herb Ennis, New York) using Taq DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide primers were designed to contain a BamHI site on the 5′-end. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), introduced into the pQE-9 expression vector (Qiagen), and transformed in Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells (Stratagene). The pQE9-rab7 plasmid was checked by sequencing and used for protein expression. E. coli cells expressing His6 Rab7 were grown at 37 °C to a cell density of A 600 = 0.8 in LB medium containing 200 μg·ml−1 ampicillin and 12.5 μg·ml−1 tetracycline and induced for 4 h at 37 °C with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and disrupted by a French press. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (9000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (250,000 × g, 1 h) and loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. The column was washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer, followed by 10 ml of 50 mm imidazole, 120 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0. His6-Rab7 was eluted with 10 ml of 250 mm imidazole, 120 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0. The His6-Rab7-containing fractions (95% purity) were mixed (1:1) with 70% glycerol, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stored at −20 °C until use. His6-Rab7 proteins were then desalted into PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2through a small gel filtration column (Hitrap, Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). To raise antibodies against Rab7, two peptides from the effector (amino acids 37–51) and the C-terminal hypervariable domains (amino acids 176–191) were coupled to rabbit serum albumin and coinjected in rabbits (Elevage Scientifique des Dombes, Romans, France). An affinity column was prepared by coupling the above peptides to glutaraldehyde-activated Affi-Gel 102 beads (Bio-Rad) and used to purify anti-Rab7 antibodies from rabbit serum as described in Ref. 20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. The antibody fractions eluted in acidic or alkaline conditions were immediately neutralized, dialyzed twice against PBS, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon, Amicon), and stored at 4 °C. Both pools of anti-Rab7 antibodies inhibited the endosome fusion assay equally. An in vitro assay for homotypic fusions between fluid phase loaded D. discoideum endocytic compartments was derived from the one based on the formation of a complex between b-HRP and avidin described for mammalian cells (17Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, the uptake rate, intracellular transit time, and exit rate of b-HRP and avidin were found similar to those of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, a fluid phase marker in D. discoideum (21Klein G. Satre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In various mammalian cells like macrophages and hepatocytes, HRP has been shown to enter the cells by a mannose receptor pathway, characterized by saturation of the uptake rate at low HRP concentrations (0.02 mg·ml−1) (22Yamaguchi Y. Dalle-Molle E. Hardison W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G880-G885PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HRP uptake by D. discoideum did not exhibit any saturation from 0.05 mg·ml−1 up to the maximum concentration tested of 5 mg·ml−1. Avidin uptake was also linear with concentration in the same range. It is therefore likely that these markers are internalized in the fluid phase and not bound to a receptor. This validates the use of b-HRP and avidin as fluid phase markers in D. discoideum. Avidin and b-HRP were internalized by D. discoideum cells for 5 min and chased for various times. PNS were prepared, and those having the same chase time were combined in a fusion assay. All PNS preparations contained the same amount of internalized markers; however, the efficiency of the fusion reaction decreased exponentially with chase duration (t ½ = 5 min, Fig.1 A). Furthermore, markers contained in PNS with 0-min chase time were unable to fuse with markers contained in PNS with 15-min chase time (data not shown), which shows that only homotypic and no heterotypic fusion of early endocytic compartments occurs in D. discoideum. To separate the fusogenic endosomes from other membranes and from the cytosol, a PNS preparation from D. discoideum cells loaded with b-HRP for 5 min was fractionated by centrifugation through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Cytosolic components were retained on the upper 3 ml of the gradient, as indicated by the high protein concentration, whereas the dense lysosomes, assessed by the presence of cathepsin B, acid phosphatase, α-mannosidase, and β-glucosidase activities, sedimented to the bottom 40–54% sucrose interface. Most of the alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of the plasma membrane and the contractile vacuolar system in D. discoideum, was present at the 8–30% interface, as expected (23Nolta K.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little HRP activity was found at the top of the gradient, indicating that most of the endosomal compartments remained sealed during the purification procedure. Half of the HRP activity was recovered at the 30–40% interface, and half sedimented to the 40–54% interface (Fig.2). When fluid phase markers were chased for 15 min, the whole HRP activity was found in a single peak at the 40–54% interface, which indicated that the light compartments were occupied before the dense ones by the markers and that the transit time from the lighter to the denser compartment was less than 15 min. Identical results were obtained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran as a fluid phase marker. After a 5-min pulse, when endocytic compartments recovered at each of the interfaces were tested for homotypic fusion activity, only the low density endosome fraction present at the 30–40% interface was active. Fusion efficiency was comparable with that obtained with PNS. The high density endocytic compartments present at the 40–50% interface were never found to be self-fusogenic, regardless of the cytosol concentration and the presence or absence of guanine and adenine nucleotides (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the endocytic compartments recovered at the 30–40% interface and at the 40–54% interface, despite containing similar amounts of fluid phase markers, never showed heterotypic fusion activity (Fig. 1 B). These results are most simply interpreted by the existence of two compartments, with the internalized fluid passing from one compartment (light and self-fusogenic) into another compartment (denser and nonfusogenic). The dense, lysosomal enzyme-rich compartment found at the 40–54% interface corresponds to the “lysosomes” (14Temesvari L. Rodriguez-Paris J. Bush J. Steck T.L. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25719-25727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with mammalian endocytosis, the newly described light fusogenic compartment present at the 30–40% interface will hereafter be designated as “early endosomes.” Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins are well known to regulate endosomal membrane fusion (24Colombo M.I. Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To test whether in vitro fusion of D. discoideum early endosomes was also regulated by GTP-binding proteins, the effects of GDP, GDPβS, GTP, or GTPγS were tested (Fig. 3 A). The three nucleotides GTP (K 50 = 10 μm), GTPγS (K 50 = 5 μm), and GDP (K 50 = 5 μm) all activated fusion, 3-fold for GTPγS and 2-fold for GTP and GDP, while GDPβS was slightly inhibitory. The activating effect of GDP, but not GDPβS, can be explained by the presence in the cytosol of a strong NDP kinase activity (25Lacombe M.L. Wallet V. Troll H. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10012-10018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) catalyzing the regeneration of GTP from GDP and ATP but unable to catalyze the transphosphorylation of GDPβS. In mammalian cells, endosome fusion exhibits a complex response to GTPγS, which activates fusion at low cytosol concentrations and inhibits fusion at higher ones (26Colombo M.I. Mayorga L.S. Casey P.J. Stahl P.D. Science. 1992; 255: 1695-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been reported that GTPγS stimulates the fusion of pelleted D. discoideumendosomes in the absence of added cytosol and gradually inhibits fusion as the cytosol concentration is raised (16Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1896-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, partially purified endosomes exhibit a clear requirement for soluble proteins (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the relative effect of the various guanine nucleotides tested above is conserved over a large range of cytosol concentrations (Fig. 4). This shows that at the cytosol concentration used within this study (0.8 mg·ml−1), the stimulatory effect of GTPγS predominates, since the onset of GTPγS inhibition starts only at cytosol concentrations higher than 2 mg·ml−1 (Fig.4). In D. discoideum, the small G-protein Rab7 is associated with the endocytic pathway (27Bush J. Cardelli J. Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). The distribution of Rab7 along the endocytic pathway was examined on magnetically purified iron-dextran-fed endocytic compartments, prepared under different pulse/chase conditions: early compartments (Fig.5 A, lane 1), lysosomes (lane 2), and postlysosomes (lane 3). Much less Rab7 was found per μg of loaded protein material on postlysosomes than on lysosomes or early compartments. Rab7 is therefore enriched on early compartments and lysosomes as compared with postlysosomes. To test whether Rab7 could mediate the activating effect of GTP and GTPγS on early endosome fusion, we used affinity-purified anti-Rab7 antibodies that recognize a 23-kDa band in Western blots of whole cell extracts or endosomal membranes. This protein was identified by microsequencing to be Rab7 (15Adessi C. Chapel A. Vincon M. Rabilloud T. Klein G. Satre M. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of these antibodies to the endosome fusion assay resulted in more than 70% inhibition (Fig.5 B), with a K 50 of 30 nm. The inhibitory effect of the antibodies was reversed by the addition of a 3-fold excess of purified recombinant His6-Rab7 (Fig.5 B). Another abundant protein at the surface of endocytic compartments in D. discoideum is the vacuolar ATPase (14Temesvari L. Rodriguez-Paris J. Bush J. Steck T.L. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25719-25727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Adessi C. Chapel A. Vincon M. Rabilloud T. Klein G. Satre M. Garin J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No inhibition was observed when similar amounts (100 nm) of purified monoclonal antibodies raised against the C subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (kindly given by Dr. G. Gerisch) were added to the fusion assay (data not shown). This rules out a steric effect of antibodies binding to the endosomes being the cause of this inhibition. These data strongly indicate that Rab7 activates endosome fusion in D. discoideum. In the absence of added guanine nucleotides, the level of homotypic fusions between partially purified early endosomes was reduced to less than 10% when an ATP-depleting system was substituted to the ATP-regenerating system. However, the addition of GTPγS restored fusion activity to the maximum level obtained in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3 B). When GTP replaced GTPγS, very little stimulation was observed. This was due to the conversion of GTP into GDP by the NDP kinase activity coupled to the ATP depletion system. The same explanation holds true for endogenous GTP. Free ATP in the endosome fusion assays was separated by ultrafiltration and quantified (see “Experimental Procedures”). The residual ATP concentration was 0.6 ± 0.4 nm or 0.05 ± 0.04 nm with an ATP-depleting system consisting of hexokinase and glucose or apyrase, respectively, and was unaffected by the presence of GTPγS. Furthermore, ATP-depletion was very fast, dropping to the described levels in less than 2 min, while endosome fusion continued steadily over 30 min. Therefore, it can be concluded that more than 90% of the observed fusions occurred in the presence of less than 1 nm free ATP-Mg2+. To rule out the possibility that an ATP requirement for fusion was in fact being substituted by GTP contaminating the commercial GTPγS preparations, we examined the effect of ATPγS on the fusion activity measured in the presence of an ATP-depleting system and GTPγS. Although the low ATP concentration favored the competition of ATPγS versus ATP even more, no inhibition was observed (Fig. 6). Moreover, in the presence of 100 μm GTP, ATPγS even activated endosome fusions up to the level of GTPγS. This might be due to the transfer of the thiophosphate from ATPγS to contaminant GDP by D. discoideum NDP kinase, a reaction already described in other cells (28Buczynski G. Potter R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Most in vitro reconstituted vesicular transport and membrane fusion systems that have been studied so far show no activity when the ATP concentration is reduced to the nanomolar level. Furthermore, endosome fusion in mammalian cells clearly requires ATP in addition to Rab protein activation (29Barbieri M.A. Li G. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore checked that the absence of ATP did not change (i) the specificity of D. discoideum endosome fusion for early compartments, (ii) their sensitivity to anti-Rab7 antibodies, and (iii) their inhibition by the NEM analogue A-485. As shown in Fig.7, D. discoideum endosome fusion conducted in the absence of ATP resembles the fusions conducted in the presence of ATP with respect to all of the above criteria. We finally tested whether NSF requirements could be fulfilled before Rab7"
https://openalex.org/W2071012300,"The kinetics of nucleotide binding to the uncoupling protein (UCP) from brown adipose tissue mitochondria were studied with a filter binding method. Fast and slow phases of binding were observed, corresponding to the two-stage binding model based on equilibrium binding studies (Huang, S. G., and Klingenberg, M. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 7846–7854) (Reaction 1). U+NKd⇌fastUNk+1⇌k−1slowU*NReaction 1 Although this method determines total binding, only the slow phase can be resolved. The fast unresolved phase represents the formation of the initial loose UCP-nucleotide complex (UN;K d ≈ 2 μm), whereas the slow phase reflects the tight binding (U*N) associated with a conformational change induced by the bound nucleotide. Best fits of the binding data yielded, for the slow phase, k +1 values of 3.0 × 10−3 s−1 for GTP, 4.8 × 10−3 s−1 for ATP, 0.13 s−1 for GDP, and >0.7 s−1 for ADP and dissociation rate constants (k −1) of 0.10 × 10−3s−1 for GTP, 0.58 × 10−3s−1 for ATP, 8.8 × 10−3s−1 for GDP, and >0.3 s−1 for ADP at pH 6.7 and 4 °C. The rates were fairly pH- and temperature-dependent. The distribution constantK c ′ (=k +1/k −1) between the tight and loose complexes ranged between 2 and 30, suggesting formation of 71–97% of the tight complex at equilibrium. TheK c ′ decreases with increasing pH, indicating a progressively less tight complex population. Anions (SO42−) form a loose complex with UCP, thus affecting the initial association step, but not the subsequent transition step. While the kinetic constants were verified by dilution and chase experiments as well as in mass action plots, they were further corroborated with data obtained by fluorescence competition measurements. Taken together, our results show that nucleotide binding to UCP occurs via a two-stage mechanism in which the initial loose complex rearranges slowly into a tight complex.

Wagonwood R.J. Kemp A. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). By facilitating the transport of H+ into the mitochondrial matrix, UCP dissipates the electrochemical energy into heat, a function that has been related to the non-shivering thermogenesis of this specialized tissue (3Smith R.E. Horwitz B.A. Physiol. Rev. 1969; 49: 330-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 4Hims-Hagen J. Annu. Rev.

The uncoupling effect is regulated by long-chain fatty acids as activators and by purine nucleoside di- and triphosphates as inhibitors (reviewed in Refs. 6Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar and 7Klingenberg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that nucleotide binding to UCP exhibits a strong pH dependence (5Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 9Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The pH dependence has been attributed to the interplay of H+-dissociating groups of both the protein and nucleotide. It was suggested that deprotonation of an acidic group (Asp/Glu) and of a putative His abolishes electrostatic interactions between the protein and nucleotide, whereas deprotonation at the terminal phosphate of the nucleotide enhances its electrostatic interaction with the protein (9Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements with fluorescent dansylated nucleotides further show that protonation at Asp/Glu is a prerequisite for nucleotide binding, whereas nucleoside triphosphate binding requires formation of an additional positive charge (HisH+) at the binding cleft (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite such progress in equilibrium binding studies, a further understanding of the mechanism of nucleotide binding requires more insight into the binding kinetics. In this work, we have employed a filter binding method to evaluate the slow kinetics of nucleotide binding. With this method, the sum of tight and loose binding was measured. These data were complemented by kinetic measurements using specific fluorescent nucleotide probes. The results were analyzed in terms of a two-stage binding model derived previously (11Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and NEN Life Science Products. 2′-O-Dansylated nucleotides were synthesized as described (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Millipore Ultrafree-MC 30,000 NMWL filter unit was obtained from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Triton X-100 was from Sigma. UCP was isolated from a Triton X-100-soluble lysate of brown adipose tissue mitochondria according to the method of Lin and Klingenberg (2Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The isolated UCP migrated as a single Coomassie Blue band at 33 kDa on SDS gel. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nucleotide-binding sites were assessed by [14C]GTP binding with an anion-exchange method (13Klingenberg M. Herlt M. Winkler E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). UCP (∼300 μg/ml) and radiolabeled nucleotide (1.2–12 μm) were incubated in an Eppendorf cup for 0.5–180 min in a medium containing 12 mm Mops, 20 mmNa2SO4, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 6.7, and 4 °C or as otherwise stated. At different time intervals, 100 μl of the mixture was withdrawn, applied to the filter, and centrifuged immediately for 1 min at 4 °C. 10–20 μl of filtrate was then taken for scintillation counting. The binding data showed a biphasic time course of increase. The initial fast phase could not be resolved by this method, whereas the slow phase exhibited an exponential increase. In line with our previous results, we interpret the fast phase as formation of the initial loose UCP-nucleotide complex (UN) and the slow phase as formation of the tight complex (U*N). Utilizing our previous two-stage binding model (11Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a simplified reaction scheme is written as shown in Reaction 1 in the Summary. K d is an apparent dissociation constant in the presence of Na2SO4, which was normally included (8Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We assume that the rate-limiting step is the slow conformational change, and UN is formed so fast that a static equilibrium is maintained. Since the free nucleotide concentration was measured, the concentration of bound nucleotide, which is calculated as the concentration of total nucleotide minus the concentration of free nucleotide, represents the sum of the concentrations of both loose and tight complexes (UN + U*N). The rate of U*N formation is written as shown in Equation 1. d(U*N)dt=k+1(UN)−k−1(U*N)Equation 1 Thus, Equation 2 follows, (U*N)=Kc′(1−e−k−1t)(UN)≡a(UN)Equation 2 with K c ′ =k +1/k −1. Applying mass conservation, we have Equations 3 and 4. No=N+UN+U*N=N(1+U/Kd+aU/Kd)Equation 3 Uo=U+UN+U*N=U+U(1/Kd+a/Kd)NEquation 4 Thus, N = N o /(1 + U/K d +aU/K d). Substitution into Equation 4 and solving for U, we have Equations Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8. U=(No−Uo)2(1+a)2+2Kd(No+Uo)(1+a)+Kd2−(No−Uo)(1+a)−Kd2(1+a)Equation 5 UN=(Uo−U)/(1+a)Equation 6 U*N=a(Uo−U)/(1+a)Equation 7 UN+U*N=Uo−UEquation 8 For the mass action plot, the concentration of bound nucleotide is calculated as shown in Equation 9. Bound=(UN+U*N)=(Uo−U)Equation 9 The concentration of free nucleotide (N) is obtained from Equations 3 and 5. The x axis in the mass action plot (Bound/free) is thus calculated as shown in Equation 10. Bound/free=(UN+U*N)/[GTP]free=(Uo−U)(1+U/Kd+aU/Kd)/NoEquation 10 Least-square fitting was performed with the MicroCal Origin program (Version 2.75, MicroCal Software Inc.). Computation of the theoretical curves was achieved with a Turbo Pascal program (Version 6). Fluorescence was measured with a Perkin-Elmer MPF-44A fluorescence spectrophotometer (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 515 nm, respectively. The slits were set at 6 nm. The transition from a loose to a tight complex was slow and could be conveniently monitored by competition with fluorescent nucleotides. The transition rate constant (k +1) was measured by competition with dansyl-ADP in 20 mm Mes, pH 6.8, at 14.5 °C. Thus, a low concentration (2–4 μm) of nucleotide (ATP, ADP, GTP, or GDP) was added to 0.2 μmUCP presaturated (>95%) with 14 μm dansyl-ADP. Under such conditions, the rate of fluorescence decrease was limited by the rate of nucleotide binding sincek +1·[UCP][N o ] ≪k −1dansyl-ADP·[UCP − dansyl-ADP] −k +1dansyl-ADP·[UCP][D o ], where [N o ] and [D o ] are the concentrations of the competing nucleotide and dansyl-ADP, respectively. The dissociation was followed by competition with dansyl-GTP. For this purpose, UCP (0.2 μm) was first saturated (>95%) with 2–4 μm nucleotide. Then, a large excess of dansyl-GTP (20 μm) was added to displace the bound nucleotide. The observed fluorescence increase reflected the rate-limiting dissociation of the nucleotide from UCP since the kinetic limitation conditionsk +1dansyl-GTP·[dansyl-GTP] ≫k −1,k +1·[N o ] apply (14Birdsall B. Burgen A.S.V. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Eccleston J.F. Spectrophotometry & Spectrofluorimetry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1987: 137-164Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the time progress of nucleotide binding to isolated UCP. To obtain rates, a low concentration of GTP (1.2 μm) and 20 mmNa2SO4, which competes for GTP binding, were added (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In all measurements, binding data showed a biphasic fast and slow increase. The time required for half-maximal binding was ∼17 min (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, ATP binding was slow (Fig.1 C). However, the nucleoside diphosphates GDP (Fig.1 B) and ADP (Fig. 1 D) bound much faster. The measured points (Fig. 1) are best fitted (solid lines) according to the two-stage binding model. To estimate the dissociation constant (K d) for the initial loose complex, we made use of the value measured at 0.5 min. For example, the concentration of bound GTP measured at 0.5 min (the first point) was ∼0.11 μm, corresponding to a K d of 21 μm. The calculated K d values varied only between 12 and 28 μm from various measurements. Since these are rough estimates, we fixed K d at an average value of 14 μm and performed least-square fitting for the two parameters K c ′ andk −1 according to Equation 8. Meaningful fitting can be obtained for the slow binding process measured at 1.2 μm. Thus, for GTP binding (Fig. 1 A), the best fit revealed very slow transition rates and a ratio of tight to loose complex of 30:1 (Table I). GTP binding at 12 μm was much faster (Fig. 1 A,inset) and could be fitted only with uncertainty. Using the parameters obtained for [GTP] = 1.2 μm (Table I), the theoretical binding calculated for [GTP] = 12 μm fit the experimental data quite well. Using the same procedure, we extracted the kinetic parameters for GDP (Fig. 1 B) and ATP (Fig. 1 C). Since the transition was faster with ADP (Fig.1 D), only a meaningful distribution constant (K c ′) could be obtained, and lower limits were estimated for the transition rates. The overall dissociation constants (K D) calculated from the extracted parameters (TableI) are in full agreement with our previous data measured by equilibrium dialysis (8Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), on anion-exchange method (9Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and fluorescence titrations (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Table IKinetic parameters of slow-phase nucleotide binding to isolated UCPGTPGDP, pH 6.7ATP, pH 6.7ADP, pH 6.7pH 6.7pH 7.4pH 7.8k +1(×103 s−1)3.0 ± 1.01.5 ± 0.2>2.1130 ± 304.8 ± 0.4>700k −1 (×103 s−1)0.10 ± 0.030.53 ± 0.08>3.08.8 ± 2.20.58 ± 0.05>300K c ′30.2 ± 7.22.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.214.5 ± 1.28.2 ± 0.32.4K D (μm)0.453.78.20.901.524 Open table in a new tab At higher pH (Fig. 2 A), GTP binding appeared to be faster, but weaker with a drastic decrease in the tight complex population (Table I). We also compared GTP binding obtained at 4 and 14.5 °C to illustrate the strong temperature dependence (Fig. 2 A). A best fit for the data points at 14.5 °C required K c ′ = 25.3 andk −1 = 1.0 × 10−3s−1. The data suggest that temperature did not affect the tight/loose complex distribution (K c ′), but the transition rates at 14.5 °C were nearly 10-fold faster than at 4 °C. To further evaluate the time-dependent nucleotide binding, we studied the nucleotide concentration dependence. Fig.3 summarizes in mass action plots the GTP binding data measured after incubation for 3, 20, and 180 min. We calculated the concentrations of bound (UN + U*N) and free GTP according to Equation 9 using the parameters given in Table I. For pH 6.7 (Fig. 3 A), the calculated mass action plots (solid lines) are straight lines of varying slopes, withK D = 12.9, 3.8, and 1.0 μm for 3, 20, and 180 min, respectively. At pH 7.4 (Fig. 3 B), GTP binding was weaker, with K D values 2–4-fold higher than at pH 6.7. GTP binding at pH 7.8 was rather weak, with 3–16-fold higherK D values. In all cases, the theoretical calculations give good fits to the data points, although the latter scattered strongly at pH 7.8 (Fig. 3 C). To verify the validity of the filtration method, we employed two approaches to measure the dissociation rate. First, UCP was incubated (23 °C) with [14C]GTP until equilibrium was reached, and excess unlabeled GTP was added to displace the prebound [14C]GTP. As shown in Fig.4 A, the concentration of prebound [14C]GTP decreased exponentially. Best fits of the data for pH 6.7 and 7.4 yielded k −1 = 0.44 × 10−3 and 1.5 × 10−3s−1, respectively. The time course of free [14C]GTP released into the supernatant followed an exponential increase with rate constants of 0.98 × 10−3 and 1.9 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. While the two sets of dissociation rate constants agree, they are comparable to those extracted directly from the binding data (Table I) when temperature dependence is taken into account. In the second approach, we measured the equilibrium shift upon dilution. Before dilution, the bound and free [14C]GTP concentrations were 42.6 and 5.35 μm, respectively. After a 21-fold dilution, the initial bound and free [14C]GTP concentrations should be 2.03 and 0.25 μm. The measured values were 1.67 and 0.40 μm, respectively (Fig.4 B). The rapid drop in the complex concentration upon dilution revealed the presence of a fast dissociating loose complex (<18%) and a tight complex (>82%), which gave the slow phase of dissociation with a rate constant of 1.1 × 10−3s−1, in fair agreement with the rate determined above by displacement with excess unlabeled GTP. Anions were known previously to be competitive inhibitors of nucleotide binding (8Lin C.S. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we studied the effects of anions on the two complexes. The influence of anion on nucleotide binding and dissociation is illustrated with Na2SO4. With increasing [SO42−] in the incubation media, the GTP binding curve was shifted progressively downward (Fig.5 A). The anion effect can be explained in that SO42− can competitively bind to the nucleotide-binding site and increase theK d for the initial loose complex (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Theoretical fitting using data of Table I gave K d values of 3.8, 9.4, and 32.7 μm at 2.1, 10, and 48 mmSO42−, respectively. Attempts to fit the data with constant K d but varyingK c ′ or k −1 failed, suggesting that SO42− does not influence the subsequent conformational change step. Such a finding was also reported for ATP or ADP binding to myosin (16Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A plot ofK d against [SO42−] gives a straight line (Fig. 5 A, inset), yielding an intrinsic dissociation constant (K d o) in the absence of any anions of 2.5 ± 0.6 μm and an SO42− inhibition constant (K i) of 4.0 mm. The SO42− inhibition constant measured with this method is close to the value (1.0 mm) determined previously by fluorescence titrations (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, when [14C]GTP dissociation induced by excess unlabeled GTP was followed in the presence of SO42− (Fig.5 B), little difference was observed in the dissociation rate with 2.1 or 48 mm Na2SO4. We also measured GTP binding to intact mitochondria from brown adipose tissue with the filter binding method in parallel with the centrifugation method (data not shown). The two measurements yielded the same results. Best fits of the binding data revealedK c ′ = 123, suggesting 4-fold higher tight complex formation with UCP in the mitochondria than in the isolated state. While at 4 °C the transition rate (k +1) was comparable to that for the isolated protein, the dissociation rate (k −1 = 0.033 × 10−3s−1) was nearly 3-fold slower. The transition rates were 8-fold faster at 23 °C than at 4 °C, similar to the data with the isolated protein. The slow-phase kinetics were also measured by competition with fluorescent nucleotides as follows. Dansyl-ADP was shown previously to bind to and dissociate from UCP rapidly (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The displacement of prebound dansyl-ADP by nucleotides was used to record their transition rates (see “Experimental Procedures”). When experiments were performed with various GTP concentrations (1–8 μm), the fluorescence decrease could be fit with the same rate constant, suggesting that rate limitation indeed applies. The rate of fluorescence decrease depends on the added nucleotide (Fig.6). While GTP and ATP caused a slow fluorescence increase, GDP and ADP elicited a faster fluorescence response, with ADP being even faster than GDP. The decreases in fluorescence can be well fit (solid lines) with a single exponential equation (Table II).Table IIRate constants of slow-phase nucleotide binding to isolated UCP at pH 6.7 and 14.5 °C measured by the fluorescence competition methodGTPGDPATPADPk +1(×103 s−1)16.8 ± 0.266.3 ± 0.725.6 ± 0.6143 ± 5k −1 (×103 s−1)2.50 ± 0.0111.2 ± 0.24.06 ± 0.0221.9 ± 0.8K c ′6.85.96.46.8 Open table in a new tab To measure the dissociation rate of the tight U*N complex, excess dansyl-GTP was added to the preformed UCP-nucleotide complex. As shown in Fig. 7, the rate of fluorescence increase depends on the competing nucleotide species. It was slow with GTP and ATP, but faster with GDP and ADP. The rate constants (k −1) were obtained by fitting and are given in Table II. Nucleotide binding to UCP was found to follow a two-stage process, with an initial fast but loose binding state and a slow transition into a tight binding state. In our previous equilibrium experiments (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the loose and tight complexes were verified by comparing the binding data measured by an anion-exchange method and fluorescence titrations. Most important, the inhibition of H+ transport was shown to require the tight binding state. Furthermore, the increased resistance to tryptic digestion of the tight complex witnesses that a major conformational change is involved (11Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we studied the time course of the total binding by a filter binding method that revealed a clearly biphasic binding process. Although the initial fast phase of binding could not be resolved with this method, we assume that the rate would be the same (k on = 3.6 × 105m−1 s−1) as previously determined for the dansylated nucleotides by a stopped-flow method (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The further slow increase in binding was attributed to the subsequent transition to the tight complex. The existence of loose and tight complexes was also demonstrated in dilution experiments (Fig.4 B). The biphasic kinetics can be best described by the two-stage binding model. Furthermore, the time-dependent change of the mass action plots could be quantitatively fitted by this model, thus providing experimental support in two dimensions of time and GTP concentration. The two-stage time progress of binding is simulated by theoretical computations to further illustrate the biphasic binding model. For this purpose, we fixed the dissociation constant for the initial loose complex (K d = 14 μm) and the tight-to-loose transition rate constant (k −1 = 0.1 × 10−3 s−1) (Table I), but varied the tight/loose distribution constant (K c ′) (Fig.8 A). The total binding (UN + U*N) is clearly very sensitive to K c ′, as was shown by the pH dependence (Fig. 2 A). Increasing theK d at a constant K c ′ shifts the binding curve downward without altering the curvature (Fig.8 B), in line with the effects of anions (Fig. 5). An increase in the transition rates (k +1 and k−1) enhances the curvature without affecting the end point (Fig. 8 C), in agreement with the faster binding at elevated temperatures (Fig. 2 B). The sensitivity of these parameters inherent to the two-stage binding model has allowed an unambiguous extraction of the kinetic parameters. In Fig.8 D, we calculated the time course of the various UCP-binding species using the parameters given in Table I. The free UCP concentration (U) decreases exponentially as binding proceeds. The loose complex (UN) forms instantly (here 0.5 μm at time 0), but its concentration decreases as the conformational change occurs. The increase in the tight complex (U*N) follows an exponential progression course from time 0. Since the filter binding method measures both the loose and tight complexes, the observed binding (UN + U*N) increases exponentially from 0.5 μm, thus showing a biphasic time course of nucleotide binding. As shown in Table I, the tight/loose distribution varies moderately among the four nucleotides so that at equilibrium (pH 6.7 and 4 °C), the tight complex (U*N) accounts for 71–97% of the total UCP-nucleotide complex. With increasing pH, the transition rate constant (k +1) for GTP varied only 2-fold, whereas the dissociation rate constant (k −1) increased 5-fold at pH 7.4 and nearly 30-fold at pH 7.8. TheK c ′ decreased by ∼10- and 43-fold, respectively, reflecting a strong decrease in the tight complex at equilibrium. The overall affinity declines accordingly due primarily to a decrease inK c ′, as shown by 8- and 18-fold increases inK D, in agreement with the pH dependence reported earlier (9Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is interesting that although the initial rapid binding rate (k on) does not depend on the nucleotide species (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the subsequent transition step as measured here is strongly nucleotide-dependent. With ATP or GTP, the transition is surprisingly ∼45 times slower than with GDP or ADP. This feature is consistent with the faster inhibition of mitochondrial swelling in the presence of potassium acetate by the diphosphates (17Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Obviously, the initial fast binding is associated with a less specific protein-ligand recognition, whereas stronger and thus more specific interactions are realized by the subsequent slow rearrangement of the binding site. The unusually slow rate is indicative of an intriguingly coordinated rearrangement required to reach the tight binding state and thus ensure inhibition of H+ transport. The difference in the dissociation rates (k −1) is even more striking. ATP dissociates 6-fold faster than GTP, whereas with the diphosphates GDP and ADP, the rate is 88- and >300-fold faster, respectively. The even slower transition for nucleoside triphosphates can be interpreted in terms of a further interaction with the histidine whereby the binding center has to be deepened (10Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The binding of GTP to brown adipose tissue mitochondria is even slower than to isolated UCP. This slow binding was associated with a much weaker initial affinity (K d ≈ 120 μm), presumably due to competition with endogenous ATP carried over from the cytosol (17Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the mitochondria were washed at higher pH (8.8) prior to the measurements, GTP binding was found to be faster with a higher initial affinity (data not shown). A comparison of nucleotides with dansylated nucleotide derivatives reveals that dansylation accelerates the conformational transition step. The k +1 increases ∼45-, 30-, and 4-fold for GTP, ATP, and ADP, respectively, whereas the increase ink −1 is more drastic, amounting to ∼700-, 240-, and 40-fold, respectively. As a result, a lower tight complex population was measured for the dansylated nucleotides (11Huang S.G. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In several nucleotide-utilizing enzymes, purine nucleotide binding (with Mg2+) was found to occur in at least two stages, with an initial loose but rapid association followed by conformational transitions. The rate of transition in most enzymes was fast,e.g. 400 s−1 for myosin (16Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), ∼200 s−1 for elongation factor Tu (18Wagner A. Simon I. Prinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and 4–17 s−1 for p21Ha- ras (19John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This differs largely from the unusually slow transition observed for nucleotide binding to UCP, presumably due to the fact that in UCP we have the rare case of free nucleotide (NDP3− and NTP4−) binding, whereas in the cases mentioned, the magnesium complexes (e.g. (NTP·Mg)2−) interact with the protein. The interaction of three or four negative charges with the protein can be expected to be stronger and thus result in larger rearrangements than in the common case of magnesium-nucleotide complex binding. The dissociation of prebound nucleotide from these enzymes was reported to be rather slow. The rate constants for dissociation of ADP and ATP from G-actin were 3.3 × 10−3 and 5 × 10−4 s−1, respectively (20Kinosian H.J. Seldon L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP dissociation from the platelet ADP receptor was found to be 2.4 × 10−2 s−1 (21Macfarlane D.E. Srivastava P.C. Mills D.C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate in myosin was very temperature-sensitive (22Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), increasing from 0.07 to 1.4 s−1 as the temperature increased from 5 to 21 °C. The G-protein family also had a high affinity for GTP and GDP. The nucleotides dissociate from the Ras-related nuclear G-protein slowly, with rate constants of 1.2 × 10−5 and 1.4 × 10−5 s−1, respectively (23Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12543-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Slow dissociation (0.85 × 10−3 s−1 for GDP and 5 × 10−3 s−1 for GTP) was observed also for elongation factor Tu from Thermus thermophilus(18Wagner A. Simon I. Prinzl M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12535-12542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The slow dissociation in these proteins may suggest a common occluded state of nucleotide in the binding pocket following conformational rearrangement in the protein."

The wild-type and mutant enzymes have similar secondary structures on the basis of CD spectroscopy. The mutation Gly679 → Ala had little effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, however, the Gly534 → Ala mutant exhibited a 4000-fold decrease in k cat and the Gly862 → Ala mutant showed an 11-fold increase inK m for ATP. Glucose 6-phosphate inhibition of the three glycine mutants is comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. Inorganic phosphate is, however, less effective in relieving glucose 6-phosphate inhibition of the Gly862 → Ala mutant, relative to the wild-type enzyme and entirely ineffective in relieving inhibition of the Gly534 → Ala mutant. Although the fluorescence emission spectra showed some difference for the Gly862 → Ala mutant relative to that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating an environmental alteration around tryptophan residues, no change was observed for the Gly534 → Ala and Gly679 → Ala mutants.

Hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, using ATP as a phosphoryl donor. Four isoforms of hexokinase exist in mammalian tissue (1Katzen H.M. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Hexokinase isoforms I, II, and III have molecular weights of approximately 100,000 and are monomers under most conditions. Amino acid sequences of isoforms I–III are 70% identical (2Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the N- and C-terminal halves of isoforms I–III have similar amino acid sequences, probably as a result of gene duplication and fusion (3Easterby J.S. O'Brien M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kosow D.P. Arch. Biochem.

Hexokinase isoform IV (glucokinase) has a molecular weight of 50,000, similar to that of yeast hexokinase. Glucokinase exhibits (as does yeast hexokinase) significant sequence similarity to the N- and C-terminal halves of isoforms I–III.Despite sequence similarities, the functional properties of hexokinase isoforms differ significantly. Isoform I (hereafter, brain hexokinase or hexokinase I) governs the rate-limiting step of glycolysis in brain and red blood cells (8Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 31-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rapoport S. Essays Biochem. 1968; 4: 69-103PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction product, glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P 1The abbreviation used is: Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate. 1The abbreviation used is: Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate.), inhibits both isoforms I and II (but not isoform IV) at micromolar levels. Inorganic phosphate (Pi), however, reverses Glu-6-P inhibition of only hexokinase I. The C-terminal domain of hexokinase I possesses catalytic activity, whereas the N-terminal domain is involved in the Pi-induced relief of product inhibition (10White T.K. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the C- and N-terminal halves exhibit comparable catalytic activity in isoform II (11Tsai H.J. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, among hexokinase isoforms, brain hexokinase exhibits unique regulatory properties in that physiological levels of Pi can reverse inhibition due to physiological levels of Glu-6-P (12Rudolph F.B.

Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of human brain hexokinase and its ATP binding site has been modeled in our laboratory based on similarities among the ATP-binding domains of actin, heat shock protein, and glycerol kinase (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The model for the complex of ATP with hexokinase I puts a number of residues in the vicinity of ATP, of which Thr680, Asp532, and Arg539 have been the focus of directed mutations and investigations of initial rate kinetics (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These residues evidently stabilize the transition state, but do not influence the binding affinity of ATP (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).This study presents the results of CD, fluorescence, and kinetic investigations of Gly534 → Ala, Arg539 → Lys, Thr661 → Ala, Thr661 → Val, Gly679 → Ala, and Gly862 → Ala mutants of brain hexokinase. The mutation Gly862 → Ala causes an order of magnitude increase in the K m for ATP, the first instance of a mutation in hexokinase I that has had a significant influence on the binding affinity of ATP. The mutation Gly534 → Ala reduces k cat by three orders of magnitude, but more significantly abolishes Pi-induced relief of Glu-6-P inhibition. Mutation at Gly534 is the first instance whereby a single mutation in hexokinase I has had a significant impact on the amelioration of product inhibition by Pi.DISCUSSIONArg539 putatively interacts with the polyphosphoryl portion of ATP and stabilizes the transition state (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Arg539 → Lys mutant is 10-fold more active than the Arg539 → Ile mutant (20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of the positive charge at position 539. However, as the Arg539→ Lys mutant reported here is still 12-fold less active than wild-type hexokinase I, specific hydrogen bond interactions of the arginyl side chain are of equal importance in stabilizing the transition state. We have suggested, on the basis of previous work, that Arg539 may form salt bridges with oxygen atoms of the α- and β-phosphoryl groups of ATP (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The observed properties of the Lys539 mutant are consistent with that suggestion.Thr661 is 10 Å away from the β-phosphoryl group of ATP in our model, however, the γ-oxygen atom of Thr661 is 3 Å from Asp657, which is putatively the catalytic base in the abstraction of a proton from the 6-hydroxyl group of glucose (25Arora K.K. Filburn C.R. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5359-5362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Thr661 → Ala mutant has kinetic properties similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, but mutation of Thr661 to valine causes a 9-fold decrease in k cat, probably by introducing an unfavorable nonbonded contact that perturbs Asp657.Consensus sequences, Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-(Ser/Thr) in mononucleotide-binding proteins (26Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly in dinucleotide-binding proteins (26Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), andY-Gly-X-Gly-X-(Phe/Tyr)-Gly-X-Val, where Y is a hydrophobic residue for protein kinases (27Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), are rich in conserved glycines. In the mononucleotide-binding protein, p21H-ras, the dihedral angles of the polypeptide chain require glycine (28Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). For dinucleotide-binding proteins (29Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the second glycine of the consensus sequence provides space for the polyphosphoryl moiety, and the first and third glycines satisfy conformational constraints of the polypeptide chain. The glycine-rich sequences of protein kinases participate in nucleotide binding, substrate recognition, and enzyme catalysis (30Bossemeyer D. Nature. 1993; 363: 590Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Yeast hexokinase, actin, hsc70, and glycerol kinase, however, are without a consensus sequence for nucleotide binding. Instead, the residues associated with nucleotide binding are scattered throughout the primary structure, but come together at single sites in the context of the folded polypeptide chains (32Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ATP binding domains of yeast hexokinase, actin, hsc70, and glycerol kinase are also rich in glycine residues.We have probed the corresponding glycines by directed mutation, in the expectation that some of these glycines are linked to observed kinetic properties in hexokinase I. The mutation of Gly534 to alanine produced a dramatic effect on k cat(4000-fold reduction) and modest effects on K m for glucose and ATP. Gly534 is conserved in sequences of hexokinase, but according to our model (Fig.3), its main chain torsion angles fall in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot for alanine. Instead, Cβ of Ala534 is 3.6 Å from an oxygen of the β-phosphoryl group of ATP, but perhaps of greater significance is its 2.4 Å contact with backbone carbonyl 537 of an adjacent β-strand. Our model suggests then, the possibility of conformational change in the vicinity of residue 534 to relieve the close contact mentioned above. Such a local conformational change could influence Asp532, which on the basis of earlier work (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) plays a critical role in the stabilization of the transition state and may be involved in the binding of Mg2+. A larger perturbation on the active site due to the mutation of Gly534 to alanine is not likely, because K m values for substrates are not influenced and CD spectroscopy indicates no change in secondary structure.The Gly534 → Ala mutant represents the first instance whereby the mutation of a single residue has abolished Pi-induced relief of Glu-6-P inhibition in hexokinase I. Glu-6-P inhibition of the C-terminal half of hexokinase I (mini-hexokinase) cannot be reversed by Pi, implicating the N-terminal domain in the relief of inhibition (20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Pi relieves Glu-6-P inhibition then evidently involves structural elements of both the N- and C-terminal halves of hexokinase I. Furthermore, the loss of Pi-induced relief of Glu-6-P inhibition in the Gly534 → Ala mutant is linked closely to position 534, as mutations of Asp532 to lysine and glutamate have little effect on this property (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Gly679 and Gly862 belong to reverse turns, which pack against each other in our model (Fig. 3). The main chain torsion angles put positions 679 and 862 in unallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for alanine (φ = −111, ψ = −133 for Gly679; φ = 70, ψ = 168 for Gly862). Of the two mutants, Gly862 → Ala has the conformation of highest energy. Although the Cβ atoms at positions 679 and 862 probably do not interact with ATP, they make unfavorable contacts in our model with backbone amide 863 (2.6 Å) and backbone amide 679 (2.7 Å), respectively. These unfavorable contacts may not be significant, however, as the mutation of Gly679 to alanine has no effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Instead, the introduction of alanine at position 862 probably causes conformational changes in main chain torsion angles. Although the fluorescence spectra of the wild-type and Gly862 → Ala enzymes differ (indicating a perturbation in the local environment of tryptophan residues) their CD spectra are identical (indicating no change in secondary structure). Furthermore, the K i for 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate and the K m for glucose are similar for the Gly682 → Ala mutant and the wild-type enzyme. Thus the mutation of Gly862 to alanine probably has an effect only on residues in the vicinity of position 862. Thr863, a residue conserved in hexokinase sequences, interacts with the ribose and base moieties of ATP in our model (Fig.3). The Gly682 → Ala mutant, then, could influence interactions involving the base of ATP by perturbing the conformation or relative position of Thr683. The mutation of Gly862 to alanine increases the K m for ATP by 11-fold without large changes in other kinetic parameters and as such, represents the first mutation, which to our knowledge influences the binding affinity of ATP.Mutations prepared here and from previous studies (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) show a trend that may be significant to the function of hexokinases in general. Mutations of hexokinase I, which putatively influence interactions involving the polyphosphoryl moiety of ATP, have no effect onK m but a large effect onk cat. Conversely, the Gly862 → Ala mutant, which putatively influences interactions at the base moiety, has little effect on k cat but substantial effects on K m for ATP. Interactions involving the base of ATP are important for affinity, but polyphosphoryl-protein interactions are involved in the stabilization of the transition state. Conceivably, hexokinase I diverts energy from favorable interactions between the polyphosphoryl moiety of ATP and the enzyme to promote conformational changes that stabilize the transition state. This phenomenon is not without precedence. In adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli mutations involving protein interactions at the base of GTP affect K m (33Kang C. Sun N. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24046-24049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas interactions between the polyphosphoryl group of GTP and the protein (and Mg2+) contribute to the stability of the transition state by driving conformational changes in the active site (34Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, using ATP as a phosphoryl donor. Four isoforms of hexokinase exist in mammalian tissue (1Katzen H.M. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Hexokinase isoforms I, II, and III have molecular weights of approximately 100,000 and are monomers under most conditions. Amino acid sequences of isoforms I–III are 70% identical (2Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover the N- and C-terminal halves of isoforms I–III have similar amino acid sequences, probably as a result of gene duplication and fusion (3Easterby J.S. O'Brien M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Kosow D.P. Arch. Biochem.

Hexokinase isoform IV (glucokinase) has a molecular weight of 50,000, similar to that of yeast hexokinase. Glucokinase exhibits (as does yeast hexokinase) significant sequence similarity to the N- and C-terminal halves of isoforms I–III. Despite sequence similarities, the functional properties of hexokinase isoforms differ significantly. Isoform I (hereafter, brain hexokinase or hexokinase I) governs the rate-limiting step of glycolysis in brain and red blood cells (8Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 31-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rapoport S. Essays Biochem. 1968; 4: 69-103PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction product, glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P 1The abbreviation used is: Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate. 1The abbreviation used is: Glu-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate.), inhibits both isoforms I and II (but not isoform IV) at micromolar levels. Inorganic phosphate (Pi), however, reverses Glu-6-P inhibition of only hexokinase I. The C-terminal domain of hexokinase I possesses catalytic activity, whereas the N-terminal domain is involved in the Pi-induced relief of product inhibition (10White T.K. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 375-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, both the C- and N-terminal halves exhibit comparable catalytic activity in isoform II (11Tsai H.J. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, among hexokinase isoforms, brain hexokinase exhibits unique regulatory properties in that physiological levels of Pi can reverse inhibition due to physiological levels of Glu-6-P (12Rudolph F.B.

This study presents the results of CD, fluorescence, and kinetic investigations of Gly534 → Ala, Arg539 → Lys, Thr661 → Ala, Thr661 → Val, Gly679 → Ala, and Gly862 → Ala mutants of brain hexokinase. The mutation Gly862 → Ala causes an order of magnitude increase in the K m for ATP, the first instance of a mutation in hexokinase I that has had a significant influence on the binding affinity of ATP.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Arg539 → Lys mutant is 10-fold more active than the Arg539 → Ile mutant (20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of the positive charge at position 539. However, as the Arg539→ Lys mutant reported here is still 12-fold less active than wild-type hexokinase I, specific hydrogen bond interactions of the arginyl side chain are of equal importance in stabilizing the transition state. We have suggested, on the basis of previous work, that Arg539 may form salt bridges with oxygen atoms of the α- and β-phosphoryl groups of ATP (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The observed properties of the Lys539 mutant are consistent with that suggestion.Thr661 is 10 Å away from the β-phosphoryl group of ATP in our model, however, the γ-oxygen atom of Thr661 is 3 Å from Asp657, which is putatively the catalytic base in the abstraction of a proton from the 6-hydroxyl group of glucose (25Arora K.K. Filburn C.R. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5359-5362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Thr661 → Ala mutant has kinetic properties similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, but mutation of Thr661 to valine causes a 9-fold decrease in k cat, probably by introducing an unfavorable nonbonded contact that perturbs Asp657.Consensus sequences, Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-(Ser/Thr) in mononucleotide-binding proteins (26Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly in dinucleotide-binding proteins (26Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), andY-Gly-X-Gly-X-(Phe/Tyr)-Gly-X-Val, where Y is a hydrophobic residue for protein kinases (27Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), are rich in conserved glycines. In the mononucleotide-binding protein, p21H-ras, the dihedral angles of the polypeptide chain require glycine (28Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). For dinucleotide-binding proteins (29Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 61-67Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the second glycine of the consensus sequence provides space for the polyphosphoryl moiety, and the first and third glycines satisfy conformational constraints of the polypeptide chain. The glycine-rich sequences of protein kinases participate in nucleotide binding, substrate recognition, and enzyme catalysis (30Bossemeyer D. Nature. 1993; 363: 590Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Yeast hexokinase, actin, hsc70, and glycerol kinase, however, are without a consensus sequence for nucleotide binding. Instead, the residues associated with nucleotide binding are scattered throughout the primary structure, but come together at single sites in the context of the folded polypeptide chains (32Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ATP binding domains of yeast hexokinase, actin, hsc70, and glycerol kinase are also rich in glycine residues.We have probed the corresponding glycines by directed mutation, in the expectation that some of these glycines are linked to observed kinetic properties in hexokinase I. The mutation of Gly534 to alanine produced a dramatic effect on k cat(4000-fold reduction) and modest effects on K m for glucose and ATP. Gly534 is conserved in sequences of hexokinase, but according to our model (Fig.3), its main chain torsion angles fall in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot for alanine. Instead, Cβ of Ala534 is 3.6 Å from an oxygen of the β-phosphoryl group of ATP, but perhaps of greater significance is its 2.4 Å contact with backbone carbonyl 537 of an adjacent β-strand. Our model suggests then, the possibility of conformational change in the vicinity of residue 534 to relieve the close contact mentioned above. Such a local conformational change could influence Asp532, which on the basis of earlier work (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) plays a critical role in the stabilization of the transition state and may be involved in the binding of Mg2+. A larger perturbation on the active site due to the mutation of Gly534 to alanine is not likely, because K m values for substrates are not influenced and CD spectroscopy indicates no change in secondary structure.The Gly534 → Ala mutant represents the first instance whereby the mutation of a single residue has abolished Pi-induced relief of Glu-6-P inhibition in hexokinase I. Glu-6-P inhibition of the C-terminal half of hexokinase I (mini-hexokinase) cannot be reversed by Pi, implicating the N-terminal domain in the relief of inhibition (20Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10509-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Pi relieves Glu-6-P inhibition then evidently involves structural elements of both the N- and C-terminal halves of hexokinase I. Furthermore, the loss of Pi-induced relief of Glu-6-P inhibition in the Gly534 → Ala mutant is linked closely to position 534, as mutations of Asp532 to lysine and glutamate have little effect on this property (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Gly679 and Gly862 belong to reverse turns, which pack against each other in our model (Fig. 3). The main chain torsion angles put positions 679 and 862 in unallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for alanine (φ = −111, ψ = −133 for Gly679; φ = 70, ψ = 168 for Gly862). Of the two mutants, Gly862 → Ala has the conformation of highest energy. Although the Cβ atoms at positions 679 and 862 probably do not interact with ATP, they make unfavorable contacts in our model with backbone amide 863 (2.6 Å) and backbone amide 679 (2.7 Å), respectively. These unfavorable contacts may not be significant, however, as the mutation of Gly679 to alanine has no effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Instead, the introduction of alanine at position 862 probably causes conformational changes in main chain torsion angles. Although the fluorescence spectra of the wild-type and Gly862 → Ala enzymes differ (indicating a perturbation in the local environment of tryptophan residues) their CD spectra are identical (indicating no change in secondary structure). Furthermore, the K i for 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate and the K m for glucose are similar for the Gly682 → Ala mutant and the wild-type enzyme. Thus the mutation of Gly862 to alanine probably has an effect only on residues in the vicinity of position 862. Thr863, a residue conserved in hexokinase sequences, interacts with the ribose and base moieties of ATP in our model (Fig.3). The Gly682 → Ala mutant, then, could influence interactions involving the base of ATP by perturbing the conformation or relative position of Thr683. The mutation of Gly862 to alanine increases the K m for ATP by 11-fold without large changes in other kinetic parameters and as such, represents the first mutation, which to our knowledge influences the binding affinity of ATP.Mutations prepared here and from previous studies (19Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) show a trend that may be significant to the function of hexokinases in general. Mutations of hexokinase I, which putatively influence interactions involving the polyphosphoryl moiety of ATP, have no effect onK m but a large effect onk cat. Conversely, the Gly862 → Ala mutant, which putatively influences interactions at the base moiety, has little effect on k cat but substantial effects on K m for ATP. Interactions involving the base of ATP are important for affinity, but polyphosphoryl-protein interactions are involved in the stabilization of the transition state. Conceivably, hexokinase I diverts energy from favorable interactions between the polyphosphoryl moiety of ATP and the enzyme to promote conformational changes that stabilize the transition state. This phenomenon is not without precedence. In adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli mutations involving protein interactions at the base of GTP affect K m (33Kang C. Sun N. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24046-24049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas interactions between the polyphosphoryl group of GTP and the protein (and Mg2+) contribute to the stability of the transition state by driving conformational changes in the active site (34Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1997229270,"The molecular events in the cAMP-induced allosteric activation of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) involve interfacial communications between subunits and domains. However, the roles of intersubunit and interdomain interactions in defining the selectivity of cAMP against other cyclic nucleotides and cooperativity in ligand binding are still not known. Natural occurring CRP mutants with different phenotypes were employed to address these issues. Thermodynamic analyses of subunit association, protein stability, and cAMP and DNA binding as well as conformational studies of the mutants and wild-type CRPs lead to an identification of the apparently dominant roles of residues 128 and 141 in the cAMP-modulated DNA binding activity of CRP. Serine 128 and the C-helix were implicated as playing a critical role in modulating negative cooperativity of cyclic nucleotide binding. A correlation was established between a weak affinity for subunit assembly and the relaxation of cyclic nucleotide selectivity in the G141Q and S128A/G141Q mutants. These results imply that intersubunit interaction is important for cyclic nucleotide discrimination in CRP. The double mutant S128A/G141Q, constructed from two single mutations of S128A and G141Q, which exhibit opposite phenotypic characteristics of CRP− and CRP*, respectively, assumes a CRP* phenotype and has biochemical properties similar to those of the G141Q mutant. These observations suggest that mutation G141Q exerts a dominant effect over mutation S128A and that the subunit realignment induced by the G141Q mutation can override the local structural disruption created by mutation S128A.

The expression of many genes involved in different cellular functions in Escherichia coli is regulated by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; CPM, 7-diethylamine-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; IAF, iodoacetamidofluorescein. and cAMP (1de Crombrugghe B.

The molecular events associated with the allosteric activation of CRP are characterized by negative cooperativity in cAMP binding and a differentiation among the various cyclic nucleotides present in the cell. Although the CRP-cAMP system has served as a paradigm of transcriptional regulation in procaryotes for many years, an understanding of this allosteric activation event at the structural level is still missing. CRP is a 47,238-Da protein made up of two identical subunits, each of which is composed of two domains connected by a hinge region. The small carboxyl-terminal domain contains a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. The large amino-terminal domain is responsible for cyclic nucleotide binding (4Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Biochemical and biophysical evidences show that binding of cAMP allosterically induces CRP to assume a conformation that exhibits a high affinity for specific DNA sequences (5Krakow J.S. Pastan I.

However, a comparison between the active, monoliganded CRP and apo-CRP shows no significant secondary structural changes. The only observable major structural changes are associated with the doubly liganded CRP (11Lee B.J. Lee S.J. Hayashi F. Aiba H. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem.

These observations imply that conformational changes during CRP activation most likely involve rigid body movements between subunits and domains without major structural changes or a change in the dynamics of various structural elements without any significant conversion of secondary structures. In CRP these rigid body movements can be envisioned as subunit realignment and domain rearrangement that are mediated by interactions involving the subunit and domain interfaces, respectively. It has been shown that various locations in the CRP molecule all respond quantitatively to the binding of cAMP (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that CRP responds to the binding of cAMP in a global manner. A global conformational switch is consistent with the proposed mechanisms involving either subunit realignment and domain rearrangement or a change in structural dynamics. There is still no information to identify the structural elements in CRP that are responsible for imposing negative cooperativity in cAMP binding. How does CRP differentiate among the various cyclic nucleotides? What structural element is responsible for establishing a tight coupling between intersubunit and interdomain interactions? CRP mutants generated by site-specific mutagenesis are employed to address these outstanding issues. Studies of point mutations at residue 128 show that serine 128 is not vital for interdomain communication but plays an important role in mediating the interactions between the two subunits (18Cheng X.

In a recent study of mutation at residue 141, it was shown that the Gly → Gln mutation differentially perturbs the two interfacial interactions (19Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30781-30784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cheng X. Mechanism of Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein Activation by Cyclic AMP in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX1994Google Scholar). Structural and functional studies reveal that the G141Q mutant assumes a conformation state that has a realigned subunit interface. The G141Q mutant does not bind to specific DNA sequence without cyclic nucleotide (19Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30781-30784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete activation of the mutant requires binding of cyclic nucleotide, which induces the reorientation of domains (20Cheng X. Mechanism of Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein Activation by Cyclic AMP in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX1994Google Scholar). In this study, the role of residue 141 in defining cyclic nucleotide specificity and the mutual influence of residues 128 and 141 in the allosteric control of CRP toward binding to specific DNA are addressed. The in vivo and in vitro functional properties of mutant CRPs were monitored, with special attention to the subunit and domain interactions in CRP. Chymotrypsin A and cGMP were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. A mutagenesis kit (Altered Sites in vitro Mutagenesis System) was obtained from Promega, and a sequencing kit (Sequenase version 2.0) was from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Subtilisin (protease type XXVII) and cAMP were purchased from Sigma. Ultrapure guanidine HCl was a product of ICN Biochemical. MacConkey agar, bactotryptone, and yeast extract were obtained from Difco. CPM, fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate, and IAF were purchased from Molecular Probes. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys. Restriction endonucleases were from Promega, Life Technologies, Inc., U.S. Biochemical Corp., or Boehringer Mannheim. A detailed description of the source and identity of the various bacterial strains and plasmids can be found in Cheng et al. (18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All experiments, except as specifically indicated, were conducted in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mKCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). The concentration of protein, cyclic nucleotides, and fluorescence probes was determined by absorption spectroscopy using the following absorption coefficients: 20,400 m−1 cm−1 at 278 nm for CRP monomer (21Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); 14,650 m−1 cm−1 at 259 nm and 12,950 m−1 cm−1 at 254 nm for cAMP and cGMP (22Merck & Co., Inc. The Merck Index. 9th Ed. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ1976: 353Google Scholar), respectively; 30,000m−1 cm−1 at 387 nm for CPM (23Sippel T.O. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 1377-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); 70,800 m−1 cm−1 at 494 nm for fluorescein (24Cerione R.A. McCarty R.E. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The G141Q point mutation was generated as described previously (18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30781-30784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cheng X. Mechanism of Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein Activation by Cyclic AMP in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX1994Google Scholar). For constructing the double mutant S128A/G141Q, the G141Q crp gene was subcloned into the unrepaired pALTER-1 vector. The same protocol described above was then used for the second round of mutagenesis. With the new Promega Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System, multiple rounds of mutation can be introduced into the same gene without subcloning. To test the effects of mutation on the lac operon expression, E. coliCA8445/pPRK248cIts, transformed with plasmid pPLc28 that contains the appropriate crp mutant gene, was streaked on MacConkey lactose indicator plates in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm cAMP or cGMP. The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The fermentation response of the mutant was scored according to the color of the colonies on the plates. A CRP+phenotype displays purple colonies only in the presence of cAMP, while a CRP* phenotype is defined as an amino acid substitution that yields purple colonies on MacConkey lactose plate (Lac +) in the absence of external cAMP or in the presence of cGMP. A CRP− phenotype is a mutant that always shows white colonies (Lac −) on MacConkey plates. Wild type CRP was purified from temperature-induced E. coli K12 ΔH1/pPlcCRP1 cells grown in LB (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutant CRP was isolated from E. coliCA8445/PPRK248CIts harboring plasmid PPLC28, which encodes the appropriate mutant crp gene. All CRP mutants were purified to more than 95% purity using the same protocol for wild type CRP purification (18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CD spectra of wild type and mutant CRP were measured with an Aviv 62 DS circular dichroism spectrometer. To acquire a full range of near- and far-UV CD spectra, fused quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 0.01 (220–190 nm), 0.1 (270–200 nm), and 1 cm (360–240 nm) and protein solutions with concentrations of about 1 mg/ml were used. Each spectrum was recorded with a 0.5-nm increment and 1-s interval. For each sample, five repetitive scans were obtained and averaged. Proteolytic digestion of CRP was employed as a tool to monitor the conformational changes in CRP using a previously described protocol (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). IAF modification of the wild type and mutant CRPs was carried out in 50 mm Tris, 0.3m KCl, 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.8 in the dark. 1.1 mg/ml CRP was modified by 0.5 mm IAF at 4 °C overnight for wild type CRP and 30–45 min at room temperature for G141Q and S128A/G141Q mutants. Labeled CRP was purified by Sephadex G-25 spin columns and dialyzed extensively against buffer A. The extent of modification was determined as described previously (16Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3200-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The DNA used for studying CRP-DNA interactions is the 40-base pair fragment of thelac promoter with the sequence of 5′-CAACGCAATTAATGTGAGTTAGCTCACTCATTAGGCACCC-3′. The underlined sequence is the primary binding site for CRP. Complementary strands of this fragment were synthesized and purified separately by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of the single-stranded polynucleotides was then labeled with CPM at the 5′-end as described previously (26Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5165-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Modified single-strand DNA was hybridized with an equal amount of its complementary strand to give the fluorescently labeled double-stranded DNA. A small aliquot of the hybridization product was analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to ensure that all of the DNA was in the double-stranded form. cAMP binding to CRP was measured by monitoring the fluorescence signal change of CRP-IAF (λex= 495 nm, λem = 520 nm). The basic protocol employed has been previously described (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with a minor modification (18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CRP exists as a dimer in solution and can bind to two molecules of cAMP per dimer. Therefore, all cyclic nucleotide binding data in this study can be fitted to the following equation by a nonlinear least squares procedure to yield thermodynamic parameters K 1,K 2, Δ 1, andΔ 2 (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), Δobs=Δ1K1[cAMP]+Δ2K2[cAMP]21+K1[cAMP]+K2[cAMP]2Equation 1 where Δobs, Δ1, and Δ2are the values of change in fluorescence intensity and the normalized values of change in going from free CRP to CRP-cAMP1 and CRP-cAMP2, respectively; K 1 andK 2 are Adair constants for the formation of CRP-cAMP1 and CRP-cAMP2; and [cAMP] is the free cAMP concentration. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were used for quantitative measurements of CRP-DNA interactions using a previously published protocol (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The measured anisotropy data were fit to Eq. 2 as described previously (26Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) to give the apparent association constant (K) for CRP-DNA interaction according to a simple reaction scheme: P + DNA ⇆K P-DNA, A=AD+(APD−AD)KDT+KPT+1−(KDT+KPT+1)2−4K2DTPT2KDTEquation 2 where A is the measured value of anisotropy;A D and A PD are values of anisotropy associated with free DNA and CRP-DNA complex, respectively; and D T and P T are the total concentration of DNA and protein, respectively. However, free CRP does not bind specific DNA, and binding of CRP to DNA in the presence of cAMP follows a more complex scheme (Scheme 1). Therefore, the apparent DNA binding affinity of CRP (K) is a function of cAMP concentration, which in accordance to the above scheme can be expressed as follows. K=K1K3[cAMP]+K1K2K4[cAMP]21+K1[cAMP]+K1K2[cAMP]2Equation 3 K 1 and K 2 can be determined independently from the cAMP binding assay. The binding affinity of CRP-cAMP2 (K 4) is very weak and can not be precisely determined (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the apparent DNA binding affinity of the CRP in the presence of 100–200 μm cAMP, where most of the CRP exists in the monoliganded form, has been shown to be a good estimation of the intrinsic DNA binding affinity of the CRP-cAMP1 complex (28Pyles E.A. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1162-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study the apparent DNA affinity of CRP in the presence of 200 μm cAMP was assumed to representK 3. The quaternary structure of CRP was monitored by sedimentation equilibrium as described previously (29Cheng X. Gonzalez M. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8130-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted in a Beckman-Spinco model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric scanner, an electronic speed control, and an RTIC temperature control. The high speed, meniscus depletion procedure was employed (30Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). The loading CRP concentrations were between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml. Sedimentation data were acquired (10 scans) and then averaged after reaching equilibrium. The density of the solution was determined with a Mettler-Paar Precision DMA-02D density meter. Values of the partial specific volume of the wild type and mutant CRPs in native buffer and 6.0 m GuHCl were calculated based on the amino acid composition of CRP (31Aiba H. Fujimoto S. Ozaki N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1345-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 32Cossart P. Gicquel-Sanzey B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1363-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using the procedure of Cohn and Edsall (33Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides. Van Nostrand-Reinhold, Princeton, NJ1943: 372Google Scholar) and Lee and Timasheff (34Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively. Sedimentation equilibrium data were fit by nonlinear least squares to a dimer assembly scheme according to the equation, C=ΔC+exp[lnC0ς(r2/2−r02/2)]+exp[2lnC0+2ς(r2/2−r02/2)+lnK]Equation 4 where C is the CRP concentration observed at radial position r, ΔC is the base-line offset,C 0 is the concentration of CRP at the meniscus (r 0), K is the dimer equilibrium association constant, and ς is the reduced molecular weight given by ς = M r(1 −v̄ρ)ω2/2RT, whereM r is the monomer molecular weight, v̄ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solution density, ω is the angular velocity, and R and T are the gas constant and the temperature in Kelvin, respectively. The effect of amino acid substitutions on the folding and domain-domain interactions in CRP was probed by monitoring the unfolding of CRP by GuHCl using fluorescence anisotropy. A detailed description of the protocol has been published (29Cheng X. Gonzalez M. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8130-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the denaturation of CRP can best be described by a three-state model, N2⇄Kd2N⇄Ku2UReaction 1 in which N 2, N, andU are folded dimer, folded monomer, and unfolded monomer of CRP, respectively. K d and K u are the equilibrium constants of dissociation and unfolding, respectively. Unlike wild type CRP, mutant S128A/G141Q exhibits a weakened subunit association, which leads to a complete uncoupling of dimer dissociation and monomer unfolding. Therefore, these two processes can be studied separately. Subunit association of S128A/G141Q was measured by sedimentation equilibrium as described above. CRP unfolding was monitored by fluorescence anisotropy at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 345 nm, respectively. To determine the equilibrium constant of unfolding, the fraction of CRP protein that is in the folded state, ƒ, was calculated by the equation, f=(ε−εunfolded)(εfolded−εunfolded)Equation 5 where ε, εfolded, and εunfoldedrepresent the measured fluorescence anisotropy signal of the protein sample and the values of fluorescence anisotropy of folded and unfolded monomer CRP at a given GuHCl concentration, respectively. εfolded and εunfolded at the unfolding transition zone were derived by linear extrapolation of the measured signals at the predenaturation and postdenaturation zones, respectively. Once ƒ was determined, the equivalent K u at different GuHCl concentrations can be calculated as follows. Ku=[U][N]=1−ffEquation 6 K u values were converted to ΔG u by ΔG u = −RTlnK u. Δ Gu0, the free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, was subsequently determined by linear extrapolation of ΔG u to zero denaturant (35Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York, NY1989: 311-330Google Scholar). G141Q displayed purple colonies on MacConkey plates in the absence of external cAMP and in the presence of cGMP as reported earlier (15Tan G.-S. Kelly P. Kim J. Wartell R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30781-30784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Sanders R. McGeoch D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Kim J. Adhya S. Garges S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9700-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, this mutant is characterized by a CRP*phenotype. Interestingly, while the S128A mutant showed a CRP− phenotype (18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the double mutant S128A/G141Q is a CRP* mutant in vivo. This in vivoobservation indicates that mutation of G141Q exerts a dominant effect over mutation S128A. Near- and far-UV CD spectra of the double mutant, S128A/G141Q are identical to that of the wild type CRP and S128A and G141Q single mutants (Fig. 1). These results indicate that no major secondary or tertiary structural changes have been introduced in CRP by these mutations. Like the wild type, S128A, and G141Q CRPs, the S128A/G141Q mutant exists in solution as an apparent dimer in the mg/ml concentration regime. However, one way of probing the effect of mutation on intersubunit communication is by monitoring the energetics of dimer formation of each mutant. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments of S128A/G141Q at different concentrations of GuHCl ranging from 0 to 1.5 m were conducted to determine the dimer dissociation constant for this double mutant. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at multiple speeds of 20,000, 28,000, and 34,000 rpm for each GuHCl concentration. The results are shown in Fig. 2 A. The experimental data were then analyzed to estimate the apparent dimer association constant, K a, app at each individual GuHCl concentration using the program NONLIN (38Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). A plot of LnK a, app versus GuHCl concentration displays an apparent linear relationship. Extrapolation of the data to zero concentration of GuHCl yields a value of the dimer association constant for S128A/G141Q in buffer (Fig. 2 B). The extrapolated dimer association constant is similar to that of the G141Q mutant, i.e. weaker dimerization than that of the S128A mutant and wild type CRP. Table Isummarized the results on subunit dissociation for all of the mutants and wild type CRP. Again, G141Q mutation exerts a dominating effect on subunit assembly.Table IParameters for subunit dissociation and protein stability of the wild type and mutant CRPCRP mutantDimer dissociation constant1-aErrors in parentheses are expressed in terms of 75% confidence intervals.ΔG of monomer unfoldingmkcal/molWild type1-bRef. 29.1.0 × 10−97.2G141Q1-cRef. 45.1.4 × 10−77.7S128A1-dRef. 18.2.3 × 10−97.2S128A/G141Q6.3 (1.7, 22.1) × 10−77.4 (7.1, 7.7)1-a Errors in parentheses are expressed in terms of 75% confidence intervals.1-b Ref. 29Cheng X.

Open table in a new tab Protein stability studies in general can provide information on the folding stability of protein molecules and possibly domain-domain interaction. The stability of the double mutant was monitored by GuHCl denaturation studies using a published procedure (29Cheng X. Gonzalez M. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8130-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The unfolding curve of the S128A/G141Q mutant is characterized by a biphasic transition resembling that of the G141Q mutant, as shown in Fig. 3 A. Again this reflects the uncoupling of the processes of dimer dissociation and monomer unfolding. Similarly, the unfolding free energy of the S128A/G141Q monomer was determined to be 7.4 kcal/mol, as shown in Fig.3 B. This value is similar to that of the wild type, S128A, and G141Q CRPs (Table I). The proteolytic digestion pattern of wild type CRP is biphasic as a function of cAMP. An initial increase in the rate of proteolysis at low cAMP concentration was followed by a decrease in rate with a further increase in cAMP concentration (17Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The S128A mutant shows a significant decrease in sensitivity to protease digestion in a wide range of cAMP concentrations (18Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10816-10826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), while mutant G141Q is sensitive to protease cleavage in the absence of cAMP. The digestion pattern of the S128A/G141Q double mutant is different from that of the wild type and S128A mutant but similar to that of the G141Q mutant (Fig. 4). The S128A/G141Q mutant is also susceptible to either chymotrypsin or subtilisin digestion in the absence of cAMP. The digestion rates of S128A/G141Q and G141Q CRP are dependent on cAMP concentration. Furthermore, the rate decreases in the order of increasing cAMP concentration. The effects of cGMP on the proteolytic digestion patterns of CRP and the mutants were also examined. At a low cGMP concentration (200 μm) no significant effect was observed, while at a high cGMP concentration (50 mm) the rate of protease digestion for both G141Q and S128A/G141Q CRP decreased significantly as compared with the unliganded protein (Fig. 4). Unlike wild type CRP, mutant G141Q CRP can also be activated by cGMP and other cyclic nucleotides for specific DNA binding (19Cheng X. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30781-30784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the binding affinities of the G141Q mutant for cGMP and cAMP were determined by monitoring the fluorescence que"
