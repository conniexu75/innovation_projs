https://openalex.org/W2981679558,"Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technology-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collection involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used."
https://openalex.org/W2988763167,"Shape-morphing systems, which can perform complex tasks through morphological transformations, are of great interest for future applications in minimally invasive medicine1,2, soft robotics3–6, active metamaterials7 and smart surfaces8. With current fabrication methods, shape-morphing configurations have been embedded into structural design by, for example, spatial distribution of heterogeneous materials9–14, which cannot be altered once fabricated. The systems are therefore restricted to a single type of transformation that is predetermined by their geometry. Here we develop a strategy to encode multiple shape-morphing instructions into a micromachine by programming the magnetic configurations of arrays of single-domain nanomagnets on connected panels. This programming is achieved by applying a specific sequence of magnetic fields to nanomagnets with suitably tailored switching fields, and results in specific shape transformations of the customized micromachines under an applied magnetic field. Using this concept, we have built an assembly of modular units that can be programmed to morph into letters of the alphabet, and we have constructed a microscale ‘bird’ capable of complex behaviours, including ‘flapping’, ‘hovering’, ‘turning’ and ‘side-slipping’. This establishes a route for the creation of future intelligent microsystems that are reconfigurable and reprogrammable in situ, and that can therefore adapt to complex situations. A micromachine less than 100 micrometres across, made of arrays of nanomagnets on hinged panels, is encoded with multiple shape transformations  and actuated with a magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2983977092,"Elastic electron–proton scattering (e–p) and the spectroscopy of hydrogen atoms are the two methods traditionally used to determine the proton charge radius, rp. In 2010, a new method using muonic hydrogen atoms1 found a substantial discrepancy compared with previous results2, which became known as the ‘proton radius puzzle’. Despite experimental and theoretical efforts, the puzzle remains unresolved. In fact, there is a discrepancy between the two most recent spectroscopic measurements conducted on ordinary hydrogen3,4. Here we report on the proton charge radius experiment at Jefferson Laboratory (PRad), a high-precision e–p experiment that was established after the discrepancy was identified. We used a magnetic-spectrometer-free method along with a windowless hydrogen gas target, which overcame several limitations of previous e–p experiments and enabled measurements at very small forward-scattering angles. Our result, rp = 0.831 ± 0.007stat ± 0.012syst femtometres, is smaller than the most recent high-precision e–p measurement5 and 2.7 standard deviations smaller than the average of all e–p experimental results6. The smaller rp we have now measured supports the value found by two previous muonic hydrogen experiments1,7. In addition, our finding agrees with the revised value (announced in 2019) for the Rydberg constant8—one of the most accurately evaluated fundamental constants in physics. A magnetic-spectrometer-free method for electron–proton scattering data reveals a proton charge radius 2.7 standard deviations smaller than the currently accepted value from electron–proton scattering, yet consistent with other recent experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2989263805,"Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is targeted for emissions mitigation by the US state of California and other jurisdictions worldwide1,2. Unique opportunities for mitigation are presented by point-source emitters—surface features or infrastructure components that are typically less than 10 metres in diameter and emit plumes of highly concentrated methane3. However, data on point-source emissions are sparse and typically lack sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to guide their mitigation and to accurately assess their magnitude4. Here we survey more than 272,000 infrastructure elements in California using an airborne imaging spectrometer that can rapidly map methane plumes5–7. We conduct five campaigns over several months from 2016 to 2018, spanning the oil and gas, manure-management and waste-management sectors, resulting in the detection, geolocation and quantification of emissions from 564 strong methane point sources. Our remote sensing approach enables the rapid and repeated assessment of large areas at high spatial resolution for a poorly characterized population of methane emitters that often appear intermittently and stochastically. We estimate net methane point-source emissions in California to be 0.618 teragrams per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.523–0.725), equivalent to 34–46 per cent of the state’s methane inventory8 for 2016. Methane ‘super-emitter’ activity occurs in every sector surveyed, with 10 per cent of point sources contributing roughly 60 per cent of point-source emissions—consistent with a study of the US Four Corners region that had a different sectoral mix9. The largest methane emitters in California are a subset of landfills, which exhibit persistent anomalous activity. Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41 per cent), followed by dairies (26 per cent) and the oil and gas sector (26 per cent). Our data have enabled the identification of the 0.2 per cent of California’s infrastructure that is responsible for these emissions. Sharing these data with collaborating infrastructure operators has led to the mitigation of anomalous methane-emission activity10. Emission of methane from ‘point sources’—small surface features or infrastructure components—is monitored with an airborne spectrometer, identifying possible targets for mitigation efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2987503309,"Bacterial chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients of chemoattractants, is among the best-characterized subjects in molecular biology1–10, but much less is known about its physiological roles11. It is commonly seen as a starvation response when nutrients run out, or as an escape response from harmful situations12–16. Here we identify an alternative role of chemotaxis by systematically examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of Escherichia coli in soft agar12,17,18. Chemotaxis in nutrient-replete conditions promotes the expansion of bacterial populations into unoccupied territories well before nutrients run out in the current environment. Low levels of chemoattractants act as aroma-like cues in this process, establishing the direction and enhancing the speed of population movement along the self-generated attractant gradients. This process of navigated range expansion spreads faster and yields larger population gains than unguided expansion following the canonical Fisher–Kolmogorov dynamics19,20 and is therefore a general strategy to promote population growth in spatially extended, nutrient-replete environments. Pioneering bacterial cells use chemotaxis along self-generated attractant gradients to facilitate rapid colonization of nutrient-replete environments."
https://openalex.org/W2984168062,"Bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to inhibit the growth of competitors1. One such mechanism involves type VI secretion systems, which bacteria can use to inject antibacterial toxins directly into neighbouring cells. Many of these toxins target the integrity of the cell envelope, but the full range of growth inhibitory mechanisms remains unknown2. Here we identify a type VI secretion effector, Tas1, in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The crystal structure of Tas1 shows that it is similar to enzymes that synthesize (p)ppGpp, a broadly conserved signalling molecule in bacteria that modulates cell growth rate, particularly in response to nutritional stress3. However, Tas1 does not synthesize (p)ppGpp; instead, it pyrophosphorylates adenosine nucleotides to produce (p)ppApp at rates of nearly 180,000 molecules per minute. Consequently, the delivery of Tas1 into competitor cells drives rapid accumulation of (p)ppApp, depletion of ATP, and widespread dysregulation of essential metabolic pathways, thereby resulting in target cell death. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism for interbacterial antagonism and demonstrate a physiological role for the metabolite (p)ppApp in bacteria. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa attacks competing bacteria using the toxin Tas1, which pyrophosphorylates adenosine nucleotides to generate (p)ppApp, thereby depleting ATP and disrupting multiple cellular functions."

https://openalex.org/W2987479280,"Central to understanding cellular behaviour in multi-cellular organisms is the question of how a cell exits one transcriptional state to adopt and eventually become committed to another. Fibroblast growth factor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (FGF -ERK) signalling drives differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and pre-implantation embryos towards primitive endoderm, and inhibiting ERK supports ES cell self-renewal1. Paracrine FGF-ERK signalling induces heterogeneity, whereby cells reversibly progress from pluripotency towards primitive endoderm while retaining their capacity to re-enter self-renewal2. Here we find that ERK reversibly regulates transcription in ES cells by directly affecting enhancer activity without requiring a change in transcription factor binding. ERK triggers the reversible association and disassociation of RNA polymerase II and associated co-factors from genes and enhancers with the mediator component MED24 having an essential role in ERK-dependent transcriptional regulation. Though the binding of mediator components responds directly to signalling, the persistent binding of pluripotency factors to both induced and repressed genes marks them for activation and/or reactivation in response to fluctuations in ERK activity. Among the repressed genes are several core components of the pluripotency network that act to drive their own expression and maintain the ES cell state; if their binding is lost, the ability to reactivate transcription is compromised. Thus, as long as transcription factor occupancy is maintained, so is plasticity, enabling cells to distinguish between transient and sustained signals. If ERK signalling persists, pluripotency transcription factor levels are reduced by protein turnover and irreversible gene silencing and commitment can occur."
https://openalex.org/W2983671769,"Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects one in ten people older than 65 years. Thus far, there is no cure or even disease-modifying treatment for this disease. The immune system is a major player in the pathogenesis of AD. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, modulates the immune system and reduces recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Theoretical considerations suggested that treatment with BCG may decrease the risk of AD. We tested this hypothesis on a natural population of bladder cancer patients. Methods and findings After removing all bladder cancer patients presenting with AD or developing AD within one-year following diagnosis of bladder cancer, we collected data on a total of 1371 patients (1134 males and 237 females) who were followed for at least one year after the diagnosis of bladder cancer. The mean age at diagnosis of bladder cancer was 68.1 years (SD 13.0). Adjuvant post-operative intra-vesical treatment with BCG was given to 878 (64%) of these patients. The median period post-operative follow-up was 8 years. During follow-up, 65 patients developed AD at a mean age of 84 years (SD 5.9), including 21 patients (2.4%) who had been treated with BCG and 44 patients (8.9%) who had not received BCG. Patients who had been treated with BCG manifested more than 4-fold less risk for AD than those not treated with BCG. The Cox proportional hazards regression model and the Kaplan-Meier analysis of AD free survival both indicated high significance: patients not treated with BCG had a significantly higher risk of developing AD compared to BCG treated patients (HR 4.778, 95%CI: 2.837–8.046, p = 4.08x10-9 and Log Rank Chi-square 42.438, df = 1, p = 7.30x10-11, respectively). Exposure to BCG did not modify the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease, 1.9% in BCG treated patients and 1.6% in untreated (Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 1). Conclusions Bladder cancer patients treated with BCG were significantly less likely to develop AD at any age than patients who were not so treated. This finding of a retrospective study suggests that BCG treatment might also reduce the incidence of AD in the general population. Confirmation of such effects of BCG in other retrospective studies would support prospective studies of BCG in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2983068796,"The ability of a species to colonize newly available habitats is crucial to its overall fitness1–3. In general, motility and fast expansion are expected to be beneficial for colonization and hence for the fitness of an organism4–7. Here we apply an evolution protocol to investigate phenotypical requirements for colonizing habitats of different sizes during range expansion by chemotaxing bacteria8. Contrary to the intuitive expectation that faster is better, we show that there is an optimal expansion speed for a given habitat size. Our analysis showed that this effect arises from interactions among pioneering cells at the front of the expanding population, and revealed a simple, evolutionarily stable strategy for colonizing a habitat of a specific size: to expand at a speed given by the product of the growth rate and the habitat size. These results illustrate stability-to-invasion as a powerful principle for the selection of phenotypes in complex ecological processes. To successfully colonize a habitat in the presence of competing chemotactic bacterial populations, the winner is required to expand its range at a speed given by the habitat size and the population doubling time."
https://openalex.org/W2984511630,"We aimed to assess the ability of deep learning (DL) and support vector machine (SVM) to detect a nonperfusion area (NPA) caused by retinal vein occlusion (RVO) with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. The study included 322 OCTA images (normal: 148; NPA owing to RVO: 174 [128 branch RVO images and 46 central RVO images]). Training to construct the DL model using deep convolutional neural network (DNN) algorithms was provided using OCTA images. The SVM used a scikit-learn library with a radial basis function kernel. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for detecting an NPA were examined. We compared the diagnostic ability (sensitivity, specificity and average required time) between the DNN, SVM and seven ophthalmologists. Heat maps were generated. With regard to the DNN, the mean AUC, sensitivity, specificity and average required time for distinguishing RVO OCTA images with an NPA from normal OCTA images were 0.986, 93.7%, 97.3% and 176.9 s, respectively. With regard to SVM, the mean AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.880, 79.3%, and 81.1%, respectively. With regard to the seven ophthalmologists, the mean AUC, sensitivity, specificity and average required time were 0.962, 90.8%, 89.2%, and 700.6 s, respectively. The DNN focused on the foveal avascular zone and NPA in heat maps. The performance of the DNN was significantly better than that of SVM in all parameters (p < 0.01, all) and that of the ophthalmologists in AUC and specificity (p < 0.01, all). The combination of DL and OCTA images had high accuracy for the detection of an NPA, and it might be useful in clinical practice and retinal screening."

https://openalex.org/W2986060408,"Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitors (SDHIs) are used worldwide to limit the proliferation of molds on plants and plant products. However, as SDH, also known as respiratory chain (RC) complex II, is a universal component of mitochondria from living organisms, highly conserved through evolution, the specificity of these inhibitors toward fungi warrants investigation. We first establish that the human, honeybee, earthworm and fungal SDHs are all sensitive to the eight SDHIs tested, albeit with varying IC50 values, generally in the micromolar range. In addition to SDH, we observed that five of the SDHIs, mostly from the latest generation, inhibit the activity of RC complex III. Finally, we show that the provision of glucose ad libitum in the cell culture medium, while simultaneously providing sufficient ATP and reducing power for antioxidant enzymes through glycolysis, allows the growth of RC-deficient cells, fully masking the deleterious effect of SDHIs. As a result, when glutamine is the major carbon source, the presence of SDHIs leads to time-dependent cell death. This process is significantly accelerated in fibroblasts derived from patients with neurological or neurodegenerative diseases due to RC impairment (encephalopathy originating from a partial SDH defect) and/or hypersensitivity to oxidative insults (Friedreich ataxia, familial Alzheimer's disease)."
https://openalex.org/W2988739665,"The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal association between concurrent, transitory and persistent difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS) on academic performance in children in a. longitudinal child-cohort (N = 3986) targeting school-aged children when they were 7–9 years (T1) and 11–13 years (T2) old, whilst controlling for mental health problems. DIMS were parent-reported at T1 and T2 and academic performance teacher-reported at T2. Mental health was based on child self-report at T2 using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). In all, 10.6% (n = 423) of the children had poor school performance at T2. These had more symptoms of externalizing and internalizing mental health problems (p. < 001) compared to their peers at T2. A logistic regression analysis showed that both concurrent DIMS (at T2, but not at T1) and persistent DIMS (at both T1 and T2) was associated with elevated risk of poor academic performance. After controlling for mental health problems, only persistent DIMS was associated with increased risk of poor academic performance. Transitory DIMS (DIMS at T1 but not at T2) did not increase the risk of later poor academic performance. A mediation analysis also revealed that the association between DIMS and poor school performance was mediated by mental health problems, in addition to an overall significant direct relative effect of DIMS on poor school performance in the persistent DIMS group. These findings support the notion that sleep problems in children are associated with impaired academic performance, and extends past findings demonstrating that sleep problems may not increase the risk of poor academic performance unless they persist over time. The negative effects of persistent sleep problems suggest that more emphasis should be put on preventive interventions of sleep problems in school-aged children."
https://openalex.org/W4239014386,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, NR2A1) is a highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Recent advances reveal that it is a key transcriptional regulator of genes, broadly involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism and also cancers of gastrointestinal tract. However, the exact functional roles of HNF4α in prostate cancer progression are still not fully understood. In this study, we determined the functional significance of HNF4α in prostate cancer. Our results showed that HNF4α exhibited a reduced expression pattern in clinical prostate cancer tissues, prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft model of castration-relapse prostate cancer. Stable HNF4α knockdown not only could promote cell proliferation and suppress doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells, but also confer resistance to paclitaxel treatment and enhance colony formation capacity and in vivo tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. On the contrary, ectopic overexpression of HNF4α could significantly inhibit the cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells, induce cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase and trigger the cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells by activation of p21 signal pathway in a p53-independent manner via its direct transactivation of CDKN1A. Together, our results show that HNF4α performs a tumor suppressor function in prostate cancer via a mechanism of p21-driven cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2986106989,"Although several metallic elements are required for plant growth, excessive amounts of aluminum ions (Al3+) can result in the inhibition of root growth, thus triggering water and nutrient deficiencies. Plants under stress undergo gene expression changes in specific genes or post-transcriptional gene regulators, such as miRNAs, that can lead to stress tolerance. In this study, we investigated the miRNAs involved in the response of sugarcane to aluminum stress. Four miRNA libraries were generated using sugarcane roots of one tolerant and one sensitive sugarcane cultivar grown under aluminum stress and used to identify the miRNAs involved in the sugarcane aluminum toxicity response. The contrast in field phenotypes of sugarcane cultivars in the field during aluminum stress was reflected in the micro-transcriptome expression profiles. We identified 394 differentially expressed miRNAs in both cultivars, 104 of which were tolerant cultivar-specific, 116 were sensitive cultivar-specific, and 87 of which were common among cultivars. In addition, 52% of differentially expressed miRNAs were upregulated in the tolerant cultivar while the majority of differentially expressed miRNAs in the sensitive cultivar were downregulated. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the expression levels of differentially expressed miRNAs. We also attempted to identify target genes of miRNAs of interest. Our results show that selected differentially expressed miRNAs of aluminum-stressed sugarcane cultivars play roles in signaling, root development, and lateral root formation. These genes thus may be important for aluminum tolerance in sugarcane and could be used in breeding programs to develop tolerant cultivars."

This activation requires phosphorylation of key transcription factors regulating IFN production and signaling, including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and STAT1. The mechanisms regulating these STAT1 and IRF3 phosphorylation events remain unclear. Here, using human and mouse cell lines along with gene microarrays, quantitative RT-PCR, viral infection and plaque assays, and reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that a microRNA cluster conserved among bilaterian animals, encoding miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183, regulates IFN signaling. In particular, we observed that the miR-183 cluster promotes IFN production and signaling, mediated by enhancing IRF3 and STAT1 phosphorylation. We also found that the miR-183 cluster activates the IFN pathway and inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus infection by directly targeting several negative regulators of IRF3 and STAT1 activities, including protein phosphatase 2A (PPP2CA) and tripartite motif–containing 27 (TRIM27).

https://openalex.org/W2984404094,"This study aimed to measure abortion safety in Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, and Rajasthan, India using population-based abortion data from representative samples of reproductive age women. Interviewers asked women separately about their experience with “pregnancy removal” and “period regulation at a time when you were worried you were pregnant”, and collected details on method(s) and source(s) of abortion. We operationalized safety along two dimensions: 1) whether the method(s) used were non-recommended and put the woman at potentially high risk of abortion related morbidity and mortality (i.e. methods other than surgery and medication abortion drugs); and 2) whether the source(s) used involved a non-clinical (or no) provider(s). We combined source and method information to categorize a woman’s abortion into one of four safety categories. In Nigeria (n = 1,800), 29.1% of abortions involved a recommended method and clinical provider, 5.4% involved a recommended method and non-clinical provider, 2.1% involved a non-recommended method and clinical provider, and 63.4% involved a non-recommended method and non-clinical provider. The corresponding estimates were 32.7%, 3.0%, 1.9%, and 62.4% in Cote d’Ivoire (n = 645) and 39.7%, 25.5%, 3.4%, and 31.4% in Rajasthan (n = 454). Results demonstrate that abortion safety, as measured by abortion related process data, is generally low but varies significantly by legal context. The policy and programmatic strategies employed to improve abortion safety and quality of care are likely to differ for women in different abortion safety categories."
https://openalex.org/W2985673661,"Purpose To evaluate the relationship between pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and optic disc morphology in glaucoma suspect and glaucoma. Methods Eighty-six eyes of glaucoma suspect and 145 eyes of manifest glaucoma subjects were included in this study. Average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was obtained with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and optic disc imaging was performed using the Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT). Visual function was evaluated with perimetry (SITA and frequency doubling technology) and PERG. Scatter plots and correlation coefficients were evaluated between visual function and RNFL thickness or optic disc structure. Results Scatter plots of PERG and perimetry according to RNFL thickness change showed that PERG started to decrease earlier than did perimetry. The differences between linear and logarithmic R2 were largest for the scatter plot of SITA 24–2 (linear R2 = 0.415; logarithmic R2 = 0.443) and the smallest for P50 amplitude of PERG (linear R2 = 0.136, logarithmic R2 = 0.138). In glaucoma suspect, HRT parameters such as cup shape measure (CSM) and linear cup-disc ratio (CDR) had significant correlations with PERG amplitudes (P = 0.016 for P50 and 0.049 for N95 in CSM, P = 0.012 for P50 in CDR). However, in glaucoma patients, mean RNFL thickness was associated with PERG amplitude (P = 0.011 for P50 and 0.002 for N95). Conclusions PERG deterioration occurred earlier than did perimetry according to RNFL thickness decrease. PERG amplitudes were significantly correlated with disc morphology in glaucoma suspect. These results suggest that PERG can detect ganglion cell dysfunction before the cells die."

Over the past several years, EVs have been shown to be released from flagella and cilia (termed ectosomes). The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas achieves timely degradation of its mother cell wall, a type of extracellular matrix, through the budding of EVs containing a proteolytic enzyme directly from the membranes of its flagella (19Wood C.R. Huang K. Diener D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. The cilium secretes bioactive ectosomes.Curr.

Another study showed that Caenorhabditis elegans-ciliated sensory neurons shed and release EVs containing polycystins LOV-1, the PKD-1 C. elegans ortholog (20Barr M.M. Sternberg P.W. A polycystic kidney-disease gene homologue required for male mating behaviour in C. elegans.Nature. 1999; 401 (10517638): 386-38910.1038/43913Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and PKD-2, and that these EVs were abundant in the lumen surrounding the cilium (21Wang J.

Furthermore, electron microscopy (EM) and genetic analysis indicated that EV biogenesis occurred via budding from the plasma membrane at the ciliary base, and not via fusion of multivesicular bodies, and that intraflagellar transport and the ciliary protein KLP-6 were required for release of PKD-2–containing EVs. The EVs isolated from WT animals induced male tail-chasing behavior, whereas EVs isolated from klp-6 mutant animals lacking PKD-2 did not, indicating that environmentally released EVs play a role in communication and mating-related behaviors (21Wang J.

Finally, it was recently shown, in murine inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) kidney cells, that, when activated, G protein–coupled receptors fail to undergo retrieval from cilia back into the cell. These G protein–coupled receptors concentrate into membranous buds at the tips of cilia before release into ectosomes, and hedgehog-dependent ectocytosis regulates ciliary signaling (22Nager A.R. Goldstein J.S. Herranz-Pérez V. Portran D. Ye F. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Nachury M.V. An actin network dispatches ciliary GPCRs into extracellular vesicles to modulate signaling.Cell. 2017; 168 (28017328): 252-263.e21410.1016/j.cell.2016.11.036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Given the growing evidence of the existence and biological importance of ectosomes, the question of how they are regulated within the cell arises. We hypothesize that the exocyst complex and primary cilia play a critical role in their regulation. The exocyst is a ∼750–kDa octameric protein complex initially identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and is highly conserved from yeast to mammals (23Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y. Scheller R.H.

The mammalian exocyst is comprised of Exoc1–8 (previously called as Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84) (23Hsu S.C. Ting A.E. Hazuka C.D. Davanger S. Kenny J.W. Kee Y.

Most recently, by mutating the VXPX ciliary targeting sequence in Exoc5, we confirmed that the ciliary function of the exocyst is responsible for the phenotypic changes following Exoc5 KD/KO (34Zuo X.

Mutations in an exocyst protein were shown to cause Joubert syndrome, a nephronophthisis form of PKD, in a human family (35Dixon-Salazar T.J. Silhavy J.L. Udpa N. Schroth J. Bielas S. Schaffer A.E.

Med. 2012; 4 (22700954): 138ra178Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). EVs carry many cilia-specific membrane proteins, including the exocyst, regulators of the exocyst (e.g. CDC42), polycystin-2, the protein product of PKD2, as well as ciliary membrane proteins such as Smoothened (36Chacon-Heszele M.F. Choi S.Y. Zuo X. Baek J.I. Ward C. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst and regulatory GTPases in urinary exosomes.Physiol. Rep. 2014; 2 (25138791): e1211610.14814/phy2.12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As noted, we have also shown, using EM (27Zuo X. Guo W. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst protein Sec10 is necessary for primary ciliogenesis and cystogenesis in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20 (19297529): 2522-252910.1091/mbc.e08-07-0772Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Chacon-Heszele M.F. Choi S.Y. Zuo X. Baek J.I. Ward C. Lipschutz J.H.

Thus, a link between the exocyst, primary cilia, and cystic kidney disease has been established. Given that understanding the mechanisms that mediate cilia/EV interactions could be critical to elucidating the biology linking cilia to renal disease, especially PKD, we explored the link between renal primary cilia, urinary EVs, and the exocyst. Here, we show that inhibiting ciliogenesis by Exoc5 knockdown and intraflagellar transport protein 88 (Ift88) knockout leads to a significant decrease in EV number and a change in protein content. EXOC5 overexpression, on the other hand, leads to an increase in EV number, as well as a change in EV protein content. Rescue of the cilia phenotype in Ift88 KO cells with exogenous Ift88 reverses these changes. To determine how loss of cilia changes the number and/or composition of EVs, 1.0 × 105 cells of Exoc5 OE, Exoc5 KD, and control Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were seeded in 12-well Transwell dishes and grown for 10 days with exosome-free medium changed daily. The conditioned medium was collected after the final change. Following harvesting of the medium, purification of the EVs was achieved by a series of ultracentrifugation steps as described under “Materials and Methods.” The nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed with the ZetaView Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer using the settings described under “Materials and Methods.” The ZetaView analysis showed that media from all the cellular conditions (EXOC5 OE, Exoc5 KD, and control MDCK cells) yielded 50–150 nm EVs (Fig. 1A). The number of EVs/ml produced by the Exoc5 KD cells was significantly less, whereas the number of EVs/ml was significantly greater for the EXOC5 OE cells, compared with control MDCK cells (Fig. 1B). Using EM, we confirmed the 50–150 nm size of the EVs (Fig. 1C). To study how Exoc5 changes the composition of EVs, we grew large amounts (nine 15-cm plastic dishes for each replicate) of EXOC5 OE, Exoc5 KD, and control MDCK cells in minimal essential media supplemented with 5% exosome-free FBS, and collected the protein lysate for MS, which was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mass spectrometry was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” We found that Exoc5 perturbation significantly affected the protein composition of EVs as can be seen by the complete segregation of samples in the dendrogram (Fig. 2A), principal components analysis (Fig. 2B), and heat map of differentially expressed proteins (Fig. 2C). The proteomic data were deposited in the ProteomeXchange Database under accession number PXD013549. To confirm the MS results, we performed Western blot analysis on two representative proteins that were interesting candidates based on the literature. We chose to investigate ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6), a small GTPase that has been shown to regulate Exoc5 (37Prigent M. Dubois T. Raposo G. Derrien V. Tenza D. Rossé C. Camonis J. Chavrier P.

We also focused on the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8-like protein 2 (Eps8L2), and Erk, as we, and others, have shown that the exocyst regulates the MAPK pathway via EGFR (29Fogelgren B.

We grew Exoc5 KD, EXOC5 OE, and control MDCK cells, and isolated EVs using ultracentrifugation as described under “Materials and Methods.” Western blotting of lysate from the EVs showed that Exoc5 was virtually absent in Exoc5 KD cell EVs, and significantly increased in EXOC5 OE cell EVs, compared with EVs from control MDCK cells (Fig. 3, A and B). As would be expected from our previous results showing loss of Exoc4 with KD of Exoc5 (27Zuo X. Guo W. Lipschutz J.H.

Also similar to the MS results (Exoc5 KD, 0 ± 0; EXOC5 OE, 33 ± 11.5; MDCK WT, 9.3 ± 3.5), there was significantly less Eps8L2 in EVs from Exoc5 KD cells, compared with EVs from control MDCK and EXOC5 OE cells, and more Eps8L2 in EVs from EXOC5 OE compared with MDCK WT cells (Fig. 3, A and B).

We also used a second EV isolation method, the Total Exosome Isolation Kit (Invitrogen), and found similar results. 1) significantly increased levels of Exoc5 in EVs from EXOC5 OE, and decreased levels of Exoc5 in EVs from Exoc5 KD, compared with EVs from control MDCK cells. 2) Significantly less Eps8L2 in EVs from Exoc5 KD cells, compared with EVs from control MDCK and EXOC5 OE cells, and more Eps8L2 in EVs from EXOC5 OE compared with MDCK WT cells. 3) Significantly more Arf6 in EVs from Exoc5 KD cells, compared with EVs from control MDCK and EXOC5 OE cells, and no significant difference in Arf6 between EVs from EXOC5 OE and MDCK WT cells (Fig. S2). Importantly, there were no differences in Arf6 and Eps8L2 levels in whole cell lysate from Exoc5 OE, KD, and control MDCK cells (Fig. S3).

https://openalex.org/W2987558088,"Tumors are made of evolving and heterogeneous populations of cells which arise from successive appearance and expansion of subclonal populations, following acquisition of mutations conferring them a selective advantage. Those subclonal populations can be sensitive or resistant to different treatments, and provide information about tumor aetiology and future evolution. Hence, it is important to be able to assess the level of heterogeneity of tumors with high reliability for clinical applications. In the past few years, a large number of methods have been proposed to estimate intra-tumor heterogeneity from whole exome sequencing (WES) data, but the accuracy and robustness of these methods on real data remains elusive. Here we systematically apply and compare 6 computational methods to estimate tumor heterogeneity on 1,697 WES samples from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) covering 3 cancer types (breast invasive carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), and two distinct input mutation sets. We observe significant differences between the estimates produced by different methods, and identify several likely confounding factors in heterogeneity assessment for the different methods. We further show that the prognostic value of tumor heterogeneity for survival prediction is limited in those datasets, and find no evidence that it improves over prognosis based on other clinical variables. In conclusion, heterogeneity inference from WES data on a single sample, and its use in cancer prognosis, should be considered with caution. Other approaches to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity such as those based on multiple samples may be preferable for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2984203179,"Hyperspectral imaging enables researchers and plant breeders to analyze various traits of interest like nutritional value in high throughput. In order to achieve this, the optimal design of a reliable calibration model, linking the measured spectra with the investigated traits, is necessary. In the present study we investigated the impact of different regression models, calibration set sizes and calibration set compositions on prediction performance. For this purpose, we analyzed concentrations of six globally relevant grain nutrients of the wild barley population HEB-YIELD as case study. The data comprised 1,593 plots, grown in 2015 and 2016 at the locations Dundee and Halle, which have been entirely analyzed through traditional laboratory methods and hyperspectral imaging. The results indicated that a linear regression model based on partial least squares outperformed neural networks in this particular data modelling task. There existed a positive relationship between the number of samples in a calibration model and prediction performance, with a local optimum at a calibration set size of ~40% of the total data. The inclusion of samples from several years and locations could clearly improve the predictions of the investigated nutrient traits at small calibration set sizes. It should be stated that the expansion of calibration models with additional samples is only useful as long as they are able to increase trait variability. Models obtained in a certain environment were only to a limited extent transferable to other environments. They should therefore be successively upgraded with new calibration data to enable a reliable prediction of the desired traits. The presented results will assist the design and conceptualization of future hyperspectral imaging projects in order to achieve reliable predictions. It will in general help to establish practical applications of hyperspectral imaging systems, for instance in plant breeding concepts."

Here, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to assess size fractionated (0.2 and 5 μm) bacterial (16S) and phytoplankton assemblages (18S) associated with blooms of C. polykrikoides during recurrent blooms in NY, USA. Over a three-year period, samples were collected inside ('patch') and outside ('non-patch') dense accumulations of C. polykrikoides to assess the microbiome associated with these blooms. Eukaryotic plankton communities of blooms had significantly lower diversity than non-bloom samples, and non-bloom samples hosted 30 eukaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs) not found within blooms, suggesting they may have been allelopathically excluded from blooms. Differential abundance analyses revealed that C. polykrikoides blooms were significantly enriched in dinoflagellates (p<0.001) and the experimental enrichment of C. polykrikoides led to a significant increase in the relative abundance of eight genera of dinoflagellates but a significant decline in other eukaryotic plankton. Amoebophrya co-dominated both within- and near- C. polykrikoides blooms and was more abundant in bloom patches. The core bacterial microbiome of the >0.2μm fraction of blooms was dominated by an uncultured bacterium from the SAR11 clade, while the >5μm size fraction was co-dominated by an uncultured bacterium from Rhodobacteraceae and Coraliomargarita. Two bacterial lineages within the >0.2μm fraction, as well as the Gammaproteobacterium, Halioglobus, from the >5μm fraction were unique to the microbiome of blooms, while there were 154 bacterial OTUs only found in non-bloom waters. Collectively, these findings reveal the unique composition and potential function of eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities associated with C. polykrikoides blooms."

The ability to utilize decaying cactus tissues as breeding and feeding sites is a key aspect that allowed the successful diversification of the repleta group in American deserts and arid lands. Within this group, the Drosophila buzzatii cluster is a South American clade of seven closely related species in different stages of divergence, making them a valuable model system for evolutionary research. Substantial effort has been devoted to elucidating the phylogenetic relationships among members of the D. buzzatii cluster, including molecular phylogenetic studies that have generated ambiguous results where different tree topologies have resulted dependent on the kinds of molecular marker used. Even though mitochondrial DNA regions have become useful markers in evolutionary biology and population genetics, none of the more than twenty Drosophila mitogenomes assembled so far includes this cluster. Here, we report the assembly of six complete mitogenomes of five species: D. antonietae, D. borborema, D. buzzatii, two strains of D. koepferae and D. seriema, with the aim of revisiting phylogenetic relationships and divergence times by means of mitogenomic analyses. Our recovered topology using complete mitogenomes supports the hypothesis of monophyly of the D. buzzatii cluster and shows two main clades, one including D. buzzatii and D. koepferae (both strains), and the other containing the remaining species. These results are in agreement with previous reports based on a few mitochondrial and/or nuclear genes, but conflict with the results of a recent large-scale nuclear phylogeny, indicating that nuclear and mitochondrial genomes depict different evolutionary histories."
https://openalex.org/W2986992147,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a major activator of fibrinolysis, which also attenuates the pro-inflammatory activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and in vivo in mice. The activity of tPA as an LPS response modifier is independent of its proteinase activity and instead, dependent on the N-methyl-D-aspartate Receptor (NMDA-R), which is expressed by BMDMs. The major Toll-like receptor (TLR) for LPS is TLR4. Herein, we show that enzymatically-inactive (EI) tPA blocks the response of mouse BMDMs to selective TLR2 and TLR9 agonists, rapidly reversing IκBα phosphorylation and inhibiting expression of TNFα, CCL2, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6. The activity of EI-tPA was replicated by activated α2-macroglobulin, which like EI-tPA, signals through an NMDA-R-dependent pathway. EI-tPA failed to inhibit cytokine expression by BMDMs in response to agonists that target the Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), NOD1 and NOD2, providing evidence for specificity in the function of EI-tPA. Macrophages isolated from the peritoneal space (PMs), without adding eliciting agents, expressed decreased levels of cell-surface NMDA-R compared with BMDMs. These cells were unresponsive to EI-tPA in the presence of LPS. However, when PMs were treated with CSF-1, the abundance of cell-surface NMDA-R increased and the ability of EI-tPA to neutralize the response to LPS was established. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory activity of EI-tPA is selective for TLRs but not all PRRs. The ability of macrophages to respond to EI-tPA depends on the availability of cell surface NMDA-R, which may be macrophage differentiation-state dependent."

Over 300 genes potentially encoding transport of amino acids, metal ions, vitamins and carbohydrates were identified in the genome of the butanol-producing strain Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B-598, based on similarity searches in protein function databases. Transcriptomic data of the genes were obtained during ABE fermentation by RNA-Seq experiments and covered acidogenesis, solventogenesis and sporulation. The physiological roles of the selected 81 actively expressed transport genes were established on the basis of their expression profiles at particular stages of ABE fermentation. This article describes how genes encoding the uptake of glucose, iron, riboflavin, glutamine, methionine and other nutrients take part in growth, production and stress responses of C. beijerinckii NRRL B-598. These data increase our knowledge of transport mechanisms in solventogenic Clostridium and may be used in the selection of individual genes for further research."

Study outcomes (leg and back pain numeric rating scales, modified Oswestry disability index) were measured before surgery, and after 3, 12, and 24 months. Group-based trajectory models were developed to identify trajectory subgroups for leg pain, back pain, and pain-related disability. We examined for differences in the proportion of patients achieving minimum clinically important change in pain and disability (30%) and clinical success (50% reduction in disability or Oswestry score ≤22) 12 months from surgery.Data from 548 patients (mean[SD] age = 66.7[9.1] years; 46% female) were included. The models estimated 3 unique trajectories for leg pain (excellent outcome = 14.4%, good outcome = 49.5%, poor outcome = 36.1%), back pain (excellent outcome = 13.1%, good outcome = 45.0%, poor outcome = 41.9%), and disability (excellent outcome = 30.8%, fair outcome = 40.1%, poor outcome = 29.1%). The construct validity of the trajectory subgroups was confirmed by between-trajectory group differences in the proportion of patients meeting thresholds for minimum clinically important change and clinical success after 12 postoperative months (p < .001).Subgroups of patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis can be identified by their trajectories of pain and disability following surgery. Although most patients experienced important reductions in pain and disability, 29% to 42% of patients were classified as members of an outcome trajectory subgroup that experienced little to no benefit from surgery. These findings may inform appropriate expectation setting for patients and clinicians and highlight the need for better methods of treatment selection for patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis."

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus’ (GDM) pregnancies complicated by fetal macrosomia, large placenta and polyhydramnios contribute for abrupt and intense increase in maternal intra-abdominal pressure. Our objective was analyze the impact of GDM on pelvic floor muscle (PFM) electromyography (EMG) activity progress from 24–30 to 36–38 weeks of gestation. We conducted a prospective cohort study. PFM EMG was performed in nulliparous or primiparous women with one previous elective cesarean delivery and with or not GDM diagnosed by the American Diabetes Association criteria. A careful explanation of the muscle anatomy and functionality of the PFM was given before EMG assessment. The outcome measures were PFM recruitment and progress from 24–30 to 36–38 weeks of gestation analyzed by the normalized root mean square (RMS) during rest-activity, fast and hold pelvic floor muscle contraction. Results Fifty-two pregnant women were assigned to 2 groups: the GDM (n = 26) and normoglycemic (NG) (n = 26). The demographic and obstetric data showed homogeneity between the groups. PFM activity progress was decreased in rest-activity (P = 0.042) and hold contraction (P = 0.044) at 36–38 weeks of gestation in the GDM group relative to that in the NG group. Conclusion GDM group showed a progressive decrease in EMG-PFM activity during rest-activity and hold contractions from 24–30 to 36–38 weeks of gestation."

Although the fastidious lifestyle of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens poses a technical challenge to such manipulations, the last decade has produced significant advances in our ability to conduct molecular genetic analysis in Chlamydia trachomatis, a major bacterial agent of infertility and blindness. Similar approaches have not been established for the closely related veterinary Chlamydia spp., which cause significant economic damage, as well as rare but potentially life-threatening infections in humans. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of conducting site-specific mutagenesis for disrupting virulence genes in C. caviae, an agent of guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis that was recently identified as a zoonotic agent in cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia. Using this approach, we generated C. caviae mutants deficient for the secreted effector proteins IncA and SinC. We demonstrate that C. caviae IncA plays a role in mediating fusion of the bacteria-containing vacuoles inhabited by C. caviae. Moreover, using a chicken embryo infection model, we provide first evidence for a role of SinC in C. caviae virulence in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2985923459,"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is an indicator of the average blood glucose concentration. Failing to control HbA1c levels can accelerate the development of complications in patients with diabetes. Although metabolite profiles associated with HbA1c level in diabetes patients have been characterized using different platforms, more studies using high-throughput technology will be helpful to identify additional metabolites related to diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients were divided into two groups based on the HbA1c level: normal (HbA1c ≤6%) and high (HbA1c ≥9%) in both discovery and replication sets. A targeted metabolomics approach was used to quantify serum metabolites and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant differences between groups. The concentrations of 22 metabolites differed significantly between the two groups in the discovery set. In the replication set, the levels of 21 metabolites, including 16 metabolites identified in the discovery set, differed between groups. Among these, concentrations of eleven amino acids and one phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysoPC a C16:1, were higher and four metabolites, including three PCs (PC ae C36:1, PC aa C26:0, PC aa C34:2) and hexose, were lower in the group with normal HbA1c group than in the group with high HbA1c. Metabolites with high concentrations in the normal HbA1c group, such as glycine, valine, and PCs, may contribute to reducing HbA1c levels in patients with T2D. The metabolite signatures identified in this study provide insight into the mechanisms underlying changes in HbA1c levels in T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2984319847,"Peripheral arterial disease is a global health problem, affecting around 20% of people aged over 60 years. Whilst ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is regularly used for diagnosis, it has a number of limitations, which have presented a need for alternative methods of diagnosis. Multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG) is one such method, but evidence of acceptability of both methods is lacking. This study aims to describe and compare preferences and experiences amongst nurses and patients of ABPI and MPPG use in primary care. We used qualitative research methods in the context of a clinical diagnostic study comparing ABPI with MPPG. Use of ABPI and MPPG by 13 nurses were observed with 51 patients across general practice surgeries in North-East England in 2015/16. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 nurses and 27 patients. Data were thematically analysed. Two major themes were identified: (1) device preferences; (2) test discomfort and anxiety. There was a compelling preference for MPPG due to ease of use, speed of the test, patient comfort, and perceived device accuracy/objectivity. However some patients struggled to identify a preference, describing ambivalence to medical testing. ABPI was deemed uncomfortable and painful, particularly when the blood pressure cuff was inflated at the lower limbs. There was also evidence of anxiety amongst patients when their foot pulses were not identified using ABPI. Whilst ABPI is a non-invasive and routine procedure it was associated with a number of drawbacks in clinical practice. Nurses required considerable dexterity to employ the test, and it resulted in anxiety amongst some patients. Conversely, MPPG was deemed to be easier and quicker to use, and perceived to be less subjective. Should diagnostic accuracy and cost be comparable to ABPI, then the findings of this study suggest MPPG would be preferable to ABPI for patients as well as nurses."
https://openalex.org/W2984617230,"Cognitive impairment (CI) in older adults is frequently accompanied by difficulty performing complex everyday activities (e.g., managing finances). However, it is unclear if and how older adults with CI modify their activities (i.e., Do individuals continue, monitor, seek help with, change their approach to, or stop different activities?). In the current study, we examined if older adults with CI are concerned about their ability to carry out complex activities, if and how they modify activities based on their concern, and the factors associated with activity modification. We hypothesized that older adults with CI will more frequently be concerned about, and modify, everyday activities than cognitively healthy (HE) older adults, and that higher awareness of memory loss in the CI group would relate to more frequent modification. The sample included 81 older adults (51 HEs; mean age 70.02 (7.34) and 30 CI; mean age 75.97 (8.12)). Compared to HEs, the CI group reported having more concern about, F(3,77) = 5.50, p = 0.02, and modifying a greater number of activities, F(3,77) = 5.02, p = 0.03. Medication management (30%) and completing taxes (33.3%) were among the most frequently modified activities for the CI and HE groups, respectively. In the CI group, higher memory awareness was associated with more concern (r = .53, p = .005) and activity modification (r = 0.55, p = .003). Findings provide novel information about how cognitively diverse older adults navigate complex activities in daily life.

https://openalex.org/W2995031867,"Neural activity within the default mode network (DMN) is widely assumed to relate to processing during off-task states, however it remains unclear whether this association emerges from a shared role in self or social content that is common in these conditions. In the current study, we examine the possibility that the role of the DMN in ongoing thought emerges from contributions to specific features of off-task experience such as self-relevant or social content. A group of participants described their experiences while performing a laboratory task over a period of days. In a different session, neural activity was measured while participants performed Self/Other judgements (e.g., Does the word ‘Honest’ apply to you (Self condition) or Barack Obama (Other condition)). Despite the prominence of social and personal content in off-task reports, there was no association with neural activity during off-task trait adjective judgements. Instead, during both Self and Other judgements we found recruitment of caudal posterior cingulate cortex—a core DMN hub—was above baseline for individuals whose laboratory experiences were characterised as detailed. These data provide little support for a role of the DMN in self or other content in the off-task state and instead suggest a role in how on-going thought is represented."

The primary aim of this study was to characterize psychological pain in a cohort of patients participating in outpatient treatment for SUD. A secondary aim was to determine the relationships between pre-treatment assessments of psychological pain, depression, anxiety and hopelessness with treatment retention time and completion rates. Data was analyzed from 289 patients enrolled in an outpatient community drug treatment clinic in Southern California, U.S. A previously determined threshold score on the Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale (MBP) was utilized to group patients into high and low-moderate scoring subgroups. The higher pain group scored higher on measures of anxiety, hopelessness and depression compared to those in the low-moderate pain group. Additionally, patients scoring in the higher psychological pain group exhibited reduced retention times in treatment and more than two-fold increased odds of dropout relative to patients with lower pre-treatment levels of psychological pain. Among all assessments, the correlation between psychological pain and treatment retention time was strongest. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that psychological pain is an important construct which correlates with relevant clinical outcomes in SUD. Furthermore, pre-treatment screening for psychological pain may help target higher-risk patients for clinical interventions aimed at improving treatment retention and completion rates."

A fundamental limitation of live-cell imaging is the presence of intrinsic autofluorescent species that create an undesired, broad spectral background that confounds detection of FP-tagged molecules expressed at low levels. For example, cellular metabolites, such as flavins and NAD(P)H, autofluoresce between 500–550 and 450–500 nm, respectively (6Billinton N. Knight A.W. Seeing the wood through the trees: a review of techniques for distinguishing green fluorescent protein from endogenous autofluorescence.Anal.

Freely diffusing metabolites increase the overall autofluorescence background, whereas cellular compartments with abundant metabolites can create bright spots that can be mistaken for specific fluorescence signals. This is especially true for imaging of small FP-tagged objects, such as single viruses, in living cells (7McDonald D. Vodicka M.A. Lucero G. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Emerman M. Hope T.J.

The development of red and far-red FPs alleviates the green/blue autofluorescence background problem, but limits the choices of FPs for multicolor imaging.

Several approaches have been used to suppress autofluorescence, including spectral unmixing, which takes advantage of a broader emission spectrum of autofluorescence compared with FPs (6Billinton N. Knight A.W. Seeing the wood through the trees: a review of techniques for distinguishing green fluorescent protein from endogenous autofluorescence.Anal.

However, if the intensity of fluorescence signal is comparable with the background, spectral unmixing tends to diminish the useful signal. Also, autofluorescence often comes from several metabolites that may be present at varying concentrations and/or ratios in different cell types or even within the same cell (11Chance B. Schoener B. Oshino R. Itshak F. Nakase Y. Oxidation-reduction ratio studies of mitochondria in freeze-trapped samples: NADH and flavoprotein fluorescence signals.J. Biol.

An alternative autofluorescence suppression technique employs time-gated fluorescence signals that blocks >95% autofluorescence (>20 ns after an excitation pulse), and thereby selectively registers the longer-lived fluorescence of interest (13Rich R.M.

However, this approach has limited utility for many common emitters, such as FPs with relatively short fluorescence lifetimes (1–4 ns) (6Billinton N. Knight A.W. Seeing the wood through the trees: a review of techniques for distinguishing green fluorescent protein from endogenous autofluorescence.Anal.

Chemical treatment or long irradiation to remove autofluorescence before imaging can also reduce background, but it is sample-dependent and not readily compatible with live-cell imaging (6Billinton N. Knight A.W. Seeing the wood through the trees: a review of techniques for distinguishing green fluorescent protein from endogenous autofluorescence.Anal.

An alternative approach to discriminate between the desired signal and obscuring background is to take advantage of FP photophysics. Because of the development of photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (PS-FPs) (e.g. Dronpa, rsFastLime), the dark state population can be reversibly and efficiently modulated by primary and secondary excitations, with minimal fluorescence loss (16Ando R.

Furthermore, the chromophore environment also makes some FPs unmodulatable (e.g. EGFP) (20Jablonski A.E. Hsiang J.C. Bagchi P. Hull N. Richards C.I. Fahrni C.J. Dickson R.M. Signal discrimination between fluorescent proteins in live cells by long-wavelength optical modulation.J. Phys. Chem.

PS-FPs offer unique signal recovery opportunities as they exhibit long-lived, optically modulatable dark states governed by photoisomerization between cis (bright, anionic) and trans (dark, neutral) chromophore conformations that result from differentially stabilizing the two differently absorbing, optically interconvertible chromophore charge states (18Stiel A.C.

Thus, fluorescence of PS-FPs can be optically recovered from the population of photophysical dark states. Such optically recoverable dark states have been widely utilized in super-resolution microscopy through stochastic recovery and proved to be photocontrollable in both fixed and live imaging conditions (23Betzig E.

In the past, OPIOM and SAFIRe have been implemented using home-built microscopes to control the laser intensity or synchronize detection to recover modulated fluorescence from unmodulatable autofluorescence. Here, we harness PS-FP photophysics to adapt SAFIRe to suppress autofluorescence using commercial fluorescence microscopes. We design a simple image acquisition and data processing protocol that markedly improves the ability to reliably visualize faint PS-FP–tagged objects in living cells. Our modulation scheme utilizes existing acquisition software without additional electronics or the need for high-frequency laser modulation. Successful implementation of SAFIRe using commercial microscopes and software will make this technique readily accessible to a wide array of applications by microscopists. PS-FPs can be efficiently photoisomerized and their signals selectively recovered because of their high absorption cross-sections and large reverse isomerization quantum yields. These properties allow considerable alteration of emissive and dark populations by mild illumination intensity (∼10 W/cm2) (21Chen Y.C. Jablonski A.E. Issaeva I. Bourassa D. Hsiang J.C. Fahrni C.J.

Importantly, this enables PS-FP modulation using commercial confocal and wide-field microscopes. To implement SAFIRe imaging on commercial fluorescence microscopes, we utilized rsFastLime (18Stiel A.C. Trowitzsch S. Weber G. Andresen M. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S. Wahl M.C. 1.8 Å bright-state structure of the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein Dronpa guides the generation of fast switching variants.Biochem.

The long-lived dark state of rsFastLime can slowly thermally relax back to the bright manifold of states or can be efficiently and quickly photoactivated by blue light back to the bright manifold. We reasoned that sequential excitation of rsFastLime by 488 nm light would generate both fluorescence and dark state populations, whereas 405-nm light would reactivate fluorescence of rsFastLime, but not fluorescence of endogenous autofluorescent species present in cells. Because only the bright and dark states of rsFastLime, but not autofluorescence, are interconverted upon illumination at 405 and 488 nm, rsFastLime emission should be linearly proportional to the population of 405-nm–photoactivated rsFastLime, thereby distinguishing it from autofluorescence. We designed a modulation scheme for rsFastLime that principally involves exposure to 488 nm (primary) light to generate fluorescence and transient photobleaching, followed by photoactivation/fluorescence recovery with 405 nm (secondary) excitation. Specifically, the imaging scheme was comprised of two elementary images with two intervening conditioning steps to generate each final demodulated image: the 1st elementary image (denoted Image 1, Im1) was collected upon 488 nm illumination, prior to 405 nm photoactivation. Next, PS-FPs were photoactivated by 405-nm illumination followed by acquisition of the 2nd elementary image (Im2) at 488 nm to visualize activated rsFastLime fluorescence. Finally, additional 488 nm illumination was used to photodeactivate rsFastLime back to the dark state (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1 shows an example of the photodarkened (Im1, Fig. 1B) and recovered rsFastLime emission (Im2, Fig. 1C) from NIH-3T3 cells expressing mitochondria-targeted rsFastLime (20Jablonski A.E.

Here, the post-405 nm–activated fluorescence image (Im2) displays an enhanced signal from the mitochondria-targeted rsFastLime, as compared with a dim signal observed before 405 nm activation (Im1). Both images 1 and 2 show similar background autofluorescence patterns. After image subtraction (Im2 − Im1), the demodulated image yielded >15-fold signal-to-background improvement (Fig. 1D) compared with the fluorescence image after activation (Im2). Photoactivation is manifested in fluorescence recovery from secondary wavelength-absorbing dark states of PS-FPs. In contrast, EGFP, which exhibits indistinguishable emission from that of rsFastLime (19Andresen M. Stiel A.C. Fölling J. Wenzel D. Schönle A. Egner A. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Jakobs S.

Therefore, we compared left- and right- sided aneurysms in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in terms of differences in outcome and prognostic factors.Patients with SAH were entered into a prospectively collected database. A total of 509 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were retrospectively selected and stratified in two groups depending on side of ruptured aneurysm (right n = 284 vs. left n = 225). Midline aneurysms of the basilar and anterior communicating arteries were excluded from the analysis. Outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS; favorable (mRS 0-2) vs. unfavorable (mRS 3-6)) six months after SAH.We did not identify any differences in outcome depending on left- and right-sided ruptured aneurysms. In both groups, the significant negative predictive factors included clinical admission status (WFNS IV+V), Fisher 3- bleeding pattern in CT, the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), early hydrocephalus and later shunt-dependence. The side of the ruptured aneurysm does not seem to influence patients´ outcome. Interestingly, the aneurysm side predicts the side of infarction, with a significant influence on patients´ outcome in case of left-sided infarctions. In addition, the in multivariate analysis side of aneurysm was an independent predictor for the side of cerebral infarctions.The side of the ruptured aneurysms (right or left) did not influence patients' outcome. However, the aneurysm-side predicts the side of delayed infarctions and outcome appear to be worse in patients with left-sided infarctions."
https://openalex.org/W2983904295,"Much evidence indicates that metabolic syndrome is strongly correlated with a decrease in nitric oxide and an increase in oxidative stress leading to cardiovascular alterations. In recent years, gut microbiota has emerged as a new contributor to the metabolic syndrome establishment and associated cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that a positive modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, through phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition could prevent cardiovascular alterations and gut dysbiosis that may be associated to metabolic syndrome. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, cafeteria diet (CD) and sildenafil citrate treated groups (5mg/kg per os) were given either a CD or a standard chow diet for 10 weeks. Body weight, arterial blood pressure and glucose tolerance test were monitored. At the 10th week, cardiac inotropy and coronary perfusion pressure were evaluated on isolated heart according to Langendorff method. Cumulative concentration response curves to phenylephrine and acetylcholine were determined on thoracic aorta rings for vascular reactivity evaluation. Faecal samples were collected for the gut microbiota analysis. Compared to the control group, CD-fed rats showed a significant increase in body weight gain, arterial blood pressure and were glucose intolerant. This group showed also a decrease in β-adrenoceptor-induced cardiac inotropy and coronary vasodilation. Gut microbiota analysis revealed a significant reduction in the abundance of Lactobocillus spp in cafeteria diet-fed rats when compared to the control ones. Sildenafil citrate long-term treatment decreased weight gain and arterial blood pressure, improved coronary vasodilation and reduced α1-adrenoceptor-induced vasoconstriction in CD group. However, it did not reverse gut dysbiosis induced by chronic CD feeding. These results suggest that cGMP pathway targeting may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of the metabolic syndrome and associated cardiovascular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2988495821,"Purpose To comprehensively assess the Randot Preschool stereo test in young children, including testability, normative values, test/retest reliability and sensitivity and specificity for detecting binocular vision disorders. Methods We tested 1005 children aged 2–11 years with the Randot Preschool stereo test, plus a cover/uncover test to detect heterotropia. Monocular visual acuity was assessed in both eyes using Keeler Crowded LogMAR visual acuity test for children aged 4 and over. Results Testability was very high: 65% in two-year-olds, 92% in three-year-olds and ~100% in older children. Normative values: In 389 children aged 2–5 with apparently normal vision, 6% of children scored nil (stereoblind). In those who obtained a threshold, the mean log threshold was 2.06 log10 arcsec, corresponding to 114 arcsec, and the median threshold was 100 arcsec. Most older children score 40 arcsec, the best available score. We found a small sex difference, with girls scoring slightly but significantly better. Test/retest reliability: ~99% for obtaining any score vs nil. Agreement between stereo thresholds is poor in children aged 2–5; 95% limit of agreement = 0.7 log10 arcsec: five-fold change in stereo threshold may occur without any change in vision. In children over 5, the test essentially acts only as a binary classifier since almost all non-stereoblind children score 40 arcsec. Specificity (true negative rate): >95%. Sensitivity (true positive rate): poor, <50%, i.e. around half of children with a demonstrable binocular vision abnormality score well on the Randot Preschool. Conclusions The Randot Preschool is extremely accessible for even very young children, and is very reliable at classifying children into those who have any stereo vision vs those who are stereoblind. However, its ability to quantify stereo vision is limited by poor repeatability in children aged 5 and under, and a very limited range of scores relevant to children aged over 5."
https://openalex.org/W2982857386,"Bordetella bacteria are respiratory pathogens of humans, birds, and livestock. Bordetella pertussis the causative agent of whopping cough remains a significant health issue. The transcriptional regulator, BpsR, represses a number of Bordetella genes relating to virulence, cell adhesion, cell motility, and nicotinic acid metabolism. DNA binding of BpsR is allosterically regulated by interaction with 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6HNA), the first product in the nicotinic acid degradation pathway. To understand the mechanism of this regulation, we have determined the crystal structures of BpsR and BpsR in complex with 6HNA. The structures reveal that BpsR binding of 6HNA induces a conformational change in the protein to prevent DNA binding. We have also identified homologs of BpsR in other Gram negative bacteria in which the amino acids involved in recognition of 6HNA are conserved, suggesting a similar mechanism for regulating nicotinic acid degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2984657051,"Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a ds-RNA virus in Fijivirus genus with family Reoviridae, which is transmitted by the small brown planthopper, is responsible for incidence of maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) and rice black-streaked dwarf disease (RBSDD). To understand the variation and evolution of S5, a unique fragment in the genome of RBSDV which encodes two partially overlapping ORFs (ORF5-1 and ORF5-2), we analyzed 127 sequences from maize and rice exhibiting symptoms of dwarfism. The nucleotide diversity of both ORF5-1 (π = 0.039) and ORF5-2 (π = 0.027) was higher than that of the overlapping region (π = 0.011) (P < 0.05). ORF5-2 was under the greatest selection pressure based on codon bias analysis, and its activation was possibly influenced by the overlapping region. The recombinant fragments of three recombinant events (14NM23, 14BM20, and 14NM17) cross the overlapping region. Based on neighbor-joining tree analysis, the overlapping region could represent the evolutionary basis of the full-length S5, which was classified into three main groups. RBSDV populations were expanding and haplotype diversity resulted mainly from the overlapping region. The genetic differentiation of combinations (T127-B35, T127-J34, A58-B35, A58-J34, and B35-J34) reached significant or extremely significant levels. Gene flow was most frequent between subpopulations A58 and B35, with the smallest |Fst| (0.02930). We investigated interactions between 13 RBSDV proteins by two-hybrid screening assays and identified interactions between P5-1/P6, P6/P9-1, and P3/P6. We also observed self-interactive effects of P3, P6, P7-1, and P10. In short, we have proven that RBSDV populations were expanding and the overlapping region plays an important role in the genetic variation and evolution of RBSDV S5. Our results enable ongoing research into the evolutionary history of RBSDV-S5 with two partly overlapping ORFs."
https://openalex.org/W2984775210,"Mechanochemical treatment of phosphate rock is considered as an effective and ecologically clean way of treating the medium- and low-grade phosphorite which could be used as fertilizer instead of the high-grade phosphorite. In order to investigate the effects of different milling times on the mechanochemically activated phosphorite (lower total phosphorus content) by more efficient milling equipment with enhanced milling speed, phosphorus solubility in citric acid and structural characteristics of natural and mechanochemically activated phosphorite from Yichang, China were studied using scanning electron microscope, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Phosphorus solubility in citric acid increased proportionately with the milling time until 30 min (57.51%), but then gradually reached an equilibrium with the maximum (59.03%) in 50 min. These changes were mainly manifested in considerably reduced particle size, decreased crystallinity and increased structural defects of phosphorite due to substitution of PO43- with CO32- and the incorporation of OH-. With the incorporation of CO32- and OH-, the non-activated carbonate-fluorapatite (type B) was transformed into a mixture of carbonate-fluorapatite, hydroxyapatite, fluorocarbon hydroxyapatite and/or carbonate apatite, respectively during the process of mechanochemical activation. As a result of the structural and phase transformations after mechanochemical activation, phosphorus solubility remarkably increased."
https://openalex.org/W2988647784,"The temporal dynamics of stride-to-stride fluctuations in steady-state walking reveal important information about locomotor control and can be quantified using so-called fractal analyses, notably the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Gait dynamics are often collected during treadmill walking using 3-D motion capture to identify gait events from kinematic data. The sampling frequency of motion capture systems may impact the precision of event detection and consequently impact the quantification of stride-to-stride variability. This study aimed i) to determine if collecting multiple walking trials with different sampling frequency affects DFA values of spatiotemporal parameters during treadmill walking, and ii) to determine the reliability of DFA values across downsampled conditions. Seventeen healthy young adults walked on a treadmill while their gait dynamics was captured using different sampling frequency (60, 120 and 240 Hz) in each condition. We also compared data from the highest sampling frequency to downsampled versions of itself. We applied DFA to the following time series: step length, time and speed, and stride length, time and speed. Reliability between experimental conditions and between downsampled conditions were measured with 1) intraclass correlation estimates and their 95% confident intervals, calculated based on a single-measurement, absolute-agreement, two-way mixed-effects model (ICC 3,1), and 2) Bland-Altman bias and limits of agreement. Both analyses revealed a poor reliability of DFA results between conditions using different sampling frequencies, but a relatively good reliability between original and downsampled spatiotemporal variables. Collectively, our results suggest that using sampling frequencies of 120 Hz or 240 Hz provide similar results, but that using 60 Hz may alter DFA values. We recommend that gait kinematics should be collected at around 120 Hz, which provides a compromise between event detection accuracy and processing time."
https://openalex.org/W2983480365,"Optical tweezers have enabled the exploration of picoNewton forces and dynamics in single-molecule systems such as DNA and molecular motors. In this work, we used optical tweezers to study the folding/unfolding dynamics of the APTSTX1-aptamer, a single-stranded DNA molecule with high affinity for saxitoxin (STX), a lethal neurotoxin. By measuring the transition force during (un)folding processes, we were able to characterize and distinguish the conformational changes of this aptamer in the presence of magnesium ions and toxin. This work was supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to propose an unfolding mechanism of the aptamer-Mg+2 complex. Our results are a step towards the development of new aptamer-based STX sensors that are potentially cheaper and more sensitive than current alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W2984344280,"Collaborative Filtering algorithms provide users with recommendations based on their opinions, that is, on the ratings given by the user for some items. They are the most popular and widely implemented algorithms in Recommender Systems, especially in e-commerce, considering their good results. However, when the information is extremely sparse, independently of the domain nature, they do not present such good results. In particular, it is difficult to offer recommendations which are accurate enough to a user who has just arrived to a system or who has rated few items. This is the well-known new user problem, a type of cold-start. Profile Expansion techniques had been already presented as a method to alleviate this situation. These techniques increase the size of the user profile, by obtaining information about user tastes in distinct ways. Therefore, recommender algorithms have more information at their disposal, and results improve. In this paper, we present the High Order Profile Expansion techniques, which combine in different ways the Profile Expansion methods. The results show 110% improvement in precision over the algorithm without Profile Expansion, and 10% improvement over Profile Expansion techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2987593394,"Recently, several wild or semi-wild herds of European bison have been reintroduced across Europe. It is essential for future successful bison reintroductions to know how the European bison use different habitats, which environmental parameters drive their habitat selection, and whether their habitat use and behavioural patterns in new reintroduction sites differ from habitats where European bison have been roaming freely for a long time. Here, we address these questions for a 40-ha enclosed site that has been inhabited by semi-free ranging European bison since 2012. The site, Vorup Meadows, is adjacent to the Gudenå river in Denmark and consists of human-modified riparian meadows. During 2013 we monitored the behavioural pattern and spatial use of the 11 bison present and in parallel carried out floristic analyses to assess habitat structure and food quality in the enclosure. We tested habitat use and selection against environmental parameters such as habitat characteristics, plant community traits, topography, and management area (release area vs. meadow area) using linear regression and spatial models. The bison herd had comparable diurnal activity patterns as observed in previous studies on free-roaming bison herds. Topography emerged as the main predictor of the frequency of occurrence in our spatial models, with high-lying drier areas being used more. Bison did not prefer open areas over areas with tree cover when accounting for habitat availability. However, they spent significantly more time in the release area, a former agricultural field with supplementary fodder, than expected from availability compared to the rest of the enclosure, a meadow with tree patches. We wish to increase awareness of possible long-term ethological effects of the release site and the management protocols accomplished here that might reduce the ecological impact by the bison in the target habitat, and thereby compromise or even oppose the conservation goals of the conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2983769620,"Intra-bone marrow transplantation (IBMT) has been adapted for mouse models to improve the seeding efficiency of transplanted hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Commonly used injection volumes for IBMT into the tibia differ between 10 and 40 μL even though considerable amounts of injected cells leak into the blood circulation immediately after injection. Injection of 3 μL trypan blue into the tibia of dead BALB/c mice showed staining in large vessels of hind limbs, even without supporting circulation. We therefore tested the effective capacity of the medullary cavity of dissected tibiae and femora of different mouse strains by bioluminescence imaging after injection of luciferase expressing cells. Cell leakage was already observed at 3 μL of injection volume and the measured emission rate increased significantly when 5 and 10 μL of volume with the same cell concentration were injected. Surprisingly, increasing injection volumes containing constant cell amounts resulted in comparable emission rates, suggesting a similar amount of leaked and absorbed cells independent of the injection volume. However, the absorption of a specific amount of injected cells could not be confirmed, as the ratio of leaked to absorbed cells was similar between IBMT that were performed with a constant injection volume containing either low or high cell amounts. In summary, for optimal cell transplantation via IBMT in mice we suggest to inject a high concentrated cell suspension with a maximum injection volume of 3 μL."
https://openalex.org/W2982887663,"To determine the proportion of care provided to children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in Australia consistent with clinical practice guidelines.Indicators were developed from national and international clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations and validated by an expert panel. Medical records from children ≤15 years presenting with AGE in three healthcare settings-Emergency Department (ED), hospital admissions and General Practitioner (GP) consultations-from randomly selected health districts across three Australian States were reviewed. Records were audited against 35 indicators by trained paediatric nurses, to determine adherence to CPGs during diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management.A total of 14,434 indicator assessments were performed from 854 healthcare visits for AGE by 669 children, across 75 GPs, 34 EDs and 26 hospital inpatient services. Documented adherence to guidelines across all healthcare settings was 45.5% for indicators relating to diagnosis (95% CI: 40.7-50.4), 96.1% for treatment (95% CI: 94.8-97.1) and 57.6% for ongoing management (95% CI: 51.3-63.7). Adherence varied by healthcare setting, with adherence in GPs (54.6%; 95% CI: 51.1-58.1) lower than for either ED settings (84.7%; 95% CI: 82.4-86.9) or for inpatients (84.3%; 95% CI: 80.0-87.9); p<0.0001 for both differences. The difference between settings was driven by differences in the diagnosis and ongoing management phases of care.Adherence to clinical guidelines for children presenting to healthcare providers with AGE varies according to phase of care and healthcare setting. Although appropriate diagnostic assessment and ongoing management phase procedures are not well documented in medical records (particularly in the GP setting), in the treatment phase children are treated in accordance with guidelines over 90% of the time."
