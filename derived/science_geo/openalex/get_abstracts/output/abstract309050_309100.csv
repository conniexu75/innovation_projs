https://openalex.org/W1963675041,"Capsian occupation in the Cheria-Telidjene region of northeastern Algeria coinides with a phase of alluviation (about 9500 to 6500 years ago) with a semi-arid climate that was cooler and more humid than today.
Capsian subsistence was based on a combination of hunting (gazelle, aurochs and hartebeest), land snail collecting, and presumably plant gathering.
Partial excavation of the Ain Misteheya escargotiere has provided a number of insigths into Capsian subsistence, settlement and diet.
The artifact assemblage from Ain Misteheyia falls within the established general parameters for the Capsien superieur.
In sum, we interpret the Capsian subsistence adaptation as innovative, conservationist, and highly successful - so much so, in fact, that despite the appearance of Neolithic economic practices in neighboring regions by about 7000 years ago, the Capsian pattern in the Maghreb appears to have remained basically inchanged for a further two millenia."

https://openalex.org/W1966244040,"Powder reflections, as well as single face reflections of large spacing, have been obtained from palmitic and other fatty acids. Single specimens with all the optical properties of a crystal and giving the same large spacing X-ray reflections as solidified films on glass have been grown from solution of palmitic acid in acetone. This acid, at least, therefore appears to be truly crystalline under these conditions and not in a ""smectic"" or other sub-crystalline state. Since the X-ray data from this acid are strictly analogous to those from other typical ""smectic"" substances, it seems necessary further to conclude that no definite X-ray evidence yet exists for this ""smectic"" state. The symmetry of palmitic acid is either monoclinic or triclinic and the long carbon chains are not normal to the face producing the large spacing reflections. Such spacings are therefore not direct measures of the lengths of these chains. By growing single plates of the acid from solution more intense reflections from the long spacings have been obtained than from films made by solidifying the acid on glass or mica. Such single crystals may prove especially useful as gratings in long wave length X-ray spectrography."
