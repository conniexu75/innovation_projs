https://openalex.org/W2073134590,"Malignant gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors and are almost always fatal. A thymidine kinase-negative mutant of herpes simplex virus-1 (dlsptk) that is attenuated for neurovirulence was tested as a possible treatment for gliomas. In cell culture, dlsptk killed two long-term human glioma lines and three short-term human glioma cell populations. In nude mice with implanted subcutaneous and subrenal U87 human gliomas, intraneoplastic inoculation of dlsptk caused growth inhibition. In nude mice with intracranial U87 gliomas, intraneoplastic inoculation of dlsptk prolonged survival. Genetically engineered viruses such as dlsptk merit further evaluation as novel antineoplastic agents."

https://openalex.org/W1982635793,"The secondary structures in solution of the synthetic, naturally occurring, amyloid β peptides, residues 1 to 42 [β(1-42)] and β(1-39), and related fragments, β(1-28) and β(29-42), have been studied by circular dichroism and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, extracellular amyloid plaque core is primarily composed of β(1-42), whereas cerebrovascular amyloid contains the more soluble β(1-39). In aqueous trifluoroethanol solution, the β(1-28), β(1-39), and β(1-42) peptides adopt monomeric α-helical structures at both low and high pH, whereas at intermediate pH (4 to 7) an oligomeric β structure (the probable structure in plaques) predominates. Thus, β peptide is not by itself an insoluble protein (as originally thought), and localized or normal age-related alterations of pH may be necessary for the self-assembly and deposition of β peptide. The hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal segment, β(29-42), exists exclusively as an oligomeric β sheet in solution, regardless of differences in solvent, pH, or temperature, suggesting that this segment directs the folding of the complete β(1-42) peptide to produce the β-pleated sheet found in amyloid plaques."

https://openalex.org/W2054726996,"The role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression in natural killer (NK) cell target recognition is controversial. Normal T cell blasts from MHC class I-deficient mutant mice were found to serve as target cells for NK cells in vitro, which suggests that MHC class I molecules are directly involved in NK cell recognition. Spleen cells from the mutant mice were deficient in their ability to lyse MHC class I-deficient target cells or NK-susceptible tumor targets, and mutant mice could not reject allogeneic bone marrow. Thus, class I molecules may participate in the positive selection or tolerance induction of NK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017900917,"We describe the cDNA encoding the SV40 transcriptional enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1) and show that its translation initiates exclusively at an AUU codon in vivo. Cloned TEF-1, which is unrelated to other known transcription factors, specifically binds the SV40 GT-IIC and Sph enhansons. Cloned TEF-1 does not activate these enhansons in lymphoid MPC11 cells where they are known to be inactive, but represses the endogenous HeLa TEF-1 activity in vivo and in vitro. Repression is also observed with chimeras where the DNA-binding domain of the GAL4 activator replaces that of TEF-1, showing that repression results from interference/squelching. Such chimeras stimulate transcription in HeLa, but not in MPC11, cells in vivo and in HeLa cell extracts in vitro. However, high concentrations result in self-interference/squelching. These results strongly suggest that the trans-activation function of TEF-1 is mediated by a highly limiting, possible cell-specific, titratable transcriptional intermediary factor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1626322384,"The thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor in human platelets is coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein whose identity has remained unknown. Candidates for this role include the atypical G protein known as Gz and members of a recently discovered G protein family known as Gq. Because of the proven utility of antibodies directed against the C terminus of G protein alpha subunits as functional probes, we prepared an antibody against a synthetic decapeptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence shared by alpha 11 and alpha q, two members of the new family. This antibody (QL) does not recognize known alpha subunits but selectively binds to a 42-kDa protein in a variety of tissues, including human platelet membranes. QL and two other C-terminal antibodies, QN and AS, known to recognize alpha z and alpha i2, respectively, were tested for their ability to block agonist-stimulated GTPase activity in human platelet membranes. Pretreatment of platelet membranes with AS has previously been shown to interfere with alpha 2 adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylylcyclase. As expected, only AS antibody produced inhibition of alpha 2 receptor-stimulated GTPase. Pretreatment of membranes with QL, but not QN or AS, caused marked inhibition of TXA2 receptor-stimulated GTPase. This identifies the G protein coupled to human platelet TXA2 receptors as a member of the novel Gq family."

https://openalex.org/W1577906027,"In bacterial chemotaxis, transmembrane receptor proteins detect attractants and repellents in the medium and send intracellular signals that control motility. The cytoplasmic proteins that transduce information from the receptors to the flagellar motor have previously been purified and many of their enzymatic activities have been identified. Here we report the reconstitution of the complete signal transduction system from purified components. The protein kinase, CheA, plays a central role in both the initial excitation response to stimuli as well as subsequent events associated with adaptation. This kinase provides phosphoryl groups to two acceptor proteins, CheY, which interacts with the flagellar motor, and CheB, which demethylates the receptors. The purified aspartate receptor, Tar, reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, acts in conjunction with an auxiliary protein, CheW, to stimulate the rate of kinase autophosphorylation greater than 10-fold. This stimulation is inhibited by aspartate. The activity of the kinase is increased by increased levels of receptor methylation. This effect provides a mechanism that explains how changes in receptor methylation mediate adaptive responses to attractant and repellant stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2054707540,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) directs signal sequence specific targeting of ribosomes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Displacement of the SRP from the signal sequence of a nascent polypeptide is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent reaction mediated by the membrane-bound SRP receptor. A nonhydrolyzable GTP analog can replace GTP in the signal sequence displacement reaction, but the SRP then fails to dissociate from the membrane. Complexes of the SRP with its receptor containing the nonhydrolyzable analog are incompetent for subsequent rounds of protein translocation. Thus, vectorial targeting of ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum is controlled by a GTP hydrolysis cycle that regulates the affinity between the SRP, signal sequences, and the SRP receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2022111320,"Competition between larval populations of the native North American treehole mosquito Aedes triseriatus and Aedes albopictus, recently introduced from Asia to North America, was assessed by comparing per capita growth rate estimates for experimental cohorts of larvae developing under a variety of initial density combinations in fluid obtained from tires or from treeholes. Estimates of carrying capacities and competition coefficients indicate that competition between the two species will result in stable coexistence in treehole communities but local extinction of A. triseriatus in tire habitats."
https://openalex.org/W1977861466,"A mutated form of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta receptor lacking most of its cytoplasmic domain was tested for its ability to block wild-type PDGF receptor function. PDGF induced the formation of complexes consisting of wild-type and truncated receptors. Such complexes were defective in autophosphorylation. When truncated receptors were expressed in excess compared to wild-type receptors, stimulation by PDGF of receptor autophosphorylation, association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with the receptor, and calcium mobilization were blocked. Thus, a truncated receptor can inactivate wild-type receptor function by forming ligand-dependent receptor complexes (probably heterodimers) that are incapable of mediating the early steps of signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2013091488,"Genetic recombination in Escherichia coli is stimulated at DNA sequences known as Chi sites, 5'-GCT-GGTGG-3'. We describe the in vitro formation of homologously paired joint molecules that is dependent upon this recombination hotspot. Chi-dependent joint molecule formation requires RecA, RecBCD, and SSB proteins and a Chi site in the donor linear dsDNA. The donor dsDNA is unwound by RecBCD enzyme, and the invasive strand is generated by nicking at Chi. This Chi-dependent invading strand must contain homology to the recipient supercoiled DNA substrate at its newly formed 3' end for efficient joint molecule formation. Action at Chi generates invasive ssDNA from the 5' but not the 3' side of Chi, suggesting that the nuclease activity of RecBCD enzyme is attenuated upon encountering a Chi site. These results support the view that RecBCD enzyme action can precede RecA protein action and reconcile the seemingly opposing degradative and recombination functions of RecBCD enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1598566568,"The cardiac glycoside sensitivity of the rat heart changes during postnatal maturation and in response to certain pathological conditions. The Na,K-ATPase is thought to be the receptor for cardiac glycosides, and there are three isozymes of its catalytic (alpha) subunit with different cardiac glycoside affinities: alpha 1 (low affinity) and alpha 2 and alpha 3 (high affinity). We examined the developmental expression of the alpha subunit isozymes in rat ventricular membrane preparations by immunoblotting with isozyme-specific antibodies. The alpha 1 isozyme was present throughout all stages of maturation. A developmental switch from alpha 3 to alpha 2 occurred between 14 and 21 days after birth. Measurements of [3H]ouabain binding and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity indicated that alpha 2 and alpha 3 should make equivalent contributions to ion pump capacity; in both neonatal natal and adult preparations, ouabain interacted with a single class of high-affinity binding sites (KD = 15 or 40 nM, respectively; Bmax = 4-5 pmol/mg protein), and at low concentrations produced a similar degree of Na,K-ATPase inhibition (25%). The results indicate that the developmental difference in cardiac glycoside sensitivity cannot be explained by quantitative differences in the proportion of high-affinity isozymes of the Na,K-ATPase. The switch from alpha 3 to alpha 2 coincides with other major changes in cardiac electrophysiology and calcium metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1524131371,"To examine the role of protein phosphatases in T cell activation, Jurkat cells were treated with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A phosphatases, and nuclear extracts were examined for the presence of AP1 as a measure of early T cell activation. Okadaic acid was found to be a potent inducer of AP1. In contrast to phorbol esters such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the induction of AP1 by okadaic acid occurs predominantly by transcriptional activation of the jun and fos family of proto-oncogenes. Surprisingly, while the addition of phytohemagglutinin further enhanced the induction of AP1, the addition of PMA inhibited it. Okadaic acid treatment was found to dramatically increase mRNA transcripts of the jun family of proto-oncogenes including c-jun, junD, and junB and to a lesser extent the fos family including c-fos and fra-1. By comparison, PMA is a very inefficient inducer of the jun gene family in Jurkat cells. Similar to its effect on the induction of AP1 by okadaic acid, PMA inhibits the induction of c-jun mRNA by okadaic acid. Transfection of c-jun promoter constructs confirmed the marked difference between PMA and okadaic acid in inducing c-jun transcription. The induction of AP1 by okadaic acid suggests that protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) may be involved in T cell activation as important negative regulators of the transcription factor AP1."

https://openalex.org/W2132236578,"A series of mutant avian beta-adrenergic receptors with progressively truncated carboxyl termini have been expressed in insect and mammalian cells. Removal of 18-124 amino acid residues caused multiple phenotypic changes in the receptor. Membranes from cells that expressed the truncated receptors displayed elevated basal (2- to 3-fold) and agonist-stimulated adenylylcyclase activities. Adenylylcyclase activity in these membranes also displayed greater stimulation in response to partial agonists. Activity was also markedly stimulated by beta-adrenergic ligands that are usually considered to be antagonists (alprenolol, greater than 4-fold; propranolol, approximately 2-fold). Wild type receptor did not mediate a response to these classical antagonists. After purification and reconstitution with Gs, the truncated receptors did not appear to be more active than the wild type. Guanine nucleotides modulated the affinity of agonist for the truncated receptors, whereas the affinity of agonist for the wild type receptor was not altered by guanine nucleotides. The truncated receptors were solubilized from the membrane more efficiently and were more susceptible to amino-terminal proteolysis than was the wild type protein. These results suggest interaction of the carboxyl terminus of the avian beta-adrenergic receptor with cellular regulatory or structural elements."
https://openalex.org/W1501353479,"Competitive hormone binding studies with membrane and partially purified receptors from Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that the oocyte possesses high affinity (KD = 1-3 nM) binding sites for both insulin growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), but not for insulin. Consistent with these findings, IGF-1 activates hexose uptake by Xenopus oocytes with a KA (3 nM) identical with its KD, while IGF-2 and insulin activate hexose uptake with KA values of 50 nM and 200-250 nM, respectively, suggesting activation mediated through an IGF-1 receptor. Both IGF-1 and insulin activate receptor beta-subunit autophosphorylation and, thereby, protein substrate (reduced and carboxyamidomethylated lysozyme, i.e. RCAM-lysozyme) phosphorylation with KA values comparable to their respective KD values for ligand binding and KA values for activation of hexose uptake. The autophosphorylated beta-subunit(s) of the receptor were resolved into two discrete components, beta 1 and beta 2 (108 kDa and 94 kDa, respectively), which were phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine and which exhibited similar extents of IGF-1-activated autophosphorylation. When added prior to autophosphorylation, RCAM-lysozyme blocks IGF-1-activated autophosphorylation and, thereby, IGF-1-activated protein substrate (RCAM-lysozyme) phosphorylation. Based on these findings, we conclude that IGF-1-stimulated autophosphorylation of its receptor is a prerequisite for catalysis of protein substrate phosphorylation by the receptor's tyrosine-specific protein kinase. The IGF-1 receptor kinase is implicated in signal transmission from the receptor, since anti-tyrosine kinase domain antibody blocks IGF-1-stimulated kinase activity in vitro and, when microinjected into intact oocytes, prevents IGF-1-stimulated hexose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1537329253,"A gluconeogenic strain of renal epithelial cells (LLC-PK1-F+) was used to characterize the effect of pH and bicarbonate concentration on the levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) and glutaminase (GA) mRNAs. The levels of both mRNAs are markedly dependent upon medium glucose concentration. The level of PCK mRNA is increased with increasing glucose concentration from 0 to 40 mM, whereas the level of GA mRNA is maximal between 3 and 5 mM glucose. When LLC-PK1-F+ cells are grown with 5 mM glucose and then subjected to an acute decrease in pH (from 7.4 to 6.9) and bicarbonate concentration (from 25 to 10 mM), the level of PCK mRNA exhibits a biphasic response. The PCK mRNA is initially increased 4-fold within 3 h, then decreases slightly and subsequently increases between 10 and 20 h to a level that is 17-fold greater than normal. Only the initial increase parallels the changes observed in vivo. In contrast, after onset of acidosis, the level of GA mRNA initially remains unchanged, is then increased 8-fold between 10 and 16 h, and then decreases slightly. This response closely mimics the results obtained in vivo. A decrease in media pH at constant bicarbonate causes a marked increase in both mRNAs. However, the levels of the two mRNAs are also elevated by decreasing bicarbonate at a constant pH. Thus, both parameters independently affect the level of the two mRNAs. The use of actinomycin D to measure the half-lives of PCK and GA mRNAs at pH 7.4 and 6.9 indicates that stabilization may fully account for the induction of GA mRNA and contributes to the inductive effects of decreased pH and/or bicarbonate on PCK mRNA. Following recovery from acidic conditions, the two mRNAs exhibit a rapid and coordinate decrease (t1/2 approximately 20 min). Dexamethasone had no effect on the level of either mRNA, whereas cAMP increased only PCK mRNA. The latter effect was additive with the increase caused by decreased pH and/or bicarbonate and was reversed by incubating in alkalotic media. Thus, the induction of PCK and GA mRNAs during acidosis is initiated in direct response to a decrease in extracellular pH and/or bicarbonate."
https://openalex.org/W1531617647,"We describe the molecular organization of the human gene coding for type I DNA topoisomerase. The coding sequence is split into 21 exons distributed over at least 85 kilobase pairs (kb) of human genomic DNA. The sizes of the 20 introns vary widely between 0.2 and at least 30 kb and all contain the sequence elements known to be required for pre-mRNA splicing. Several of the intron sequences separate exons encoding parts of the enzyme that are highly conserved between human and yeast suggesting that at least some of the exons may code for individual, structurally, or functionally important domains of the enzyme. We also describe the promoter sequence of the human topoisomerase I gene and show that it is composed of distinct functional elements."
https://openalex.org/W2053338459,"Fractionation of a microsomal detergent extract with ammonium sulfate allows separation of the signal recognition particle receptor (SRα), which is required for targeting of the nascent chain, from other microsomal proteins, such as signal peptidase, whose activity is displayed during subsequent translocation. The reconstituted SRα-enriched fraction is functional in assays of precursor targeting and elongation arrest release but lacks translocation activity. This defect can be complemented by addition, prior to reconstitution, of a separate protein subfraction. In addition, protein components necessary for translocation can be reversibly depleted from the complementary fraction, under conditions where precursor targeting is retained, by sulfhydryl-directed chromatography. Thus, precursor binding and translocation can be biochemically uncoupled, indicating that they are sequential reactions mediated by distinct components."
https://openalex.org/W1591800820,"The cleavage and religation reactions of eukaryotic topoisomerase II were studied by use of a 5'-recessed DNA substrate containing a strong recognition sequence for the enzyme. Cleavage of the DNA substrate was suicidal, that is the enzyme was unable to religate the cleaved DNA due to a release of DNA 5' to the cleavage position. With this substrate cleavage products accumulated with time in the absence of protein-denaturing agents, and the cleavage reaction was not reversible with salt. The suicide cleavage complexes contained a kinetically competent topoisomerase II enzyme as determined by the enzyme's ability to perform intermolecular ligation of the cleaved DNA to a free 3'-hydroxyl end on another DNA strand. The efficiency of the religation reaction depended on the ability of the religation substrate to base pair to the DNA in the cleaved enzyme-DNA complex. Higher levels of religation were obtained with dinucleotides than with long DNA substrates. Mononucleotides also were efficiently religated, indicating an ability of the enzyme to mediate religation without making contacts to a long stretch of nucleotides 5' to the cleavage position."

https://openalex.org/W1597493417,"Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins from bovine brain were resolved by fast protein liquid chromatography chromatography using Mono Q columns. Two distinct forms of the protein Go were identified. Both forms had stochiometric amounts of alpha- and beta gamma-subunits. The a-subunits of both forms were recognized by an alpha o-specific antiserum, but not by any of the alpha i-specific antisera. The two forms showed distinct migration patterns on 9% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing 4-8 M urea gradients. Neither form comigrated with the recombinant alpha o1. Both the recombinant alpha o1 and the most abundant form of Go were recognized by an antiserum, H-660, against a peptide encoding amino acids 3-17 of alpha i2. H-660 has been shown previously to recognize alpha o and alpha i (Mumby, S. M., Pang, I. K., Gilman, A. G., and Sternweis, P. C. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2020-2026). This more abundant form is called Go A most likely corresponds to the cloned alpha o1. The less abundant form, Go B, was not recognized by H-660. However, both forms of bovine brain Go were recognized by GC/2, an antiserum against the N-terminal region of alpha o1. Hence alpha oA and alpha oB may be different in their N terminus regions. Neither form of bovine brain Go was recognized by an antisera made to a peptide encoding the unique regions of the cloned alpha o2 from HIT cells (Hsu W. H., Rudolph, U., Sanford, J., Bertrand, P., Olate, J., Nelson, C., Moss, L.E., Boyd, A. E., III, Codina, J., and Birnbaumer, L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11220-11226). Go A and Go B have similar guanine nucleotide binding and release properties. Both release GDP within 1 min in the absence of added Mg2+. Both bind guanosine (GTP gamma S) rapidly as well. However Go A binds GTP gamma S about 2.5-fold faster than Go B, in the absence of added Mg2+ ion. Both forms of Go as well as the recombinant alpha o (alpha o1) can increase muscarinic stimulation of inositol trisphosphate-mediated Cl- current in Xenopus oocytes. These data indicate that we have identified two structurally distinct forms of Go that have different guanine nucleotide binding properties and are capable of functioning in the receptor-regulated phospholipase C pathway in Xenopus oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1524656006,"We identified transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-binding proteins which are distinct from previously described TGF-beta receptors or TGF-beta-binding proteins. These TGF-beta-binding proteins migrate as 150- and 180-kDa 125I-TGF-beta 1 affinity-labeled complexes which are consistently co-expressed in A549, Mv1Lu, MG-63, and BS-C-1 cells. They differ from the types I, II, and III TGF-beta receptors in their electrophoretic mobilities, their lack of binding to TGF-beta 2, and their failure to undergo the marked down-regulation seen with types I, II, and III receptors following a 16-h incubation with TGF-beta 1. The 150- and 180-kDa TGF-beta-binding proteins also are distinct from the recently described disulfide-linked TGF-beta 1-binding proteins which are present in rat glomeruli. In contrast to the glomerular TGF-beta 1-binding proteins, the electrophoretic mobilities of the 150- and 180-kDa binding proteins are unchanged following reduction. In addition, the 150- and 180-kDa TGF-beta-binding proteins are present in the detergent-rich phase during Triton X-114 phase separation, whereas the glomerular TGF-beta-binding proteins partition exclusively into the detergent-poor phase."
https://openalex.org/W1566530341,"Membranes from chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage were fractionated by equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation and assayed for galactosyl xylose transferase, chondroitin polymerization and sulfation as well as the marker enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase, NADH cytochrome c reductase, galactosyl ovalbumin transferase, and sialyltransferase. The order of distribution of chondroitin sulfate synthesis from dense to light membranes correlated with the established sequence of events for its synthesis. The linkage region enzyme, viz. galactosyl xylose transferase, distributed with NADH cytochrome c reductase in an earlier and heavier cis compartment. Chondroitin polymerization and sulfation had a dual distribution similar to the galactosyl ovalbumin transferase and sialyltransferase in separate later and lighter medial and trans compartments, or in an extended medial or trans compartment. The galactosyl xylose transferase had a distribution distinctly different from that of the galactosyl ovalbumin transferase indicating that these distinct enzymes showed no cross-reactivity with their respective acceptor substrates. The dual distribution of chondroitin sulfate synthesis was consistent with our previous demonstration of the two nascent proteochondroitin populations produced by microsomal preparations from the same source. The results indicated separate subcellular locations for synthesis of the two forms."
https://openalex.org/W1495106776,"Active B2 bradykinin (BK) receptors were solubilized in high yields from intact monolayers or particulate fractions of cultured human foreskin fibroblasts using 4 mM of the non-denaturing zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS). Other detergents showed only minor (digitonin) or no (Triton X-100, n-octyl glucopyranosid) efficacy at all. The stability of CHAPS-solubilized BK binding activity was temperature dependent being reduced to 30% of initial binding after 3 days of storage at 4 degrees C. CHAPS extracts, however, retained BK binding activity for at least several days when they were stored at -20 degrees C in the presence of 10% glycerol. The pharmacological characterization gave a rank order of potency for unlabeled BK, BK agonists, and antagonists to compete with [3H]BK for specific binding very similar to that observed in intact fibroblasts. Association and dissociation kinetics demonstrated that the binding of [3H]BK to the soluble CHAPS extracts was time dependent and reversible. Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data exhibited saturable binding of a single class of high affinity BK-binding sites with a Kd of 1.68 +/- 0.8 nM. Gel filtration revealed an apparent molecular weight of 250,000 for the solubilized BK receptor complex in CHAPS extracts. The ability to solubilize the B2 BK receptor in an active and stable form should allow for its future purification and for the characterization of its chemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1541081932,"The major tyrosine phosphatase activity against angiotensin detected in membranes of the antigen-specific T cell hybridoma 2B4 is contained in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD45 molecule. When these cells are stimulated with either an antibody directed against the T cell antigen receptor or an activating anti-Thy-1 antibody, there is a rapid redistribution of CD45 in the cells. The redistribution can be observed in two ways: morphology and subcellular fractionation. Morphologic examination of resting cells reveals intense CD45 staining of the Golgi as well as surface staining. Upon activation the Golgi is rapidly cleared of CD45. This redistribution is specific for CD45 and is not observed for an intrinsic Golgi protein, mannosidase II, or a protein traversing the secretory pathway, the T cell receptor. In activated cells, in contrast to resting cells, approximately 30% of the total cellular CD45 is precipitated either at 280 x g or at 200,000 x g through a 2.2 M sucrose cushion after cell homogenization. This fraction is not accessible to cell surface labeling. CD45 redistribution does not require hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositides and cannot be reproduced by the addition of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. It does require the presence of an intact functional T cell receptor on the cell surface. These studies suggest that the residence time of CD45 within an intracellular organelle can be acutely regulated by a signal mediated via the T cell receptor. This regulation may control access of this phosphatase to critical substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1598105244,"Abstract Herpes simplex virus (HSV) ribonucleotide reductase is formed by the association of two distinct dimeric subunits, R1 and R2. Attempts to purify either the HSV holoenzyme or its R1 subunit in their active form have been unsuccessful until now. The C terminus of the R2 protein being involved in the association with R1, the synthetic nonapeptide corresponding to this terminus, impedes the formation of the holoenzyme by competing with R2 for a critical site on R1. Based upon these observations, we developed an affinity chromatographic procedure to purify the R1 protein from HSV-1-infected baby hamster kidney cells. Specific binding of R1 to an affinity column made by linking the peptide HSV R2-(326-337) to Affi-Gel 10, followed by specific elution with an excess of an analogous peptide exhibiting a higher affinity for R1 yielded, in a single step, highly purified R1 protein. The purified R1 preparations contained approximately 95% of intact R1, the remaining 5% consisting of two R1 copurifying proteolytic breakdown products. The purified R1 protein exhibited a high reductase specific activity when mixed with an excess of the R2 subunit. Moreover, in vitro kinase assays revealed that the purified R1 protein of HSV-1 possesses an autophosphorylating activity also able to phosphorylate alpha-casein and histone II-S. The intrinsic protein kinase activity of HSV R1 is associated with its unique N-terminal domain which is absent from all other reductase subunits 1 and contains consensus motifs found in Ser/Thr protein kinases. A preliminary characterization of the kinase activity of the R1 protein of HSV-1 ribonucleotide reductase is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1591560513,"A large variety of proOmpF-Lpps, hybrid secretory proteins composed of the signal region of proOmpF and the mature part of the major lipoprotein, either possessing or not possessing a proline residue near the amino terminus of their mature domains, were constructed at a DNA level, and the rates of their in vitro translocation were determined in the presence and absence of the proton motive force (delta muH+). A proline residue at the signal peptide cleavage site (position +1) blocked the cleavage reaction but not the translocation reaction. All the proOmpF-Lpps examined exhibited approximately the same translocation rate in the presence of delta muH+ irrespective of the presence or absence of a proline residue near the amino terminus. In the absence of the delta muH+, which was achieved by either depletion of the respiratory substrate or the use of urea-treated membrane vesicles permeable to protons, proOmpF-Lpps possessing a proline residue near the amino terminus of the mature domain were translocated whereas those possessing no proline residue in this region were not translocated at all or only very weakly. The position of the proline residue was then moved stepwise away from the amino terminus of the mature domain. The further the position was moved away, the slower was the rate of translocation in the absence of delta muH+. The removal of the proline residue at position +2 of the mature domain of proOmpA also made the delta mu(H+)-independent translocation appreciably slower. It is suggested that the conformational flexibility endowed by the proline residue on the junction region between the signal peptide and the mature domain allows the translocation in the absence of delta muH+ and that this junction region must take on a particular conformation for initiation of the translocation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2154721987,"Protein-mediated exchange of homologous DNA strands is a central reaction in general genetic recombination and the mechanism by which proteins mediate this process in vivo is a topic of keen interest. The dda protein of the bacteriophage T4 is a DNA helicase that has been shown to accelerate branch migration catalyzed by the phage uvsX and gene 32 proteins in vitro (Kodadek, T., and Alberts, B.M. (1987) Nature 326, 312-314). This study did not address the potential role of the helicase in protein-mediated homologous pairing, the first phase of the overall strand-exchange reaction. It is shown here that the dda protein inhibits uvsX protein-mediated pairing between homologous single and double-stranded DNAs. Experiments using deproteinized heteroduplex joints demonstrate that the dda helicase is capable of unwinding these structures to some extent and suggests that this activity may be responsible for the observed inhibition of pairing. It is found that the helicase also reduces the level of uvsX protein-mediated, single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis in the strand-exchange reactions, suggesting that the helicase may also act to destabilize the uvsX protein-DNA filaments that are important intermediates in the pairing reaction. Three other helicases are found to have no effect on the uvsX protein-mediated pairing reaction. A model rationalizing the ability of the dda protein to both inhibit homologous pairing and stimulate branch migration is presented and possible in vivo roles for this interesting activity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585885299,"This paper documents the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on the processing and transport of viral envelope glycoproteins in a retrovirus-transformed murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell line. BFA is a fungal metabolite that disrupts intracellular membrane traffic at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi complex junction. In MEL cells, BFA inhibited the processing of the newly synthesized precursor, gPr90env, of the murine leukemia virus envelope protein, gp70, and curtailed the budding of virions into the culture medium by blocking the transport of this protein out of the ER. The block resulted in the intracellular accumulation of gPr90env and two putative products of its processing (78 and 66 kDa). The results of endoglycosidase (endo) H and D digestion of the viral glycoproteins in the presence and absence of BFA indicated that (i) there was no glycoprotein processing during the first approximately 2 h of the BFA block; (ii) active Golgi enzymes relocated to the ER in approximately 2 h during BFA treatment, resulting in the production of partially endo H-resistant forms of the spleen focus-forming virus glycoprotein, gp55 (in controls, this glycoprotein was generally retained in the ER as an endo H-sensitive entity); and (iii) proteolytic processing of gPr90env to gp70 occurred prior to the acquisition of endo H resistance and at approximately the same time as endo D sensitivity (i.e. in a cis Golgi compartment). In control cells, the spleen focus-forming virus glycoprotein, gp55, underwent turnover with a half-life of approximately 5 h. In contrast, its turnover was considerably slower during BFA treatment (t 1/2 = approximately 20 h), suggesting that transport of gp55 out of the ER was required for its degradation or that BFA afforded it protection from proteolysis within the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1600235544,"Purification of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) or bombesin receptor has proved elusive in part due to technical difficulties. In the present studies, the problem of oxidized radioligand was avoided by the use of 125I-GRP, which was verified to be not oxidized by high performance liquid chromatography. Specific 125I-GRP binding (at 0 degrees C) to intact human small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H345 cells which had been subjected to a dilute acid wash was 6 fmol/10(6) cells. Inhibition of GRP degradation by human H345 cell membranes through the use of phenanthroline or phosphoramidon permitted the development of binding assays for the GRP receptor in detergent-solubilized crude membrane preparations. The solubilized GRP receptor exhibited saturable, high affinity (KD = 1.3 nM), temperature-dependent specific binding averaging 402 +/- 65 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- S.E. for eight separate membrane preparations with 125I-GRP concentration = 3 nM), with a Bmax = 434 fmol/mg protein using a gel filtration binding assay. That the GRP receptor had been solubilized was demonstrated by its failure to pellet when centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min, its passage through a 0.22-micron filter without loss of binding activity, and its elution in the void volume of a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column, but within the inclusion volume of a Sephacryl S-200 column (Ve/V0 = 1.1). Isolation of the GRP receptor from human H345 cell-solubilized membranes was achieved by ligand affinity chromatography. A unique 70-kDa band on silver-stained reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was reproducibly eluted from GRP14-27 affinity columns by an acidic high salt buffer, but binding activity was denatured by these conditions. The protein nature of the GRP receptor was demonstrated by its sensitivity to proteases after isolation. In addition, two unique bands of 65 and 70 kDa were eluted from the GRP14-27 affinity column with GRP14-27 in neutral buffer, and this eluate possessed specific 125I-GRP binding with a stoichiometry of approximately 1:1. Thus, reported here is the isolation of a functional membrane-associated, saturable, high affinity GRP receptor with temperature-dependent binding from the solubilized membranes of human H345 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1560836664,"Previous suggestions (Hubert, J. J., Schenk, D. B., Skelly, H., and Leffert, H. L. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 4156-4163) of tissue-specific isoforms or nonexistence of hepatic Na,K-ATPase beta 1-subunits were reevaluated by quantifying beta 1-subunit mRNA levels in quiescent and proliferating liver. RNA was extracted from caudate liver lobes of sham or 67% hepatectomized adult rats and from primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes that simulate developmental and regenerating growth transitions. Northern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled full-length Na,K-ATPase beta 1-cDNA probe (Mercer, R. W., Schneider, J. W., Savitz, A., Emmanuel, J., Benz, T.J., and Levenson, R. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 3884-3890) revealed four (approximately 2.7, 2.4, 1.7-1.8, and 1.5 kilobases) low abundance mRNA species in quiescent tissue, freshly isolated hepatocytes, and cultured hepatocytes derived from lag or late stationary phase (1-2 days or 11-12 days postplating, respectively). In contrast, proliferating liver from 4 h post-67% hepatectomized rats or cultured hepatocytes in logarithmic growth phase contained levels of beta 1-subunit mRNA which exceeded quiescent levels by 4-35-fold. Membrane Na,K-ATPase activity also increased 2-3-fold during liver regeneration 12-24 h after partial hepatectomy. When proliferation in vitro was augmented by transforming growth factor-alpha, a hepatocyte mitogen, or reinitiated in late stationary phase by a change to fresh culture medium containing rat serum, beta 1-subunit mRNA expression was restimulated 4-20-fold. Parallel measurements of alpha-tubulin mRNA induction showed relatively nonsynchronous or invariant changes during hepatocyte proliferative transitions; similar results were obtained after Northern blots with a sodium pump alpha I-subunit cDNA probe. No detectable hybridization signals were observed when either rat kidney or hepatocyte RNAs from freshly isolated and cultured cells or regenerating tissues were probed for the sodium pump 3.4-kilobase mRNA beta 2-isoform. These observations suggest that enhanced hepatic beta 1-subunit gene expression is linked specifically to growth-associated increases in Na,K-ATPase activity, hepatocyte proliferation, and mitogen activation."

https://openalex.org/W1517851497,"Abstract The individual pretreatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with either 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (HCB) has been previously shown to result in the induction of [3H]TCDD specific binding activity in hepatic tissue. In the present work, the coadministration of TCDD and HCB increased the concentration of hepatic proteins capable of binding [3H]TCDD specifically by at least 2-3-fold. This increase was shown not to be the result of activation, by HCB, of a form of the receptor having low affinity toward [3H]TCDD into a form with high affinity. Kinetic analysis of the time course of binding of [3H]TCDD to induced cytosol was consistent with the presence of an binding protein in addition to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor present in cytosol from untreated animals. The liganded ([3H]TCDD) form of the inducible binding component lost its ligand much faster than the liganded form of the constitutive Ah receptor at 37 degrees C; apparent first order rate constants for loss of [3H]TCDD were 0.55 min-1 and less than 0.0024 min-1, respectively. Conversely, the unliganded form of the induced binding component was slightly more stable (approximately 2-fold) toward thermal inactivation than the unbound constitutive Ah receptor. The [3H]TCDD-bound protein(s) in uninduced and induced cytosols behaved identically in a sucrose gradient; 8.7-8.9 S in the absence of salt, shifted to 5.5 S by 0.4 M KCl. They were also indistinguishable by gel permeation chromatography, and by photoaffinity labeling their TCDD-binding subunits, approximate molecular weights 105,000. These results show the hepatic TCDD-binding protein(s) induced upon pretreatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with TCDD/HCB to be kinetically distinct from the Ah receptor, but structurally very similar."
https://openalex.org/W1482878708,"Abstract To study cross-talk between unoccupied epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and activated EGF receptor kinases, we have used double-transfected cells, IHE2 cells, expressing both an enzymatically active insulin-EGF chimeric receptor and an inactive kinase EGF receptor mutant. Using immunoaffinity-purified receptors, we show that insulin increased phosphorylation of the insulin-EGF chimeric beta subunit and of the kinase-deficient EGF receptor. Stimulation of intact IHE2 cells with insulin leads to a rapid tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin-EGF chimeric beta subunit and to tyrosine phosphorylation of the unoccupied kinase-deficient EGF receptor. Insulin-stimulated transphosphorylation of the kinase-deficient EGF receptor yields the same pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides as those in EGF-induced autophosphorylation of the wild-type human EGF receptor. We conclude that insulin, through activation of the insulin-EGF chimeric receptor, mediates transphosphorylation of the kinase-deficient EGF receptor, further confirming that EGF receptor autophosphorylation may proceed by an intermolecular mechanism. In addition to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, we find that exposure of cells to insulin results in enhanced phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues of the unoccupied kinase-deficient EGF receptor. These results suggest that insulin-EGF chimeric receptor activation stimulates at least one serine/threonine kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the kinase-deficient EGF receptor. Finally, we show that transphosphorylation and coexpression of an active kinase cause a decrease in the number of cell surface kinase-deficient EGF receptors without increasing their degradation rate."
https://openalex.org/W1507081668,"DNA cleavage by eukaryotic type II DNA topoisomerase (EC 5.99.1.3) was strongly inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing 10 dGua residues. Catalytic activities of topoisomerase II, as measured by relaxation and decatenation reactions, were also inhibited by oligo(dG)10. Inhibition was specific to oligo(dG)10; other oligonucleotides, nucleotides, or single-stranded DNAs tested did not influence the activity of topoisomerase II. Oligo(dG)10 did not inhibit other activities such as restriction enzymes. Although the enzyme neither binds nor cleaves oligo(dG)10, inhibition can be explained by the finding that topoisomerase II binds tightly with aggregated oligo(dG) structures (estimated to contain between 20 and 30 molecules of monomeric oligo(dG)10) that form spontaneously prior to addition of enzyme. These aggregated oligo(dG)-topoisomerase complexes are large networks that can be pelleted by a 20-min centrifugation step in a Microfuge. Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody confirmed that topoisomerase II is trapped in these pellets. The ability of the enzyme to form large DNA-protein networks could be a biochemical mechanism by which topoisomerase II might promote or participate in chromosome condensation in vivo prior to mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1518894649,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone known to play an important role as a modulator of hematopoietic processes in human and murine cells. One of the characteristics of TGF-beta 1 is the ability to inhibit the growth of several cell types, including cells of the myeloid lineage. To study the mechanism by which TGF-beta 1 inhibits the growth of myeloid cells, we have used three murine myeloid cell lines, the parental interleukin-3-dependent 32D-123 cell line and two retrovirally infected interleukin-3-independent cell lines (32D-abl, 32D-src), all of which are growth inhibited by TGF-beta 1. Each of these oncogene-transfected cells expresses a greater number of TGF-beta 1 receptors than the parental cell line and responds to TGF-beta 1 with increased sensitivity; 32D and 32D-src cells are 2- and 58-fold more sensitive to TGF-beta 1 inhibition than the parental cell line (ED50 = 35 pM). Both 32D-abl- and 32D-src-transformed cell lines expressed higher levels of the 65- and 85-kDa TGF-beta 1 receptor species than did the parental cells. We observed a correlation between the greater sensitivity of 32D-src cells to TGF-beta 1 and the more rapid down-modulation and reappearance of cell surface TGF-beta 1 receptors on 32D-src cells. Thus, the level of TGF-beta 1 receptor expression and rate of reexpression both have a crucial regulatory effect on the functional activity of the TGF-beta 1 ligand."

https://openalex.org/W2065325874,"The dioxin receptor is the focus of current controversy regarding safe exposure levels for dioxin. Although the mechanisms are unclear, many of the toxic effects of dioxin have been linked to its receptor, leading to suggestions that most if not all of the toxic and carcinogenic effects of dioxin may be mediated by the dioxin receptor. If this is so, exposures to concentrations of dioxin well below the dissociation constant of dioxin from the receptor are unlikely to lead to toxicity, and standard methods for the extrapolation of dioxin's toxic and carcinogenic effects to lower doses would result in overestimation of the risks of exposure"
https://openalex.org/W1588692096,"Mouse embryo fibroblasts were grown in low and control O2 for 24 h (average medium oxygen tensions, 7 torr and 143 torr, respectively). Relative to controls, there was a reduction in radiolabeled subunits in immunoprecipitates of cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome b.c1 prepared from low O2 cells. Incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into subunit I of cytochrome oxidase and the apocytochrome b protein of the b.c1 complex ranged from 51-100% of control, whereas the appearance of these pulse-labeled subunits into holoenzymes immunoprecipitated from low O2 cells was in the range of 6-39% of control. The synthesis of subunit II of cytochrome oxidase by low O2 cells ranged from 63-100% of control, and assembly of this protein into the low O2 immunoprecipitated enzyme ranged from 15-61% of control. Thus, the data suggest that O2 had an effect on the assembly of these mitochondrially translated proteins that was independent of any effect on their synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1480793438,"We have observed previously that some chimeric replicons inclusive of a partly duplicated polyomavirus (Py) genome yield unit-length Py DNA (P155) at high frequency when transfected into normal or Py-transformed mouse cells. We demonstrate here that one such replicon generates either P155 or illegitimate recombination products in other mouse cells, transformed by simian virus 40. Use of the polymerase chain reaction indicates that each of the illegitimate products carried a different deletion, but that all deletions mapped within a rather well defined portion of the precursor replicon. Thus, these products were organized as if two hotspots for recombination existed in the Py late-coding region, one being located within or near one of the duplicated sequences characteristic of the chimeric replicon. Since this particular hotspot has already been shown to be involved in the generation of P155, the data reported here could indicate that a single recombination mechanism can yield either homologous (P155) or illegitimate products. How the DNA interacts with certain proteins, such as papovavirus large tumor antigen, could explain why one or the other type of product is formed."
