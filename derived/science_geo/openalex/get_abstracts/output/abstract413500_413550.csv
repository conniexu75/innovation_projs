https://openalex.org/W2146739527,"Biomarker discovery from high-dimensional data is a crucial problem with enormous applications in biology and medicine. It is also extremely challenging from a statistical viewpoint, but surprisingly few studies have investigated the relative strengths and weaknesses of the plethora of existing feature selection methods. In this study we compare 32 feature selection methods on 4 public gene expression datasets for breast cancer prognosis, in terms of predictive performance, stability and functional interpretability of the signatures they produce. We observe that the feature selection method has a significant influence on the accuracy, stability and interpretability of signatures. Surprisingly, complex wrapper and embedded methods generally do not outperform simple univariate feature selection methods, and ensemble feature selection has generally no positive effect. Overall a simple Student's t-test seems to provide the best results."
https://openalex.org/W1996164472,"The progression of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to invasive and metastatic disease may involve localized occurrences of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, mechanisms of the EMT process in CRC progression are not fully understood. We previously showed that knockdown of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) up-regulated E-cadherin (a key component in EMT progression) in CRC. In this study, we examined the roles of STAT3 in CRC EMT and ZEB1, an EMT inducer, in STAT3-induced down-regulation of E-cadherin. Knockdown of STAT3 significantly increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin and vimentin expressions in highly invasive LoVo CRC cells. Meanwhile, overexpression of STAT3 significantly reduced E-cadherin and enhanced N-cadherin and vimentin expressions in weakly invasive SW1116 CRC cells. Activation of STAT3 significantly increased CRC cell invasiveness and resistance to apoptosis. Knockdown of STAT3 dramatically enhanced chemosensitivity of CRC cells to fluorouracil. STAT3 regulated ZEB1 expression in CRC cells, and the STAT3-induced decrease in E-cadherin and cell invasion depended on activation of ZEB1 in CRC cells. Additionally, pSTAT3Tyr-705 and ZEB1 expressions were significantly correlated with TNM (tumor, lymph node, and metastasis stages) (p < 0.01). In conclusion, STAT3 may directly mediate EMT progression and regulate ZEB1 expression in CRC. ZEB1 may participate in STAT3-induced cell invasion and E-cadherin down-regulation in CRC cells. The expressions of pSTAT3Tyr-705 and ZEB1 may be positively associated with CRC metastasis. Our data may provide potential targets to prevent and/or treat CRC invasion and metastasis.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in the initiation of the metastatic spread of tumor cells to distal organs (3.Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y.

EMT may promote epithelial cells to escape from the rigid structural constraints provided by the tissue architecture and adopt a phenotype more amenable to cell migration and movement (4.Hay E.D.

Therefore, EMT can be regarded as a pathological process that contributes to cancer progression, particularly in tumor cell invasion and metastasis (9.Arias A.M.

The initiation and progression of EMT require transduction of cell signals. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and activated Ras pathways have been implicated as key EMT inducers in CRC cancer (10.Bhowmick N.A. Ghiassi M. Bakin A. Aakre M. Lundquist C.A.

The Wnt, PI3K/AKT, and other signaling pathways may also play an important role in the EMT process in CRC progression (12.Joyce T. Cantarella D. Isella C. Medico E. Pintzas A.

Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that abnormalities in the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway are involved in CRC oncogenesis (16.Spano J.P.

STAT3 mRNA and protein expression in colorectal cancer. Effects on STAT3-inducible targets linked to cell survival and proliferation.J. Clin. Pathol. 2007; 60: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As a key component of the JAK/STAT pathway, STAT3 is constitutively activated in CRC (18.Xiong H. Zhang Z.G. Tian X.Q. Sun D.F. Liang Q.C. Zhang Y.J. Lu R. Chen Y.X. Fang J.Y. Inhibition of JAK1,2/STAT3 signaling induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reduces tumor cell invasion in colorectal cancer cells.Neoplasia. 2008; 10: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and several lines of evidence have supported its role in mediating cell motility and migration. STAT3 is important for the migration of sheets of cells in zebrafish embryo development (19.Yamashita S. Miyagi C. Carmany-Rampey A. Shimizu T. Fujii R. Schier A.F. Hirano T. Stat3 controls cell movements during zebrafish gastrulation.Dev.

Keratinocyte-specific ablation of Stat3 exhibits impaired skin remodeling, but does not affect skin morphogenesis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4657-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Additionally, gastrin may induce EMT in CRC through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (21.Ferrand A. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Bertrand C. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Dufresne M. Seva C. Involvement of JAK2 upstream of the PI 3-kinase in cell-cell adhesion regulation by gastrin.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 301: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). EGF receptor is overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma, whereas EGF-induced EMT in ovarian cancer cells has been shown to depend on IL-6R and the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (22.Colomiere M. Ward A.C. Riley C. Trenerry M.K. Cameron-Smith D. Findlay J. Ackland L. Ahmed N. Cross-talk of signals between EGFR and IL-6R through JAK2/STAT3 mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian carcinomas.Br. J. Cancer. 2009; 100: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, the role of STAT3 in the EMT process of CRC progression is not fully understood. Loss of E-cadherin expression is a crucial step and fundamental event of EMT in cancer progression (3.Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7557) Google Scholar). As a key component of adherens junctions, E-cadherin plays a crucial role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity (23.Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Sticky business. Orchestrating cellular signals at adherens junctions.Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Many studies have reported on the regulation of E-cadherin during cancer progression (3.Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y.

Critical role of Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling in motility and invasiveness of carcinoma cells following Snail-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Genes Cells. 2011; 16: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and several proteins, including Snail, ZEB1, and ZEB2, have been identified that may down-regulate E-cadherin in various cancers (3.Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7557) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we found that knockdown of STAT3 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly increased E-cadherin expression in CRC cells (18.Xiong H. Zhang Z.G. Tian X.Q. Sun D.F. Liang Q.C. Zhang Y.J. Lu R. Chen Y.X. Fang J.Y. Inhibition of JAK1,2/STAT3 signaling induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reduces tumor cell invasion in colorectal cancer cells.Neoplasia. 2008; 10: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Whether STAT3 contributes to the EMT process of CRC progression and the mechanisms of STAT3-induced E-cadherin down-regulation are not known. We now show that STAT3 may directly induce cell invasion and participate in resistance to chemotherapy drugs and apoptosis during EMT of CRC progression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that STAT3 may directly mediate the EMT process and ZEB1 expression of CRC progression. STAT3-induced cell invasion and decrease in E-cadherin expression depend on activation of ZEB1 in CRC cells. The combination of pSTAT3Tyr-705/ZEB1 may be a novel predictor of CRC metastasis and a potential therapeutic target. Two human CRC cell lines SW1116 and LoVo (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For AG490 (pharmacological JAK2 inhibitor; Sigma) treatment, CRC cells were incubated with 100 μm AG490 for 24 h (18.Xiong H. Zhang Z.G. Tian X.Q. Sun D.F. Liang Q.C. Zhang Y.J. Lu R. Chen Y.X. Fang J.Y.

The DNA fragment encoding the STAT3 gene (GenBank® accession number NM_003150) was amplified from human cDNA with the primers STAT3-F (5′-GCTAAGCTTTATGGCCCAATGGAATCAGCTACAG-3′ and STAT3-R (5′-GCTCTCGAGTCATGGGGGAGGTAGCGCACTCCG-3′), which introduced the cloning sites HindIII and XhoI (underlined), respectively. The cDNA fragment obtained above was verified by sequencing and finally cloned into pCDNA3.1 between the HindIII and XhoI sites to obtain pCDNA3.1-STAT3. The wild type DNA fragment containing part of the promoter region (−520 to +70 from transcriptional initiation site) of the E-cadherin gene (GenBank® accession number NM_004360) and the wild type DNA fragment containing part of the promoter region (−500 to +100 from the transcriptional initiation site) of the ZEB1 gene (GenBank® accession number NM_001174094) were amplified from human genomic DNA with the following primers, respectively: E-cadherinP-F (5′-GGGGTACCTGTCTCTCTACAAAAAGGCA-3′) and E-cadherinP-R (5′-GGAAGATCTGGGCTGGAGCGGGCTGGAGT-3′); ZEB1 P-F (5′- GGGGTACCAAAGACGTTTCCTTATTCGA-3′) and ZEB1 P-R (5′- GAAGATCTAGAAAGGCGACGGGCTGACC-3′), which introduced the cloning sites KpnI and BglII (underlined), respectively. The DNA fragment obtained above was directly cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) between the KpnI and BglII sites to obtain pGL3-E-cadherinPWT and pGL3-ZEB1PWT. The mutant DNA sequences of the ZEB1 promoter region encompassing both of the two putative binding sites of STAT3 (−500 to +100 from the transcriptional initiation site) or the mutant DNA sequences of the E-cadherin promoter region encompassing both of the two putative binding sites of STAT3 and four putative binding sites of ZEB1 (−520 to +70 from transcriptional initiation site) were synthesized and inserted into pGL3-basic vector. The mutant type constructs were designated as pGL3-basic-ZEB1P MT, pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP STAT3B MT, pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP ZEB1B MT, and pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP STAT3B and ZEB1B MT, respectively. T was replaced with G in each STAT3 binding site of pGL3-basic-ZEB1P MT, pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP STAT3BMT, and pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP STAT3B and ZEB1B MT constructs. CT and CTG was replaced with AA and AAA in each ZEB1 binding site of pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP ZEB1B MT and pGL3-basic-E-cadherinP STAT3B and ZEB1B MT constructs, respectively. The siRNA against ZEB1 (TCF8; catalog no. L-006564-01-0005), the siRNA against STAT3 (catalog no. L-003544-00-0005), and the control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technology (Lafayette, CO). Twenty-four h before transfection at 30–40% confluence, CRC cells were transferred to 6-well plates. Transfection of siRNAs was carried out with DharmaFECT 1 siRNA transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were collected for analysis 48 h after transfection. For plasmid transfections, CRC cells (70% confluence, ∼5 × 106 cells) were transfected with 2 μg of pCDNA3.1-STAT3 or pCDNA3.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were collected for measurements 48 h after transfection. To stably knock down ZEB1, we infected SW1116 and LoVo cells with MISSION shRNA lentivirus particles (with the puromycin resistance gene) containing a U6 promoter driving shRNA targeting human ZEB1 or scramble negative control (Sigma-Aldrich). Methods used for lentivirus production and infection were performed as described by Gire et al. (26.Gire V. Roux P. Wynford-Thomas D. Brondello J.M. Dulic V. DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk2 triggers replicative senescence.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the protocol of the manufacturer, and 1.5 μg of total RNA from cultured cells was reverse transcribed using the PrimeScriptPTMP RT reagent kit (Perfect Real Time) for RT-PCR (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 7900 quantitative PCR system. The primers used were as follows: ZEB1-F (5′-GCCAATAAGCAAACGATTCTG-3′), ZEB1-R (5′-TTTGGCTGGATCACTTTCAAG-3′), ZEB2-F (5′-CGGTGCAAGAGGCGCAAACA-3′), ZEB2-R (5′-GGAGGACTCATGGTTGGGCA-3′), Snail1-F (5′-CACTATGCCGCGCTCTTTC-3′), Snail1-R (5′-GGTCGTAGGGCTGCTGGAA-3′), Snail2-F (5′-AAACTACAGCGAACTGGACACA-3′), Snail2-R (5′-GCCCCAAAGATGAGGAGTATC-3′), Twist1-F (5′-AGTCCGCAGTCTTACGAGGA-3′), Twist1-R (5′- GCCAGCTTGAGGGTCTGAAT-3′), Twist2-F (5′-CAAGCTGAGCAAGATCCAGAC-3′), Twist2-R (5′-GGTCATCTTATTGTCCATCTCG-3′), E12/E47-F (5′- TCAAGCAATAACTTCTCGTCCA-3′), E12/E47-R (5′-CGTCCAGGTGGTCTTCTATCTT-3′)18S-F (5′-CGGACAGGATTGACAGATTGATAGC-3′), and 18S-R (5′-TGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCGTTATCG-3′). All reactions were performed in triplicate in a 10-μl total volume containing Brilliant® SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Takara, Shiga, Japan). The amplified transcript level of each specific gene was normalized to that of 18S. Western blot analysis was performed using standard techniques as described previously (27.Lu R. Wang X. Chen Z.F. Sun D.F. Tian X.Q. Fang J.Y. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway decreases DNA methylation in colon cancer cells.J. Biol.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Kangchen, Shanghai, China) was detected as a loading control. Antibodies used in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). All primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Cell proliferation assay was assessed by a tetrazolium salt (WST-8)–based colorimetric assay in Cell Counting Kit 8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) (28.Morita Y. Naka T. Kawazoe Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M.

Briefly, control and CRC cells treated with different doses of fluorouracil were seeded onto 96-well plates at an initial density of 5 × 103 cells/well. At specified time points, 10 μl of Cell Counting Kit 8 solution were added to each well of the plate, which was then incubated for 2 h. Cell viability was determined by scanning with a microplate reader at 450 nm. Data are expressed as the percentage of viable cells calculated as follows: cell survival rate (%) = (A450(treated) − A450(blank))/(A450(control) − A450(blank)) × 100%. For flow cytometric analysis, an annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate/PI double stain assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Analysis was performed using a flow cytometer. Cell invasion assays were performed as described by Hecht et al. (30.Hecht M. Papoutsi M. Tran H.D. Wilting J. Schweigerer L. Hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling promotes the progression of experimental human neuroblastomas.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6109-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, chambers with 8-μm pore polycarbonate membranes, coated with Matrigel on the upper side, were used (BD Biosciences). CRC cells or stable CRC cell lines with ZEB1 gene knockdown were transfected with STAT3 siRNA, control siRNA, pCDNA3.1-STAT3, or pCDNA3.1 for 24 h. Transfected cells were then harvested, and 1 × 105 cells were seeded in serum-free medium into the upper chamber, whereas medium supplemented with 15% FBS was applied to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant to induce invasion. After incubation for 48 h, migrated cells on the bottom surface of the filter were fixed, stained, and counted. Designated combinations of pGL3-E-cadherinPWT, pGL3-ZEB1PWT, and other mutant constructs with other siRNA or plasmids at 1.0 μg and 100 ng of phRL (Renilla luciferase) TK plasmid (Promega) for monitoring transfection efficiency were transiently transfected in triplicate with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or DharmaFECT 1 siRNA transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's directions. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were collected to detect luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured by using a BD Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Biosciences). Variation in transfection efficiency was normalized by dividing the luciferase activity of the construct by the corresponding Renilla luciferase activity. Promoter activity is reported as the mean ± S.E. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) following the manufacturer's protocol. ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (31.Fu X. Beer D.G. Behar J. Wands J. Lambeth D. Cao W. cAMP-response element-binding protein mediates acid-induced NADPH oxidase NOX5-S expression in Barrett esophageal adenocarcinoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20368-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Antibodies against ZEB1 (Cell Signal Technology), STAT3 (Cell Signal Technology), and normal rabbit IgG (Upstate) were used. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using an Applied Biosystems 7900 quantitative PCR system. Each PCR was carried out in a 10-μl reaction volume by using 3 μl of the eluted immunoprecipitated DNA. The amount of genomic DNA co-precipitated with the specific antibody was calculated in comparison with the total input DNA used for each immunoprecipitation as follows: CBTB = CBTB(genomic input) − CBTB(specific antibody), where CBTB(genomic input) and CBTB(specific antibody) are the mean threshold cycles of PCR performed in triplicate on DNA samples from the genomic input samples and the specific antibody samples, respectively. All specimens were from patients (35 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas) who underwent surgery in Shanghai Renji Hospital from July 2009 to December 2010. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine Renji Hospital, and the research was carried out according to the provisions of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. None of the patients received preoperative treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Meanwhile, 21 specimens of normal colonic epithelium, taken from patients without colorectal cancer, were used as negative controls. The expressions of STAT3, pSTAT3Tyr-705, ZEB1, and E-cadherin were examined with primary antibodies (STAT3, pSTAT3Tyr-705, ZEB1, and E-cadherin; dilution 1:100) in consecutive tissue sections using the LSAB+ kit (DakoCytomation, Copenhagen, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were examined independently by two investigators blinded to both clinical and pathologic data. Protein expression was quantified using a visual grading system based on the extent of staining (percentage of positive tumor cells graded on a scale of 0–4: 0, none; 1, 1–25%; 2, 26–50%; 3, 51–75%; 4, 475%) and the intensity of staining (graded on a scale of 0–3: 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining). For further analysis, an index value was calculated as a product of grades of the extent and intensity of staining to define the cut-off value for high expression of the proteins, and the protein expression was classified into two categories: high (grades 4–12) and low (grades 0–3). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 13.0 software. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical differences between two groups were determined by Student's t test. Differences between multiple groups were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and checked for significance using Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Analyses comparing the expressions of STAT3, pSTAT3Tyr-705, ZEB1, and E-cadherin were performed using χ2 analysis and Fisher's exact test. Results were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. Correlation analysis was performed between pSTAT3Tyr-705 and ZEB1. We previously showed that activated STAT3 is constitutively expressed in CRC and mediates cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of STAT3 significantly restores E-cadherin expression (18.Xiong H.

Inhibition of JAK1,2/STAT3 signaling induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reduces tumor cell invasion in colorectal cancer cells.Neoplasia. 2008; 10: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of E-cadherin is one of the EMT phenotypes in cancer progression (3.Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7557) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT3 mediates EMT initiation in CRC cells, the effect of STAT3 siRNA was evaluated in highly invasive LoVo CRC cells. Western blot analysis showed that STAT3 siRNA significantly decreased STAT3 expression and phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that the STAT3 was knocked down effectively. Knockdown of STAT3 significantly increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin and vimentin expressions (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that STAT3 may contribute to EMT progression in LoVo cells. To further confirm the role of STAT3 in down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of N-cadherin and vimentin in CRC cells, we constructed and transfected the recombinant pCDNA3.1-STAT3 plasmid into low invasion SW1116 cells. Transfection of the pCDNA3.1-STAT3 plasmid significantly increased STAT3 expression and phosphorylation in SW1116 cells, when compared with the pCDNA3.1 control (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that STAT3 was successfully overexpressed. Overexpression of STAT3 significantly reduced E-cadherin and enhanced N-cadherin and vimentin expressions in SW1116 cells, compared with pCDNA3.1 transfection. These results further indicate that STAT3 may mediate EMT initiation and progression in CRC cells. It has been reported that EMT may induce cell migration, alter invasion properties, promote chemotherapy drug resistance, and prevent apoptosis (3.Thiery J.P. Acloque H. Huang R.Y. Nieto M.A. Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in development and disease.Cell. 2009; 139: 871-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7557) Google Scholar). Aberrant cell survival and resistance to apoptosis are also hallmarks of tumor EMT progression in epithelial carcinoma (32.Jäättelä M. Escaping cell death. Survival proteins in cancer.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether STAT3 participates in these aspects of EMT progression in CRC cells. Transwell cell invasion assays showed that knockdown of STAT3 expression significantly reduced the invasion ability of LoVo cells normal"

Here we show that the clinical side-effects (SEs) provide a human phenotypic profile for the drug, and this profile can suggest additional disease indications. We extracted 3,175 SE-disease relationships by combining the SE-drug relationships from drug labels and the drug-disease relationships from PharmGKB. Many relationships provide explicit repositioning hypotheses, such as drugs causing hypoglycemia are potential candidates for diabetes. We built Naïve Bayes models to predict indications for 145 diseases using the SEs as features. The AUC was above 0.8 in 92% of these models. The method was extended to predict indications for clinical compounds, 36% of the models achieved AUC above 0.7. This suggests that closer attention should be paid to the SEs observed in trials not just to evaluate the harmful effects, but also to rationally explore the repositioning potential based on this “clinical phenotypic assay”."

When grown in high light, cells had a faster growth rate and higher biomass production compared with low and control light conditions. However, cells acclimated to low light intensity are indeed able to produce more biomass per photon available as compared with high light-acclimated cells, which dissipate as heat a large part of light absorbed, thus reducing their photosynthetic efficiency. This dissipative state is strictly dependent on the accumulation of LhcSR3, a protein related to light-harvesting complexes, responsible for nonphotochemical quenching in microalgae. Other changes induced in the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus upon high light acclimation consist of an increase of carotenoid content on a chlorophyll basis, particularly zeaxanthin, and a major down-regulation of light absorption capacity by decreasing the chlorophyll content per cell. Surprisingly, the antenna size of both photosystem I and II is not modulated by acclimation; rather, the regulation affects the PSI/PSII ratio. Major effects of the acclimation to low light consist of increased activity of state 1 and 2 transitions and increased contributions of cyclic electron flow.

Major effects of the acclimation to low light consist of increased activity of state 1 and 2 transitions and increased contributions of cyclic electron flow. Sunlight is the most abundant source of energy available on Earth, and it is used by photosynthetic organisms to fix inorganic carbon into organic molecules and produce biomass. Oxygenic photosynthesis occurs by the activity of two types of protein complexes named photosystems, photosystem I and II (PSI 2The abbreviations used are: PSIphotosystem IPSIIphotosystem IIChlchlorophyllLHCIlight-harvesting complex of photosystem ILhcblight-harvesting complex of photosystem IILHCIImajor light-harvesting complex of photosystem IINPQnonphotochemical quenchingROSreactive oxygen speciesCEFcyclic electron flowLEFlinear electron flowCytcytochromePTOXplastid-terminal oxidaseqPphotochemical quenchingLLlow lightCLcontrol lightHLhigh lightDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaPMFprotonmotive forceRubiscoribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenaseECSelectrochromic shiftμEmicroeinstein. and PSII), in which reaction centers catalyze primary light-dependent charge separation events driving electron transport from H2O to NADPH. Reaction centers are functionally connected with each other and to their electron donor/acceptor by redox transporters such as the cytochrome b6/f complex, whereas their capacity for absorbing photons is increased by light-harvesting antenna complexes that bind most of the chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. In addition, ATPase synthesizes ATP from the trans-thylakoid proton gradient generated by the photosynthetic electron transport. The diversity in the organization of photosynthesis in organisms, originated from common prokaryotic ancestor(s), is largely because of their different light-harvesting machinery, although the structure of reaction centers is much more conserved (1.Alboresi A.

Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3619-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antenna complexes, besides harvesting photons, have an important role in photoprotection, which is an essential function because production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequent photoinhibition is an unavoidable consequence of oxygenic photosynthesis at all light intensities (3.Dall'Osto L. Fiore A. Cazzaniga S. Giuliano G. Bassi R. Different roles of α- and β-branch xanthophylls in photosystem assembly and photoprotection.J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). In addition to species-specific differences in the molecular organization of the light-harvesting apparatus, acclimatized processes have been developed to cope with changes of irradiance in different environmental niches and/or different atmospheric conditions. Short term acclimatizing mechanisms respond to fast light intensity changes during the day length, due for example to transient clouds. Long term adaptation responds to shading by competing species, low/high irradiance in specific environments resulting in limitation in photosynthesis or oversaturating light intensity. Physiologic consequences range from metabolic energy shortage to absorption of excess excitation energy that leads to production of ROS. Responses to these environmental cues have been studied in higher plants, which have evolved a number of mechanisms including modulation of the stoichiometry and composition of peripheral light-harvesting antenna subunits (Lhcb) serving as photosystem II (PSII) antenna (5.Niyogi K.K.

In Arabidopsis thaliana PSII antenna system two monomeric (Lhcb4 and Lhcb6) and a trimeric subunit (LHCII-S) are constitutively accumulated and bound to the PSII core to form C2S2 supercomplexes, whereas additional subunits located more peripherally, namely the monomeric Lhcb6 (CP24) and trimeric LHCII-M and LHCII-L, are accumulated with decreasing irradiance (6.Ballottari M.

Consequences of a chronic over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 4616-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Higher plant PSI is also made of a core complex plus LHC antenna moieties, but its size is constitutive, whereas modulation is restricted to stoichiometric changes with respect to PSII to match plastoquinone reduction rate. Because the absorption spectra of PSI is somehow red-shifted with respect to PSII, changes in light quality may lead to an imbalance of PSII versus PSI excitation, leading to a decrease in light use efficiency, particularly under low light conditions. This can be corrected through a reversible transfer of LHCII-L from PSII to PSI in a mechanism named “state transitions” (7.Pesaresi P. Hertle A. Pribil M. Kleine T. Wagner R. Strissel H.

State transitions and light adaptation require chloroplast thylakoid protein kinase STN7.Nature. 2005; 433: 892-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), a mechanism inhibited in high light. The activity of the dark phase of photosynthesis is also modulated by light intensity; ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) accumulates with increasing light being a sink for ATP and reducing power accumulated in HL (6.Ballottari M.

Even HL-acclimated plants can experience excess illumination and respond by activating nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), by which energy dissipation into heat is catalyzed, preventing ROS formation. Accumulation of the carotenoid zeaxanthin upon excess light from pre-existing violaxanthin increases NPQ (11.Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R.

Previous work showed that HL induced a decrease in the transcription and translation of Lhc proteins (28.Durnford D.G. Price J.A. Mckim S.M. Sarchfield M.L.

Besides its importance as a model system for molecular analysis of photosynthesis, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely used in biofuel research as a converter of solar energy into biomass within photobioreactors where algae are grown at high density, thus producing a steep gradient of light intensity with excess light on the surface (leading to energy loss by thermal dissipation and photoinhibition) and limiting light below (limiting photosynthesis and producing energy loss by respiration). Engineering of light-harvesting apparatus has been proposed as a strategy for improving light use efficiency in producing biomass (20.Melis A. Neidhardt J. Benemann J.R.

In particular, acclimatized modulation of antenna size implies compensation of genetically induced modifications by overexpression of other subunits (33.Andersson J. Wentworth M. Walters R.G.

In this work, we analyzed in detail the acclimatized response of C. reinhardtii cells to light intensity and observed that modulation of the relative abundance of Lhc proteins is restricted to minor component(s) of the antenna system, whereas bulk antenna subunits are constitutively expressed.

Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured at room temperature on whole acclimated cells at a concentration of 2 × 106 with a PAM-101 fluorometer with a saturating light at 4500 μE and actinic light at different intensities. Before measurements, cells were dark-adapted under stirring for at least 60 min at room temperature.

C. reinhardtii cells from the cw15 strain were grown in 15-ml liquid cultures at three different light intensities: 20 μE m−2 s−1 (LL), 60 μE m−2 s−1 (CL), and 400 μE m−2 s−1 (HL). Effects of light stress or light depletion were followed by measuring changes of PSII quantum yield (Fv/Fm) in the different conditions. Fv/Fm was slightly lower in LL- (0.66 ± 0.02) and HL (0.65 ± 0.03)-grown cells at the second generation upon transfer from control light, where the Fv/Fm is generally 0.75 ± 0.02. In the following generations, the PSII efficiency recovered to a level similar to CL in LL but not in HL. HL cells indeed showed lower Fv/Fm (0.65 ± 0.02) compared with CL (0.75 ± 0.01) and LL (0.73 ± 0.03) even after 10 generations. This result suggests that LL and HL cells are both acclimated to irradiance conditions, but acclimation to HL leads to a sustained reduction in Fv/Fm. The growth curve of LL, CL, and HL cells is reported in Fig. 1. HL cells grow slightly faster than CL, although LL grew substantially slower. The generation time in the different conditions is reported in Table 1, being 36, 26, and 20 h for LL, CL, and HL cells, respectively. Biomass production in the different growth conditions was evaluated by measuring the average dry weight per cell per day of a culture in exponential phase (Table 1), resulting in slightly higher values for HL as compared with CL, although the value vas substantially lower for LL cells. The photosynthetic light use efficiency for the different cultures was calculated dividing the dry weight production by the light intensity of growth (PAR); photosynthetic efficiency values are similar for CL and LL (4.94 × 10−4 and 5.23 × 10−4 g liter−1 day−1 PAR−1, respectively) but strongly reduced in HL (8.64 × 10−5 g liter−1 d−1 PAR−1).TABLE 1Biomass production under different growth conditionsSampleGeneration timeDry weight/dayPARPEhg liter−1 day−1μmol m−2 s−1g liter−1 day−1PAR−1LL36 ± 21.83E-02 ± 3.79E-03355.23E-04 ± 1.08E-04CL26 ± 1.52.97E-02 ± 7.44E-03604.94E-04 ± 1.24E-04HL20 ± 13.45E-02 ± 4.69E-034008.63E-05 ± 1.17E-05 Open table in a new tab Acclimation to different irradiance conditions is well known to induce variations in pigment content and relative composition in higher plants.

We monitored the redox events in the cytosol and mitochondria using reduction-oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) probes and the level of reduced/oxidized thioredoxins (Trxs). Either H(2)O(2) or the Trx reductase inhibitor 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), in embryonic rat heart (H9c2) cells, evoked 8 or 50 mV more oxidizing glutathione redox potential, E(hc) (GSSG/2GSH), respectively. In contrast, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) treatment in H9c2 cells, or overexpression of either the glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic subunit (GCLC) or GCL modifier subunit (GCLM) in human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cells, led to 3- to 4-fold increase of GSH and caused 7 or 12 mV more reducing E(hc), respectively. This condition paradoxically increased the level of mitochondrial oxidation, as demonstrated by redox shifts in mitochondrial roGFP and Trx2. Lastly, either NAC treatment (EC(50) 4 mM) or either GCLC or GCLM overexpression exhibited increased cytotoxicity and the susceptibility to the more reducing milieu was achieved at decreased levels of ROS. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which GSH-dependent reductive stress triggers mitochondrial oxidation and cytotoxicity."

In a previous study, we demonstrated that exposure of mouse bone marrow derived stromal cells to Doxorubicin led them to acquire anti-proliferative potential towards co-cultured haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We thus hypothesized whether freshly isolated human bone marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and mature murine stromal cells (SR4987 line) primed in vitro with anti-cancer drugs and then localized near cancer cells, could inhibit proliferation.Paclitaxel (PTX) was used to prime culture of hMSCs and SR4987. Incorporation of PTX into hMSCs was studied by using FICT-labelled-PTX and analyzed by FACS and confocal microscopy. Release of PTX in culture medium by PTX primed hMSCs (hMSCsPTX) was investigated by HPLC. Culture of Endothelial cells (ECs) and aorta ring assay were used to test the anti-angiogenic activity of hMSCsPTX and PTX primed SR4987(SR4987PTX), while anti-tumor activity was tested in vitro on the proliferation of different tumor cell lines and in vivo by co-transplanting hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX with cancer cells in mice. Nevertheless, despite a loss of cells due to chemo-induced apoptosis, both hMSCs and SR4987 were able to rapidly incorporate PTX and could slowly release PTX in the culture medium in a time dependent manner. PTX primed cells acquired a potent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity in vitro that was dose dependent, and demonstrable by using their conditioned medium or by co-culture assay. Finally, hMSCsPTX and SR4987PTX co-injected with human cancer cells (DU145 and U87MG) and mouse melanoma cells (B16) in immunodeficient and in syngenic mice significantly delayed tumor takes and reduced tumor growth.These data demonstrate, for the first time, that without any genetic manipulation, mesenchymal stromal cells can uptake and subsequently slowly release PTX. This may lead to potential new tools to increase efficacy of cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2151961400,"An important component of the mammalian stress response is the reprogramming of translation. A variety of stresses trigger abrupt polysome disassembly and the accumulation of stalled translation preinitiation complexes. These complexes nucleate cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), sites of mRNA triage in which mRNAs from disassembling polysomes are sorted and the fates of individual transcripts are determined. Here, we demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV) actively suppresses SG formation during infection, thereby allowing translation of viral mRNAs. Complete inhibition of SG formation is dependent on the function of the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1); at late times postinfection, cells infected with NS1-mutant viruses formed SGs in a double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-dependent fashion. In these cells, SG formation correlated with inhibited viral protein synthesis. Together, these experiments demonstrate the antiviral potential of SGs and reveal a viral countermeasure that limits SG formation.—Khaperskyy, D. A., Hatchette, T. F., McCormick, C.

https://openalex.org/W2055438942,"Multiple signaling pathways are involved in the tight regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is important for the tailoring of inflammatory response to pathogens in macrophages. It is widely accepted that TLR signaling can activate Notch pathway; however, whether full activation of Notch signaling can feedback modulate TLR signaling pathway so as to control inflammation response remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that stimulation with TLR ligands up-regulated Notch1 and Notch2 expression in macrophages. The expression of Notch target genes including Hes1 and Hes5 was also induced in macrophages by LPS, suggesting that TLR4 signaling enhances the activation of Notch pathway. Importantly, overexpression of constituted active form of Notch1 (NICD1) and Notch2 (NICD2) suppressed production of TLR4-triggered proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 but promoted production of antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, which is dependent on the PEST domain of NICD. In addition, NICD1 and NICD2 suppressed TLR-triggered ERK phosphorylation, which is indispensable for Notch-mediated inhibition of TLR4-triggered proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, activation of Notch signaling inhibited NF-κB transcription activity by MyD88/TRAF6 and TRIF pathways, which was dependent on ERK activity. Therefore, our results showed that Notch signaling negatively regulates TLR-triggered inflammation responses, revealing a new mechanism for negative regulation of TLR signaling via Notch pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2045728118,"The inflammatory response in the injured spinal cord, an immune privileged site, has been mainly associated with the poor prognosis. However, recent data demonstrated that, in fact, some leukocytes, namely monocytes, are pivotal for repair due to their alternative anti-inflammatory phenotype. Given the pro-inflammatory milieu within the traumatized spinal cord, known to skew monocytes towards a classical phenotype, a pertinent question is how parenchymal-invading monocytes acquire resolving properties essential for healing, under such unfavorable conditions. In light of the spatial association between resolving (interleukin (IL)-10 producing) monocytes and the glial scar matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), in this study we examined the mutual relationship between these two components. By inhibiting the de novo production of CSPG following spinal cord injury, we demonstrated that this extracellular matrix, mainly known for its ability to inhibit axonal growth, serves as a critical template skewing the entering monocytes towards the resolving phenotype. In vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that this matrix alone is sufficient to induce such monocyte polarization. Reciprocal conditional ablation of the monocyte-derived macrophages concentrated at the lesion margins, using diphtheria toxin, revealed that these cells have scar matrix-resolving properties. Replenishment of monocytic cell populations to the ablated mice demonstrated that this extracellular remodeling ability of the infiltrating monocytes requires their expression of the matrix-degrading enzyme, matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), a property that was found here to be crucial for functional recovery. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the glial scar-matrix, a known obstacle to regeneration, is a critical component skewing the encountering monocytes towards a resolving phenotype. In an apparent feedback loop, monocytes were found to regulate scar resolution. This cross-regulation between the glial scar and monocytes primes the resolution of this interim phase of spinal cord repair, thereby providing a fundamental platform for the dynamic healing response."

https://openalex.org/W2084913565,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and pulmonary fibrogenesis require epithelial integrin α3β1-mediated cross-talk between TGFβ1 and Wnt signaling pathways. One hallmark of this cross-talk is pY654-β-catenin accumulation, but whether pY654-β-catenin is a biomarker of fibrogenesis or functionally important is unknown. To clarify further the role of β-catenin in fibrosis, we explored pY654-β-catenin generation and function. α3β1 was required for TGFβ1-mediated activation of Src family kinases, and Src inhibition blocked both pY654 and EMT in primary alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). TGFβ1 stimulated β-catenin/Lef1-dependent promoter activity comparably in immortalized AECs stably expressing WT β-catenin as well as Y654E or Y654F β-catenin point mutants. But EMT was abrogated in the Tyr to Phe mutant. pY654-β-catenin was sensitive to the axin β-catenin turnover pathway as inhibition of tankyrase 1 led to high AEC axin levels, loss of pY654-β-catenin, and inhibition of EMT ex vivo. Mice given a tankyrase inhibitor (50 mg/kg orally) daily for 7 days beginning 10 days after intratracheal bleomycin had improved survival over controls. Treated mice developed raised axin levels in the lung that abrogated pY654-β-catenin and attenuated lung Snail1, Twist1, α-smooth muscle actin, and type I collagen accumulation. Total β-catenin levels were unaltered. These findings identify Src kinase(s) as a mediator of TGFβ1-induced pY654-β-catenin, provide evidence that pY654-β-catenin levels are a critical determinant of EMT and fibrogenesis, and suggest regulation of axin levels as a novel therapeutic approach to fibrotic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2083909329,"IL-32 can be expressed in several isoforms. The amino acid sequences of the major IL-32 isoforms were used to predict the secondary and tertiary protein structure by I-TASSER software. The secondary protein structure revealed coils and α-helixes, but no β sheets. Furthermore, IL-32 contains an RGD motif, which potentially activates procaspase-3 intracellular and or binds to integrins. Mutation of the RGD motif did not result in inhibition of the IL-32β- or IL-32γ-induced cytotoxicity mediated through caspase-3. Although IL-32α interacted with the extracellular part of αVβ3 and αVβ6 integrins, only the αVβ3 binding was inhibited by small RGD peptides. Additionally, IL-32β was able to bind to αVβ3 integrins, whereas this binding was not inhibited by small RGD peptides. In addition to the IL-32/integrin interactions, we observed that IL-32 is also able to interact with intracellular proteins that are involved in integrin and focal adhesion signaling. Modeling of IL-32 revealed a distinct α-helix protein resembling the focal adhesion targeting region of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Inhibition of FAK resulted in modulation of the IL-32β- or IL-32γ-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, IL-32α binds to paxillin without the RGD motif being involved. Finally, FAK inhibited IL-32α/paxillin binding, whereas FAK also could interact with IL-32α, demonstrating that IL-32 is a member of the focal adhesion protein complex. This study demonstrates for the first time that IL-32 binds to the extracellular domain of integrins and to intracellular proteins like paxillin and FAK, suggesting a dual role for IL-32 in integrin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2060999387,"Corticosteroid insensitivity is a major barrier of treatment for some chronic inflammatory diseases, such as severe asthma, but the molecular mechanism of the insensitivity has not been fully elucidated. The object of this study is to investigate the role of protein phosphate 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase, on corticosteroid sensitivity in severe asthma.Corticosteroid sensitivity was determined by the dexamethasone ability to inhibit TNFα-induced IL-8 or LPS-induced TNFα production. PP2A expression, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation defined as the nuclear/cytoplasmic GR ratio and phosphorylation of GR-Ser²²⁶, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and PP2A were analysed by Western-blotting. Phosphatase activity was measured by fluorescence-based assay. Okadaic acid (OA), a PP2A inhibitor, reduced corticosteroid sensitivity with reduced GR nuclear translocation and increased GR phosphorylation in U937 monocytic cells. PP2A knockdown by RNA interference showed similar effects. IL-2/IL-4 treatment to U937 reduced corticosteroid sensitivity, and PP2A expression/activity. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from severe asthma, the PP2A expression and activity were significantly reduced with concomitant enhancement of PP2A(C)-Tyr³⁰⁷ phosphorylation compared with those in healthy volunteers. As the results, GR-Ser²²⁶ and JNK1 phosphorylation were increased. The expression and activity of PP2A were negatively correlated with phosphorylation levels of GR-Ser²²⁶. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay in U937 cells revealed that PP2A associated with GR and JNK1 and IL-2/IL-4 exposure caused dissociation of each molecule. Lastly, PP2A overexpression increased corticosteroid sensitivity in U937 cells.PP2A regulates GR nuclear translocation and corticosteroid sensitivity possibly by dephosphorylation of GR-Ser²²⁶ via dephosphorylation of upstream JNK1. This novel mechanism will provide new insight for the development of new therapy for severe asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2167263540,"Inflammation plays an important role in a wide range of human diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, arteriosclerosis, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc. Neutrophilic accumulation in the inflamed tissues is an essential component of normal host defense against infection, but uncontrolled neutrophilic infiltration can cause progressive damage to the tissue epithelium. The CXC chemokine receptor CXCR2 and its specific ligands have been reported to play critical roles in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases. However, it is unclear how CXCR2 is coupled specifically to its downstream signaling molecules and modulates cellular functions of neutrophils. Here we show that the PDZ scaffold protein NHERF1 couples CXCR2 to its downstream effector phospholipase C (PLC)-β2, forming a macromolecular complex, through a PDZ-based interaction. We assembled a macromolecular complex of CXCR2·NHERF1·PLC-β2 in vitro, and we also detected such a complex in neutrophils by co-immunoprecipitation. We further observed that the CXCR2-containing macromolecular complex is critical for the CXCR2-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization and the resultant migration and infiltration of neutrophils, as disrupting the complex with a cell permeant CXCR2-specific peptide (containing the PDZ motif) inhibited intracellular calcium mobilization, chemotaxis, and transepithelial migration of neutrophils. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role of the PDZ-dependent CXCR2 macromolecular signaling complex in regulating neutrophil functions and suggest that targeting the CXCR2 multiprotein complex may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for certain inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2003929905,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and the most aggressive type of brain cancer; the median survival time from the time of diagnosis is approximately one year. GBM is characterized by the hallmarks of rapid proliferation and aggressive invasion. miR-451 is known to play a key role in glioblastoma by modulating the balance of active proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the microenvironment. The present paper develops a mathematical model of GBM evolution which focuses on the relative balance of growth and invasion. In the present work we represent the miR-451/AMPK pathway by a simple model and show how the effects of glucose on cells need to be ""refined"" by taking into account the recent history of glucose variations. The simulations show how variations in glucose significantly affect the level of miR-451 and, in turn, cell migration. The model predicts that oscillations in the levels of glucose increase the growth of the primary tumor. The model also suggests that drugs which upregulate miR-451, or block other components of the CAB39/AMPK pathway, will slow down glioma cell migration. The model provides an explanation for the growth-invasion cycling patterns of glioma cells in response to high/low glucose uptake in microenvironment in vitro, and suggests new targets for drugs, associated with miR-451 upregulation."

Mitragynine is the major alkaloid compound found in leaves of Mitragyna speciosa, a plant widely used by opiate addicts to mitigate the harshness of drug withdrawal. A series of experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of mitragynine on anxiety behavior, cortisol level and expression of stress pathway related genes in zebrafish undergoing morphine withdrawal phase. Adult zebrafish were subjected to two weeks chronic morphine exposure at 1.5 mg/L, followed by withdrawal for 24 hours prior to tests. Using the novel tank diving tests, we first showed that morphine-withdrawn zebrafish display anxiety-related swimming behaviors such as decreased exploratory behavior and increased erratic movement. Morphine withdrawal also elevated whole-body cortisol levels, which confirms the phenotypic stress-like behaviors. Exposing morphine-withdrawn fish to mitragynine however attenuates majority of the stress-related swimming behaviors and concomitantly lower whole-body cortisol level. Using real-time PCR gene expression analysis, we also showed that mitragynine reduces the mRNA expression of corticotropin releasing factor receptors and prodynorphin in zebrafish brain during morphine withdrawal phase, revealing for the first time a possible link between mitragynine's ability to attenuate anxiety during opiate withdrawal with the stress-related corticotropin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2161365997,"There is growing evidence that the complement activation product C5a positively or negatively regulates inflammatory functions. The studies presented here report that C5a exerts anti-inflammatory effects by altering production of the cytokines IL-17A and IL-23 during endotoxic shock in young adult male C57BL/6J mice and has similar effects on macrophages from the same mice. IL-17A and IL-23 both appeared in plasma during endotoxemia, and their neutralization improved survival. The relevant sources of IL-17A during endotoxemia were not CD4(+) cells, γδ T cells, or NK cells but CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages. The addition in vitro of C5a to lipopolysaccharide-activated peritoneal macrophages dose dependently antagonized the production of IL-17A (IC(50), 50-100 nM C5a) and IL-23 (IC(50), 10 nM C5a). This suppression required the receptor C5aR, but was independent of the second C5a receptor, C5L2. Genetic absence of C5aR was associated with much higher levels of IL-17A and IL-23 during endotoxic shock. Mechanistically, C5a mediated its effects on the IL-17A/IL-23 axis in a 2-step process. C5a caused activation of the PI3K-Akt and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways, resulting in induction of IL-10, which powerfully inhibited production of IL-17A and IL-23. These data identify previously unknown mechanisms by which the anaphylatoxin C5a limits acute inflammation and antagonizes the IL-17A/IL-23 axis."
https://openalex.org/W2098622443,"Objective Adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to assess the muscular and renal adverse events induced by the administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and to attempt to determine the rank-order of the association. Methods After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin were analyzed. Authorized pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals, i.e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Myalgia, rhabdomyolysis and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level were focused on as the muscular adverse events, and acute renal failure, non-acute renal failure, and an increase in blood creatinine level as the renal adverse events. Results Based on 1,644,220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, signals were detected for 4 statins with respect to myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, and an increase in creatine phosphokinase level, but these signals were stronger for rosuvastatin than pravastatin and atorvastatin. Signals were also detected for acute renal failure, though in the case of atorvastatin, the association was marginal, and furthermore, a signal was not detected for non-acute renal failure or for an increase in blood creatinine level. Conclusions Data mining of the FDA's adverse event reporting system, AERS, is useful for examining statin-associated muscular and renal adverse events. The data strongly suggest the necessity of well-organized clinical studies with respect to statin-associated adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W1984743811,"Decorin is a small proteoglycan, composed of 12 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that modulates the activity of transforming growth factor type β (TGF-β) and other growth factors, and thereby influences proliferation and differentiation in a wide array of physiological and pathological processes, such as fibrosis, in several tissues and organs. Previously we described two novel modulators of the TGF-β-dependent signaling pathway: LDL receptor-related protein (LRP-1) and decorin. Here we have determined the regions in decorin that are responsible for interaction with LRP-1 and are involved in TGF-β-dependent binding and signaling. Specifically, we used decorin deletion mutants, as well as peptides derived from internal LRR regions, to determine the LRRs responsible for these decorin functions. Our results indicate that LRR6 and LRR5 participate in the interaction with LRP-1 and TGF-β as well as in its dependent signaling. Furthermore, the internal region (LRR6i), composed of 11 amino acids, is responsible for decorin binding to LRP-1 and subsequent TGF-β-dependent signaling. Furthermore, using an in vivo approach, we also demonstrate that the LRR6 region of decorin can inhibit TGF-β mediated action in response to skeletal muscle injury."
https://openalex.org/W2013023683,"The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family member myostatin is an important regulator of myoblast, adipocyte, and fibroblast growth and differentiation, but the signaling mechanisms remain to be established. We therefore determined the contribution of myostatin type I receptors activin receptor-like kinase-4 (ALK4) and -5 (ALK5) and different coreceptors in C2C12 myoblasts, C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells, and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, as well as in primary myoblast and fibroblasts. We performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of each receptor and measured signaling activity using Smad3-dependent luciferase and Smad2 phosphorylation assays with nontargeting siRNA as control. We find that myostatin utilizes ALK4 in myoblasts, whereas it has a preference for ALK5 in nonmyogenic cells. Notably, our results show that coreceptor Cripto is expressed in myoblasts but not in the nonmyogenic cells and that it regulates myostatin activity. More specifically, myostatin requires Cripto in myoblasts, whereas Cripto represses activin activity and TGF-β signaling is Cripto independent. Cripto-mediated myostatin signaling is dependent on both epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and Cripto-FRL1-cryptic (CFC) domains, whereas activin signaling is solely conferred by the CFC domain. Furthermore, Cripto down-regulation enhances myoblast differentiation, showing its importance in myostatin signaling. Together, our results identify a molecular mechanism that explains the cell-type specific aspects of signaling by myostatin and other TGF-β family members.—Kemaladewi, D. U., de Gorter, D. J.

We compared standard Kaplan-Meier curves with CR cumulative incidence. We calculated hazard ratios for LTFU across CD4 cell count strata using cause-specific Cox models, or Fine and Gray subdistribution models, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and clinical stage. 89,339 patients from Zambia and 1,860 patients from Switzerland were included. 12,237 patients (13.7%) in Zambia and 129 patients (6.9%) in Switzerland were LTFU and 8,498 (9.5%) and 29 patients (1.6%), respectively, died. In Zambia, the probability of LTFU was overestimated in Kaplan-Meier curves: estimates at 3.5 years were 29.3% for patients starting ART with CD4 cells <100 cells/µl and 15.4% among patients starting with ≥ 350 cells/µL. The estimates from CR cumulative incidence were 22.9% and 13.6%, respectively. Little difference was found between naïve and CR analyses in Switzerland since only few patients died. The results from Cox and Fine and Gray models were similar: in Zambia the risk of loss to follow-up and death increased with decreasing CD4 counts at the start of ART, whereas in Switzerland there was a trend in the opposite direction, with patients with higher CD4 cell counts more likely to be lost to follow-up.In ART programmes in low-income settings the competing risk of death can substantially bias standard analyses of LTFU. The CD4 cell count and other prognostic factors may be differentially associated with LTFU in low-income and high-income settings."

We show that BLOC-1 is an elongated complex that contains one copy each of the eight subunits pallidin, Cappuccino, dysbindin, Snapin, Muted, BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3. The complex appears as a linear chain of eight globular domains, ∼300 Å long and ∼30 Å in diameter. The individual domains are flexibly connected such that the linear chain undergoes bending by as much as 45°. Two stable subcomplexes were defined, pallidin-Cappuccino-BLOS1 and dysbindin-Snapin-BLOS2. Both subcomplexes are 1:1:1 heterotrimers that form extended structures as indicated by their hydrodynamic properties. The two subcomplexes appear to constitute flexible units within the larger BLOC-1 chain, an arrangement conducive to simultaneous interactions with multiple BLOC-1 partners in the course of tubular endosome biogenesis and sorting."

Adverse events were monitored every 6 months for 3.5 years, during which pregnancy outcomes were recorded. Of the 16,402 volunteers, 69% of the participants reported an adverse event any time after the first dose. Only 32.9% experienced an AE within 30 days following any vaccination. Overall adverse event rates and attribution of relatedness did not differ between groups. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in vaccine (14.3%) and placebo (14.9%) recipients (p = 0.33). None of the 160 deaths (85 in vaccine and 75 in placebo recipients, p = 0.43) was assessed as related to vaccine. The most common cause of death was trauma or traffic accident. Approximately 30% of female participants reported a pregnancy during the study. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes were experienced in 17.1% of vaccine and 14.6% (p = 0.13) of placebo recipients. When the conception occurred within 3 months (estimated) of a vaccination, the majority of these abnormal outcomes were spontaneous or elective abortions among 22.2% and 15.3% of vaccine and placebo pregnant recipients, respectively (p = 0.08). Local reactions occurred in 88.0% of vaccine and 61.0% of placebo recipients (p<0.001) and were more frequent after ALVAC-HIV than AIDSVAX B/E vaccination. Systemic reactions were more frequent in vaccine than placebo recipients (77.2% vs. 59.8%, p<0.001). Local and systemic reactions were mostly mild to moderate, resolving within 3 days.The ALVAC-HIV and AIDSVAX B/E vaccine regimen was found to be safe, well tolerated and suitable for potential large-scale use in Thailand.ClinicalTrials.govNCT00223080."

https://openalex.org/W2039870922,"Immune complexes composed of IgG-opsonized pathogens, particles, or proteins are phagocytosed by macrophages through Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). Macrophages primed with IFNγ or other pro-inflammatory mediators respond to FcγR engagement by secreting high levels of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO). We found that unprimed macrophages produced lower levels of NO, which required efficient calcium (Ca(2+)) flux as demonstrated by using macrophages lacking selenoprotein K, which is required for FcγR-induced Ca(2+) flux. Thus, we further investigated the signaling pathways involved in low output NO and its functional significance. Evaluation of inducible, endothelial, and neuronal nitric-oxide synthases (iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS) revealed that FcγR stimulation in unprimed macrophages caused a marked Ca(2+)-dependent increase in both total and phosphorylated nNOS and slightly elevated levels of phosphorylated eNOS. Also activated were three MAP kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38, of which ERK activation was highly dependent on Ca(2+) flux. Inhibition of ERK reduced both nNOS activation and NO secretion. Finally, Transwell experiments showed that FcγR-induced NO functioned to increase the phagocytic capacity of other macrophages and required both NOS and ERK activity. The production of NO by macrophages is conventionally attributed to iNOS, but we have revealed an iNOS-independent receptor/enzyme system in unprimed macrophages that produces low output NO. Under these conditions, FcγR engagement relies on Ca(2+)-dependent ERK phosphorylation, which in turn increases nNOS and, to a lesser extent, eNOS, both of which produce low levels of NO that function to promote phagocytosis."

The objective of this study was to assess the relation of the occurrence of respiratory infections in the past 12 months to adult-onset asthma in a population-based incident case-control study of adults 21-63 years of age.We recruited all new clinically diagnosed cases of asthma (n = 521) during a 2.5-year study period and randomly selected controls (n = 932) in a geographically defined area in South Finland. Information on respiratory infections was collected by a self-administered questionnaire. The diagnosis of asthma was based on symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction in lung function measurements. The risk of asthma onset was strongly increased in subjects who had experienced in the preceding 12 months lower respiratory tract infections (including acute bronchitis and pneumonia) with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.16-9.99), or upper respiratory tract infections (including common cold, sinusitis, tonsillitis, and otitis media) with an adjusted OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.72-2.97). Individuals with personal atopy and/or parental atopy were more susceptible to the effects of respiratory infections on asthma onset than non-atopic persons.This study provides new evidence that recently experienced respiratory infections are a strong determinant for adult-onset asthma. Reducing such infections might prevent onset of asthma in adulthood, especially in individuals with atopy or hereditary propensity to it."

PCR was employed for the detection of CMV, HHV6-8 and HSV-1 DNA in lung specimens (4 controls and 11 IPF specimens) and BALF pellet [6 controls and 20 fibrotic Idiopathic Intestitial Pneumonias (f-IIPs) samples: 13 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 7 nonspecific idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)] samples. Among all herpesviruses tested, HSV-1 was detected in 1/11 (9%) specimens from IPF lung tissue and in 2/20 (10%) samples of f-IIPs BALF whereas the control group was negative. Primary cell cultures from BALF of patients with IPF and healthy controls were infected in vitro with wild-type HSV-1 virus and Real Time PCR was employed for the detection of gene transcription of specific axes implicated in lung fibrosis. Primary cell cultures were permissive to HSV-1, resulting in an upregulation of the fibrotic growth factors TGFβ1 and FGF, the angiogenetic markers SDF1a, SDF1b, VEGF, FGF and the regulators of tissue wound healing MMP9 and CCR7. Downregulation was noted for the CXCR4 and MMP2 genes, while a different response has been detected in healthy donors regarding the expression of the aforementioned markers. These results implicate for the first time the HSV-1 with Fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias since the virus presented similar incidence in two different biological samples."
https://openalex.org/W2005418948,"La proteins are conserved factors in eukaryotes that bind and protect the 3' trailers of pre-tRNAs from exonuclease digestion via sequence-specific recognition of UUU-3'OH. La has also been hypothesized to assist pre-tRNAs in attaining their native fold through RNA chaperone activity. In addition to binding polymerase III transcripts, human La has also been shown to enhance the translation of several internal ribosome entry sites and upstream ORF-containing mRNA targets, also potentially through RNA chaperone activity. Using in vitro FRET-based assays, we show that human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe La proteins harbor RNA chaperone activity by enhancing RNA strand annealing and strand dissociation. We use various RNA substrates and La mutants to show that UUU-3'OH-dependent La-RNA binding is not required for this function, and we map RNA chaperone activity to its RRM1 motif including a noncanonical α3-helix. We validate the importance of this α3-helix by appending it to the RRM of the unrelated U1A protein and show that this fusion protein acquires significant strand annealing activity. Finally, we show that residues required for La-mediated RNA chaperone activity in vitro are required for La-dependent rescue of tRNA-mediated suppression via a mutated suppressor tRNA in vivo. This work delineates the structural elements required for La-mediated RNA chaperone activity and provides a basis for understanding how La can enhance the folding of its various RNA targets."

KLF16 also regulated the expression of several genes essential for metabolic and endocrine processes in sex steroid-sensitive uterine cells. Mechanistically, we determined that KLF16 possesses an activation domain that couples to histone acetyltransferase-mediated pathways, as well as a repression domain that interacts with the histone deacetylase chromatin-remodeling system via all three Sin3 isoforms, suggesting a higher level of plasticity in chromatin cofactor selection. Molecular modeling combined with molecular dynamic simulations of the Sin3a-KLF16 complex revealed important insights into how this interaction occurs at an atomic resolution level, predicting that phosphorylation of Tyr-10 may modulate KLF16 function. Phosphorylation of KLF16 was confirmed by in vivo 32P incorporation and controlled by a Y10F site-directed mutant. Inhibition of Src-type tyrosine kinase signaling as well as the nonphosphorylatable Y10F mutation disrupted KLF16-mediated gene silencing, demonstrating that its function is regulatable rather than constitutive. Subcellular localization studies revealed that signal-induced nuclear translocation and euchromatic compartmentalization constitute an additional mechanism for regulating KLF16 function.

https://openalex.org/W1974454940,"mRNA control networks depend on recognition of specific RNA sequences. Pumilio-fem-3 mRNA binding factor (PUF) RNA-binding proteins achieve that specificity through variations on a conserved scaffold. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Puf3p achieves specificity through an additional binding pocket for a cytosine base upstream of the core RNA recognition site. Here we demonstrate that this chemically simple adaptation is prevalent and contributes to the diversity of RNA specificities among PUF proteins. Bioinformatics analysis shows that mRNAs associated with Caenorhabditis elegans fem-3 mRNA binding factor (FBF)-2 in vivo contain an upstream cytosine required for biological regulation. Crystal structures of FBF-2 and C. elegans PUF-6 reveal binding pockets structurally similar to that of Puf3p, whereas sequence alignments predict a pocket in PUF-11. For Puf3p, FBF-2, PUF-6, and PUF-11, the upstream pockets and a cytosine are required for maximal binding to RNA, but the quantitative impact on binding affinity varies. Furthermore, the position of the upstream cytosine relative to the core PUF recognition site can differ, which in the case of FBF-2 originally masked the identification of this consensus sequence feature. Importantly, other PUF proteins lack the pocket and so do not discriminate upstream bases. A structure-based alignment reveals that these proteins lack key residues that would contact the cytosine, and in some instances, they also present amino acid side chains that interfere with binding. Loss of the pocket requires only substitution of one serine, as appears to have occurred during the evolution of certain fungal species."

https://openalex.org/W2075270864,"During development, the formation of biological networks (such as organs and neuronal networks) is controlled by multicellular transportation phenomena based on cell migration. In multi-cellular systems, cellular locomotion is restricted by physical interactions with other cells in a crowded space, similar to passengers pushing others out of their way on a packed train. The motion of individual cells is intrinsically stochastic and may be viewed as a type of random walk. However, this walk takes place in a noisy environment because the cell interacts with its randomly moving neighbors. Despite this randomness and complexity, development is highly orchestrated and precisely regulated, following genetic (and even epigenetic) blueprints. Although individual cell migration has long been studied, the manner in which stochasticity affects multi-cellular transportation within the precisely controlled process of development remains largely unknown. To explore the general principles underlying multicellular migration, we focus on the migration of neural crest cells, which migrate collectively and form streams. We introduce a mechanical model of multi-cellular migration. Simulations based on the model show that the migration mode depends on the relative strengths of the noise from migratory and non-migratory cells. Strong noise from migratory cells and weak noise from surrounding cells causes “collective migration,” whereas strong noise from non-migratory cells causes “dispersive migration.” Moreover, our theoretical analyses reveal that migratory cells attract each other over long distances, even without direct mechanical contacts. This effective interaction depends on the stochasticity of the migratory and non-migratory cells. On the basis of these findings, we propose that stochastic behavior at the single-cell level works effectively and precisely to achieve collective migration in multi-cellular systems."

https://openalex.org/W2063697534,"Tristetraprolin (TTP) is the prototype of a family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins that can bind to AU-rich elements in mRNAs and promote their decay. TTP binds to mRNA through its central tandem zinc finger domain; it then promotes mRNA deadenylation, considered to be the rate-limiting step in eukaryotic mRNA decay. We found that TTP and its related family members could bind to certain isoforms of another AU-rich element-binding protein, HNRNPD/AUF1, as well as a related protein, laAUF1. The interaction domain within AUF1p45 appeared to be a C-terminal ""GY"" region, and the interaction domain within TTP was the tandem zinc finger domain. Surprisingly, binding of AUF1p45 to TTP occurred even with TTP mutants that lacked RNA binding activity. In cell extracts, binding of AUF1p45 to TTP potentiated TTP binding to ARE-containing RNA probes, as determined by RNA gel shift assays; AUF1p45 did not bind to the RNA probes under these conditions. Using purified, recombinant proteins and a synthetic RNA target in FRET assays, we demonstrated that AUF1p45, but not AUF1p37, increased TTP binding affinity for RNA ∼5-fold. These data suggest that certain isoforms of AUF1 can serve as ""co-activators"" of TTP family protein binding to RNA. The results raise interesting questions about the ability of AUF1 isoforms to regulate the mRNA binding and decay-promoting activities of TTP and its family members as well as the ability of AUF1 proteins to serve as possible physical links between TTP and other mRNA decay proteins and structures."

A substantial body of evidence indicates that the mechanism of action of defensins mainly relies on several structural features such as cationicity and amphipathy, which drive the antimicrobial peptide to interact with bacterial membranes and tend to divide peptides into two mechanistic classes, membrane-disruptive and nonmembrane-disruptive (5.Powers J.P. Hancock R.E. The relationship between peptide structure and antibacterial activity.Peptides. 2003; 24: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 6.Hancock R.E. Sahl H.G. Antimicrobial and host-defense peptides as new anti-infective therapeutic strategies.Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (3153) Google Scholar). In the latter case, there is growing evidence that defensins induce killing by acting on chiral anionic intracellular targets (for review see Refs. 7.Marcos J.F. Gandia M. Antimicrobial peptides: to membranes and beyond.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2009; 4: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8.Yeung A.T. Gellatly S.L. Hancock R.E. Multifunctional cationic host defense peptides and their clinical applications.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 2161-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Interest in defensins as therapeutic drugs is growing because defensins may constitute an alternative to the controversial use of antibiotics. In birds, a potential use of these peptides has been proposed in particular to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Salmonella, a major zoonotic agent that causes food poisoning (9.European Food Safety Authority EFSA J. 2007; 98: 1-85Google Scholar). Numerous β-defensins were identified in birds from isolated peptides or gene sequences (for review see Ref. 4.van Dijk A. Veldhuizen E.J. Haagsman H.P. Avian defensins.Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2008; 124: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In a previous study, it was shown that chicken β-defensin genes (avBD1 and -2) were highly expressed in the intestinal tissue of birds that are resistant to Salmonella colonization (10.Sadeyen J.R. Trotereau J. Protais J. Beaumont C. Sellier N. Salvat G. Velge P. Lalmanach A.C. Salmonella carrier-state in hens. Study of host resistance by a gene expression approach.Microbes Infect. 2006; 8: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three defensins (AvBD1, AvBD2, and AvBD7) were therefore purified from chicken bone marrow, and their antimicrobial activity was tested on a series of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (11.Derache C. Labas V. Aucagne V. Meudal H. Landon C. Delmas A.F. Magallon T. Lalmanach A.C. Primary structure and antibacterial activity of chicken bone marrow-derived β-defensins.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 4647-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Only chicken AvBD2 was shown to be more active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains, as reported for the king penguin spheniscin (AvBD103b) (12.Thouzeau C. Le Maho Y. Froget G. Sabatier L. Le Bohec C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. Spheniscins, avian β-defensins in preserved stomach contents of the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51053-51058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the only other avian β-defensin whose three-dimensional structure has been determined to date. Concerning the molecular patterns involved in the activity of avian defensins, the sole data currently available refer to ostrich AvBD1 and AvBD2 defensins, which share 39 and 78%, respectively, of identity with chicken AvBD2. Ostrich defensins were shown to create a slow and partial depolarization of the Escherichia coli membrane but were unable to provoke bacterium death by membrane disruption (13.Sugiarto H. Yu P.L. Mechanisms of action of ostrich β-defensins against Escherichia coli.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 270: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This indicated that the ostrich defensins could cross the bacterial membrane to target a cytoplasmic molecule. Considering that the ostrich defensins were efficient in shifting the mobility of bacterial DNA in a gel electrophoresis assay, it has been proposed that DNA could be the target of defensin (13.Sugiarto H. Yu P.L. Mechanisms of action of ostrich β-defensins against Escherichia coli.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 270: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the context of the long term objective of improving knowledge of immunity in birds, this work was carried out to gain information on structure-activity relationships of the chicken AvBD2 defensin, at the atomic level, which is an essential first step to understanding how avian β-defensins function. HPLC analyses were carried out on either an Elite LaChrom system composed of a Hitachi L-2130 pump, a Hitachi L-2455 diode array detector, and a Hitachi L-2200 autosampler or a LaChrom 7000 system composed of a Merck-Hitachi L-7100 pump, a Merck-Hitachi L-7455 diode array detector, and a Merck-Hitachi D-7000 interface, which was also used for semi-preparative purification. The machines were equipped with C18 reversed phase columns (Nucleosil), 300 Å, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm for the analytical separations, or 250 × 10.5 mm for purification. Solvents A and B containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were H2O and MeCN, respectively. Solid-phase peptide synthesis was run on automated synthesizer 433A from Applied Biosystems using Fmoc/t-butyl chemistry at a 0.1 mmol scale with O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′,-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate as the coupling reagent. Fmoc-Ala-methylphenoxypropionic acid (Polypeptide Group, France) (122 mg, 0.25 mmol) was manually coupled onto the aminomethylpolyethylene glycol polyacrylamide resin (3 g wet weight, 0.1 mmol) in the presence of O-(7-aza-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (95 mg, 0.25 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (86 μl, 0.5 mmol) for 2 h. The elongation was then carried out automatically using a 10-fold excess of protected amino acids and coupling reagents. The protecting groups used for the side chains were Arg(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyl-dihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl), Asn(triphenylmethyl), Cys(Acm), 5The abbreviations used are: AcmacetamidomethylMICminimal inhibitory concentrationFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylNMPN-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. His(triphenylmethyl), Lys(t-butoxycarbonyl), Ser(t-butyl), Trp(t-butoxycarbonyl), Tyr(t-butyl). A 0.1-mmol scale program was used, and each coupling step was followed by capping with acetic anhydride. The coupling step was performed twice from Cys30 to Leu1. The dipeptides Gly7–Ser8 and Gly31–Ser32 were also coupled twice, as the Fmoc-Gly-Ser(ΨMe,Me Pro)-OH pseudoproline derivative (Merck). After completion of the peptide elongation, the peptide resin was treated for 3 h at room temperature with TFA/H2O/i-Pr3SiH/PhOH, 87.5:5:2.5:5, and the linear S-Acm-alkylated peptide was precipitated by dilution into ice-cold diethyl ether. acetamidomethyl minimal inhibitory concentration N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. In a syringe fitted with a frit, the S-Acm-protected peptide resin (15 μmol) was swollen in NMP (two times, 5 ml for 1 min). Silver tetrafluoroborate (58.4 mg per Acm group, 20 eq.) in NMP/H2O, 9:1 mixture (4 ml), was transferred to the resin by suction, and the resulting suspension was stirred by rotation for 5 min at RT, in the absence of light, followed by washes with NMP/H2O, 9:1, and then N,N-dimethylformamide. This treatment was repeated once (60 min of stirring), and the resin was further washed with pyridine (five times, 6 ml), then treated alternatively with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (25 mm in NMP) and pyridine hydrochloride (1 m in CH2Cl2/MeOH, 95:5) (three and two times, 5 ml), followed by extensive washes with N,N-dimethylformamide. The peptide resin was then treated for 3 h at room temperature with TFA/H2O/i-Pr3SiH/PhOH, 87.5:5:2.5:5, and the linear peptide was precipitated by dilution with ice-cold diethyl ether. The crude reduced form of AvBD2 was dissolved in 20% acetic acid (AcOH) and purified by semi-preparative C18 reversed phase HPLC. The oxidative folding was performed at a peptide/GSH/GSSG molar ratio of 1:100:10 in deoxygenated MeCN, 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5 (50:50, v/v), containing 1 mm EDTA. The peptide concentration (50 μg/ml) was measured using UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm (ϵTrp, 5579 m−1 cm−1). The kinetics of the oxidative folding was monitored by analytic C18 reversed phase HPLC. Aliquots (100 μl) of the folding reaction mixture were taken at regular intervals, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of TFA before HPLC analysis. The oxidative folding was quantitative over 30 min. The peptide was purified on to a Resource S column (GE Healthcare) using a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The fractions corresponding to the pure peptide were loaded on a Sep-Pak® C18 column (6-ml column, Waters) followed by washing with 5% aqueous AcOH, eluted by MeCN/H2O/AcOH, 5:4:1, and lyophilized. Protein cleavages were performed in a total volume of 20 μl. To avoid the scrambling of disulfide bridges known to occur at basic pH, cleavages were performed in 30 mm ammonium acetate buffer adjusted to pH 6.5. Trypsin (Roche Diagnostics) cleavage of AvBD2 was performed at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w) for 4 h at 37 °C. Papain (Roche Diagnostics) was incubated with AvBD2 for 4 h at 25 °C using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:5 (w/w). For papain cleavage, the following amino acids were considered for proteinase specificity: Arg, Ala, Asn, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Lys, Phe, Leu, and Tyr. Intact and proteolyzed synthetic l-AvBD2 was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) using an Autoflex instrument (BrukerDaltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and a gridless delayed extraction ion source. Sample deposition on the MALDI plate was performed using the ultrathin layer method as described previously (14.Cadene M. Chait B.T. A robust, detergent-friendly method for mass spectrometric analysis of integral membrane proteins.Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15.Gabant G. Cadene M. Mass spectrometry of full-length integral membrane proteins to define functionally relevant structural features.Methods. 2008; 46: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted at a ratio of 1:20 with a matrix solution consisting of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid (Bruker) saturated in a solution of 66.5% water, 33.3% MeCN, and 0.1% TFA. A 0.5-μl aliquot of this analyte/matrix solution was spotted onto the ultrathin layer plate. The MALDI spot was irradiated using a 4 Hz laser pulse to produce ions. At least 200 laser shots were accumulated for each spectrum. Ions were analyzed in positive ion reflector mode with a 150-ns delay and an accelerating voltage of 19 kV. The measured m/z values correspond to the a0 peak as determined by the SNAP algorithm on the isotopic ion distribution. The spectra were calibrated externally and internally using the Pepmix calibrant mixture (Bruker) consisting of bradykinin, angiotensin, substance P, bombesin, renin substrate, adrenocorticotropic hormone 19–38, and somatostatin. Instrument parameters were adjusted using FlexControl (Bruker). Data analysis and internal calibration were performed using FlexAnalysis (Bruker). The disulfide-bridged cleavage peptides were mapped to the known AvBD2 sequence using the PeptideMap software tool from the PROWL website (The Rockefeller University, New York). Given the amino acid sequence of the protein and the proteinase cleavage specificity, PeptideMap automatically computes all theoretically possible combinations of bridged peptides and matches the observed masses to the corresponding theoretical masses. The antibacterial activities of the peptides were measured by radial diffusion assay (16.Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. Ultrasensitive assays for endogenous antimicrobial polypeptides.J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) as described in Derache et al. (11.Derache C. Labas V. Aucagne V. Meudal H. Landon C. Delmas A.F. Magallon T. Lalmanach A.C. Primary structure and antibacterial activity of chicken bone marrow-derived β-defensins.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 4647-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in gel containing either one of the following Gram-positive bacterial strains: Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, and Listeria monocytogenes strain EGD, or one of the following Gram-negative bacterial strains: E. coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 13076, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. For each bacterial strain, three identical independent measurements of the antibacterial activity were performed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each peptide was determined from a graph constructed by plotting the log peptide concentration against the diameter of the clear zone on the plate minus the diameter of the well. The best fit straight line was determined using linear regression with GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software). The MIC was calculated by finding the x-intercept of the line, indicating the peptide concentration where no clear zone was obtained. For each bacterial strain, the statistical difference between native and variant peptide MICs was assessed by comparing the slope and intercepts of both regression lines with GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. The CD experiments were carried out on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Solutions of 30 μm (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) of both l-AvBD2 and d-AvBD2 enantiomers were compared. A standard set of two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments (COSY, 80-ms TOCSY and 160-ms NOESY) was performed on a 0.1 mm aqueous solution of the synthetic l-AvBD2 (H2O/D2O 90:10 and 100% D2O) at pH 4.1 and at 293 K. An additional set of data, recorded at 303 K, was used to resolve assignment ambiguities due to spin system overlaps. All spectra were recorded on a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer (NMR Facilities, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The NMR data sets were processed using the NMRPipe/NMRDraw software package (17.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11637) Google Scholar, 18.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. NMRview: A computer program for the visualization and analysis of NMR data.J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were assigned according to classical procedures (19.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Interscience W, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). NOE cross-peaks were integrated and assigned within the NMRView software (17.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11637) Google Scholar). Covalent bonds were built between the sulfur atoms of the paired cysteines. Structure calculations were performed with the ARIA 1.1 software (20.Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Automated assignment of ambiguous nuclear Overhauser effects with ARIA.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The calculations were initiated using the default parameters of ARIA and a first set of easily assigned NOEs. At the end of each run, the new assignments proposed by ARIA were checked manually and introduced (or not) in the following calculation. This iterative process was repeated until complete assignment of the NOESY map. A last run of 1000 structures was then performed with the final list of NOE-derived distance restraints, and 200 structures were submitted to the last step on ARIA. The 10 structures without residual NOE violation and with the lowest residual NOE energy were selected and considered as characteristic of the peptide structures. Representation and quantitative analysis of the calculated structures were performed using MOLMOL (21.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. MOLMOL: a program for display and analysis of macromolecular structures.J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and in-house programs. The same sets of experiments were recorded on a VARIAN 600 MHz spectrometer for the variant AvBD2-K31A (2.4 mm of the synthetic peptide in aqueous solution at pH 4.2 and at 293 K). The same protocol was followed except that ambiguous constraints were introduced between cysteine residues, using the “ambiguous disulfide bridges” protocol of the ARIA 1.1 software (20.Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Automated assignment of ambiguous nuclear Overhauser effects with ARIA.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The peptide elongation of AvBD2 was carried out by solid-phase peptide synthesis following the Fmoc/t-butyl strategy. Besides repeating most of the coupling steps twice, optimization of the elongation yield required the combined use of pseudoproline dipeptide derivatives and a polar resin (22.Cremer G.A. Tariq H. Delmas A.F. Combining a polar resin and a pseudo-proline to optimize the solid-phase synthesis of a “difficult sequence.”.J. Pept. Sci. 2006; 12: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our synthetic strategy also involved the use of the acetamidomethyl group as a TFA-stable protection of cysteinyl residues to obtain the linear S-Acm-alkylated AvBD2 (AvBD2-Acm). To obtain the linear nonalkylated AvBD2 from the same batch of peptide resin, we developed conditions for the removal of the Acm groups on the peptide resin before the final TFA treatment. After HPLC purification of the reduced form of AvBD2, the oxidative folding was carried out using a procedure based on a thermodynamically controlled disulfide shuffling, in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione at pH 8.5. The folding kinetics was followed by quantitative analytical HPLC, and the reaction was shown to be complete in 30 min (supplemental Fig. S1). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of oxidized AvBD2 showed a 6-Da difference in mass compared with the reduced form, consistent with the fully oxidized form of this peptide (data not shown). The oxidized AvBD2 was then purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography. Reversed phase HPLC analysis showed that synthetic AvBD2 co-eluted with the natural product extracted from chicken bone marrow (supplemental Fig. S2). As further evidence of the identity of the synthetic and natural peptides, their activities measured in MIC assays were in the same range for every bacterial strain tested (supplemental Table S1). Altogether, our data validated an efficient optimized protocol for the production of highly pure and biologically active synthetic AvBD2. It was successfully applied to the synthesis of the all-d-enantiomeric homologues of AvBD2 (d-AvBD2) and the AvBD2-K31A variant (supplemental Fig. S3). The all-d-form was checked by circular dichroïsm where CD spectra of the two enatiomers show equal and opposite spectra (supplemental Fig. S4). In the case of the AvBD2-K31A variant, the increase in hydrophobicity led to a poor folding yield. Organic solvents were then screened as folding additives (supplemental Table S2) and MeCN, which greatly enhanced the yield, was selected for preparative scale oxidative foldings. Our optimized protocol, including an efficient peptide elongation and the use of a co-solvent for the folding step, enabled an enhanced production yield up to 30–40% for all the AvBD2 peptides. The antimicrobial activities of d-AvBD2 and l-AvBD2 were tested on a selection of three Gram-positive (B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus) and three Gram-negative (E. coli, S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium) bacterial strains. As shown in Table 1, the MICs measured for the two enantiomers are identical for every tested strain.TABLE 1Antibacterial activity of AvBD2 peptidesBacterial strainsMIC in μml-AvBD2d-AvBD2l-AvBD2-AcmAvBD2-K31AAvBD2-K31A-AcmGram +B. cereus0.310.343.47ap = 0.0002.0.75bp = 0.0003.>58.26(0.19–0.47)(0.19–0.53)(2.12–4.87)(0.56–0.97)L. monocytogenes0.200.203.21ap = 0.0002.1.55cp < 0.0001.23.3–58.26(0.09–0.36)(0.11–0.34)(0.98–6.13)(1.05–2.14)S. aureus0.581.37>114.996.56cp < 0.0001.>116.52(0.05–1.79)(0.35–3.03)(0–32.5)Gram −E. coli1.091.051.232.07dp = 0.016.23.3–58.26(0.68–1.57)(0.73–1.40)(0.32–2.49)(0.11–5.20)S. enterica sv.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the role of the well conserved three-dimensional frame of β-defensin in AvBD2 functionality, the antibacterial activities of the linear S-alkylated AvBD2 (AvBD2-Acm) were compared with the activities of its oxidatively folded counterpart (Table 1). The linear AvBD2-Acm is less active than the folded AvBD2 for every bacterial strain tested except for E. coli (p = 0.06), as shown by the dramatic increase in the MIC of AvBD2 when linear. In particular, the linear form of AvBD2 is 10 and 16 times less efficient than the folded peptide against the Gram-positive strains B. cereus (p = 0.0002) and L. monocytogenes (p = 0.0002), respectively. The linear form is even ineffective in our conditions toward the Gram-positive strain S. aureus, showing the strict requirement of the three-dimensional fold for an optimal antimicrobial activity. The effect of the three-dimensional structure on the activity is more limited for the Gram-negative strains. Indeed, for S. enterica serovar Enteritidis and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the linear form of AvBD2 displays an activity one and a half (p < 0.0001) to three times (p = 0.0002) lower than that of the folded AvBD2 peptide. The determination of the correct disulfide pairing is generally achieved using enzymatic proteolysis of proteins and mass spectrometry analysis of the obtained cleavage products. These data can thus be introduced as additional constraints in structure calculations, allowing the three-dimensional models to converge more efficiently. For the chicken AvBD2 defensin, the trypsin proteolysis experiment produced cleavage peptides that were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The observed masses were matched to four sets of disulfide-connected peptides using the PeptideMap software (supplemental Table S3). Although peptides Leu1–Lys4 and Val20–Arg27 each contain one connectable cysteine, peptides Gly5–Lys19 and Ser28–Lys31 each have two cysteines that can participate in disulfide bridges. The connection of Leu1–Lys4 to Ser28–Lys31 shows that Cys3 is connected to Cys29 or Cys30. Similarly, Cys23 has to be linked to either Cys8 or Cys13. These first two connected products were observed with one linked cysteine and one free thiol. The products containing three connected peptides show that the remaining cysteine, either 8 or 13, forms a bond with the remaining cysteine 29 or 30. Trypsin cleavage thus narrowed down the number of possible disulfide bridges combinations to four (supplemental Fig. S5). Papain proteolysis produced one set of connected peptides, defining the Cys8–Cys23 bridge for certain. Consequently, in keeping with the trypsin result showing that Cys13 does not connect with Cys3, Cys13 can only connect with Cys29 or Cys30. However, these adjacent cysteines could not be differentiated. It is a known limitation of this method that, because of the impossibility to cleave between adjacent half-cystinyl residues, connected peptides containing a single disulfide bond cannot be obtained in such cases (22.Cremer G.A. Tariq H. Delmas A.F. Combining a polar resin and a pseudo-proline to optimize the solid-phase synthesis of a “difficult sequence.”.J. Pept. Sci. 2006; 12: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Following analyses by enzymatic proteol"
https://openalex.org/W2033013800,"The ultimate goal of catalytic antibody research is to develop new patient therapies that use the advantages offered by human catalytic antibodies. The establishment of a high-throughput method for obtaining valuable candidate catalytic antibodies must be accelerated to achieve this objective. In this study, based on our concept that we can find antibody light chains with a high probability of success if they include a serine protease-like catalytic triad composed of Ser, His, and Asp on a variable region of the antibody structure, we amplified and cloned DNAs encoding human antibody light chains from germline genes of subgroup II by seminested PCR using two primer sets designed for this purpose. Seven DNA fragments encoding light chains in 17 clones were derived from germline gene A18b, 6 DNA fragments from A3/A19, 2 DNA fragments from A17, and a clone DNA fragment from A5 and O11/O1. All light chains expressed in Escherichia coli and highly purified under nondenaturing conditions exhibited amidolytic activity against synthetic peptides. Some of the light chains exhibited unique features that suppressed the infectious activity of the rabies virus. Furthermore, the survival rate of mice in which a lethal level of the rabies virus was coinoculated directly into the brain with light chain 18 was significantly improved. In the case of humans, these results demonstrate that high-throughput selection of light chains possessing catalytic functions and specificity for a target molecule can be attained from a light-chain DNA library amplified from germline genes belonging to subgroup II."
https://openalex.org/W2020106188,"Correlated mutation analysis has a long history of interesting applications, mostly in the detection of contact pairs in protein structures. Based on previous observations that, if properly assessed, amino acid correlation data can also provide insights about functional sub-classes in a protein family, we provide a complete framework devoted to this purpose. An amino acid specific correlation measure is proposed, which can be used to build networks summarizing all correlation and anti-correlation patterns in a protein family. These networks can be submitted to community structure detection algorithms, resulting in subsets of correlated amino acids which can be further assessed by specific parameters and procedures that provide insight into the relationship between different communities, the individual importance of community members and the adherence of a given amino acid sequence to a given community. By applying this framework to three protein families with contrasting characteristics (the Fe/Mn-superoxide dismutases, the peroxidase-catalase family and the C-type lysozyme/α-lactalbumin family), we show how our method and the proposed parameters and procedures are related to biological characteristics observed in these protein families, highlighting their potential use in protein characterization and gene annotation."
https://openalex.org/W2085036241,"Both pandemic and seasonal influenza are receiving more attention from mass media than ever before. Topics such as epidemic severity and vaccination are changing the way in which we perceive the utility of disease prevention. Voluntary influenza vaccination has been recently modeled using inductive reasoning games. It has thus been found that severe epidemics may occur because individuals do not vaccinate and, instead, attempt to benefit from the immunity of their peers. Such epidemics could be prevented by voluntary vaccination if incentives were offered. However, a key assumption has been that individuals make vaccination decisions based on whether there was an epidemic each influenza season; no other epidemiological information is available to them. In this work, we relax this assumption and investigate the consequences of making more informed vaccination decisions while no incentives are offered. We obtain three major results. First, individuals will not cooperate enough to constantly prevent influenza epidemics through voluntary vaccination no matter how much they learned about influenza epidemiology. Second, broadcasting epidemiological information richer than whether an epidemic occurred may stabilize the vaccination coverage and suppress severe influenza epidemics. Third, the stable vaccination coverage follows the trend of the perceived benefit of vaccination. However, increasing the amount of epidemiological information released to the public may either increase or decrease the perceived benefit of vaccination. We discuss three scenarios where individuals know, in addition to whether there was an epidemic, (i) the incidence, (ii) the vaccination coverage and (iii) both the incidence and the vaccination coverage, every influenza season. We show that broadcasting both the incidence and the vaccination coverage could yield either better or worse vaccination coverage than broadcasting each piece of information on its own."
https://openalex.org/W2151373362,"In July 2009, WHO and partners were notified of a large outbreak of unknown illness, including deaths, among African Union (AU) soldiers in Mogadishu. Illnesses were characterized by peripheral edema, dyspnea, palpitations, and fever. Our objectives were to determine the cause of the outbreak, and to design and recommend control strategies.The illness was defined as acute onset of lower limb edema, with dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or headache. Investigations in Nairobi and Mogadishu included clinical, epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory studies. A case-control study was performed to identify risk factors for illness.From April 26, 2009 to May 1, 2010, 241 AU soldiers had lower limb edema and at least one additional symptom; four patients died. At least 52 soldiers were airlifted to hospitals in Kenya and Uganda. Four of 31 hospitalized patients in Kenya had right-sided heart failure with pulmonary hypertension. Initial laboratory investigations did not reveal hematologic, metabolic, infectious or toxicological abnormalities. Illness was associated with exclusive consumption of food provided to troops (not eating locally acquired foods) and a high level of insecurity (e.g., being exposed to enemy fire on a daily basis). Because the syndrome was clinically compatible with wet beriberi, thiamine was administered to ill soldiers, resulting in rapid and dramatic resolution. Blood samples taken from 16 cases prior to treatment showed increased levels of erythrocyte transketolase activation coefficient, consistent with thiamine deficiency. With mass thiamine supplementation for healthy troops, the number of subsequent beriberi cases decreased with no further deaths reported.An outbreak of wet beriberi caused by thiamine deficiency due to restricted diet occurred among soldiers in a modern, well-equipped army. Vigilance to ensure adequate micronutrient intake must be a priority in populations completely dependent upon nutritional support from external sources."
https://openalex.org/W2042940417,"Expression and activation of the Ste20-like kinase, SLK, is increased during kidney development and recovery from ischemic acute kidney injury. SLK promotes apoptosis, and it may regulate cell survival during injury or repair. This study addresses the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of kinase activity. We mutated serine and threonine residues in the putative activation segment of the SLK catalytic domain and expressed wild type (WT) and mutant proteins in COS-1 or glomerular epithelial cells. Compared with SLK WT, the T183A, S189A, and T183A/S189A mutants showed reduced in vitro kinase activity. SLK WT, but not mutants, increased activation-specific phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase. Similarly, SLK WT stimulated activator protein-1 reporter activity, but activation of activator protein-1 by the three SLK mutants was ineffective. To test if homodimerization of SLK affects phosphorylation, the cDNA encoding SLK amino acids 1–373 (which include the catalytic domain) was fused with a cDNA for a modified FK506-binding protein, Fv (Fv-SLK 1–373). After transfection, the addition of AP20187 (an FK506 analog) induced regulated dimerization of Fv-SLK 1–373. AP20187-stimulated dimerization enhanced the kinase activity of Fv-SLK 1–373 WT. In contrast, kinase activity of Fv-SLK 1–373 T183A/S189A was weak and was not enhanced after dimerization. Finally, apoptosis was increased after expression of Fv-SLK 1–373 WT but not T183A/S189A. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Ser-189 plays a key role in the activation and signaling of SLK and could represent a target for novel therapeutic approaches to renal injury.

Protein kinases form a diverse and important gene family in eukaryotes (1.Scheeff E.D. Bourne P.E. Structural evolution of the protein kinase-like superfamily.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, and their dysregulation can result in diseases (2.Ali A.S. Ali S. El-Rayes B.F.

Dysregulation in polycystic kidney disease.Kidney Int. 2008; 73: 251-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of protein kinases is tightly regulated, often via the activation segment, which may be phosphorylated by other kinases to facilitate catalytic activity (4.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases. Controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Typically, a kinase will phosphorylate the activation segment of a downstream kinase, allowing the downstream kinase to further propagate a signal (4.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases. Controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). When unphosphorylated, the activation segment is largely unstructured. Phosphorylation of the activation segment at the primary phosphorylation site stabilizes the kinase in a conformation suitable for substrate binding. Kinases may also have secondary phosphorylation sites in their activation segment, which may enhance activity. Secondary phosphorylation may also aid in the recruitment of substrate by changing the conformation of a kinase to facilitate substrate binding. Once a kinase is stabilized and activated, the catalytic domain identifies a specific substrate and phosphorylates the substrate via its active site. This process can be facilitated by increasing the local concentration of a kinase relative to its substrate and may include dimerization of the kinase (4.Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases. Controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). A subset of kinases can also autoactivate via self-phosphorylation of their activation segment by their catalytic domains (5.Oliver A.W. Knapp S. Pearl L.H. Activation segment exchange. A common mechanism of kinase autophosphorylation?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This form of activation requires that the activation segment contain a consensus sequence that can be recognized by the catalytic domain. In some kinases activation segment dimerization is a mechanism for kinase autophosphorylation of non-consensus sites (5.Oliver A.W. Knapp S. Pearl L.H. Activation segment exchange. A common mechanism of kinase autophosphorylation?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This allows the catalytic domain of one dimerization partner to phosphorylate the activation domain of the other partner even if the activation domain does not correspond to the substrate consensus sequence of the catalytic domain. Activation segment domain exchange is a mechanism proposed for the in trans activation of kinases that do not require a consensus sequence to be present in the activation segment of their binding partner. In this model dimerization is induced in an adjacent homodimerization domain. As such, the kinases are ideally positioned, so that a transient activation of one catalytic site leads to the phosphorylation of the activation segment of the binding partner. This in turn leads to the activation of the binding partner and the phosphorylation of the original kinase in its activation segment; the final result is the activation of two kinases, which can then phosphorylate downstream targets with or without prior dissociation (5.Oliver A.W. Knapp S. Pearl L.H. Activation segment exchange. A common mechanism of kinase autophosphorylation?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SLK is a serine/threonine protein kinase related to yeast Ste20 (6.Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A.

The regulation and functions of SLK have received considerable attention in recent years. Downstream signaling by SLK involves mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. We demonstrated that in kidney epithelial cells, overexpression of SLK activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. SLK can also activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and increase the transactivation of p53 (13.Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Guillemette J. Papillon J. Volpini R.A. Di Battista J.A.

Exposure of cultured kidney epithelial cells to chemical anoxia and re-exposure to glucose (which recapitulates ischemia-reperfusion in vivo) stimulated SLK activity (10.Cybulsky A.V. Takano T.

Overexpression of SLK in cultured GECs (which we have used to model the increased expression observed in the in vivo circumstances) resulted in a modest proapoptotic effect, and in the setting of ischemia reperfusion, SLK overexpression markedly exacerbated cell death (10.Cybulsky A.V.

Overexpression of SLK also induced apoptosis in other cell lines (15.Sabourin L.A.

Together, the studies suggest that SLK may regulate cell survival during development, injury, or repair. In fibroblasts, SLK regulates cytoskeletal remodeling. SLK was found to be associated with the microtubular network, and activation of SLK via focal adhesion kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways destabilized the actin network. This process affected focal adhesion turnover, cell adhesion, spreading, and motility. SLK can also increase stress fiber disassembly (11.Wagner S. Flood T.A. O'Reilly P. Hume K. Sabourin L.A.

The regulation of SLK activity is complex and multifactorial. Activity may be regulated by changes in expression (10.Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Khadir A. Bijian K. Chien C.C. Alpers C.E. Rabb H. Renal expression and activity of the germinal center kinase SK2.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F16-F25Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SLK mRNA is unstable and contains adenine- and uridine-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region that appear to regulate mRNA stability (21.Cybulsky A.V. Takano T. Papillon J. Hao W. Mancini A.

The C-terminal region containing coiled-coil domains was recently shown to facilitate dimerization of the protein (22.Delarosa S. Guillemette J. Papillon J. Han Y.S. Kristof A.S. Cybulsky A.V.

Activation segment dimerization. A mechanism for kinase autophosphorylation of non-consensus sites.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activation loop of SLK contains at least two potential phosphorylation sites, Thr-183 and Ser-189, and based on the crystal structure of the SLK catalytic domain, it was proposed that activation may involve homodimerization of SLK catalytic domains and phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Ser-189 (25.Pike A.C. Rellos P. Niesen F.H. Turnbull A. Oliver A.W. Parker S.A. Turk B.E. Pearl L.H. Knapp S. Activation segment dimerization. A mechanism for kinase autophosphorylation of non-consensus sites.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation would occur as one SLK molecule enters into close contact with the catalytic domain of the other and vice versa. It should, however, be noted that the kinase domain of SLK recognizes an amino acid sequence that is not in the activation segment of SLK (25.Pike A.C. Rellos P. Niesen F.H. Turnbull A. Oliver A.W. Parker S.A. Turk B.E. Pearl L.H. Knapp S. Activation segment dimerization. A mechanism for kinase autophosphorylation of non-consensus sites.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the SLK catalytic domain is able to form dimers in vitro and to phosphorylate its partner activation segment at Thr-183 and Ser-189. Phosphorylation may facilitate the formation of a hydrogen bond network, and a bond between Lys-63 and Glu-79 might be sufficient to lock an SLK monomer in an active conformation, suitable for substrate binding (25.Pike A.C. Rellos P. Niesen F.H. Turnbull A. Oliver A.W. Parker S.A. Turk B.E. Pearl L.H. Knapp S. Activation segment dimerization. A mechanism for kinase autophosphorylation of non-consensus sites.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that Thr-193 in SLK is highly conserved in the evolutionarily related kinases, DAPK3 (death-associated protein kinase-3) and CHK2 (checkpoint kinase-2), where it is a known phosphorylation site, possibly playing a regulatory role (25.Pike A.C. Rellos P. Niesen F.H. Turnbull A. Oliver A.W. Parker S.A. Turk B.E. Pearl L.H. Knapp S. Activation segment dimerization.

We selected amino acids Lys-63, Glu-79, Thr-183, Ser-189, and Thr-193 in SLK for further study. These amino acids were mutated to test their functional role in the activation of SLK. We demonstrate that mutations in amino acids in the activation segment (Thr-183, Ser-189, and Thr-193) reduce activity; moreover, mutations in amino acids that may form a bond in the catalytic domain, which sustains catalytic activity (Lys-63, Glu-E79), also result in a kinase with reduced activity.

For the T183A mutation, the PCR reactions included full-length SLK forward and T183A reverse primers (T183A Reaction 1) and T183A forward/full-length SLK reverse primers (T183A Reaction 2). Full-length HA-SLK WT in pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) was used as the template. Products of T183A reactions 1 and 2 were combined in a third PCR reaction using primers full-length SLK forward and full-length SLK reverse (Reaction 3) to generate a 1674-base pair SLK T183A cDNA.

For studies of homodimerization, the N-terminal domains of SLK WT and SLK mutants (amino acids 1–373) were fused with two modified FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domains (Fv-SLK 1–373) (22.Delarosa S.

A silent mutation that removed an internal XbaI site in the catalytic domain of SLK and the SLK T183A/S189A mutant was created by PCR using Primer 1/-XbaI Primer 1 (-XbaI Reaction 1) and Primer 2/-XbaI Primer 2 (-XbaI Reaction 2). The SLK(-XbaI) and T183A/S189A(-XbaI) SLK cDNA was produced by PCR by combining the products from -XbaI reaction 1 and 2 and using Primer 1 and Primer 2. To create Fv-SLK 1–373 T193A, SLK(-XbaI) was used as template for PCRs with Primer 1 and T193A reverse (T193A Reaction 1) and T193A forward and Primer 2 (T193A Reaction 2) before being combined into the complete catalytic domain with Primer 1 and Primer 2 (T193A Reaction 3). Similarly, SLK mutants T183D, T183E, S189D, S189E, K63R, and E79A were produced using three reactions (Table 1). PCR products were blunt end-ligated into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+). The vector was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the WT or mutant cDNAs encoding the SLK kinase domains were subcloned into pC4M-Fv2E upstream of two modified FKBP domains and an HA tag (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) (the myristoylation sequence was deleted from the pC4M-Fv2E vector). All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. For studies of heterodimerization, SLK 1–373 WT and T183A/S189A cDNAs (described above) were subcloned into pC4M-F2E (without the myristoylation sequence) upstream of two unmodified FKBP domains and an HA tag (Ariad Pharmaceuticals). Also, SLK 1–373 WT, K63R and T183A/S189A cDNAs were subcloned into pC4M-RHE, upstream of a single FRB and an HA tag (Ariad Pharmaceuticals). FRB is a 93-amino acid portion of the FKBP-12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP or mTOR), which is sufficient for binding the complex of FKBP-rapamycin (29.Muthuswamy S.K. Gilman M. Brugge J.S.

For transfection, cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. 7.5 × 105 cells were passaged into 100-mm plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with 4.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer.

https://openalex.org/W2080836516,"Upper hinge is vulnerable to radical attacks that result in breakage of the heavy-light chain linkage and cleavage of the hinge of an IgG1. To further explore mechanisms responsible for the radical induced hinge degradation, nine mutants were designed to determine the roles that the upper hinge Asp and His play in the radical reactions. The observation that none of these substitutions could inhibit the breakage of the heavy-light chain linkage suggests that the breakage may result from electron transfer from Cys(231) directly to the heavy-light chain linkage upon radical attacks, and implies a pathway separate from His(229)-mediated hinge cleavage. On the other hand, the substitution of His(229) with Tyr showed promising advantages over the native antibody and other substitutions in improving the stability and function of the IgG1. This substitution inhibited the hinge cleavage by 98% and suggests that the redox active nature of Tyr did not enable it to replicate the ability of His to facilitate radical induced degradation. We propose that the lower redox potential of Tyr, a residue that may be the ultimate sink for oxidizing equivalents in proteins, is responsible for the inhibition. More importantly, the substitution increased the antibody's binding to FcγRIII receptors by 2-3-fold, and improved ADCC activity by 2-fold, while maintaining a similar pharmacokinetic profile with respect to the wild type. Implications of these observations for antibody engineering and development are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059011467,"Vitiligo is a chronic depigmented skin disorder with regional melanocytes depletion. The pathogenesis was not completely clarified. Recently, more and more evidence suggested that polymorphisms of some genes are associated with vitiligo risk. Here, we want to examine the association between the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene polymorphisms and the risk of vitiligo in Chinese populations.In a hospital-based case-control study of 749 patients with vitiligo and 763 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, three polymorphisms of iNOS gene were genotyped by using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and mutagenically separated PCR (MS-PCR) methods, respectively. We found the iNOS-954 polymorphism was associated with a significantly higher risk of vitiligo (adjusted OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.02-1.81). Furthermore, this association is more pronounced in vulgaris vitiligo, active vitiligo and vitiligo without other autoimmune diseases in the stratification study. Analysis of haplotypes showed increased risk for the C₋₁₁₇₃C₋₉₅₄C(Ex₁₆+₁₄) (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.01-1.74). In addition, the serum iNOS activity is significantly associated with iNOS-954 combined genotype (GC+CC) and is much higher in vitiligo patients than in the controls (P<0.01). Logistic regression analysis of iNOS activity showed increased risk between higher activity and iNOS-954 G→C variant genotype carriers (P(trend)<0.001).INOS gene polymorphisms may play an important role in the genetic susceptibility to the development of vitiligo."
https://openalex.org/W2109612002,"The distribution of chromatin within the mammalian nucleus is constrained by its organization into chromosome territories (CTs). However, recent studies have suggested that promiscuous intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions play fundamental roles in regulating chromatin function and so might define the spatial integrity of CTs. In order to test the extent of DNA mixing between CTs, DNA foci of individual CTs were labeled in living cells following incorporation of Alexa-488 and Cy-3 conjugated replication precursor analogues during consecutive cell cycles. Uniquely labeled chromatin domains, resolved following random mitotic segregation, were visualized as discrete structures with defined borders. At the level of resolution analysed, evidence for mixing of chromatin from adjacent domains was only apparent within the surface volumes where neighboring CTs touched. However, while less than 1% of the nuclear volume represented domains of inter-chromosomal mixing, the dynamic plasticity of DNA foci within individual CTs allows continual transformation of CT structure so that different domains of chromatin mixing evolve over time. Notably, chromatin mixing at the boundaries of adjacent CTs had little impact on the innate structural properties of DNA foci. However, when TSA was used to alter the extent of histone acetylation changes in chromatin correlated with increased chromatin mixing. We propose that DNA foci maintain a structural integrity that restricts widespread mixing of DNA and discuss how the potential to dynamically remodel genome organization might alter during cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2069831571,"To evaluate community-based values for avoiding pandemic influenza (A) H1N1 (pH1N1) illness and vaccination-related adverse events in adults and children.Adult community members were randomly selected from a nationally representative research panel to complete an internet survey (response rate = 65%; n = 718). Respondents answered a series of time trade-off questions to value four hypothetical health state scenarios for varying ages (1, 8, 35, or 70 years): uncomplicated pH1N1 illness, pH1N1 illness-related hospitalization, severe allergic reaction to the pH1N1 vaccine, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. We calculated descriptive statistics for time trade-off amounts and derived quality adjusted life year losses for these events. Multivariate regression analyses evaluated the effect of scenario age, as well as respondent socio-demographic and health characteristics on time trade-off amounts.Respondents were willing to trade more time to avoid the more severe outcomes, hospitalization and Guillain-Barré syndrome. In our adjusted and unadjusted analyses, age of the patient in the scenario was significantly associated with time trade-off amounts (p-value<0.05), with respondents willing to trade more time to prevent outcomes in children versus adults. Persons who had received the pH1N1 vaccination were willing to trade significantly more time to avoid hospitalization, severe allergic reaction, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, controlling for other variables in adjusted analyses.(p-value<0.05)Community members placed the highest value on preventing outcomes in children, compared with adults, and the time trade-off values reported were consistent with the severity of the outcomes presented. Considering these public values along with other decision-making factors may help policy makers improve the allocation of pandemic vaccine resources."
https://openalex.org/W2086278297,"Negative and positive transcriptional feedback loops are present in natural and synthetic genetic oscillators. A single gene with negative transcriptional feedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the transmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A single gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce oscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction with a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine a model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive feedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and activates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a repressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A stochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic study identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two types of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and this protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual negative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting on the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient condition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive transcriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor gene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop is not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the formation of protein multimers. Therefore, our findings could help to clarify the design principles of cellular clocks and constitute a new efficient tool for engineering synthetic genetic oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W2009305068,"Background Given the considerable geographic overlap in the endemic regions for malaria and tuberculosis, it is probable that co-infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium species are prevalent. Thus, it is quite likely that both malaria and TB vaccines may be used in the same populations in endemic areas. While novel vaccines are currently being developed and tested individually against each of these pathogens, the efficacy of these vaccines has not been evaluated in co-infection models. To further assess the effectiveness of these new immunization strategies, we investigated whether co-infection with malaria would impact the anti-tuberculosis protection induced by four different types of TB vaccines in a mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Principal Findings Here we show that the anti-tuberculosis protective immunity induced by four different tuberculosis vaccines was not impacted by a concurrent infection with Plasmodium yoelii NL, a nonlethal form of murine malaria. After an aerogenic challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis, the lung bacterial burdens of vaccinated animals were not statistically different in malaria infected and malaria naïve mice. Multi-parameter flow cytometric analysis showed that the frequency and the median fluorescence intensities (MFI) for specific multifunctional T (MFT) cells expressing IFN-γ, TNF-α, and/or IL-2 were suppressed by the presence of malaria parasites at 2 weeks following the malaria infection but was not affected after parasite clearance at 7 and 10 weeks post-challenge with P. yoelii NL. Conclusions Our data indicate that the effectiveness of novel TB vaccines in protecting against tuberculosis was unaffected by a primary malaria co-infection in a mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis. While the activities of specific MFT cell subsets were reduced at elevated levels of malaria parasitemia, the T cell suppression was short-lived. Our findings have important relevance in developing strategies for the deployment of new TB vaccines in malaria endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W2047584792,"Music listeners have difficulty correctly understanding and remembering song lyrics. However, results from the present study support the hypothesis that young adults can learn African-American English (AAE) vocabulary from listening to hip-hop music. Non-African-American participants first gave free-response definitions to AAE vocabulary items, after which they answered demographic questions as well as questions addressing their social networks, their musical preferences, and their knowledge of popular culture. Results from the survey show a positive association between the number of hip-hop artists listened to and AAE comprehension vocabulary scores. Additionally, participants were more likely to know an AAE vocabulary item if the hip-hop artists they listen to use the word in their song lyrics. Together, these results suggest that young adults can acquire vocabulary through exposure to hip-hop music, a finding relevant for research on vocabulary acquisition, the construction of adolescent and adult identities, and the adoption of lexical innovations."
https://openalex.org/W2046278277,"When one watches a sports game, one may feel her/his own muscles moving in synchrony with the player's. Such parallels between observed actions of others and one's own has been well supported in the latest progress in neuroscience, and coined ""mirror system."" It is likely that due to such phenomena, we are able to learn motor skills just by observing an expert's performance. Yet it is unknown whether such indirect learning occurs only at higher cognitive levels, or also at basic sensorimotor levels where sensorimotor delay is compensated and the timing of sensory feedback is constantly calibrated.Here, we show that the subject's passive observation of an actor manipulating a computer mouse with delayed auditory feedback led to shifts in subjective simultaneity of self mouse manipulation and auditory stimulus in the observing subjects. Likewise, self adaptation to the delayed feedback modulated the simultaneity judgment of the other subjects manipulating a mouse and an auditory stimulus. Meanwhile, subjective simultaneity of a simple visual disc and the auditory stimulus (flash test) was not affected by observation of an actor nor self-adaptation.The lack of shift in the flash test for both conditions indicates that the recalibration transfer is specific to the action domain, and is not due to a general sensory adaptation. This points to the involvement of a system for the temporal monitoring of actions, one that processes both one's own actions and those of others."
