https://openalex.org/W2152112132,"Adult neural stem cells are rare, and little is known about their unique characteristics, leaving their in vivo identity enigmatic. We show that Lewis X (LeX), a carbohydrate expressed by embryonic pluripotent stem cells, is made by adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) stem cells and shed into their environment. Only 4% of acutely isolated SVZ cells are LeX(+); this subpopulation, purified by FACS, contains the SVZ stem cells. Ependymal cells are LeX(-), and purified ependymal cells do not make neurospheres, resolving the controversial claim that these are stem cells. Thus, LeX expression by adult CNS stem cells aids their in vivo identification, allows their enrichment, and raises new questions about the role of this unusual carbohydrate in stem cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2013452556,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a polyglutamine disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. We generated a transgenic mouse model carrying a full-length AR containing 97 CAGs. Three of the five lines showed progressive muscular atrophy and weakness as well as diffuse nuclear staining and nuclear inclusions consisting of the mutant AR. These phenotypes were markedly pronounced in male transgenic mice, and dramatically rescued by castration. Female transgenic mice showed only a few manifestations that markedly deteriorated with testosterone administration. Nuclear translocation of the mutant AR by testosterone contributed to the phenotypic difference with gender and the effects of hormonal interventions. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of hormonal intervention for SBMA."
https://openalex.org/W1996112634,"Activation of protein tyrosine kinases is prevalent in human cancers and previous studies have demonstrated that Stat3 signaling is a point of convergence for many of these tyrosine kinases. Moreover, a critical role for constitutive activation of Stat3 in tumor cell proliferation and survival has been established in diverse cancers. However, the oncogenic signaling pathways in melanoma cells remain to be fully defined. In this study, we demonstrate that Stat3 is constitutively activated in a majority of human melanoma cell lines and tumor specimens examined. Blocking Src tyrosine kinase activity, but not EGF receptor or JAK family kinases, leads to inhibition of Stat3 signaling in melanoma cell lines. Consistent with a role of Src in the pathogenesis of melanoma, we show that c-Src tyrosine kinase is activated in melanoma cell lines. Significantly, melanoma cells undergo apoptosis when either Src kinase activity or Stat3 signaling is inhibited. Blockade of Src or Stat3 is also accompanied by down-regulation of expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1. These findings demonstrate that Src-activated Stat3 signaling is important for the growth and survival of melanoma tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994161105,"Chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. We have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate CXCR4-mediated G protein activation and to enhance CXCR4 internalization. Here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of CXCR4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or RNA-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. Expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor CCR5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. Further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened CXCR4-mediated activation of both p38 MAPK and ERK, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. Interestingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK activation (but not ERK activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 MAPK effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ASK1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. The results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of CXCR4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ASK1/p38 MAPK pathway.

Chemokines are a family of soluble peptides that promote the recruitment of various types of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and to secondary lymphoid organs (1Baggiolini M.

SDF-1/CXCR4 plays an important role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis and is mandatory for various development processes, in particular the development of the brain, heart, and blood vessels (16Bleul C.C.

It has recently been demonstrated that chemotaxis induced by CXCR4 is involved in breast cancer metastasis (20Müller A. Homey B. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4453) Google Scholar). As a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), CXCR4 can be regulated by β-arrestin, which is a well known regulator of GPCRs. Our previous study demonstrates that β-arrestin can functionally interact with CXCR4 on SDF-1 stimulation and thus significantly attenuate CXCR4-mediated G-protein activation and promote CXCR4 internalization (21Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recent discoveries indicate that β-arrestin also plays an important role as a scaffold that links GPCRs to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades such as Raf, ERK, ASK1, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 3 (22McDonald P.H. et al.Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, formation of β-arrestin complexes with Hck or c-Fgr after stimulation of CXCR1 by interleukin 8 leads to Hck or c-Fgr activation that regulates CXCR1-mediated granule exocytosis (23Barlic J. Andrews J.D. Kelvin A.A. Bosinger S.E. DeVries M.E. Xu L. Dobransky T. Feldman R.D. Ferguson S.S. Kelvin D.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A very recent report shows that lymphocytes from β-arrestin2-deficient mice are strikingly impaired in their ability to respond to CXCL12 (SDF-1) in migration assays (24Fong A.M. Premont R.T. Richardson R.M. Yu Y.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Patel D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that p38 MAPK is functionally involved in cell migration and chemotaxis. Oddly enough, however, both p38 MAPK and ERK can respond to chemotactic stimulation. In human endothelial cells, inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by its specific inhibitor leads to blockage of EGF-induced cell migration, and this is correlated to its attenuation of heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation and actin reorganization (25Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). It is also reported that inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogates methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein-1-induced chemotaxis (26Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, the potential role of p38 MAPK in CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis is not known yet. SDF-1α was purchased from Leinco Technologies, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). PD98059, U0126, SB203580, SKF86002, and SB202474 were from Calbiochem. The anti-ASK1 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-β-arrestin polyclonal antibody was produced in our laboratory as described (27Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Zhou T.H. Cen B. Guo S.Q. Pei G. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao. 1999; 31: 344-346PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length CXCR4 and β-arrestin2 clones were generated as described (28Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). T140 is a generous gift from Dr. Stephen C. Peiper (Dept. of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA). The ASK1 (K709R) was subcloned by PCR from ASK1 plasmid that was a generous gift from Dr. Jiahuai Han (Dept. of Immunology, the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Construction of RNAi plasmid for β-arrestin2 was performed as described (29Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar elB. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The BS/U6 vector was a generous gift of Dr. Yang Shi (Dept. of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). A 22-nucleotide oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide 1) that corresponded to nucleotides 216–237 of the β-arrestin2 coding region was first inserted into the BS/U6 vector withApaI (blunted) and XhoI. The inverted motif that contains the six-nucleotide spacer and five Ts (oligonucleotide 2) was then subcloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the intermediate plasmid to generate BS/U6/β-arrestin2. Oligonucleotide 1 is 5′-GGCTTGTCCTTCCGCAAAGACA-3′(forward) and 5′-AGCTTGTCTTTGCGGAAGGACAAGCC-3′ (reverse). Oligonucleotide 2 is 5′-AGCTTGTCTTTGCGGAAGGACAAGCCCTTTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGCTTGTCCTTCCGCAAAGACA-3[prime(reverse). The sequences for the body of the small interfering RNA for β-arrestin2 was taken from GenBanktm accession no. NM_004313 (nucleotides 270–290). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were cultured in 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For stable transfection, HEK293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA that contained a neomycin-selectable marker by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were selected and maintained in G418 (800 μg/ml). For transient transfection, HEK293 cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as described previously (28Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses that encode β-galactosidase or β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin2 antisense were prepared as described previously (30Mundell S.J. Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Briefly, β-galactosidase, β-arrestin2, or β-arrestin2 antisense was cloned into shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV by using standard cloning protocols, and the shuttle vectors were recombined with pAdEasy-1, which harbors a CMV-driven green fluorescent protein, to form the viral constructs. The adenoviral plasmids were transfected into the HEK293 cells to generate recombinant adenovirus. The assays were performed in blind well chambers (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD) as described (32Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For each agonist concentration tested, cells migrated through to the underside of the membrane were counted in five high power fields, in a blinded fashion. The migration index for each experiment was calculated as the mean number of cells that migrated toward medium-containing agonist divided by the mean number of cells that migrated toward medium-containing bovine serum albumin only. After serum starvation for 12 h in 0.1% bovine serum albumin-minimum Eagle's medium, the cells were stimulated with SDF-1α and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoehanol. Aliquots of the whole cell extracts prepared were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The total amounts of ERK and phosphorylated ERK were detected by anti-total-ERK antibodies and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies (New England Biolabs Inc.), respectively. The total amounts of p38 MAPK and phosphorylated p38 MAPK were detected by anti-total-p38 antibodies and anti-phospho-p38 antibodies (New England Biolabs Inc.), respectively. After being stimulated with SDF-1α in serum-free medium, the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. Next the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation to detect p38 MAPK kinase activity by using the p38 MAPK kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed by Student'st test to compare independent means with pooled estimates of common variations. HeLa cells express endogenous CXCR4 receptor (33de Parseval A. Elder J.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4528-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and under the conditions of this study SDF-1α could induce HeLa cell chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). When the cells were pretreated with CXCR4-specific antagonist T140 (300 nm), SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis was totally inhibited (Fig.1 A), whereas as a control EGF-induced chemotaxis was not affected by T140 (Fig. 1 A). Thus, HeLa cells were used as a model system to explore the potential effect of β-arrestin2 on CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. The recombinant adenoviruses that encode β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin2 antisense were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of β-arrestin2 in HeLa cells was detected in Western blotting (Fig. 1 B) 80 h after adenovirus infection. The expression of endogenous β-arrestin2 was reduced to approximately 40% by the β-arrestin2 antisense adenovirus infection and was enhanced approximately 5-fold by the β-arrestin2 adenovirus infection as compared with the control of β-galactosidase adenovirus infection. However, the expression of actin was not affected under the same conditions (Fig. 1 B). In the chemotaxis assay, when the expression of β-arrestin2 was reduced in HeLa cells, SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis was severely decreased when the maximum chemotactic index was decreased from 3.8 to 2.5 (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, when β-arrestin2 was overexpressed in HeLa cells the sensitivity of the cells to SDF-1α was greatly increased; the concentration needed to induce maximum chemotaxis was reduced from 30 to 3 nm (Fig. 1 C). To further test the specificity of β-arrestin2 effect, EGF-induced chemotaxis in the infected HeLa cells was measured under the same conditions. The results revealed that infection by neither β-arrestin2 adenovirus nor β-arrestin2 antisense adenovirus could alter EGF-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 1 D). This indicates that the potential for chemotaxis in these cells was not changed, and that the effect of β-arrestin2 on chemotaxis was receptor-specific. To confirm the above phenomenon, β-arrestin2 or β-galactosidase was transfected to the CXCR4-expressed stable cell line of HEK293 cells (CXCR4-HEK293 cells), and the chemotaxis assay was performed 48 h after transfection. The expression of transfected β-arrestin2 was approximately 7-fold higher than the endogenous level (Fig.2 A). To make sure that only the transfected cells were counted in the assay, green fluorescent protein was co-transfected with β-arrestin2 or β-galactosidase, and the chemotactic cells with green fluorescence were counted. As in the HeLa cells, the concentration of SDF-1α to induce the maximum chemotaxis was reduced from 3 to 0.3 nm after HEK293 cells were transfected with β-arrestin2 as compared with those with β-galactosidase (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the EGF-induced chemotaxis in the β-arrestin2-transfected HEK293 cells was not changed (Fig. 2 C). To explore the potential function of β-arrestin2 on chemotaxis mediated by other chemokine receptors, β-arrestin2 or β-galactosidase was transfected to the CCR5-expressed stable cell line of HEK293 cells. The results showed that the chemotactic sensitivity of the β-arrestin2-transfected HEK293 cells to RANTES stimulation was also greatly increased as compared with the control cells (Fig. 2 D). Double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) has recently emerged as a powerful reverse genetic tool to silence gene expression in multiple organisms (34Chuang C.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4985-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 35Misquitta L. Paterson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3191-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Using this technology, we transfected RNAi plasmid of β-arrestin2 or the control vector into the CXCR4-HEK293 cells, and the expression of endogenous β-arrestin2 was remarkably reduced to approximately 20% of the control level as detected by Western blotting (Fig.3 A). However, the expression of actin and β-arrestin1 was not affected under the same conditions. Further experiments showed that when β-arrestin2 expression was reduced by RNAi, the chemotaxis mediated by CXCR4 was also greatly attenuated (Fig. 3 B), but the chemotaxis mediated by EGFR was not changed under the same conditions (Fig. 3 C). To test the effect of β-arrestin2 on the CXCR4-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, the widely used phospho-specific antibodies against two kinases were applied in the Western blotting to detect their activation. When treated with SDF-1α in CXCR4-HEK293 cells, ERK and p38 MAPK were activated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). The activation of ERK was significantly enhanced by co-transfection with β-arrestin2 at 0.3 nm SDF-1α, whereas the activation of p38 MAPK was significantly enhanced at the basal and the two SDF-1α concentrations tested (Fig. 4). This result indicates that β-arrestin2 can functionally mediate the activation of both kinases. In contrast, when β-arrestin2 expression in CXCR4-HEK293 cells was reduced by its RNAi, the activation of both p38 MAPK and ERK was significantly attenuated at 3.0 nm SDF-1α as shown in Fig5.Figure 5Effects of β-arrestin2 RNAi on the SDF-1 α-stimulated activation of ERK and p38 MAPK. CXCR4-HEK293 cells were transfected with control plasmid (BS/U6 vector) or RNAi plasmid of β-arrestin2, respectively. The transfected cells were incubated without (basal) or with 3.0 nm SDF-1α for 5 min, and the cells were solubilized and extracts were subjected to immunoblotting by using anti-phospho-p44/42 or anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies, and the same blots were reprobed with anti-p44/42 or anti-p38 MAPK antibodies to check for total protein content after stripping and blocking (A). -Fold activation of ERK (B) or p38 MAPK (C) over basal was shown. *, p < 0.05 compared with control plasmid (BS/U6 vector). Data are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further test the specificity of β-arrestin2 effect on p38 MAPK activation, EGF-stimulated activation of p38 MAPK in the same CXCR4-HEK293 cells was detected under the same conditions. The results revealed that activation of p38 MAPK stimulated by EGF could not be altered by co-transfection with β-arrestin2 at the two EGF concentrations tested (Fig. 6,A and B). To directly measure the change in kinase activity in p38 MAPK, ATF2 was used as the substrate in the kinase assay (37Jing Q. Xin S.M. Cheng Z.J. Zhang W.B. Zhang R. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The results showed that the ATF2 phosphorylation by p38 MAPK after EGF stimulation did not change by co-transfection with β-arrestin2 as compared with those with β-galactosidase (Fig.6 C), whereas it was remarkably enhanced after SDF-1α stimulation under the same conditions (Fig. 6 D). This finding not only confirms the effect of β-arrestin2 on p38 MAPK activation but also indicates that the effect was receptor-specific, a result that agrees with the data from the chemotaxis assay (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). Because β-arrestin2 expression enhanced both ERK and p38 MAPK activation, the specific inhibitors of these two kinases were used to test their role in the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. Pretreated with 2 or 6 μm SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK), the chemotaxis index of CXCR4-HEK293 cells that transfected with β-arrestin2 was decreased from 3.5 to 2.1 or 1.4, respectively (Fig.7 A). The latter was comparable to the level of inhibition of chemotaxis index (1.5) by the transfection of RNAi plasmid of β-arrestin2 (Fig. 7 A). Application of another p38 MAPK inhibitor, SKF86002, gave similar results, whereas pretreatment with SB202474 (a negative control of SB203580) or ERK pathway inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 did not have any effect on chemotaxis (Fig. 7 A). This result indicates that the activation of p38 MAPK but not that of ERK is likely involved in the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. To further independently test the role of p38 MAPK in the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2, a dominant-negative p38 MAPK (p38AF) was co-transfected with β-arrestin2 to the CXCR4-HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 7 B, both the maximal chemotactic response and the efficacy of the response to SDF-1α were greatly decreased by the co-transfection of p38AF, consistent with the results from the above study with use of the p38 inhibitors. ASK1 is one of the upstream MAPKKKs of p38 MAPK and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. SDF-1α-induced p38 MAPK activation was attenuated after the catalytically inactive mutant ASK1 (K709R) and β-arrestin2 were co-transfected in the CXCR4-HEK293 cells as compared with those of the control (co-transfection with β-galactosidase and β-arrestin2) (Fig. 7 C). Consistently, SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis was also remarkably reduced, because the concentration of SDF-1α needed for the maximum response was increased from 0.3 to 3 nm(Fig. 7 D) by the co-transfection of ASK1 (K709R). These data further support the notion that the ASK1/p38 MAPK pathway may mediate the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. When the expression of β-arrestin2 was severely reduced by RNAi, the remainder of the SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis would be mediated largely in a β-arrestin2-independent manner. This was indeed the case as demonstrated by results from the co-expression of p38 (AF) or ASK1 (K709R) with β-arrestin2 RNAi (Fig. 7 E), which only slightly reduced the SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis. These results further indicate the function of the β-arrestin2/ASK1/p38 MAPK pathway in CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. As a key regulator of GPCR signaling, β-arrestins carry out many important roles in GPCR-mediated biological functions. For example, both the duration of action and the analgesic potency of single doses of morphine are markedly enhanced in the β-arrestin2 knock-out mice as compared with wild-type littermates, and β-arrestin2 knock-out mice fail to develop tolerance to the repeated administration of morphine (38Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Another example is that β-arrestin regulates interleukin 8-induced granule release of the neutrophilic leukocytes (23Barlic J. Andrews J.D. Kelvin A.A. Bosinger S.E. DeVries M.E. Xu L. Dobransky T. Feldman R.D. Ferguson S.S. Kelvin D.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By positively or negatively manipulating the expression level of β-arrestin2 in two different kinds of cell lines, this study further demonstrates that β-arrestin2 is critically involved in the chemokine-mediated chemotaxis. The changes in CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis are nicely correlated with the change of β-arrestin2 expression levels in the two systems. This correlation coincides with the findings of a recent report that used lymphocytes from β-arrestin2-deficient mice (24Fong A.M. Premont R.T. Richardson R.M. Yu Y.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Patel D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Altogether, all of the results provide at least one physiological explanation for the wide and rich expression of β-arrestins in the blood system and further imply a potential role for β-arrestins in the immunological functions via their regulation of chemokine-induced chemotaxis. β-Arrestins have been shown to possess dual functions in regulating the signals of GPCRs. β-Arrestins quench some signals from the activated receptor such as in cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathways, and they mediate other signals such as those involved in the MAPK cascades. It has been reported that β-arrestins play a crucial role in β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated ERK activation (39Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), and our previous work also demonstrates that β-arrestin2 can enhance the CXCR4-mediated activation of ERK (21Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Sun Y. Hu W. Wu Y.L. Cen B. Wu G.X. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2479-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our current study further reveals that β-arrestin2 is crucially involved in the chemokine-induced activation of p38 MAPK. More interestingly, activation of p38 MAPK but not that of ERK seems to mediate the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. Our results coincide with early reports that p38 MAPK plays a functional role in chemotaxis induced by serum, lysophosphatidylcholine, and chemokines in leukocytes and smooth muscle cells (25Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 26Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol.

Res. 2000; 87: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is likely that heat shock protein 27, a p38 MAPK downstream substrate protein that acts as an F-actin cap binding protein, mediates the chemotactic function of p38 MAPK because the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 by p38 MAPK is well correlated to cell chemotaxis (25Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of β-arrestin2 enhancement of chemokine-induced chemotaxis is currently unclear, but it seems to be mediated by ASK1, the upstream kinase of p38 MAPK. However, more study is required to reveal the detailed pathway from β-arrestin2 to p38 MAPK. As a good control, the current investigation shows that the change in the level of β-arrestin2 expression does not alter EGFR-mediated chemotaxis or EGF-induced activation of p38 MAPK. This indicates that the effect of β-arrestin2 is not on the general apparatus of cell chemotaxis and migration; rather, it works through its specific signal pathways and under the control of GPCRs. It may also be worthwhile to point out that the current study successfully used DNA vector-based RNAi technology to significantly inhibit the endogenous expression of β-arrestin2 in a mammalian cell line, and the inhibition of β-arrestin2 expression is well correlated to its effect on chemotaxis. Another construction of RNAi plasmid of β-arrestin2 was also used, and it showed a similar ability to block β-arrestin2 expression (data not shown). It has been difficult in our laboratory to block β-arrestin2 expression in HEK293 cells by using oligo-based or virus-based antisense technology, probably because of the high expression level and/or the slow degradation of β-arrestin2. DNA vector-based RNAi technology to block β-arrestin2 expression apparently provides a useful tool for future study of the various functions of β-arrestin2.

https://openalex.org/W2051690606,"Atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop in areas of the vasculature exposed to nonlaminar blood flow and low fluid shear stress, whereas laminar flow and high fluid shear stress are athero-protective. We have identified a set of genes including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), ferritin (heavy and light chains), microsomal epoxide hydrolase, glutathione S-transferase, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthase, whose expression is induced by exposure to prolonged physiological levels of steady laminar flow (shear stress = 20 dyn/cm2) in endothelial cells (EC). These genes contain an antioxidant response element (ARE) or ARE-like transcriptional regulatory sequence in their promoters and generally function to protect cells against oxidant stress. We demonstrate that exposure of EC to laminar flow activates ARE-mediated transcriptional activity. Mutation of the ARE from either the NQO1 or HO-1 promoter abolished laminar flow-induced NQO1 and HO-1 transcriptional activation. Expression of antisense Nrf2 (a transcriptional factor for ARE), a dominant negative Nrf2, or the cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2 (Keap1/INrf2) inhibited laminar flow-induced NQO1 promoter activation in EC. In addition, expression of NQO1 or Nrf2 inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activation of VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) gene expression in EC. These data define the ARE as a novel endothelial shear stress response element. Furthermore, laminar flow activation of antioxidant genes via an ARE-dependent transcriptional mechanism may represent a novel athero-protective and anti-inflammatory mechanism in the vasculature.

Alexander R.W. Chappell D.C. Medford R.M. Varner S.E. Taylor W.R. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1998; 316: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The nature and magnitude of this fluid shear stress play a key role in the maintenance of vascular integrity and in the development of vascular diseases. For example, the nonrandom distribution of atherosclerotic lesions is due at least in part to local alterations in hemodynamic forces impinging on the vasculature (2Asakura T. Karino T. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1045-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 3Cornhill J.F. Akins D. Hutson M. Chandler A.B.

At sites vulnerable to lesion formation such as branch points, bifurcations, and curvatures, unidirectional laminar flow is disturbed, with areas characterized by complex flow patterns such as nonlaminar flow and flow reversal. In contrast, lesion-protected areas of the vasculature are characterized by more uniform laminar flow patterns with relatively high levels of fluid shear stress (2Asakura T. Karino T. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1045-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 3Cornhill J.F. Akins D. Hutson M. Chandler A.B.

It is now well accepted that areas of the vasculature exposed to nonlaminar or oscillatory flow have a predilection for the development of atherosclerotic lesions, whereas relatively high levels of steady laminar flow are athero-protective. Differential regulation of endothelial gene expression by shear stress may be involved in the focal localization of early atherosclerotic lesions (5Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A., Jr. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). For example, pro-atherogenic genes such as platelet-derived growth factor and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 are transiently up-regulated by shear stress, peak at 1.5 h, and are followed by sustained down-regulation (6Shyy Y.J. Hsieh H.J. Usami S. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4678-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 7Hsieh H.J., Li, N.Q. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H642-H646PubMed Google Scholar). These initial responses of cultured endothelial cells to applied shear stress may reflect in vivo responses to the temporal and spatial changes of shear stress resulting from nonlaminar flow. Prolonged exposure of endothelial cells to oscillatory flow results in up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1),1 intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin (8Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), suggesting that oscillatory flow imparts a proinflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells. In contrast, physiological levels of laminar flow are anti-inflammatory and anti-adhesive. Prolonged exposure of murine endothelial cells to laminar flow results in down-regulation of the expression of VCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin (9Korenaga R. Ando J. Kosaki K. Isshiki M. Takada Y. Kamiya A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1506-C1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that chronic laminar flow suppresses interleukin-1β-induced VCAM-1 gene expression in endothelial cells (1Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Chappell D.C. Medford R.M. Varner S.E. Taylor W.R. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1998; 316: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similarly, exposure of endothelial cells to fluid flow inhibits monocyte adherence and VCAM-1 expression induced by TNF-α or oxidized low density lipoprotein in endothelial cells (10Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In addition, genes encoding the antioxidants manganese superoxide dismutase, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase are demonstrated to be up-regulated by laminar flow but not by oscillatory flow (11Topper J.N. Cai J. Falb D. Gimbrone M.A., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 12De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C. Ishizaka N. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The antioxidant response element (ARE), also referred to as the electrophile response element (EpRE), is a cis-acting regulatory element with a core sequence of 5′-RTGACNNNGC-3′ (13Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,14Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The ARE is present in the 5′-flanking regions of several genes encoding enzymes involved in the phase II metabolism of xenobiotics and antioxidant proteins including glutathione S-transferase (GST) (15Prestera T. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) (16Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and glucuronosyltransferase (15Prestera T. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Activation of the ARE results from cellular exposure to insults that induce oxidative stress, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), ionizing radiation, and a variety of chemical entities including electrophilic compounds, lipid peroxides, antioxidants, Michael reaction acceptors, redox-cycling polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and quinones (13Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Prestera T. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The ability of phase II enzymes to conjugate redox-cycling chemicals is an important protective mechanism against electrophile and oxidative toxicity (13Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although this antioxidant defense mechanism has been studied extensively as a hepatic detoxification mechanism, it has also been suggested that the ARE pathway may contribute to antioxidant defenses via induction of other ARE-regulated antioxidant proteins such as HO-1 (17Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) and ferritin (18Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). There is a considerable body of evidence that suggests that HO-1 plays an important protective role in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases mediated via oxidant stress and may serve as a therapeutic target (19Immenschuh S. Ramadori G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). For example, targeted expression of HO-1 prevents the pulmonary inflammatory and vascular responses to hypoxia (20Minamino T. Christou H. Hsieh C.M. Liu Y. Dhawan V. Abraham N.G. Perrella M.A. Mitsialis S.A. Kourembanas S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8798-8803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Induction of HO-1 in vascular cells suppresses oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced monocyte transmigration and inhibits atherosclerotic lesion formation in low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice (21Ishikawa K.

Itabe H. Maruyama Y. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, ferritin, an iron sequestrant, is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress (18Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ferritin protects endothelial cells from oxidant-mediated cytolysis (23Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through the analysis of subtraction libraries, we have identified numerous genes whose expression is significantly increased by prolonged exposure to laminar flow as compared with static culture in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). In the present study, we report that exposure of endothelial cells to laminar flow activates ARE-driven transcriptional activity and increases the expression of a set of ARE-regulated genes. These genes include NQO1, HO-1, microsomal epoxide hydrolase, GST, ferritin, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthase. We further demonstrate that the ARE is the cis-acting element in the promoter of the NQO1 and HO-1 genes that mediates laminar flow-induced gene expression. Laminar flow-mediated, ARE-dependent NQO1 gene regulation in endothelial cells involves the transcriptional factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, co-expression of NQO1 or Nrf2 inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of VCAM-1 gene expression. These data suggest that laminar flow may exert athero-protective effects through a coordinated increase in expression of ARE-regulated intracellular antioxidant genes in endothelial cells. Therefore, this newly described laminar flow-regulated pathway may contribute to the modulation of oxidation-reduction (redox)-sensitive processes that result in vascular dysfunction, including the expression of inflammatory gene products. HAEC were obtained from Clonetics, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and cultured in EGM-2 growth medium (Clonetics, Inc.). Cells were used between passages 5 and 9. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were described previously (24Chen X.L. Tummala P.E. Olliff L. Medford R.M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and were cultured in modified MCDB 131 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and EGM Singlequots (Clonetics, Inc.). All cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. To construct p3xARE/Luc and p3xmutARE/Luc, tandem repeats of double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning the ARE of the human NQO1 promoter, 5′-CAGTCACAGTGACTCAGCAGAATC-3′ (for wild type ARE) and 5′-CAGTCACAG TGACTCATAAGAATC (for mutated ARE, the underlined sequences represent mutation of conserved nucleotides GC to TA in the ARE), were introduced into the SacI and BglII sites of PGL3 promoter plasmid (Promega Corp.) (25Xie T. Belinsky M., Xu, Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol.

To generate a mutated ARE in the NQO1 promoter, pNQO1CAT1.55mARE, the conserved GC nucleotides in the ARE element (13Jaiswal A.K. Biochem.

The PCR primers used in the mutagenesis were 5′-CGCAGTCACAGTGACTCATAAGAATCTGAGCC-3′ (forward primer, the underlined TA represents GC to TA mutation) and 5′-TGAGTCACTGTGACTGCGAATTTGGAAGGC-3′ (reverse primer). To generate the human HO-1 promoter construct, pHO-1Luc4.0, a DNA fragment containing 4.0 kilobases of the human HO-1 promoter region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA (Promega) using specific primers described previously (27Kataoka K. Handa H. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34074-34081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and cloned into the MluI and XhoI sites of PGL3 basic plasmid (Promega). To generate a mutated ARE in the HO-1 promoter, pHO-1Luc4.0mARE, the conserved GC nucleotides in the inverted ARE element were mutated to TA using the GeneTailor mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The PCR primers used in the mutagenesis were 5′-GGCGGATTTTGC TAGATTTTATTGAGTCACCA-3′ (forward primer, the underlined AT represents GC to TA mutation) and 5′-TGTTTCCCTTCCGCCTAAAACGATCTAAAA-3′ (reverse primer). LNCX-Nrf2 (an expression vector containing the full-length murine Nrf2 gene) and LNCX-Nrf2R (containing murine Nrf2 gene in an antisense orientation) have been described previously (28Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). To generate a dominant negative Nrf2 mutant, a DNA fragment that contains the Cap'nCollar homology region and the basic leucine-zipper domain (amino acids 399–598) was amplified by PCR reaction using the following primers: 5′-ATGTCACCAGCTCAAGGGCACAGTGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCATCCTCCCGAACCTAGTT-3′ (reverse primer). The amplified fragment was cloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3DN-Nrf2. To construct NQO1 and Keap1/INrf2 (a cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2) mammalian expression vectors, full-length human NQO1 and Keap1/INrf2 cDNA were generated by RT-PCR and cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3NQO1 or pcDNA3Keap1/INrf2, respectively. p85VCAM/CAT is a chimeric reporter gene containing coordinates −85 to +12 of the human VCAM-1 promoter linked to the CAT gene (29Marui N. Offermann M.K. Swerlick R. Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The flow system used has been previously described (8Chappell D.C. Varner S.E. Nerem R.M. Medford R.M. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 12De Keulenaer G.W. Chappell D.C. Ishizaka N. Nerem R.M. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Circ.

Cells were exposed to either static conditions (cells maintained on glass slides in a 150-cm2 tissue culture dish) or exposed to flow conditions. The glass plate containing the monolayer was inserted into a parallel-plate flow chamber that was installed in a closed loop flow system. For laminar flow experiments, endothelial monolayers were subjected to laminar flow with shear stress of +20 dyn/cm2 or +5 dyn/cm2. For oscillatory flow experiments, the endothelial monolayers were exposed to a very low mean shear stress (less than 0.5 dyn/cm2) with a superimposed instantaneous oscillatory shear stress that cycled between +5 and −5 dyn/cm2 at a periodicity of 1 Hz. This small mean flow component was included to ensure adequate media exchange over the endothelial monolayer. After the indicated times, RNA or protein samples were collected. Suppression subtraction hybridization libraries were prepared from total RNA collected from HAEC exposed to laminar flow or static cultures for 48 h using the Clontech PCR-SelectTM Subtraction kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This method for creating subtraction libraries is based on the method first described by von Stein et al. (30von Stein O.D. Thies W.G. Hofmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1469-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and Mueller et al. (31Mueller C.G. Rissoan M.C. Salinas B. Ait-Yahia S. Ravel O. Bridon J.M. Briere F. Lebecque S. Liu Y.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, this method “subtracts” both low and high abundance mRNA populations that are in common between two RNA samples while at the same time equalizing and enriching for differentially expressed sequences. After construction of the subtracted libraries that were enriched for sequences expressed preferentially in the laminar flow population or the static population, the PCR-Select Differential Screening kit (Clontech) was used to rapidly screen for clones that were differentially expressed. Approximately 800 clones from each of the laminar flow-enriched and static-enriched libraries were hybridized to probes created from each library. Individual clones demonstrating a differential pattern of hybridization were selected for DNA sequence analysis. Clone identities were determined by BLAST analysis of the GenBankTM DNA sequence data base. Oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to amplify an ∼500-base pair fragment from the 3′ end of each mRNA (Table I). Total RNA was collected from HAEC using Trizol (Invitrogen). 3 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the level of each gene product was measured by semi-quantitative end-point RT-PCR analysis. Cycling conditions were 95 °C initial denaturation for 5 min, 26 cycles of 94 °C denaturation (20 s), 55 °C annealing (30 s), and 72 °C extension (20 s), followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. After amplification, 15 μl of the sample was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained by ethidium bromide. Relative band intensities were determined by densitometry using the Bio-Rad Quantity ONE software. For each primer pair, serial dilutions of each cDNA were assayed, and a dilution that resulted in linear amplification was used for further experiments. Each sample was assayed at least three times from the same RNA sample, and results are expressed as relative levels compared with β-actin.Table IDNA sequences for primer pairs used in RT-PCR analysisGene nameGenBank™ Accession NumberPrimer sequenceγ-Glutamylcysteine synthase (heavy subunit)M90656F-TGAGGCCAACATGCGAAAAC R-AAATCACTCCCCAGCGACAATCHeme oxygenase-1XM_009946F-TTGCTGTAGGGCTTTATGCR-CTGCATTTGAGGCTGAGCCMicrosomal epoxide hydrolaseNM_000120F-CTGGCCCGGCTCTTTCTACGA R-CAGCAGCTCCACATCCCTCTCAGlutathioneS-transferaseXM_012235F-GTTTTTGCCAATCCAGAAGAC R-GCTCCCCTCCTACCTAAAATCNQO1J03934F-CCTGGCCCTTGCAATCTTCTACR-CAGCTCGGTCCAATCCCTTCAFerritin (heavy chain)NM_002032F-CTGGCCACTGACAAAAATGACC R-AACGGCACTTAAGGAATCTGGAFerritin (light chain)M10119F-GCGCGAGGGCTACGAG R-CTATTGGCTGGAGGGAGAGGβ-ActinXM_004814F-ATCGGCGGCTCCATCCR-GGGGCACGAAGGCTCATCF, forward; R, reverse.

HAEC were lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmHepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF. Protein samples (15 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Antibody-bound protein bands were then visualized via horseradish peroxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit anti-NQO1 antibody was described previously (32Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Relative band intensities were determined by densitometry using the Bio-Rad Quantity One software. HMEC were grown to 60–70% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected with various plasmids as indicated in figure legends using SuperFect transfection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc). For flow experiments, HMEC were grown to 60% confluence on gelatin-coated glass plates. HMEC were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using SuperFect reagents. 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to either laminar flow (shear stress = 20 dyn/cm2) or static conditions for 24 h. For determination of CAT activity, cell extracts were prepared from HMEC by rapid freeze-thaw in 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.0. 5 μg of protein per sample was then incubated with 5 μCi of 14C-labeled chloramphenicol (Amersham Biosciences) and 5 μg ofn-butyryl coenzyme A (Amersham Biosciences) for various times. The acetylated chloramphenicol forms were extracted using a 2:1 mixture of 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane:xylenes and subjected to centrifugation (33Kinston R.E. Sheen J. Ausubel F.M. Current Prtotocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 9.7.1Google Scholar). The organic phase was removed and counted to determine CAT activity. Plasmids pRL-TK or pRL-SV40 (Renilla luciferase constitutively expressed under the control of the thymidine kinase or SV40 promoter, respectively) were co-transfected in all samples and were used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Renilla luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All CAT activities were normalized against the Renilla luciferase activity. To identify genes that were differentially expressed by exposure to laminar flow, we constructed cDNA subtraction libraries from HAEC kept in static culture or subjected to laminar flow (shear stress = 20 dyn/cm2) for 48 h. Differentially expressed clones from each enriched library were identified by differential hybridization, and several hundred clones from each library were selected for DNA sequencing. DNA sequence analysis identified many genes that were relatively abundant in the laminar flow-enriched library compared with the static-enriched library. Analysis of the promoters of a subset of these genes including ferritin (heavy and light chains), NQO1, HO-1, GST, microsomal epoxide hydrolase, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthase revealed a common transcriptional regulatory feature. Each of these genes contains an ARE or ARE-like transcriptional regulatory element(s) in its promoter and is known to be up-regulated by oxidative stress. Furthermore, these genes function as antioxidants and protect cells from oxidative stress. Table II shows the sequence alignment of the ARE or ARE-like regulatory elements from the laminar flow-inducible genes compared with the consensus ARE sequence, RTGACNNNGC (13Jaiswal A.K. Biochem.

As shown in Fig. 1, all of the genes were induced, although to varying degrees, by exposure to laminar flow for 48 h. These observations confirm that exposure of HAEC to laminar flow for 48 h results in increased expression of ARE-containing cytoprotective genes compared with static controls. To characterize the role of fluid flow in the regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression, we focused on the NQO1 and HO-1 genes. The effects of time, flow rates, and types of flow were evaluated for their contribution to NQO1 gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the expression of NQO1 in response to laminar flow increased progressively from 12 to 48 h. Similarly, the expression of HO-1 in response to laminar flow increased progressively from 6 to 48 h (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the levels of NQO1 and HO-1 mRNA in static cultures remained relatively constant throughout the time course (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of NQO1 in response to laminar flow at 48 h was also dependent on the levels of shear stress. As compared with static cultures, laminar flow with shear stress of 5 dyn/cm2 increased the NQO1 mRNA levels ∼7-fold. Incr"

https://openalex.org/W2063691589,"Autophagy is a pathway for bulk degradation of subcellular constituents that is hyperactivated in many neurodegenerative conditions. It has been considered a second form of programmed cell death. Death of cerebellar Purkinje cells in lurcher animals is due to a mutation in GluRdelta2 that results in its constitutive activation. Here we have identified protein interactions between GluRdelta2, a novel isoform of a PDZ domain-containing protein (nPIST) that binds to this receptor, and Beclin1. nPIST and Beclin1 can synergize to induce autophagy. GluRdelta2(Lc), but not GluRdelta2(wt), can also induce autophagy. Furthermore, dying lurcher Purkinje cells contain morphological hallmarks of autophagic death in vivo. These results provide strong evidence that a direct link exists between GluRdelta2(Lc) receptor and stimulation of the autophagic pathway in dying lurcher Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972818610,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked, adult-onset, neurodegenerative disorder affecting only males and is caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in the N-terminal A/B domain of human androgen receptor (hAR). Although no overt phenotype was detected in adult fly eye photoreceptor neurons expressing mutant hAR (polyQ 52), ingestion of androgen or its known antagonists caused marked neurodegeneration with nuclear localization and structural alteration of the hAR mutant. Ligand-independent toxicity was detected with a truncated polyQ-expanded A/B domain alone, which was attenuated with cytosolic trapping by coexpression of the unliganded hAR E/F ligand binding domain. Thus, our findings suggest that the full binding of androgen to the polyQ-expanded hAR mutants leads to structural alteration with nuclear translocation that eventually results in the onset of SBMA in male patients."
https://openalex.org/W2094774201,"The projection of developing axons to their targets is a crucial step in the assembly of neuronal circuits. In the spinal cord, the differentiation of specific motor neuron pools is associated with the expression of ETS class transcription factors, notably PEA3 and ER81. Their initial expression coincides with the arrival of motor axons in the vicinity of muscle targets and depends on limb-derived signals. We show that in Pea3 mutant mice, the axons of specific motor neuron pools fail to branch normally within their target muscles, and the cell bodies of these motor neurons are mispositioned within the spinal cord. Thus, the induction of an intrinsic program of ETS gene expression by peripheral signals is required to coordinate the central position and terminal arborization of specific sets of spinal motor neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2131867298,"Target innervation by specific neuronal populations involves still incompletely understood interactions between central and peripheral factors. We show that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), initially characterized for its role as a survival factor, is present early in the plexus of the developing forelimb and later in two muscles: the cutaneus maximus and latissimus dorsi. In the absence of GDNF signaling, motor neurons that normally innervate these muscles are mispositioned within the spinal cord and muscle invasion by their axons is dramatically reduced. The ETS transcription factor PEA3 is normally expressed by these motor neurons and fails to be induced in most of them in GDNF signaling mutants. Thus, GDNF acts as a peripheral signal to induce PEA3 expression in specific motor neuron pools thereby regulating both cell body position and muscle innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2037509005,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the upregulation of downstream target genes. Ferredoxin Reductase (protein, FR; gene, FDXR) transfers electron from NADPH to cytochrome P450 via ferredoxin in mitochondria. Here, we identified FDXR as a target gene of the p53 family, that is, p53, p63, and p73. We found that FDXR can be induced by DNA damage in cells in a p53-dependent manner and by a mutated form of p53 that is competent in inducing apoptosis. In addition, we identified a p53 response element located within the FDXR promoter that is responsive to wild-type p53, p63alpha, p63gamma, p73alpha, and p73beta. Furthermore, we showed that p53, p63alpha and p73alpha directly bind to the p53 response element in vivo and promote the accessibility of the FDXR promoter by increasing the acetylation of histones H3 and H4. To determine the role of FR in p53 tumor suppression, we generated cell lines that express FR using a tetracycline-regulated promoter. We found that over-expression of FR in lung H1299, breast MCF7, and colorectal HCT116 carcinoma cells have no effect on cell proliferation. However, we showed that FR increases the sensibility of H1299 and HCT116 cells to 5-fluorouracil-, doxorubicin- and H(2)O(2)- mediated apoptosis. Our data support a model of feed-forward loop for p53 activity, that is, various cellular stresses, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), activate p53, which induces the expression of FDXR; and the FDXR gene product, FR, in turn sensitizes cells to ROS-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2022264926,"Memory loss occurs by diverse mechanisms, as different time constants of performance decrement and sensitivities to experimental manipulations suggest. While the phenomena of memory decay, interference, and extinction are well established behaviorally, little is known about them at the circuit or molecular level. In Drosophila, odorant memories lasting up to 3 hr can be localized to mushroom body Kenyon cells, a single neuronal level in the olfactory pathway. The plasticity underlying this memory trace can be induced without Kenyon cell synaptic output. Experimental extinction, i.e., presentation of the conditioned stimulus without the reinforcer, reduces memory performance and does so at the same circuit level as memory formation. Thus, unreinforced presentation of learned odorants antagonizes intracellularly the signaling cascade underlying memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W1964957919,"We have previously shown that the Jak2 tyrosine kinase is activated in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines and blood cells from CML blast crisis patients by tyrosine phosphorylation. We are searching for downstream targets of Jak2 in Bcr-Abl positive cells. It is known that c-Myc expression is required for the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl, and that over-expression of c-Myc complements the transformation defect of the Bcr-Abl SH2 deletion mutant. Moreover, the Bcr-Abl SH2 deletion mutant and an Abl C-terminal deletion mutant are deficient in activating c-Myc expression. Since the Jak2 binds to the C-terminal domain of Bcr-Abl and optimal Jak2 activation requires the SH2 domain, we tested whether Jak2 was involved in c-Myc protein induction by Bcr-Abl. We treated the 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells with the Jak2 specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG490, and found that this drug, like the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571, inhibited c-Myc protein induction by Bcr-Abl. Treatment of 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells with AG490 also inhibited c-MYC RNA expression. It is also known that c-Myc protein is a labile protein that is increased in amounts in response to various growth factors by a mechanism not involving new Myc protein formation. Treatment of 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells with both the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and AG490 blocked the reduction of the c-Myc protein observed by AG490 alone. An adaptor protein SH2-Bbeta is involved in the enhancement of the tyrosine kinase activity of Jak2 following ligand/receptor interaction. In this regard we showed that the Jak2/Bcr-Abl complex contains SH2-Bbeta. Expression of the SH2-Bbeta R555E mutant in 32Dp210 Bcr-Abl cells reduced c-Myc expression about 40% compared to a vector control. Interestingly, we found the reduction of the c-Myc protein in several clones of dominant-negative (DN) Jak2 expressing K562 cells correlated very well with the reduction of tumor growth of these cells in nude mice as compared to vector transfected K562 cells. Both STI-571 and AG490 also induced apoptosis in 32Dp210 cells. Of interest, IL-3 containing medium reversed the STI-571 induced apoptosis of 32Dp210 cells but did not reverse the induction of apoptosis by AG490, which strongly supports the specificity of the inhibitory effects of AG490 on the Jak2 tyrosine kinase. In summary, our findings indicate that Jak2 mediates the increase in c-Myc expression that is induced by Bcr-Abl. Our results indicate that activated Jak2 not only mediates an increase of c-MYC RNA expression but also interferes with proteasome-dependent degradation of c-Myc protein."
https://openalex.org/W2050004148,"Overexpression of the c-Jun proto-oncogene in MCF7 breast cancer cells results in a variety of phenotype changes related to malignant progression including increased motility and invasion. Concurrent with these phenotypic effects are changes in the expression of multiple gene targets. We previously demonstrated that expression of the SPARC/osteonectin gene, while undetectable in the MCF7 cell line, is highly induced in response to stable c-Jun overexpression (c-Jun/MCF7). Because the SPARC gene product is associated with tumor cell invasion in a variety of different cancers, we have examined its role in mediating the phenotypic changes induced by c-Jun in MCF7 cells. We found that antisense mediated suppression of SPARC dramatically inhibits both motility and invasion in this c-Jun/MCF7 model. In contrast, stable overexpression of SPARC in the parental MCF7 cell line is not sufficient to stimulate cell motility or invasion. Examination of the promoter region of the human SPARC gene reveals three non-canonical AP-1 sites. We demonstrate that one of these sites binds c-Jun/Fra1 heterodimers in vitro, but that this and the other AP-1 like sites are dispensable with respect to c-Jun stimulated SPARC promoter activation. Deletion analysis identified a region between −120 and −70 as a c-Jun responsive element sufficient to induce maximal promoter activation. This region does not contain any AP-1 sites but does mediate binding by SP1 ‘like’ complexes. Furthermore, this region is necessary for SP1/SP3 responsiveness in Drosophila SL2 cells. These results demonstrate that SPARC plays an important role in stimulating motility and the invasive behavior of c-Jun/MCF7 cells and that SPARC promoter activation by c-Jun appears to occur through an indirect mechanism."

Transcription mapping of the FRA6F region identified 19 known genes, 10 within the FRA6F interval and nine in a proximal or distal position. The nucleotide sequence of FRA6F is rich in repetitive elements (LINE1 and LINE2, Alu, MIR, MER and endogenous retroviral sequences) as well as in matrix attachment regions (MARs), and shows several DNA segments with increased helix flexibility. We found that tight clusters of stem-loop structures were localized exclusively in the two regions with greater frequency of breakage. Chromosomal instability at FRA6F probably depends on a complex interaction of different factors, involving regions of greater DNA flexibility and MARs. We propose an additional mechanism of fragility at FRA6F, based on stem-loop structures which may cause delay or arrest in DNA replication. A senescence gene likely maps within FRA6F, as suggested by detection of deletion and translocation breakpoints involving this fragile site in immortal human-mouse cell hybrids and in SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts containing a human chromosome 6 deleted at q21. Deletion breakpoints within FRA6F are common in several types of human leukemias and solid tumors, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene in the region. Moreover, a gene associated to hereditary schizophrenia maps within FRA6F. Therefore, FRA6F may represent a landmark for the identification and cloning of genes involved in senescence, leukemia, cancer and schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2320459054,"The 3p21.3 tumour suppressor gene (TSG) RASSF1A is inactivated predominantly by promoter methylation and rarely by somatic mutations. Recently we demonstrated that epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A is frequent in both clear cell and papillary adult renal cell carcinomas (even though 3p21.3 allele loss is rare in papillary tumours). Wilms' tumour is the most common childhood kidney tumour, but relatively little is known about its molecular pathogenesis. Thus TSGs such as WT1, p16(CDKN2a) and p53 are inactivated in only a minority of cases. In view of the involvement of RASSF1A in adult renal cancers we investigated RASSF1A as a candidate Wilms' TSG. We detected RASSF1A hypermethylation in 21 of 39 (54%) primary Wilms' tumours. 3p21.3 allele loss was not detected in nine informative Wilms' tumours (five with RASSF1A methylation). In contrast to RASSF1A, only a minority (10.3%) of Wilms' tumours demonstrated p16 promoter methylation. As chromosome 3p allele loss is frequent in colorectal cancer, we proceeded to investigate RASSF1A promoter methylation in colorectal cancer and detected RASSF1A methylation in 80% (4/5) colorectal cancer cell lines and 45% (13/29) primary colorectal cancers. There was no correlation between RASSF1A and p16 methylation in colorectal cancer. We have demonstrated that RASSF1A inactivation is the most frequent genetic or epigenetic event yet reported in Wilms' tumourigenesis and that allelotyping studies may fail to identify regions containing important TSGs."

The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein activates transcription from its long terminal repeat (LTR) through interaction with cellular factors such as CREB and a transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300. However, little is known about the interaction between Tax and transcriptional repressors. Here, we demonstrate the physical and functional interaction between Tax and HDAC1. We found that HDAC1 represses the trans-activation function of Tax in 293T and MT4 cells. However, this repression was restored by treatment with an HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A. We also observed physical interaction between Tax and HDAC1 both in vitro and in vivo. The N-terminal region of HDAC1 (amino acid residues 28-97) was required for this binding. Moreover, HDAC1 inhibited the synergistic trans-activation of Tax observed on ectopic expression of CBP. However, this repression was relieved by overexpression of CBP. Thus, HDAC1 is likely to compete with CBP in binding with Tax and functions as a negative regulator for the transcriptional activation by Tax."

However, apoptosis has also been observed in HIV-1-infected cells, including in vitro cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes from AIDS patients (7Meyaard L. Otto A.A. Jonker R.R. Mijnster M.J.

Invest. 1991; 87: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence links the cytopathic potential of HIV-1 to the activity of the viral envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 (9Fisher A.G. Ratner M. Mitsuya H. Marselle L.M. Harper M.E. Broder S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1986; 233: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The binding of viral glycoproteins to the CD4 receptor on adjacent cells induces cell fusion giving rise to syncytia formation (10Sodroski J. Gogh W.C. Rosen C.A. Campbell K.A. Haseltine W.A. Nature. 1986; 322: 3105-3111Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In addition, recent data suggest that intracellular interaction of gp120/gp41 with the CD4 receptor can also trigger membrane fusion, thus contributing to single cell lysis (11Cao J. Park I.W. Cooper A. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1340-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12LaBonte J. Patel T. Hofmann W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10690-10698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The expression of other HIV-1 proteins such as Tat, Nef, and Vpr has also been related to detrimental effects on cell functions (13Ayyavoo V. Mahboubi A. Mahalingam S. Ramalingam R. Kudchodkar S.

Furthermore, HIV-1 protease exhibits cytotoxicity when expressed in a variety of cells, including bacteria and mammalian cells (16Baum E.Z. Bebernitz G.A. Gluzman Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5573-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Strack P.R. West Frey M. Rizzo C.J. Cordova B. George H.J. Meade R. Peng Ho S. Corman J. Tritch R. Korant B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9571-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Transient expression of HIV-1 PR in COS cells has been reported to induce apoptosis preceded by cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (17Strack P.R. West Frey M. Rizzo C.J. Cordova B. George H.J. Meade R. Peng Ho S. Corman J. Tritch R. Korant B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9571-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A major function of HIV-1 PR in the virus life cycle is to proteolytically process the gag and gag-polprecursors to yield mature virion proteins. The protease is initially synthesized in an inactive form as part of the gag-polprecursor and is activated at the final stages of the virus life cycle. This activation gives rise to the formation of the isolated protease as well as to the mature enzymes reverse transcriptase and integrase, and the virion core structural proteins MA, CA, NC, and p6 (18Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schneider J. Kent S.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Vogt V.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 95-131PubMed Google Scholar). Protease activation is required for virion maturation, because inhibition of PR activity gives rise to immature virus particles containing unprocessed gag-pol precursors that are unable to re-infect cells (21Kohl N.E. Emini E.A. Schleif W.A. Davis L.J. Heimbach J.C. Dixon R.A. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4686-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Apart from viral-encoded substrates, the cleavage of cell proteins by HIV-1 PR is well documented (22Riviere Y. Blank P. Kourilsky P. Israel I. Nature (Lond.). 1991; 350: 625-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Shoeman R.L. Hüttermann C. Harting R. Traub P. Mol. Biol.

Thus, the cytoskeletal proteins vimentin, desmin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein are cleaved in vitro by recombinant HIV-1 PR (25Shoeman R.L. Höner B. Stoller T.J. Kesselmeier C. Miedel M.C. Traub P. Graves M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6336-6340Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, HIV-1 PR proteolyzes actin, troponin C, Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein, and pro-interleukin 1β in vitro (26Tomasselli A.G. Hui J.O. Adams L. Chosay J. Lowery D. Greenl B. Yem A. Deibel M.R. Zürcher-Neely H. Heinrikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only the cleavage of vimentin has been reported to occur in HIV-infected cells (27Konvalinka J. Litterst M.A. Welker R. Kottler H. Rippmann F. Heuser A.M. Kräusslich H.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7180-7186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that HIV-1 PR might play a role in virus-induced cytopathology, although there are no direct data supporting this rationale. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the functions of heterologous proteins of diverse origin (28Bonnet D. Spahr P.F. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5628-5632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This system has been successfully employed to test the cytotoxic potential of viral proteins, including proteases (29Barco A. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,30Macreadi I.G. Castelli L.A. Hewish D.R. Kirkpatrick A. Ward A.C. Azard A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 74: 4835-4838Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe a novel lytic activity of HIV-1 PR in both yeast and mammalian cells. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for the construction of expression plasmids as described elsewhere (31Sambrook K.J. Fritsch E.R. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae strain FYBL-1 (Mata,ura3–851, lys2–202, leu2–1,his3–200) was generously provided by Dr. J. P. G. Ballesta (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, Madrid, Spain). Expression plasmids were constructed according to standard procedures (31Sambrook K.J. Fritsch E.R. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The HIV-1 PR coding sequence was amplified by PCR from clone BH10 of HIV-1 using the primers 5′ HIV-1 PR (GCGCGCCATGGGACCTCAGATCACTCTTTGG) (artificial initiation codon in italics) and 3′HIV-1PR (CGCGGATCCTTACTAAAAATTTAAAGTGCAACCAATCTG). The 300-bp product was digested with a BamHI enzyme and cloned into the expression vector pEMBL-yex4 (32Baldani C. Cesareni G. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PKS5′LGAG-PR plasmid encodes gag andpr genes under the entire 5′-leader region of HIV-1 derived from pNL4.3 plasmid. Its construction involved cloning the 3-kbp PCR-amplified DNA fragment into pKSBluescript (Stratagene) usingNotI and BamHI enzymes. Primers used were 5′NCRH (CGACGCGGCCGCGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGACC) and 3′HIV-1 PR. pEMBL-2Apro, pEMBL-2BC, pTM1-HIV-1 PR, pTM1–2Apro, pTM1–2BC, and pTM1–3Cpro have been described previously (33Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Barco A. Carrasco L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Ventoso I. Blanco R. Perales C. Carrasco L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12966-12971Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Yeast cells transformed by the lithium acetate method using the indicated plasmid were selected on minimal yeast nitrogen bases (YNB)-glucose plates supplemented with 20 mg/liter of the required amino acids or bases according to auxotrophic markers, as described previously (34Barco A. Carrasco L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For induction of the UASGAL-CYC promoter on agar plates, glucose was replaced by galactose at a final concentration of 2%. For induction in liquid medium, cells were grown in YNB-lactate and induced by the addition of 2% galactose. Yeast extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously (36Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For yeast expressing HIV-1 PR, both cells and media were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were separated on 17% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the indicated antibody. Goat antiserum against HIV-1 PR and a monoclonal antibody against HIV-1 p55/p24 were provided by the EU Program EVA/MRC Centralised Facility for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, UK and used at dilutions 1:700 and 1:500, respectively. Antibodies against human PARP (Pharmingen), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and actin (Sigma) were used at dilutions of 1/500. Detection was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of pTM-1 plasmids coupled to vT7 infection has been previously described in detail (37Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1997; 7: 2538-2544Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μg of each plasmid was mixed with 2 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent® (Invitrogen) and added to COS7 cells growing in 24-well plates at 70% confluency. Cell viability was scored by the trypan blue exclusion method. Yeast cell lysis was estimated by the release of intracellular proteins into the medium. Induced yeast cultures (1 ml) were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants were used directly to determine protein concentration by the Bio-Rad Bradford assay. Alternatively, cells were stained with 0.005% propidium iodide (PI) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Lysis in mammalian cells was determined using the cytotoxicity detection kit (LDH) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For the ultrastructural analysis of yeast, we followed the electron microscopy protocol described by Wrightet al. (38Wright R. Basson M. D′Ari L. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with a few modifications: cells were fixed for 2 h at room temperature in 2% glutaraldehide-1% tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 6.8, and finally embedded in London resin white resin. The same procedure was applied for mammalian cells, except for the buffer used in this case, 0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.2. Our initial aim was to analyze the effect of HIV-1 PR expression in the yeastS. cerevisiae. To this end, the coding sequence of HIV-1pr was cloned into the expression plasmid pEMBLyex4 (32Baldani C. Cesareni G. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) under the galactose-inducible promoter. The yeast strain FYBL-1 was chosen for transformation. First, cells bearing the pEMBL-HIV-1PR plasmid were induced on galactose-containing plates. As control, yeast transformants that synthesize poliovirus proteins 2Apro or 2BC were induced in parallel, because these proteins are highly toxic for yeast (29Barco A. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Barco A. Carrasco L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3349-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Ashows that induction of HIV-1 PR synthesis arrested cell growth to a similar extent as 2Apro and 2BC. This toxic effect was prevented by the addition of 2 μm saquinavir, a specific inhibitor of HIV-1 PR, indicating that the proteolytic activity of the enzyme is indeed responsible for its cytotoxicity. To further characterize this cytotoxic effect, HIV-1 PR was induced in liquid medium. Yeast growth was monitored by measuring the optical cell density of the cultures. Cell extracts were obtained at different time points after induction to detect the expression of HIV-1 PR by Western blotting. During the first 12 h post induction (h.p.i.), cells expressing HIV-1 PR grew at a rate similar to those transformed by the vector alone (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). However, growth of cells expressing HIV-1 PR was abruptly halted at 14–18 h.p.i. This inhibition was concomitant to peak HIV-1 PR synthesis at 18–24 h.p.i., determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A,lower panel). Surprisingly, after this arrest of cell growth, cultures expressing HIV-1 PR underwent a subsequent decrease in optical density corresponding to a 20–30% loss in cell number 24 h.p.i. This finding was confirmed in over 10 independent experiments performed using different yeast transformants. The phenotype of cells expressing HIV-1 PR is clearly different from that of cells expressing poliovirus 2Apro and 2BC. Even though poliovirus 2Apro and 2BC expression induced an early arrest of yeast growth, the number of cells in these cultures remained constant until 30 h.p.i. This suggests that HIV-1 PR expression is cytocidal, whereas expression of poliovirus 2Apro or 2BC is cytostatic. The survival curve shows that about 80% of the cells died upon HIV-1PR induction (Fig. 1 B). The explanation for the remaining 20% of cells that survived HIV-1PR expression is not obvious. To further explore the lytic activity of HIV-1 PR in yeast, the release of intracellular protein into the medium was measured at different time points after induction of protease expression. Fig. 1 C shows that HIV-1 PR expression led to an increasing protein concentration in the medium, which reached 15 μg/ml at 24 h.p.i. This would be consistent with the idea that cell integrity is extensively damaged. In contrast, no release of intracellular protein was detected in yeast transformed with the vector alone or in cells expressing poliovirus 2Apro or 2BC. These data further demonstrate that induction of lysis is a feature specific to HIV-1 PR. To better characterize the lytic phenotype induced by HIV-1 PR, yeast cells synthesizing HIV-1 PR were fixed and examined by electron microscopy at different times after induction. At 18 h.p.i., before undergoing lysis, yeast cells expressing HIV-1 PR showed a number of morphological alterations, compared with cells transformed with the vector alone. These changes included increased cell size and disintegration of the vacuole into multiple smaller bodies. They were also observed in cells that synthesize poliovirus 2BC protein (Fig. 2 B) or 2Apro (data not shown), suggesting that they are common features to cells expressing cytotoxic proteins. The plasma membrane, in turn, displayed specific alterations in cells expressing HIV-1 PR. In control yeast cells and in cells expressing poliovirus 2Apro or 2BC proteins, the plasma membrane is closely associated with the inner layer of the cell wall and shows a typical smooth contour. However, the plasma membrane of cells expressing HIV-1 PR was notably wrinkled and started to detach from the cell wall (Fig. 2 C). Other organelles, including the nucleus, retained their normal appearance for longer periods. Further incubation of cells expressing HIV-1 PR led to a profound loss of cell integrity and lysis at 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 2,D and F). Thus, the plasma membrane became completely detached from the cell wall, and finally, the cell wall broke down causing the release of cell content into the medium. Interestingly, this rupture of the cell wall frequently occurred on budding scars, which are the thinnest area of the cell wall. In contrast, the overall integrity of yeast expressing poliovirus 2Apro or 2BC proteins was not compromised, even though these cells underwent extensive modifications in sub-cellular structures. In the next stage, we undertook experiments designed to establish the major toxic effect of HIV-1 PR on yeast. The electron microscopy data suggested that the lytic phenotype induced by HIV-1 PR expression could be the final result of early damage on the plasma membrane. To test this possibility, the permeability of the plasma membrane toward propidium iodide (PI) was measured in yeast expressing HIV-1 PR before cell lysis occurred (12–18 h.p.i.). It was shown by FACS analysis that this dye was unable to penetrate yeast transformed with the vector alone (Fig. 3 A). However, PI uptake became evident in cells expressing HIV-1 PR as early as 12 h.p.i., and PI entry into cells was further enhanced at 18 h.p.i. Cells expressing HIV-1 PR showed no morphological changes at this stage (data not shown), suggesting that membrane alteration is an early event that precedes cell lysis. It is well known that changes in yeast cell wall architecture can lead to cell lysis. This is true of yeast cells bearing thermosensitive mutations in genes involved in maintenance of cell wall integrity, which undergo lysis upon incubation at the restricted temperature (40De la Fuente J.M. Alvarez A. Nombela C. Sánchez M. Yeast. 1992; 8: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this situation, lysis can be effectively prevented by osmotic stabilizers such as sorbitol or NaCl (41Andrews P.D. Stark M.J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 507-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of interest to establish whether sorbitol could prevent HIV-1 PR-induced cell lysis. Yeast transformed with pEMBL-HIV-1 PR were induced on galactose plates and liquid medium both containing 0.5 msorbitol. As shown in Fig. 3 B, sorbitol failed to affect both the extent of growth arrest and the cell lysis provoked by HIV-1 PR. Similar results were obtained when 1 m NaCl was used as osmoregulator instead of sorbitol (data not shown). It is thus proposed that lethal alterations other than cell wall breakage give rise to the lytic phenotype of HIV-1 PR-expressing cells. Next, we determined whether the lytic activity of HIV-1 PR also affects mammalian cells. To this end, COS7 cells were transfected with the protease-encoding plasmid pTM1-HIV-1 PR coupled to vaccinia virus vT7 infection (37Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1997; 7: 2538-2544Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). HIV-1 PR is detected as a band of ∼9 kDa upon labeling of cells with [35S]Met/Cys 16 h post transfection (h.p.t.) (Fig. 4 A). On microscopy, it was observed that cells synthesizing HIV-1 PR displayed a number of cytopathic alterations (see below for details). To search for changes in membrane permeability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release to the culture medium was determined, because enhanced leakage of this enzyme reflects loss of plasma membrane integrity. It was not possible to detect LDH activity in culture media from cells transfected with the vector alone. In contrast, LDH did leak out of cells expressing HIV-1 PR (Fig. 4 B). Based on these data, we estimated that 20–25% of cells transfected with pTM1-HIV-1 PR underwent lysis. LDH leakage requires the proteolytic activity of HIV-1 PR, because addition of saquinavir prevented this leakage, although not completely. Probably the high level of HIV-1PR expression using this system makes it difficult to inhibit all HIV-1PR molecules by saquinavir. To determine whether plasma membrane damage is a feature specific of HIV-1 PR, the release of LDH was checked in the culture media of cells transfected with plasmids encoding poliovirus 2Apro, 3Cpro, or 2BC proteins. As mentioned above, these poliovirus proteins are cytotoxic for mammalian cells (34Barco A. Carrasco L. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 42Barco A. Feduchi E. Carrasco L. Virology. 2000; 266: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows that only synthesis of the 2BC protein induced cell lysis to an extent similar to that provoked by HIV-1 PR, and it is in agreement with the idea that 2BC expression enhances plasma membrane permeability, as previously described in detail (33Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of poliovirus 3Cpro failed to induce LDH release despite the fact that 3C protease causes massive cell death by apoptosis (42Barco A. Feduchi E. Carrasco L. Virology. 2000; 266: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cell death by HIV-1 PR occurs by necrosis rather than apoptosis, as initially suggested by Strack and colleagues (17Strack P.R. West Frey M. Rizzo C.J. Cordova B. George H.J. Meade R. Peng Ho S. Corman J. Tritch R. Korant B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9571-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Early alterations in membrane permeability in cells expressing HIV-1 PR were then examined. As a test of membrane permeabilization, the sensitivity of cellular translation to the inhibitor hygromycin B was tested (33Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This translation inhibitor does not enter into cells that possess an intact plasma membrane. Addition of 0.6 mmhygromycin B to cells transfected with pTM1-HIV-1 PR reduced protein synthesis by 40–50% (Fig. 4 C). This degree of inhibition is probably related to the proportion of transfected cells. In the presence of 2 μm saquinavir, entry of hygromycin B into cells was not observed. The nuclear morphology of cells expressing HIV-1 PR was examined to gain knowledge on the mode of HIV-1 PR-induced cell death. Fragmented nuclei, a sign of apoptosis, were observed in COS7 cells expressing poliovirus 3Cpro. Nuclear fragmentation, however, did not occur in cells transfected with pTM1-HIV-1 PR (Fig. 5 A). Caspase-mediated cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a biochemical marker of apoptosis, was also measured. PARP is cleaved in cells expressing poliovirus 3Cpro and in actinomycind-induced apoptotic cells, giving rise to a distinct pattern of cleavage products (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, no cleavage of PARP was observed in cells transfected with pTM1-HIV-1 PR. The integrity of Bcl-2 in cells expressing HIV-1PR was then examined. Under our experimental conditions, Bcl-2 did not undergo proteolysis upon expression of HIV-1 PR in COS7 cells (Fig. 5 B). The translation initiation factor eIF4G was cleaved in cells expressing HIV-1 PR and poliovirus 2Apro as described recently (data not shown) (35Ventoso I. Blanco R. Perales C. Carrasco L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12966-12971Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Bcl-2 protein was cleaved in cells expressing poliovirus 3Cpro but remained intact in actinomycin d-induced apoptotic cells. This suggests that 3Cpro may induce Bcl-2 cleavage via a caspase-independent mechanism (Fig. 5 B). We then went on to examine the ultrastructure of COS7 cells expressing HIV-1 PR. Cells were fixed at 16 h.p.t. and observed by electron microscopy. A large percentage (40%) of COS7 cells transfected with pTM1-HIV-1 PR showed marked morphological alterations (Fig. 6). These changes included swelling, extensive vacuolization, and loss of plasma membrane integrity. In addition, the cytoplasm of these cells showed reduced electrodensity, which suggests cell emptying. Indeed, cell cultures expressing HIV-1 PR accumulated large amounts of cell debris as a consequence of massive cell lysis. In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 5, the nuclei of cells expressing HIV-1 PR remained recognizable with no sign of fragmentation despite some peripheral condensation of chromatin. These changes are clearly more consistent with a necrotic process of cell death. Apoptotic features, such as nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing, or the appearance of apoptotic bodies, were absent in cells expressing HIV-1 PR (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, cells expressing poliovirus 3Cpro displayed these apoptotic changes as described previously (Fig. 6 B) (42Barco A. Feduchi E. Carrasco L. Virology. 2000; 266: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The viral protease and the other pol-encoded enzymes are synthesized at much lower levels than Gag precursors in HIV-1-infected cells. To test whether the cytotoxic effect of HIV-1 PR persists when lower levels of the enzyme are synthesized, Gag-PR HIV-1 sequences were expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 7). Most translation events on gag-pro mRNAs give rise to Gag, whereas only about 5% of the ribosomes engaged in translation direct the synthesis of Gag-PR precursor by a frame-shifting mechanism (43Jaks T. Power M.D. Masiarz F.R. Luciw P.A. Barr P.J. Varmus H.E. Nature. 1989; 331: 280-283Crossref Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Thus, cells transfected with pKS5′l-GAG-PR synthesize much less HIV-1 PR than those transfected with pTM1-HIV-PR. Western blotting against HIV-1 p-24 (CA) protein showed that HIV-1PR is activated in the Gag-PR precursor. This activation leads to processing of the Gag precursor, yielding CA-MA and mature forms of CA (Fig. 7 A). The level of expression of viral proteins with this construct is comparable to that observed in HIV-1-infected cells. As expected, Gag precursor processing was partially prevented when cells were treated with saquinavir. The lytic activity of Gag-PR precursor was comparable to that of HIV-1 PR alone. Fig. 7 B shows that transfection of COS7 cells with pKS5′l-GAG-PR induced a similar degree of cell lysis to that observed in cells expressing HIV-1 PR alone, as judged by the LDH activity recovered in the culture medium. Notice that Gag-PR-induced cell lysis was blocked by saquinavir, indicating it is HIV-1 PR activity itself, and not that of the other gag-encoded proteins, is responsible for cell lysis. In this case, the concentration of saquinavir used was enough to completely block HIV-1PR-mediated cell lysis, because the level of expression of HIV-1PR from pKS5′l-GAG-PR is lower as compared with that observed from pTM1-HIV-1PR. This is consistent with data shown in Fig. 4 B. By individually expressing animal virus proteins in eukaryotic cells different cytopathogenic effects have been attributed to particular gene products. Thus, virus-induced alterations observed in infected cells have been ascribed, in some cases, to the action of one or more particular viral products. This approach has opened new avenues to improve our understanding on the molecular mechanisms used by cytolytic viruses to disrupt cell function and provoke cell death. In the present report, we show that the expression of HIV-1 PR in yeast and mammalian cells induces cytopathogenic effects that culminate in cell lysis. Indeed, there is a striking parallelism between the cell damage induced by HIV-1 PR in the two cell types analyzed,i.e. yeast and mammalian cells. Common detrimental effects include plasma membrane damage, cytoplasm vacuolization, and loss of cell integrity, whereas no major alterations were obvious in other organelles such as the nucleus. This close similarity would suggest a similar mechanism of action for HIV-1 PR in yeast and mammalian cells, despite their evolutionary distance. The yeast S. cerevisiae has been successfully employed to assess alterations produced in mammalian cells by several viral proteins such as poliovirus 2Apro, 2BC, or HIV-1 Vpr (29Barco A. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,39Barco A. Carrasco L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3349-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 44Gu J. Emerman M. Sandmeyer S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4033-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, as far as we are aware, the present findings are the first clear illustration of a lytic effect of a viral protein such as HIV-1 PR on yeast. These data might also prove useful for the development of a yeast-based model to test the lytic ability of other proteins derived from animal viruses. Furthermore, this potential of yeast genetics raises the possibility of searching for one or more genes whose overexpression may suppress HIV-1 PR-mediated cytolysis. An explanation for the observed HIV-1 PR-induced effects on yeast and mammalian cells may be degradation of one or more proteins involved in maintenance of plasma membrane architecture. However, further work is required to fully understand the molecular mechanism by which HIV-1 PR induces cell lysis. As shown by electron microscopy, before undergoing lysis, the plasma membrane of yeast cells that express HIV-1 PR collapses. This alteration was not observed in cells expressing poliovirus 2BC despite dramatic modifications in plasma membrane permeability (33Aldabe R. Barco A. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23134-23137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and indicates that simple plasma membrane permeabilization does not necessarily lead to cell lysis. The reason for cell wall breakage and lysis in HIV-1 PR-expressing yeast is not obvious. However, the possibility that HIV-1 PR might be directly involved in cell wall degradation seems very unlikely. The cell wall affords mechanical protection to yeast cells against osmotic lysis (45Cid V.J. Durán A. del Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 345-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,46Takeo K. Yamamura M. Kamihara T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 61: 297-300Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Indeed, growth of lytic strains with mutations in genes involved in cell wall integrity can be effectively restored by osmotic stabilizers (41Andrews P.D. Stark M.J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 507-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that HIV-1 PR-induced lysis was not prevented by increasing osmotic pressure, suggests that lethal damages other than cell wall degradation underlie this effect. HIV-1 PR has been previously expressed in a wide variety of cells, including bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells, mainly to produce large quantities of the protease. Expression of a secretable form of HIV-1 PR in yeast showed no cytotoxic effects, further suggesting the cell wall is not a direct target for HIV-1 PR. This lack of cytotoxicity toward yeast cells may arise from translocation of the protease to the E.R. lumen at the time of synthesis. Transient expression of HIV-1 PR in COS7 cells leads to cell death. Features characteristic of apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation (17Strack P.R. West Frey M. Rizzo C.J. Cordova B. George H.J. Meade R. Peng Ho S. Corman J. Tritch R. Korant B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9571-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), have been correlated with the observation that HIV-1 PR can induce degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in vitro (17Strack P.R. West Frey M. Rizzo C.J. Cordova B. George H.J. Meade R. Peng Ho S. Corman J. Tritch R. Korant B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9571-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein protects cells from HIV-1 PR-mediated cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, the significance of these observations has been questioned, because infection with HIV-1 does not result in cleavage of Bcl-2. Furthermore, overexpression of this anti-apoptotic protein fails to protect cells against HIV-1-induced lysis (47Kolesnitchenko V. King L. Riva A. Tani Y. Korsmeyer S.J. Cohen D.I. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9753-9763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results indicate that synthesis of HIV-1 PR, both in its mature form and as part of the Gag-PR precursor, induces a number of alterations in COS7 cells that are compatible with necrosis, rather than apoptosis. Indeed, no caspase activation was detected in COS7 cells expressing HIV-PR. It was not possible to detect markers of apoptosis such as nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and PARP cleavage. Furthermore, no signs of cleavage of Bcl-2 by HIV-1 PR in COS7 cells were seen under our experimental conditions. Discrepancies between our results and those published by Strack et al.(48Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2045-2050PubMed Google Scholar) probably reflect differences in the amount and timing of HIV-1PR expression. Overexpression of Bcl-2 can also protect cells from necrotic injury and thus should not be regarded as definitive proof of apoptosis. A role for HIV-1 PR in virus-induced cell killing was previously suggested by the observation that HIV-1 engineered to encode a constitutively activated HIV-1 PR-linked dimer showed increased lytic potential on CD4+ cells and caused defects in virus assembly and budding (49Kräusslich H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of HIV-1 PR in acutely, but not chronically, infected cells, appears to be initiated at an intracellular compartment before virus budding (50Kaplan A.H. Swanstrom R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4528-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the importance of the appropriate spatial and temporal activation of HIV-1 PR in infected cells to ensure a productive lytic infection. The results presented here may clarify some features of the HIV-1 life cycle. Thus, activation of HIV-1 PR during late stages of infection may lead to plasma membrane damage and cell lysis. Altered plasma membrane homeostasis is a major cytopathic feature observed in CD4+ cells infected with HIV-1 (51Cloyd M.W. Lynn W.S. Virology. 1991; 181: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This modification could facilitate the release of newly assembled HIV-1 particles from infected cells, particularly virus particles that bud intracellularly and are trapped into vacuoles. This notion is supported by earlier observations showing that intracellular activation of HIV-1 PR is required for virus release to occur with maximum efficiency (52Kaplan A.H. Manchester M. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6782-6786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank J. Arroyo and J. Lewis for stimulating discussion and critical reading of the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W1985586890,"Voltage-gated EAG K+ channels switch between fast and slow gating modes in a Mg2+-dependent manner by an unknown mechanism. We analyzed molecular motions in and around the voltage-sensing S4 in bEAG1. Using accessibility and perturbation analyses, we found that activation increases both the charge occupancy and volume of S4 side chains in the gating canal. Fluorescence measurements suggest that mode switching is due to a motion of the S2/S3 side of the gating canal. We propose that when S4 is in the resting state and its thin end is in the gating canal, a conformational rearrangement of S2/S3 narrows the canal around S4, forming the Mg2+ binding site. Binding of Mg2+ is proposed to stabilize this conformation and to slow opening of the gate by impeding S4's voltage-sensing outward motion."

Subsequent transamination by the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate-dependent glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (GSA-AM) produces ALA (1Jahn D. Verkamp E. Söll D. Trends Biochem.

The molecular mass, oligomeric state, and catalytic mechanism of GluTR has been the subject of lengthy discussion (6Schröder I. Hederstedt L. Kannangara C.G. Gough S. Biochem.

Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 513-519Google Scholar). Recently, the properties of recombinant GluTR from the hyperthermophilic Archaea Methanopyrus kandleri were investigated (13Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Google Scholar). This enzyme requires only NADPH as cofactor and displays maximal activity in a metal-free reaction. Chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis identified a single catalytically essential cysteine (13Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Google Scholar). Based on biochemical data, a catalytic mechanism for the enzyme was proposed and subsequently explained by the high resolution crystal structure of GluTR complexed with the substrate-like inhibitor glutamycin (14Moser J. Schubert W.-D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 23: 6583-6590Google Scholar, 15Moser J. Schubert W.-D. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 579-584Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer in which each monomer consists of three domains linked by a long “spinal” α-helix. The N-terminal catalytic domain specifically binds the glutamate moiety of glutamycin. It bears the cysteine poised to attack the aminoacyl linkage of the natural substrate glutamyl-tRNA. The potential thioester intermediate is finally reduced by direct hydride transfer from NADPH supplied by a second, NADPH binding domain to form the product GSA. The third domain of M. kandleri GluTR is responsible for dimerization through α-helices from two neighboring monomers. This creates the unusual overall V-shape of the enzyme. Similar catalytic and structural properties have been proposed for plant GluTRs (16Schubert W.-D. Moser J. Schauer S. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Photosynth. Res. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Here we present a biochemical characterization of wild-type and mutantEscherichia coli GluTR enzymes. The enzymatic mechanism is similar to that of M. kandleri as demonstrated by chemical trapping of the corresponding enzyme-bound acyl intermediate. The 1254-bp E. coli hemA gene encoding the 418 amino acid residues of GluTR was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA from E. coli strain DH5α as template and the primers pBKCwtfor (5′-GCGCGGATCCCATGACCCTTTTAGCACTC-3′) and pBKCwtrev (5′-CAGGCTCAGCTACTCCAGCCCGAGGCTGTC-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and BlpI (underlined in the primer sequences) and ligated into the appropriately digested vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pBKCwt. This cloning strategy fused the 5′ end of E. coli hemAto six histidine codons for subsequent affinity chromatographic purification of recombinant GluTR. E. coli cells carrying a hemHmutation are sensitive to visible light (17Miyamoto K. Nakahigashi K. Nishimura K. Inokuchi H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 393-398Google Scholar). The E. coli hemH mutant has a light-sensitive visA phenotype via the accumulation of photoreactive protoporphyrin IX. Further mutation of additional hem genes abolishes the accumulation of the intermediate and reverses the light-sensitive phenotype. If such selected mutants are recovered by the addition of ALA to the growth medium they are either defective in hemA or hemL. Complementation with appropriate plasmid-encoded genes helps to distinguish between both loci (18Nakayashiki T. Taketani S. Inokuchi H. Gene. 1995; 153: 67-70Google Scholar). A total of eight different mutants with mutations in hemA were selected. The genehemA and flanking DNA sequences of such mutants were amplified from their genome by PCR as described above. The corresponding constructs are pBKC104 (G191D), pBKC107 (G7D), pBKC108 (R314C), pBKC110 (G44C/S105N/A326T), pBKC111 (G106N), pBKC112 (S145F), pBKC113 (S22L/S164F), and pBKC236 (E114K). Mutations were identified by complete sequence determination of each isolated hemAgene. To exchange individual residues of E. coli GluTR, the QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides were employed with the introduced codons underlined: GTGCTGTCGACGTCTAACCGCACGGAAC (C50S), GTTAATCCGCTGGCTTTCTGATTATCACAATC (C74S), and GCTTTTGCGGCTTCTACGCTGGCGCG (C170S). Mutant E. coli hemA genes were expressed, and recombinant proteins were purified as described below. E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pBKCwt and pRDKJG (coding for the dnaK chaperone gene and the co-chaperone genes dnaJ and grpE) was cultivated in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A578 of 0.7. After the addition of 250 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 μm ampicillin, cultures were further incubated at 30 °C to an A578 of 1.5. Subsequently, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial cell pellet was re-suspended in an equal volume of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 60 min at 50,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with buffer A with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A containing 50 mmimidazole to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Bound proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing GluTR (1 ml; 2 mg/ml) were pooled and applied to a Superdex 200 high resolution 10/30 gel permeation chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mmNa-HEPES, pH 8.1, including 200 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm CHAPS at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions containing GluTR were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM-10; Amicon, Witten, Germany) to 5 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The native molecular mass of recombinant GluTR in the absence of tRNA substrate was estimated using gel permeation chromatography and glycerol gradient centrifugation (19Frankenberg N. Heinz D. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Google Scholar, 20Waldschmidt R. Jahn D. Seifart K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13350-13356Google Scholar). The first 15 residues of GluTR (220 μg) were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer linked to a 120A analyzer (19Frankenberg N. Heinz D. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data were collected using a Finnigan Mat TSQ 7000 spectrometer. The analyses were carried out with 50 μl of GluTR (0.8 mg/ml) in 5% (v/v) methanol containing 0.01% (v/v) acetic acid (19Frankenberg N. Heinz D. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Google Scholar). For glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments, various amounts of purified E. coli GluTR (90–900 μg/ml) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with the aldehyde using concentrations ranging from 0.0001 to 0.01% (w/v) in 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Reaction products were separated via SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The substrate [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu was prepared in a bulk reaction using 100 μg of purified E. colitRNAGlu (Sigma) and 50 μg of purified E. coliglutamyl-tRNA synthetase incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 15 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, and 40 μm[14C]Glu (10 μCi) with a specific activity of 284 mCi/mmol (10.5 GBq/mmol). After incubation, 1/10 volume of ice-cold 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added, and the reaction mixture was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.9, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant E. coli glutamyl-tRNA synthetase was purified to apparent homogeneity after published procedures (21Lin S. Brisson A. Liu J. Roy P.H. Lapointe J. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 71-74Google Scholar). The GluTR assay mix (100 μl) contained 200 nm purified recombinant E. coli GluTR, 10 μm E. coli [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu in 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 mmNADPH (standard assay buffer) unless stated otherwise. Reactions were started by the addition of [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu, incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time periods, and stopped by pipetting aliquots of 15 μl from the assay mixture onto Whatman No. 3MM filters. The tRNA was precipitated, washed, and quantified as described previously (22Hoben P. Söll D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 55-59Google Scholar). Reactions without GluTR for each employed condition served as background controls for spontaneous substrate hydrolysis. The standard deviation of a typical series of measurements was 8%, and the reported activities were rounded to the nearest 5%. For kinetic measurements the NADPH and [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu concentrations varied between 10 and 600 μm and 1 to 100 μm, respectively. The kinetic data were analyzed according to Lineweaver and Burk (23Lineweaver D. Burk M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Google Scholar). Standard assay mixtures were performed as outlined above with incubation at 37 °C for 2 min. In most cases the reaction product GSA was further identified by its specific conversion into ALA using purified E. coli GSA-AM (24Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Eggertsson G. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3408-3413Google Scholar). Reaction products were analyzed on a Waters Bondapack™ C18 reversed phase column (3.9 × 150-mm, 125-Å pore size, 10-μm particle diameter) as described before (25Mau Y.-H. Wang W.-Y. Tamura R.N. Chang T.-E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 75-79Google Scholar). The radioactive GluTR substrate [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu still contained residual amounts of free [14C]Glu. Under the separation conditions employed, the commercially available [14C]Glu (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) appeared as a double peak at the 1.7- and 2.5-min retention time. A reaction mixture containing 1 mm[14C]Glu-tRNAGlu and 100 μm E. coli GluTR in 10 μl of standard assay buffer (as outlined above) was incubated for the indicated periods of time at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue followed by incubation at 95 °C for 30 s. After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining the gel was dried and exposed for 72 h to a Kodak Storage Phosphor Screen (Bio-Rad). For visualization a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) was used. The plasmid pKR320 contains the E. coli tRNAGlu gene cloned downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (26Roger K.C. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14210-14219Google Scholar). The DNA fragment carrying the E. coli tRNAGlu gene and the T7 RNA polymerase promoter were amplified using PCR. To generate the 3′-CCA end of tRNA during run-off transcription, the PCR-amplified template DNA was digested with FokI. The in vitro transcription reaction was performed at 37 °C for 2.5 h in a buffer containing 40 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 1m betaine, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4 mm each nucleoside triphosphate, the PCR-amplified template DNA (0.5 μm), and 100 μg/ml T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA transcripts were subsequently purified by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography as described before (27Jahn M. Jahn D. Kumar M.A. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2786Google Scholar). The E. coli hemA gene was expressed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase-dependent promoter, resulting in an N-terminal His6-tag fusion protein. Initially, various expression systems and protocols yielded mainly insoluble HemA as inclusion bodies. Co-expression of hemA with thednaJK/grpE-encoded chaperone system dramatically increased the amount of soluble GluTR, allowing affinity chromatography purification on Ni-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose. SDS-PAGE revealed four major purified proteins with approximate Mrvalues of 69,000, 48,000, 41,000, and 24,000, respectively (Fig. 1). N-terminal sequence determination identified the 69,000 protein as E. coli DnaK (calculated molecular mass of 69,114 Da), the 48,000 protein as E. coliGluTR (48,475 Da), the 41,000 protein as E. coli DnaJ (41,043 Da), and the 24,000 protein as an E. coli FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase. The tight association of the molecular chaperones and GluTR may explain the increased solubility of the recombinant enzyme (28De Marco A. Volrath S. Bruyere T. Law M. Fonne-Pfister R. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 81-86Google Scholar). Gel permeation chromatography on Superdex 200 separated aggregates of E. coli GluTR, DnaK and DnaJ, from free GluTR (Fig. 1). Homogeneity of E. coli GluTR was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. One liter of bacterial culture yielded ∼100 μg of GluTR. The calculated molecular mass of the GluTR monomer (48,475 Da) was experimentally confirmed to be 48,448 ± 30 Da by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The His tag was removed by thrombin treatment for 10 h at 25 °C. Unprocessed fusion protein and cleaved His tag were removed by a second affinity chromatography on nickel-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose (data not shown). The integrity of native GluTR was checked by N-terminal sequencing and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. After removal of the His tag, E. coli GluTR retained eight additional N-terminal amino acids (GSHMLEDP) due to the cloning procedure. The catalytic properties of the recombinant E. coli enzyme were determined by the combination of a substrate depletion assay (13Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Google Scholar) and HPLC analysis. The assay quantifies the rate of substrate utilization using a standard aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase test (22Hoben P. Söll D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 55-59Google Scholar). Substrate utilization and product identity were verified using HPLC. Without E. coli GluTR, slow substrate hydrolysis of less than 10% after 2 min was observed. Adding recombinant E. coli GluTR significantly increased E. coli glutamyl-tRNA utilization. The reaction product GSA was quantified by HPLC (Fig. 2, panel B). As expected, the GluTR reaction product was almost completely converted to ALA by the further addition of purified E. coli GSA-AM (Fig. 2,panel B). In contrast to M. kandleri GluTR, Mg2+ ions were observed to stimulate the activity of purified recombinant E. coli GluTR. Adding metal-chelating agents such as EDTA, EGTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and 2,2′-dipyridyl significantly reduced enzyme activity, although this was restored through the addition of Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+. PtCl4, and KPdCl4 as well as Ni2+and Co2+ inactivated the enzyme (TableI). These inhibitory effects may be caused by interaction of the metal ions with an active-site residue. Alternatively, heavy metal ions may inactivate GluTR by occupying the Mg2+-binding site.Table ICatalytic properties of E. coli GluTRAddition 1aThe pH of the substances indicated were adjusted to 8.1 and preincubated with purified E. coli GluTR under standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) for 15 min before reactions were started by adding radioactive E. coli glutamyl-tRNA substrate.Addition 2aThe pH of the substances indicated were adjusted to 8.1 and preincubated with purified E. coli GluTR under standard assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) for 15 min before reactions were started by adding radioactive E. coli glutamyl-tRNA substrate.GluTR activitybGluTR activity was measured by the substrate depletion assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Under optimal standard assay conditions at pH 8.1 and 37 °C,E. coli GluTR has a specific activity of 600 nmol h−1 mg−1 (= 0.01 μmol min−1mg−1) using E. coli Glu-tRNA as substrate. This specific activity was set to 100%. All other reported values were related to this value. The Km andkcat for E. coli Glu-tRNA were, respectively, found to be 24 μm and 0.13 s−1, and those for NADPH were 39 μm and 0.15 s−1. The N-terminal His tag had no influence on these catalytic parameters. High concentrations of the purified recombinant E. coli GluTR (up to 11 mg/ml) were analyzed using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Typical spectra for tetrapyrroles, flavins, NADPH, NADP+, iron-sulfur clusters, or pyridoxal 5′-phosphate/pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate were not detected. In agreement with these observations, no stimulation of E. coli GluTR activity by the addition of iron protoporphyrin IX, FAD, FMN, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate was observed (Table I). From these results we conclude that purified E. coli GluTR does not possess a chromophoric prosthetic group. Contradictory molecular mass determinations have previously been reported forE. coli GluTR (8Jahn D. Michelsen U. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2542-2548Google Scholar, 29Verkamp E. Jahn M. Jahn D. Kumar M.A. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8275-8280Google Scholar) presumably due to its aggregation through intermolecular disulfide bridges and its tendency to associate with other cellular components (30Chen W. Wright L. Lee S. Cosloy S.D. Russell C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 109-121Google Scholar). We repeated the native molecular mass determination using homogenous, soluble, and purified E. coli GluTR. Gel permeation chromatography experiments and glycerol gradient centrifugation with recombinant E. coli GluTR revealed a relative molecular mass for the native enzyme of 180,000 ± 10,000 with a Stokes radius of 50 Å. With a calculated molecular mass of 48,475 Da per monomer, a tetrameric E. coli GluTR could be inferred. Without dithiothreitol addition, aggregates of higher Mr, more than 2,000,000, dominated next to minor amounts of “tetrameric” enzyme as previously noted for M. kandleri GluTR (13Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the latter, however, rather than confirming a tetramer, revealed an extended dimer with a deduced Stokes radius of ∼80 Å. To confirm a dimeric structure for E. coli GluTR, cross-linking experiments using glutaraldehyde with subsequent SDS-PAGE were performed. The addition of increasing amounts of glutaraldehyde led to the formation of significant amounts of GluTR with aMr of ∼95,000 ± 5,000 kDa (data not shown). These experimental results together with a sequence identity of 60% to M. kandleri GluTR indicate that E. coliGluTR is also a homodimeric enzyme with an extended structure. The catalytic mechanism of M. kandleri GluTR involves an active-site cysteine that forms a thioester to the substrate before NADPH-dependent reduction (13Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Google Scholar). To identify the corresponding nucleophilic amino acid in E. coli GluTR, the enzyme was chemically modified. As shown in Table I, treatment ofE. coli GluTR with iodoacetamide,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) totally abolish enzymatic activity. Together with the observed heavy-metal sensitivity, this confirms the involvement of one or more nucleophilic cysteines in catalysis. To identify the cysteine residues involved, all cysteines in the protein, Cys-50, Cys-74, and Cys-170, were individually replaced by serine. Only mutant GluTR, C50S, is inactive (TableII). The remaining two mutants retain full catalytic activity. Cys-50 is the only cysteine conserved in all known GluTRs (more than 40 known genes compared),"
https://openalex.org/W2000306281,"AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is a nuclear receptor coactivator gene amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. However, the mechanisms by which AIB1 is regulated are unclear. Here we show that 17beta-estradiol represses AIB1 mRNA and protein expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells primarily by suppressing AIB1 gene transcription. Estrogen levels present in fetal calf serum are sufficient to maintain AIB1 mRNA and protein at low basal levels, and this repression is reversed by the addition of antiestrogens or all-trans retinoic acid. Interestingly, cycloheximide inhibition experiments revealed that secondary protein synthesis was necessary to induce AIB1 expression by antiestrogens and retinoids. Experiments with TGF-beta and TGF-beta blocking antibodies demonstrated that this growth factor modulates AIB1 expression and showed that the antiestrogen and retinoid induction of AIB1 gene expression is mediated at least in part through TGF-beta. These data reveal a mechanism of estrogen-induced down-modulation of the overall hormone sensitivity of cells through feedback inhibition of coactivator gene expression. These data also suggest that antiestrogens can shift the sensitivity of cells to non-estrogenic proliferative signaling by increasing cellular levels of AIB1. This effect may play a role in breast cancer progression and resistance to drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1996339094,"RNA polymerase (pol) III transcription is abnormally active in fibroblasts transformed by polyomavirus (Py) or simian virus 40 (SV40). Several distinct mechanisms contribute to this effect. In untransformed fibroblasts, the basal pol III transcription factor (TF) IIIB is repressed through association with the retinoblastoma protein RB; this restraint is overcome by large T antigens of Py and SV40. Furthermore, cells transformed by these papovaviruses overexpress the BDP1 subunit of TFIIIB, at both the protein and mRNA levels. Despite the overexpression of BDP1, the abundance of the other TFIIIB components is unperturbed following papovavirus transformation. In contrast, mRNAs encoding all five subunits of the basal factor TFIIIC2 are found at elevated levels in fibroblasts transformed by Py or SV40. Thus, both papovaviruses stimulate pol III transcription by boosting production of selected components of the basal machinery. Py differs from SV40 in encoding a highly oncogenic middle T antigen that localizes outside the nucleus and activates several signal transduction pathways. Middle T can serve as a potent activator of a pol III reporter in transfected cells. Several distinct mechanisms therefore contribute to the high levels of pol III transcription that accompany transformation by Py and SV40.

RNA Polymerase III Transcription. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Pol III products are overexpressed in a wide variety of cell lines transformed by DNA tumor viruses, RNA tumor viruses, or chemical carcinogens (e.g. Refs. 2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar, 3Singh K. Carey M. Saragosti S. Botchan M. Nature. 1985; 314: 553-556Google Scholar, 4White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6838-6846Google Scholar). These observations also apply to rodent and human tumors in vivo(7Chen W. Heierhorst J. Brosius J. Tiedge H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 288-292Google Scholar, 8Chen W. Bocker W. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 345-351Google Scholar, 9Winter A.G. Sourvinos G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H. Spandidos D.A. White R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12619-12624Google Scholar). For example, RT-PCR assays showed that tRNA, 5S rRNA, and 7SL RNA are overproduced consistently in human ovarian cancers (9Winter A.G. Sourvinos G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H. Spandidos D.A. White R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12619-12624Google Scholar). An extensive Northern analysis of 80 tumor specimens representing 19 types of cancer revealed that 7SL RNA is abnormally abundant in every tumor analyzed, relative to healthy tissue from the same patient (8Chen W. Bocker W. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 345-351Google Scholar). Furthermore, in situ hybridization of breast, lung, and tongue carcinomas showed increased levels of pol III transcripts in neoplastic cells relative to the surrounding healthy tissue (7Chen W. Heierhorst J. Brosius J. Tiedge H. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 288-292Google Scholar, 8Chen W. Bocker W. Brosius J. Tiedge H. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 345-351Google Scholar). The first indication that pol III responds to cell transformation came from studies with murine fibroblasts transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40) (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar, 3Singh K. Carey M. Saragosti S. Botchan M. Nature. 1985; 314: 553-556Google Scholar, 10Carey M.F. Singh K. Botchan M. Cozzarelli N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3068-3076Google Scholar). When different SV40-transformed clones are compared, the highest abundance of pol III transcripts is found in those that most efficiently induce tumors, whereas lower levels are detected in the less tumorigenic lines (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar, 4White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3713-3721Google Scholar). A tight link between transformation and pol III induction is suggested by lines transformed using temperature-sensitive mutants of the SV40 oncoprotein large T antigen; these activate pol III transcription within 30 min of transfer to the permissive temperature (11Luo Y. Kurz J. MacAfee N. Krause M.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 313-327Google Scholar) and rapidly down-regulate pol III products when returned to nonpermissive conditions, while reverting to normal morphology and phenotype (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar). SV40 large T antigen has also been shown to activate pol III transcription in vitro and in transient transfections (12Loeken M. Bikel I. Livingston D.M. Brady J. Cell. 1988; 55: 1171-1177Google Scholar, 13Damania B. Mital R. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1331-1338Google Scholar, 14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). Large T antigen can bind and neutralize the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein RB (15DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.-Y. Huang C.-M. Lee W.-H. Marsilio E. Paucha E. Livingston D.M.

Cell. 1989; 58: 257-267Google Scholar). Mutations in T antigen that reduce RB binding also abrogate its transforming activity (15DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.-Y. Huang C.-M. Lee W.-H. Marsilio E. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 275-283Google Scholar, 16Moran E. Nature. 1988; 334: 168-170Google Scholar, 17Ewen M.E. Ludlow J.W. Marsilio E. DeCaprio J.A. Millikan R.C. Cheng S.H. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 257-267Google Scholar). Gene disruption experiments revealed that endogenous RB represses pol III transcription in murine fibroblasts (18White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar). The increased synthesis of tRNA and 5S rRNA in RB-knockout cells reflects deregulation of TFIIIB, a pol III-specific TBP-containing complex that is required for expression of all class III genes (19Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Google Scholar). Three groups have independently reported evidence that TFIIIB activity is inhibited by recombinant RB (19Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Google Scholar, 20Chu W.-M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Schmid C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14755-14761Google Scholar, 21Hirsch H.A. Gu L. Henry R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9182-9191Google Scholar). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation, cofractionation, and pull-down experiments showed that TFIIIB associates stably with both endogenous and recombinant RB (19Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Google Scholar, 20Chu W.-M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Schmid C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14755-14761Google Scholar). This interaction prevents TFIIIB from contacting pol III and TFIIIC2, both in vitroand in vivo, and thereby precludes the formation of a functional initiation complex (22Sutcliffe J.E. Brown T.R.P. Allison S.J. Scott P.H. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9192-9202Google Scholar). The ability of large T antigen to neutralize RB allows it to release TFIIIB from repression (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). As a consequence, the proportion of endogenous TFIIIB associated with RB is substantially diminished in SV40-transformed cells (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). In most cases, TFIIIB is recruited to promoters by the large DNA-binding factor TFIIIC2 (reviewed in Refs. 23Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Google Scholar and 24Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed elevated TFIIIC2 activity in the SV40-transformed fibroblast lines SV3T3 Cl38 and SV3T3 Cl49 relative to the untransformed parental 3T3 line A31 (4White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3713-3721Google Scholar). Antibodies against its two largest subunits revealed that the higher TFIIIC2 activity correlates with an increase in protein abundance (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that this overexpression reflects elevated levels of the corresponding mRNAs; the effect is specific, because no increase was observed in mRNAs encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or the TFIIIB subunit BRF1 (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). These SV40-transformed cell lines therefore deregulate two key components of the class III machinery to achieve high rates of pol III transcription; this involves release from repression in the case of TFIIIB, whereas TFIIIC2 hyperactivity reflects its increased production. Although two subunits of TFIIIC2 were shown to be overexpressed in SV3T3 cells (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar), its other three subunits had not been isolated at that time and so were not examined. As their sequences are now available (25Hsieh Y.-J. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4944-4952Google Scholar, 26Hsieh Y.-J. Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7697-7704Google Scholar), we are able here to confirm that each of their mRNAs shows a similar response to SV40 transformation, allowing a coordinated induction. Furthermore, the recent isolation (27Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Google Scholar) of the remaining human TFIIIB subunit BDP1 (previously referred to as B“) has allowed us to also examine if this polypeptide responds to transformation. Unlike the other components of TFIIIB, we find that BDP1 is overproduced at both the mRNA and protein levels in SV3T3 cells. We have extended these observations to include polyomavirus (Py), a second member of the papovavirus family that causes a variety of tumors in newborn mice (28Kaplan D.R. Pallas D.C. Morgan W. Schaffhausen B. Roberts T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 345-364Google Scholar). We show that Py-transformed fibroblasts resemble SV3T3 cells in that they overexpress BDP1 and all five subunits of TFIIIC2 and that they use large T antigen to release TFIIIB from repression by RB. Whereas SV40 just has large T and small t antigens, Py also makes a middle T antigen which is essential for its transforming capacity (28Kaplan D.R. Pallas D.C. Morgan W. Schaffhausen B. Roberts T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 345-364Google Scholar). Although Py middle T is not found in the nucleus, we show that it too can activate pol III transcriptionin vivo, probably via one or more signaling cascades. The class III machinery is therefore deregulated through several distinct mechanisms in fibroblasts transformed by SV40 and Py, allowing these papovaviruses to achieve the high rates of pol III activity that are necessary for cells to sustain rapid growth. SV3T3 lines were generated by infection of Balb/c 3T3 A31 cells with SV40 of the wt830 strain and were selected by focus formation in low serum (29Rigby P.W.J. Chia W. Clayton C.E. Lovett M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1980; 210: 437-450Google Scholar). Py3T3 and Pytsa3T3 are lines of A31 cells transformed by wild-type Py and tsa mutant virus, respectively (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and were harvested when subconfluent. RNA was extracted from cells using TRI reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's specifications. All primers have been described previously (9Winter A.G. Sourvinos G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H. Spandidos D.A. White R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12619-12624Google Scholar), apart from those involvingBDP1. PCR of BDP1 used primers 5′-GCTGATAGAGATACTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CCAGAGACAAGAATCTTCTC-3′ to give a 293-bp product and the following amplification conditions: 95 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 5 min. Amplification was carried out over a linear range using conditions described previously (9Winter A.G. Sourvinos G. Allison S.J. Tosh K. Scott P.H. Spandidos D.A. White R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12619-12624Google Scholar), except for the inclusion of 1.8 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol). Reaction products were resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 0.5× TBE. Radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimaging (Fujix Bas 1000). Details of pol III templates pVA1, Mcet1, pGlu6, E2-160, and pTB14 have all been published (30White R.J. Rigby P.W.J. Jackson S.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 16: 1-7Google Scholar, 31White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Google Scholar). pCAT (Promega) contains the CAT gene driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer. Expression constructs pSV-LT, pSV-MT, and pSV-NG59 have been described (32Urich M. El Shemerly M.Y.M. Besser D. Nagamine Y. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29286-29292Google Scholar, 33Marti A. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2917-2921Google Scholar). Cell lines were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection using TRI reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. It was then analyzed by primer extension using bothVA1-specific (5′-CACGCGGGCGGTAACCGCATG-3′) andCAT-specific (5′-CGATGCCATTGGGATATATCA-3′) labeled primers. Primer extension reactions were conducted as previously described (18White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar). Pol III transcription was carried out as previously described (34White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Google Scholar), except that pBR322 was not included and the incubations were for 60 min at 30 °C. Whole cell extracts were prepared using the method described by White et al. (31White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Google Scholar). Extract (150 μg) was incubated at 4 °C on an orbital shaker with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads carrying equivalent amounts of prebound IgG. Samples were then pelleted, supernatants were removed, and the beads were washed five times with 150 μl of LDB buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 17% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol). The bound material was analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies used were C-15 (Santa Cruz) and G99-549 (Pharmingen) against RB, M-19 (Santa Cruz) against TAFI48, C18 (Santa Cruz) against TFIIB, 330 and 128 against BRF1 (35Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Google Scholar, 36Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Google Scholar), SL30 against TBP (37Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1029-1040Google Scholar), clone 46 (Transduction Laboratories) against TFIIIC110, and Ab4 against TFIIIC220 (38Shen Y. Igo M. Yalamanchili P. Berk A.J. Dasgupta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4163-4171Google Scholar). Antiserum 2663 against BDP1 was raised by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptide CSDRYRIYKAQKLRE (human BDP1 residues 139–152 (27Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Google Scholar)) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antiserum 1898 against TFIIIC90 was raised by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides MNTADQARVGPADDGC and GMGNADDEQQEEGTSC (human TFIIIC90 residues 1–16 and 613–626 (26Hsieh Y.-J. Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7697-7704Google Scholar), respectively) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Western immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (31White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that pol III transcripts are overexpressed in a large number of rat, mouse, and hamster fibroblast cell lines that have been transformed with Py, relative to their untransformed parental lines (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar,39Majello B. La Mantia G. Simeone A. Boncinelli E. Lania L. Nature. 1985; 314: 457-459Google Scholar, 40Lania L. Pannuti A. La Mantia G. Basilico C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 400-404Google Scholar). Nuclear run-on assays revealed that this is because of an increased rate of pol III transcription (40Lania L. Pannuti A. La Mantia G. Basilico C. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 400-404Google Scholar). However, these earlier studies did not investigate the molecular basis of the induction. To do this, we have concentrated on the murine line Py3T3, a Py-transformed derivative of A31 cells, an immortalized Balb/c 3T3 line (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar). This was chosen to allow direct comparison with our previous data on SV3T3 cells, which were generated from the same A31 parental line by SV40 transformation (29Rigby P.W.J. Chia W. Clayton C.E. Lovett M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1980; 210: 437-450Google Scholar). To confirm that the Py3T3 cells display a general deregulation of class III genes, RT-PCR reactions were carried out over a linear range with template cDNAs generated using RNA extracted from the Py3T3 and A31 3T3 lines. The level of tRNATyr and U6 snRNA was clearly elevated in the Py3T3 cells (Fig. 1). This was also true for tRNALeu (data not shown). In contrast, little or no change was detected in the levels of mRNA encoding acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (ARPP P0), which is synthesized by pol II. In the case of the tRNAs, our primers hybridize to the intron sequences of short-lived primary transcripts; because these tRNA precursors are processed very rapidly, their levels in a cell reflect the rate of ongoing transcription (41Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Google Scholar). Our data therefore suggest that pol III activity is elevated specifically in the Py3T3 line relative to the untransformed parental cells. In untransformed fibroblasts, TFIIIB is bound and repressed by RB (19Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Google Scholar). The large T antigen of SV40 was shown to overcome this repressive influence of RB on TFIIIB (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). Because Py also encodes a large T antigen that can bind and neutralize RB (42Dyson N. Bernards R. Friend S.H. Gooding L.R. Hassel J.A. Major E.O. Pipas J.M. Vandyke T. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1353-1356Google Scholar, 43Larose A. Dyson N. Sullivan M. Harlow E. Bastin M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2308-2313Google Scholar, 44Freund R. Bronson R.T. Benjamin T.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1979-1987Google Scholar), we investigated whether this viral product can activate TFIIIB by releasing it from RB. Whole cell extracts were prepared in parallel from 3T3 and Py3T3 cells. As expected, the transformed cell extracts transcribed a range of pol III templates more actively than the matched 3T3 extracts (Fig. 2A). Complementation experiments were conducted to compare directly the TFIIIB activity in the extracts. These assays exploit the differential sensitivity of pol III factors to inactivation by mild heat treatment. When an extract is heated at 47 °C for 15 min, TFIIIC and TBP are inactivated whereas the other components of the pol III machinery are not compromised; the activity of TFIIIB in an unfractionated extract can therefore be assayed by heating the extract and then measuring its ability to reconstitute transcription when added to a complementing fraction containing TFIIIC, TBP, and pol III (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar, 19Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R. Martin K. Kouzarides T. Jackson S.P. White R.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2061-2071Google Scholar, 31White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Google Scholar, 35Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Google Scholar, 36Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Google Scholar). This revealed that TFIIIB activity is elevated ∼6-fold in extracts of the Py3T3 line (Fig. 2B). To test whether large T antigen is responsible for this increase, we used Pytsa3T3 cells, a line generated by transforming 3T3 A31 cells using a Py mutant in which large T is inactivated specifically (2Scott M.R.D. Westphal K.-H. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 34: 557-567Google Scholar). In contrast to the extracts of cells transformed with wild-type virus, Pytsa3T3 cell extracts showed only a ∼1.3-fold increase in TFIIIB activity (Fig. 2B). This suggests that large T antigen is primarily responsible for the elevated TFIIIB activity observed in Py3T3 cells. Because the above experiments implicate Py large T in the deregulation of TFIIIB and this T antigen is known to target RB, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments to investigate how the interaction between RB and TFIIIB responds to Py transformation. As shown previously (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar, 19Larminie C.G.C. Cairns C.A. Mital R.

Sutcliffe J.E. Alzuherri H.M. Mclees A. Winter A.G. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1005-1014Google Scholar), the BRF1 subunit of TFIIIB can be coimmunoprecipitated using antibody against RB (Fig. 3A,upper panel). This reflects a specific interaction with RB, because BRF1 is not detected in immunoprecipitates obtained using antibody against TAFI48, which serves as a negative control. Although similar amounts of RB are immunoprecipitated from the two cell types (lower panel), the amount of bound BRF1 is substantially reduced in the Py3T3 cells when compared with 3T3. Western blotting of whole cell extracts shows that the reduced interaction between RB and BRF1 cannot be explained by a decrease in the level of either of these components (Fig. 3B). We also detect no change in the abundance of TBP. The results above show that the proportion of BRF1 bound to RB is significantly reduced following transformation by Py. The most likely explanation is that much of the RB in Py3T3 cells is bound and neutralized by the viral large T antigen. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitations confirmed that large T antigen associates with RB in the Py3T3 cell extracts. 2Z. A. Felton-Edkins, unpublished data. To test directly whether Py large T can activate pol III transcription in vivo, we carried out transient transfections. 3T3 cells were transfected with the adenovirus VA1 gene, as a pol III reporter, and the CAT gene driven by the SV40 early promoter, as an internal pol II control. Cotransfection with a vector encoding Py large T antigen resulted in a dramatic, specific and dose-dependent activation of VA1 expression (Fig. 4A). As a negative control, we used a mutant form of Py middle T, which had no effect on the pol III reporter. After normalization against the SV40-CAT internal control, the Py large T antigen was found to stimulate VA1 gene expression by over 50-fold in this assay (Fig. 4B). TFIIIB contains three essential subunits, TBP, BRF1, and BDP1 (23Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Google Scholar, 24Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Google Scholar). Although the levels of TBP and BRF1 are similar in 3T3 and Py3T3 cell extracts (Fig. 3B), we found that the BDP1 protein is significantly more abundant after Py transformation (Fig. 5A,upper panel). This overexpression does not require large T antigen, as it is seen with the Pytsa mutant as well as the wild-type virus. The effect is specific, because equal amounts of TFIIB are detected in the three cell types (Fig. 5A,lower panel). It was confirmed using an alternative antibody against BDP1.2 To find out if overproduction of BDP1 is a more general feature of papovavirus-transformed fibroblasts, we carried out similar blots with SV40-transformed lines. Both SV3T3 Cl38 and SV3T3 Cl49 were found to produce abnormally high levels of BDP1 (Fig. 5B). As with Py3T3 cells, the BRF1 and TBP levels are normal in these SV3T3 lines (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). Thus, transformation by both Py and SV40 can induce a selective increase in the abundance of a specific subunit of TFIIIB. RT-PCR assays showed that in each case the increase in BDP1 protein is associated with a selective increase in the mRNA encoding BDP1 (Fig. 5, C and D). Overexpression of BDP1 in transformed cells has not been reported previously. However, SV3T3 cells have been shown to overexpress the two largest subunits of TFIIIC2, TFIIIC220 and TFIIIC110 (also called TFIIICα and TFIIICβ, respectively), at both the protein and mRNA levels (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). Elevated expression of TFIIIC220 and TFIIIC110 was also detected in Py3T3 cells, as revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, RT-PCR suggests that this increase occurs at the transcript level (Fig. 6B). This effect is independent of large T antigen, because it also occurs in the Pytsa3T3 line. After normalization against a constantly expressed control transcript (ARPP P0), the specific increase in TFIIIC220 and TFIIIC110 mRNAs after Py transformation was found to be ∼2- and ∼2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6C). This relatively small but reproducible induction is significantly less than the ∼4-fold elevation of TFIIIC220 and the ∼7-fold increase in TFIIIC110 mRNAs in SV40-transformed cells (14Larminie C.G.C. Sutcliffe J.E. Tosh K. Winter A.G. Felton-Edkins Z.A. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4927-4934Google Scholar). However, in both cases the induction of TFIIIC110 is greater than that of TFIIIC220. TFIIIC2 is composed of five subunits (47Sinn E. Wang Z. Kovelman R. Roeder R.G.

To identify molecular changes underlying compensatory mechanisms activated in chronic diarrheas, cDNA microarrays and Northern blot analyses were used to compare global mRNA expression patterns in small intestine of NHE3-deficient and wild-type mice. Among the genes identified were members of the RegIII family of growth factors, which may contribute to the increased absorptive area, and a large number of interferon-γ-responsive genes. The latter finding is of particular interest, since interferon-γ has been shown to regulate ion transporter activities in intestinal epithelial cells. Serum interferon-γ was elevated 5-fold in NHE3-deficient mice; however, there was no evidence of inflammation, and unlike conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, levels of other cytokines were unchanged. In addition, quantitative PCR analysis showed that up-regulation of interferon-γ mRNA was localized to the small intestine and did not occur in the colon, spleen, or kidney. These in vivodata suggest that elevated interferon-γ, produced by gut-associated lymphoid tissue in the small intestine, is part of a homeostatic mechanism that is activated in response to the intestinal absorptive defect in order to regulate the fluidity of the intestinal tract.

A balance between absorption and secretion of ions in the intestinal tract is necessary to maintain proper ionic and fluid composition of the luminal contents and to recover electrolytes, acid-base equivalents, and water. The absorption of NaCl, HCO3−, and water is due, in part, to apical Na+/H+ exchange. There are five known plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger (the number following NHE refers to the specific isoform); Nhe3+/+ andNhe3−/−, wild-type and homozygous mutant mice, respectively; IFN-γ, interferon-gamma; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin (the number following IL refers to the specific interleukin); mAb, monoclonal antibody; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NKCC1, isoform 1 of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; RT, reverse transcription; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. three of which are expressed in the intestine (1Orlowski J.

Little is known, however, about the underlying genetic regulatory mechanisms that are activated in the small intestine during chronic diarrheas. To address this issue, global mRNA expression patterns were examined in small intestines of Nhe3−/−and Nhe3+/+ mice using cDNA microarrays. We were particularly interested in genes that have the potential to regulate either ion transport processes or growth and development, such as signal transduction molecules, transport proteins, and growth or transcription factors. Some of the most interesting genes identified included putative growth factors of the regenerating gene subtype III family and, surprisingly, a large number of IFN-γ-responsive genes. A number of investigators have shown previously that IFN-γ regulates the expression and activity of ion transporters involved in intestinal absorption and secretion (13Yoo D. Lo W. Goodman S. Ali W.

Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1398-C1404Google Scholar, 17Rocha F. Musch M.W. Lishanskiy L. Bookstein C. Sugi K. Xie Y. Chang E.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1224-C1232Google Scholar). The identification of so many IFN-γ-responsive genes altered in theNhe3−/− small intestine suggested that elevated IFN-γ might serve as a mechanism for regulating the balance between absorption and secretion, thereby adjusting the fluidity of the intestinal contents to a more appropriate level for digestive functions and reducing the loss of electrolytes and acid-base equivalents. The apparent IFN-γ response was puzzling, however, because IFN-γ has been associated almost invariably with inflammatory responses, yet previous studies provided no evidence for inflammation inNhe3−/− mice (7Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Google Scholar). Analysis of serum cytokine levels in Nhe3−/− mice revealed that IFN-γ levels were increased, but levels of other cytokines characteristic of known models of gut inflammation were unchanged. Moreover, there was no histological or molecular evidence for inflammation in small intestine and no signs of pathogenic bacteria detected by our methods. These data, showing that IFN-γ levels were elevated and that the expression of numerous IFN-γ-responsive genes was altered in theNhe3−/− small intestine, in the absence of any detectable inflammation, suggest the possibility of a homeostatic function for IFN-γ in chronic diarrhea. Colonies of NHE3-deficient mice were generated previously (7Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Google Scholar) and maintained on a mixed 129SvJ and Black Swiss background because viability was severely impaired on an inbred background (8Ledoussal C. Woo A.L. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1385-G1396Google Scholar). All experimental pairs ofNhe3−/− and Nhe3+/+mice were 8–12 weeks old and were littermates matched by both age and sex. Colonies of ROMK-deficient mice were generated and maintained as previously described (18Lorenz J.N. Baird N.R. Judd L.M. Noonan W.T. Andringa A. Doetschman T. Manning P.A. Liu L.H. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37871-37880Google Scholar). Mice were housed in a barrier facility, in individually ventilated microisolation cages. To ensure a pathogen-free environment, sentinel mice housed on each rack were tested every three months for viral infections, including, but not limited to, mouse hepatitis virus, rotavirus, hantavirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and parvovirus. A viral infection was never detected in this room. Total RNA was extracted from pooled small intestines of three Nhe3+/+ and threeNhe3−/− mice using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and poly(A) RNA was purified using the MicroPoly(A) pure small scale mRNA purification kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Two separate sets of poly(A) RNAs fromNhe3−/− and Nhe3+/+small intestines were sent to IncyteGenomics (St. Louis, MO), where three experiments were performed using the mouse GEM2 gene expression array. In experiment 1A, the first set of poly(A) RNAs fromNhe3−/− and Nhe3+/+small intestine pooled samples were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. In experiment 1B, the same set of poly(A) RNAs were used, but the Cy3 and Cy5 labels were reversed. In the third experiment, experiment 2, the second set of pooled poly(A) RNAs fromNhe3−/− and Nhe3+/+small intestines were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. The first two hybridizations used GEM2.08, and the third hybridization used GEM2.25. Microarray data were analyzed using Incyte Gemtools software and GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). Only those samples that passed the quality control specifications outlined by IncyteGenomics, determined using Gemtools, were incorporated in the study. The Cy3 and Cy5 signals for each data set were normalized using a balancing coefficient determined from the total signal intensity of each dye on the microarray. In addition, an intensity-dependent normalization procedure, provided by the GeneSpring software, was used to normalize data at lower fluorescence levels, where nonlinearity in the ratios of the two dyes is often observed (19Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Google Scholar). Differential mRNA expression levels were calculated from the ratio of Nhe3−/− toNhe3+/+ fluorescence measurements and are referred to as -fold changes. -Fold changes greater than +1 represent up-regulation in the knockout compared with wild type, whereas -fold changes less than −1 represent down-regulation in the knockout compared with wild type. Lists of up-regulated and down-regulated genes were compiled by determining the average -fold changes in gene expression for experiments 1A and 1B (collectively referred to as experiment 1) and then calculating the average -fold changes in gene expression for experiments 1 and 2. Values that exceeded an average of 1.4-fold differential expression, the value recommended by IncyteGenomics, are reported in Tables I and II. The recommended differential expression level of 1.4 was based on an IncyteGenomics GEM Microarray Validation study showing that the percentage coefficient of variation (the relative S.D. value) between two experiments was 12%; thus, fewer than 1% of genes that are not differentially expressed will vary by as much as 1.4 in a single experiment. The reproducibility between experiments 1A and 1B and between experiments 1 and 2 was excellent, with coefficients of variation of 10.1 and 9.1%, respectively. Northern blot analyses of a third distinct set of RNA samples was performed to confirm the reliability of microarray data obtained from the first two sets of samples.Table IUp-regulated genes in the Nhe3−/− small intestineGenBank™Expt. 1Expt. 2AverageGeneNM_0110369.086.427.75RegIIIβ, pancreatitis-associated proteinNM_0138935.37ND5.37RegIIIδ, islet neogenesis-associated protein-related proteinNM_0187383.024.173.60IGTP, interferon-γ-induced GTPaseNM_0094773.162.402.78Uridine phosphorylaseNM_0103783.072.472.77Histocompatibility 2, class II antigen A, αBC0034762.602.452.53Ia-associated invariant chainNM_0109273.601.362.48Nitri-oxide synthase 2, inducible, macrophageAK0073922.542.072.30Elastase 1, pancreaticNM_0096692.601.952.27Amylase 2, pancreaticNM_0135852.292.042.16LMP2, large multifunctional protease 2NM_0103701.922.382.15Granzyme ANM_0079191.972.252.11Elastase 2NM_0077692.321.882.10crp-ductinNM_0107242.321.842.08LMP7, large multifunctional protease 7NM_0103822.141.962.05Histocompatibility 2, class II antigen E βNM_0116461.982.072.03Trypsin 4NM_1392692.051.811.93HRAS-like suppressor 3BC0183652.021.831.93Immunoglobulin heavy chain 1 (serum IgG2a)NM_0136021.562.241.90Metallothionein 1NM_0113152.091.681.89Serum amyloid A 3NM_0112711.921.801.86Ribonuclease 1, pancreaticBC0317581.791.861.83Metallothionein 2NM_0092831.811.841.83STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1BC0243201.522.011.76CEACAM2, CEA-related cell adhesion molecule 2NM_0136531.581.911.75RANTES, small inducible cytokine A5AA8712651.74ND1.74Anti-DNA immunoglobulin light chain IgG antibodyNM_0135421.561.911.73Granzyme BAK0086951.891.561.72TCR β locus from base 1 to 250,611 (section 1 of 3)NM_0136831.691.681.69TAP-2, ATP-binding cassette subfamily B 2NM_0135152.011.331.67Stomatin, erythrocyte protein band 7.2NM_0083301.661.671.66IRG-47, interferon-γ-inducible protein, 47 kDaNM_0097321.931.391.66Arginine vasopressinNM_0100491.581.701.64Dihydrofolate reductaseU685431.811.451.63Immunoglobulin κ chain variable 28 (V28)AK0030611.381.871.62Carboxypeptidase B1 (tissue)NM_1340511.671.551.61Immunoglobulin A heavy chain constant region (Igh-2)NM_0115791.981.221.60TGTP, T-cell-specific GTPaseNM_0098541.531.671.60CD7 antigenBC0183651.761.421.59Immunoglobulin heavy chain 1 (serum IgG2a)U685431.911.221.57Immunoglobulin kappa chain variable 28 (V28)NM_0078451.911.181.54Defensin-related cryptdin, related sequence 10NM_0097351.341.711.53β2-MicroglobulinNM_0107081.671.371.52Lectin, galactose binding, soluble 9NM_0078481.811.191.50Defensin-related cryptdin, related sequence 7NM_0083201.741.271.50ICSBP, interferon-γ consensus sequence-binding proteinM125711.541.461.50hsp68, heat shock protein, 70 kDa 3NM_0095101.531.461.50Villin 2NM_0076311.621.361.49Cyclin D1NM_0334441.511.471.49Chloride intracellular channel 1BC0060261.631.341.49Immunoglobulin-joining chainNM_0242811.551.401.48Ribosome-binding protein 1NM_0188741.541.371.45Pancreatic lipase related protein 1M549961.371.511.44Mouse T-cell receptor active γ-chain Open table in a new tab Table IIDown-regulated genes in the Nhe3−/− small intestineGenBank™Expt. 1Expt. 2AverageGeneAK004861−3.09−1.84−2.30Cytochrome P450, steroid-inducible 3a11NM_008182−2.45−2.09−2.26GlutathioneS-transferase, alpha 2 (Yc2)NM_010357−2.23−1.79−1.99GlutathioneS-transferase, alpha 4AA822040−2.21−1.80−1.98Alcohol dehydrogenase 1, complexNM_010356−2.23−1.73−1.95GlutathioneS-transferase, alpha 3NM_009363−2.12−1.70−1.89TFF2, trefoil factor 2 (spasmolytic protein 1)NM_008615−1.78−2.00−1.89Malic enzyme, supernatantNM_011921−1.80−1.89−1.85Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A7NM_134143−1.78ND−1.78Cytochrome P450, 2c40NM_007895−1.61−1.90−1.74Eosinophil-associated ribonuclease 2NM_010008−2.18−1.42−1.72Cytochrome P450, 2j6AI324412−1.64−1.68−1.66UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, member 5NM_016978−1.55−1.75−1.64Ornithine aminotransferaseNM_013777−1.76−1.46−1.59Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C12NM_010016−1.72−1.43−1.56Decay-accelerating factor 1NM_011996−1.60−1.52−1.56Alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (class II), pi polypeptideNM_010358−1.42−1.67−1.53GlutathioneS-transferase, mu 1NM_013467−1.27−1.88−1.52Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1NM_011978−1.49−1.53−1.51FATP2, fatty acid transporter, member 2NM_010018−1.45−1.55−1.50d-amino acid oxidaseNM_133969−1.85−1.24−1.49Kallikrein B, plasma 1NM_010006−2.10−1.14−1.47Cytochrome P450, 2d9NM_007815−1.77−1.23−1.45Cytochrome P450, 2c29NM_013607−1.27−1.66−1.44Myosin heavy chain 11, smooth muscleNM_011671−1.44ND−1.44Uncoupling protein 2, mitochondrialNM_008830−1.78−1.21−1.44ABCB4, ATP-binding cassette subfamily B4NM_017399−1.67−1.24−1.42l-FABP, fatty acid-binding protein 1, liverNM_021455−1.33−1.50−1.41Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosome region 14 homolog Open table in a new tab Total RNA was extracted from the pooled small intestines of three Nhe3+/+ andNhe3−/− mice using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center). These samples were from a different set of animals than those used for the microarrays. Total RNA (10 μg/sample) was mixed with Glyoxal sample buffer (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME), separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blots were screened using 32P-labeled cDNA probes, all generated from I.M.A.G.E. consortium clones except for Na,K-ATPase α1 (20Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10436-10442Google Scholar), Na,K-ATPase β1(20Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10436-10442Google Scholar), and NKCC1 (mouse codons 427–695) probes. I.M.A.G.E. clones were purchased from IncyteGenomics or the University of Cincinnati Genomics and Microarray Laboratory and were sequence-verified. Quantitation of mRNA levels was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (AmershamBiosciences) using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Gene expression levels were normalized using the L32 ribosomal protein mRNA as a loading control and reported as mean volume-integrated values for replicate samples from four lanes. The Cincinnati Cytokine Capture Assay (an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was used for in vivomeasurement of serum IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 in five pairs of Nhe3−/− andNhe3+/+ mice and of IFN-γ in four pairs ofRomk −/− and Romk +/+mice (21Finkelman F.D. Morris S.C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1811-1818Google Scholar). All mice were housed in a barrier facility until the day of the experiment. Biotin-labeled anti-IFN-γ mAb (R4–6A2), anti-TNF-α mAb (TN3) (Pharmingen), anti-IL-4 mAb (BVC4–1D11), anti-IL-2 mAb (JES6–5H5) (Pharmingen), and anti-IL-6 mAb (Pharmingen) were administered via the lateral tail vein, and mice were housed overnight in a clean facility. Blood was collected 24 h later, and serum cytokine levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (21Finkelman F.D. Morris S.C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1811-1818Google Scholar). LPS stimulation of mice that had been injected with biotinylated antibody was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg of Salmonella enteritidis LPS (Sigma) (22Strassmann G. Patil-Koota V. Finkelman F. Fong M. Kambayashi T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2365-2370Google Scholar, 23Heinzel F.P. Rerko R.M. Ahmed F. Hujer A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4521-4528Google Scholar). Blood was collected 6 h later, and serum cytokine levels were determined. Statistics were performed using Student'st test, and changes were considered significant ifp was <0.05. Whole small intestines and colons were dissected from Nhe3−/− andNhe3+/+ mice, fixed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate (Fisher), dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Paraffin sections were cut at 5 μm. Using a camera lucida, Summagraphics digitizing tablet, and SigmaScan Pro software (Jandel Scientific), the following measurements were recorded. The area of Peyer's patches (μm2) and linear distance of submucosa (μm) was digitized, and plasma cells and inflammation (i.e.neutrophils, eosinophils, and small mononuclear cells) were assessed semiquantitatively on a 0–5+ scale with 5+ being most severe. In these analyses, n refers to the number of mice examined, and all segments of the small and large intestine were analyzed. Data were analyzed using SAS 8e for the PC, using the general linear model. Changes were considered significant if p was <0.05. Total cellular RNA was extracted from small intestine, colon, spleen, and kidneys of three individual mice of each genotype (these were different mice than those used for the microarray and Northern blot analysis) using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center). 5 μg of each RNA sample was converted to cDNA in a total volume of 21 μl, using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). cDNA products were amplified by PCR using the following gene-specific primers: IFN-γ (5′-TGGCTGTTTCTGGCTGTTACTG-3′ and 5′-AATCAGCAGCGACTCCTTTTCC-3′) (24Allen R.D.

Biol. 2000; 22: 34-44Google Scholar). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min and then 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C (IL-1β and β-actin) or 60 °C (IFN-γ, IL-18, IL-12p40, transforming growth factor-β) for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The same cDNA samples used for semiquantitative PCR were also used for real time PCR. Reverse-transcribed cDNA was amplified using gene-specific primers for IFN-γ (5′-TCAAGTGGCATAGATGTGGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-TGGCTCTGCAGGATTTTCATG-3′, 92-base pair product) (28Overbergh L. Valckx D. Waer M. Mathieu C. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 305-312Google Scholar) and IL-1β (5′-ACACTCCTTAGTCCTCGGCCA-3′ and 5′-CCATCAGAGGCAAGGAGGAA-3′, 82-base pair product) (29Wang H. Xu L. Venkatachalam S. Trzaskos J.M. Friedman S.M. Feuerstein G.Z. Wang X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 869-874Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out in a Cepheid Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously (30Seta K.A. Kim R. Kim H.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44405-44412Google Scholar) and contained the following components in a total volume of 25 μl: 1× LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics), 10 pmol of each primer, and 0.05–1 μg of RNA-equivalent cDNA. The annealing temperature was 60 °C for both primer sets, fluorescence was recorded during the 72 °C extension step of each cycle, and threshold cycle values were calculated from the second derivative of the growth curve as described previously (30Seta K.A. Kim R. Kim H.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44405-44412Google Scholar). The line equations of the linear regions for each curve were used to calculate the relative -fold change between Nhe3−/− andNhe3+/+ tissues. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and placed in an anaerobic chamber. The contents of the small intestines were gently squeezed out and weighed in preweighed 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Intestinal contents were diluted in PRAS anaerobic medium (Randolf Biomedical, West Warwick, RI) to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The intestinal suspension was vortexed for several minutes and used for 10-fold serial dilutions in PRAS medium. 50 μl of each dilution was spread onto a plate and grown anaerobically. Bacteria were cultured on Brucella blood agar (Anaerobe Systems, Morgan Hill, CA) and egg yolk agar (Anaerobe Systems), both enriched nonselective media, to obtain the total number of bacteria/g of intestinal contents. Bacteria were also cultured onBacteroides bile esculin agar and cycloserine-cefoxitin fructose agar (Anaerobe Systems) for the isolation and identification of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile, respectively. All plates were cultured at 37 °C for 24–48 h under anaerobic conditions, until distinct colonies were formed. The average number of colonies/g of intestinal contents ± S.E. for three pairs of mice was calculated. cDNA microarray analyses of mRNAs fromNhe3−/− and Nhe3+/+small intestines were performed to identify differentially regulated genes. The GEM2 microarrays contained 10,200 elements (IncyteGenomics). In each of the three competitive hybridization experiments, a number of elements did not meet the appropriate hybridization criteria. These elements were excluded, leaving 8234, 8044, and 9257 elements that passed all criteria in experiments 1A, 1B, and 2, respectively. All elements that changed an average of 1.4-fold or greater in experiments 1 and 2 were identified, resulting in 53 known genes that were up-regulated (Table I) and 28 known genes that were down-regulated (Table II). As discussed in more detail below, expression levels of 16 differentially expressed genes were examined by Northern blot analyses of a third set of pooled RNA samples. We included two genes that were just below our cut-off of 1.4 (CFTR, −1.30; trefoil factor 1, −1.32) and one gene, small proline-rich protein 2a, which was identified as up-regulated in experiments 1A and 1B but down-regulated in experiment 2. The latter gene has no known function in the intestine but has been implicated in barrier function in squamous epithelium (31Cabral A. Voskamp P. Cleton-Jansen A.M. South A. Nizetic D. Backendorf C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19231-19237Google Scholar) and was identified as up-regulated in anNhe3−/− small intestine subtraction/suppression library. 2A. L. Woo and G. E. Shull, unpublished observation. The Northern blot data (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) confirmed the microarray data for all but one of the genes. For metallothionein I, the microarrays detected a 1.90-fold up-regulation inNhe3−/− small intestines, whereas Northern blots revealed only a 1.1-fold increase (Fig. 1). These experiments show that there is a good correlation between the microarray and Northern blot data, although the Northern blots tended to yield higher levels of induction or repression.Figure 3Northern blot analysis of IFN-γ-inducible GTPases in theNhe3 −/− and Nhe3+/+ small intestine.

https://openalex.org/W2322880228,"PAPIN has six PDZ domains and interacts with p0071, a catenin-related protein. Recent studies have revealed that catenins determine the subcellular localization of some PDZ proteins. We have examined whether the localization of PAPIN is determined by p0071 in epithelial cells. PAPIN was localized not only on the lateral membrane but also on the apical membrane, where p0071 was absent. The targeting to both membranes was mediated by the middle region of PAPIN and did not require the p0071-interacting PDZ domain. In cells that came into contact, PAPIN was diffusely distributed on the plasma membrane, while p0071 was concentrated at immature cell–cell contacts. When epithelial cells were exposed to the low concentration of calcium, p0071 was internalized, whereas PAPIN remained on the plasma membrane. We also confirmed that the interaction with p0071 was not essential for the membrane targeting of ERBIN, a recently identified p0071- and ErbB2-binding protein. PAPIN, p0071, and ERBIN formed a complex in 293T cells. Furthermore, ERBIN and ErbB2 were colocalized with PAPIN on the lateral membrane. These findings suggest that PAPIN, p0071, and ERBIN come to the cell–cell contacts independently and interact with each other on the lateral membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2068081315,"Analyses of five wild-type p53 containing cell lines revealed lineage specific differences in phosphorylation of Thr18 after treatment with ionizing (IR) or ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Importantly, Thr18 phosphorylation correlated with induction of the p53 downstream targets p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21) and Mdm-2, suggesting a transactivation enhancing role. Thr18 phosphorylation has been shown to abolish side-chain hydrogen bonding between Thr18 and Asp21, an interaction necessary for stabilizing alpha–helical conformation within the transactivation domain. Mutagenesis-derived hydrogen bond disruption attenuated the interaction of p53 with the transactivation repressor Mdm-2 but had no direct effect on the interaction of p53 with the basal transcription factor TAFII31. However, prior incubation of p53 mutants with Mdm-2 modulated TAFII31 interaction with p53, suggesting Mdm-2 blocks the accessibility of p53 to TAFII31. Consistently, p53-null cells transfected with hydrogen bond disrupting p53 mutants demonstrated enhanced endogenous p21 expression, whereas p53/Mdm-2-double null cells exhibited no discernible differences in p21 expression. We conclude disruption of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between Thr18 and Asp21 enhances p53 transactivation by modulating Mdm-2 binding, facilitating TAFII31 recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W1976166089,"Although it is clear that p53 plays a pivotal role in G1/G2 checkpoints to conserve genomic integrity, its role in S phase checkpoint is less well understood. Recently, it has been reported that p53 is transcriptionally impaired even though it is stabilized during replication blockade. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not known. In the present study, it has been shown that p53 accumulates and transactivates its target genes such as p21, gadd45 and bax in response to replication blockade in normal and cancer cells. Lack of transcriptional activation under similar conditions in cells lacking p53 shows that p53-target gene activation during replication blockade is indeed p53-dependent. Further, transactivation of p21 in response to replication blockade by hydroxyurea and aphidicolin is similar to that in response to ionizing radiation except that the latter is more immediate compared to the response to replication blockade. These findings suggest that impairment of transcriptionally active p53 in response to replication blockade is not a general phenomenon."

No effect was observed in SAPK pathways (p38MAPK and JNK), but E1a was able to affect the Akt activation mediated by insulin. This result was confirmed by transient transfection experiments performed in Cos-7 cells and also observed in other transformed cell lines such as A431. Furthermore, E1a expression induces a decrease in the basal status of Akt activity. Finally we demonstrated that E1a is able to block the Akt activation mediated by cisplatin and correlates with a sensitive phenotype. In summary, our data demonstrate that specific inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway mediates some of the biological properties of E1a such as induction of chemosensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1971959894,"Replication factor C (RFC) catalyzes assembly of circular proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamps around primed DNA, enabling processive synthesis by DNA polymerase during DNA replication and repair. In order to perform this function efficiently, RFC must rapidly recognize primed DNA as the substrate for clamp assembly, particularly during lagging strand synthesis. Earlier reports as well as quantitative DNA binding experiments from this study indicate, however, that RFC interacts with primer-template as well as single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively) with similar high affinity (apparent K d ≈ 10 nm). How then can RFC distinguish primed DNA sites from excess ssDNA and dsDNA at the replication fork? Further analysis reveals that despite its high affinity for various DNA structures, RFC selects primer-template DNA even in the presence of a 50-fold excess of ssDNA and dsDNA. The interaction between ssDNA or dsDNA and RFC is far less stable than between primed DNA and RFC (k off > 0.2 s−1 versus 0.025 s−1, respectively). We propose that the ability to rapidly bind and release single- and double-stranded DNA coupled with selective, stable binding to primer-template DNA allows RFC to scan DNA efficiently for primed sites where it can pause to initiate clamp assembly.

Replicative DNA polymerases synthesize DNA with high processivity in collaboration with two key accessory proteins: a circular clamp and a clamp loader complex (see Fig. 1; reviewed in Refs. 1Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Google Scholar and 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Google Scholar). These accessory proteins are conserved in structure and function among a variety of organisms including bacteriophage (e.g. T4 gp45 clamp and gp44/62 clamp loader), bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli β clamp and γ complex clamp loader), archaebacteria (e.g. Pyrococcus furiosusproliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; Pol, polymerase; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); DTT, dithiothreitol; SSB, single-stranded binding protein; nt, nucleotide clamp and replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader), and eukaryotes such asSaccharomyces cerevisiae and humans (PCNA and RFC) as well (see Ref. 3Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-224Google Scholar for a review of recent crystal structures). Clamps are ring-shaped multisubunit proteins with an inner diameter of ∼35 Å that is large enough to encircle duplex DNA (e.g.homotrimeric PCNA) (4Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Google Scholar). When bound to polymerase and DNA, the clamp forms a sliding tether that stabilizes polymerase on the primer-template and facilitates processive DNA replication (5Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Google Scholar). A polymerase-clamp complex, such as S. cerevisiae Pol δ·PCNA, can extend DNA with a processivity of hundreds of nucleotides per template binding event, a substantial increase from the 6–12-nucleotide processivity of Pol δ alone (6Bauer G.A. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7506-7510Google Scholar, 7Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Google Scholar). The circular clamp is opened and assembled around primer-template DNA by the clamp loader, a multiprotein machine whose action is fueled by ATP binding and hydrolysis. Clamps must be present at primed DNA sites for polymerase to bind them and initiate processive DNA synthesis (7Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Google Scholar,8O'Donnell M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Google Scholar). Efficient clamp assembly is particularly important during lagging DNA synthesis when a clamp is required at the initiation of every Okazaki fragment (Fig. 1). Given an estimated Okazaki fragment size of 100–200 nucleotides in eukaryotes and a Pol δ·PCNA-catalyzed DNA synthesis rate of ∼100 nucleotides/s, clamp assembly is required once every 1 or 2 s during lagging strand synthesis (7Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Google Scholar). The replicative polymerase, Pol III holoenzyme, from the well examinedE. coli model system has a similar requirement for timely clamp assembly as it completes a 1000–2000-nucleotide Okazaki fragment every 1–2 s (reviewed in Ref. 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Google Scholar). Thus, clamp loaders have to rapidly recognize primed sites on template DNA and assemble clamps on them for efficient initiation and completion of DNA replication. The S. cerevisiae clamp loader, RFC, is composed of five proteins: RFC1 (95 kDa), RFC2 (40 kDa), RFC3 (38 kDa), RFC4 (36 kDa), and RFC5 (40 kDa). All five proteins are essential for viability according to deletion analysis (9Li X. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21880-21884Google Scholar, 10Li X. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

McAlear M.A. Rose D. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 255-267Google Scholar, 13Gary S.L. Burgers M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4986-4991Google Scholar, 14Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 15Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216Google Scholar). The five proteins share sequence homology among each other and with clamp loader proteins from other organisms (e.g. γ and δ′ proteins ofE. coli γ complex and gp44 protein of bacteriophage T4 gp44/62; reviewed in Refs. 14Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Google Scholar and 16Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Google Scholar). Human RFC is very similar to theS. cerevisiae RFC complex, with one large subunit (p140) and four small subunits (p37, p36, p40, and p38) that correspond to RFC1, -2, -3, -4, and -5, respectively (15Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216Google Scholar). The homology occurs chiefly in seven regions, RFC boxes II–VIII, of which boxes III and V have the most well defined function as ATP-binding Walker A and B motifs, respectively. The large RFC1 subunit contains an additional box I at the amino terminus, which shares homology with DNA ligases and is known to bind DNA but appears unnecessary for clamp loading (17Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11014-11018Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of the E. coli γ complex clamp loader, γ3δδ′ (18Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Google Scholar, 19Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Google Scholar), and the small RFC subunit from archaebacterium P. furiosus (20Oyama T. Ishino Y. Cann I.K. Ishino S. Morikawa K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 455-463Google Scholar) reveal striking structural similarities as well among clamp loaders from different organisms. Each subunit is composed of three domains, a helical carboxyl-terminal domain III and amino-terminal domains I and II, connected by flexible linker regions. The complete E. coliγ3δδ′ clamp loader structure reveals five subunits arranged in a circle that is closed by interactions among the C-terminal domains but open at the N-terminal domains (the RFC sketch in Fig. 1 is modeled after the γ3δδ′ structure). The δ subunit contains a clamp-binding element in N-terminal domain I that contacts a hydrophobic pocket on the clamp and triggers clamp opening. The crystal structure of a δ·β clamp complex indicates that the clamp fits “flat” up against the clamp loader with its C-terminal face adjacent to the N-terminal face of the clamp loader (3Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-224Google Scholar,21O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a sketch of RFC·PCNA derived from the proposed γ3δδ′·β complex structure. Presumably, the primer-template DNA enters the circular clamp through the open interface; however, it is not clear where or how the clamp loader binds DNA to facilitate interaction between the clamp and DNA. The P. furiosus small RFC subunit has the same overall fold as the E. coli γ complex subunits (20Oyama T. Ishino Y. Cann I.K. Ishino S. Morikawa K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 455-463Google Scholar), and electron microscopic images of the human RFC complex (22Shiomi Y. Usukura J. Masamura Y. Takeyasu K. Nakayama Y. Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14127-14132Google Scholar) and archaeal small RFC subunit (23Mayanagi K. Miyata T. Oyama T. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 35-45Google Scholar) show the subunits in a circular arrangement, indicating that the eukaryotic/archaeal clamp loaders adopt a similar quaternary structure as the bacterial clamp loader and may therefore employ similar mechanisms of action. The mechanism of clamp assembly has been examined to varying degrees of detail for E. coli, phage T4, and human/ S. cerevisiae clamp loaders. In the E. coli γ complex, ATP binding to the γ subunits induces a change in conformation that exposes δ, allowing it to bind and open the β clamp (24Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Google Scholar, 25Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Google Scholar). A recent study of the interactions between γ complex and its substrates indicates that the clamp loader binds β and then primer-template DNA with high affinity, and DNA binding specifically triggers ATP hydrolysis and release of β linked topologically to DNA (26Ason B. Bertram J.G. Hingorani M.M. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3006-3015Google Scholar). Notably, the γ complex also binds single-stranded DNA with high affinity in the presence or absence of the clamp (26Ason B. Bertram J.G. Hingorani M.M. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3006-3015Google Scholar), raising questions about how the clamp loader recognizes primed DNA but not ssDNA as the substrate for clamp assembly. In the case of bacteriophage T4 clamp loader, gp44/62, the proposed clamp loading mechanism includes ATP binding to the four gp44 subunits in the complex, followed by interaction between gp44/62 and gp45 clamp, hydrolysis of two ATP molecules, interaction with DNA, hydrolysis of the remaining two ATP, and finally release of the clamp·DNA complex (27Sexton D.J. Kaboord B.F. Berdis A.J. Carver T.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7749-7756Google Scholar). A more recent study suggests that only one ATP molecule is hydrolyzed during gp45 assembly on DNA; thus, the precise mechanism of how gp44/62 couples ATP binding and hydrolysis to clamp assembly on DNA is not yet clear (28Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 869-891Google Scholar). Additionally, there is not enough information available on the interaction between gp44/62 and different DNA structures to clarify how the clamp loader selects primer-template DNA as the site for clamp assembly. In the case of eukaryotic clamp loaders, questions about DNA selection are even more pertinent, given the numerous reports of human/S. cerevisiae RFC binding to double-stranded DNA (29Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hubscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Google Scholar, 30Burbelo P.D. Utani A. Pan Z.Q. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3877-3882Google Scholar), and single-stranded DNA (33Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Google Scholar, 36Keller R.C. Mossi R. Maga G.

These results suggest a relatively low specificity of RFC binding to primer-template DNA, and since the concentration of primed sites is expected to be much lower than that of single- and double-stranded regions in replicating DNA, how does the clamp loader rapidly recognize a primed DNA site for clamp assembly? An early footprinting experiment with S. cerevisiae RFC and a hairpin DNA substrate with a 3′ recessed end demonstrated convincingly that the clamp loader binds at the primer-template junction (33Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Google Scholar), but the same study also found that RFC binds ssDNA and to some extent dsDNA as well (gel mobility shift experiments). The addition of single-stranded binding protein, RPA, to the reaction reduced the interaction between an RFC·PCNA complex and ssDNA (33Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Google Scholar). A more recent examination of RFC-DNA interaction by surface plasmon resonance revealed similar inhibition of RFC binding to ssDNA by RPA (38Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34768-34775Google Scholar). However, the extent of RPA binding to single-stranded template DNA during replication in vivo is not known, and it may not be sufficient to facilitate highly specific interaction between RFC and primer-template DNA. Other studies have shown that RFC binds dsDNA and that its ATPase activity is stimulated by dsDNA (31Fotedar R. Mossi R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Maga G. Brickner H. Messier H. Kasibhatla S. Hubscher U. Fotedar A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4423-4433Google Scholar, 39Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Google Scholar), although this result is contradicted by reports that RFC binding to the 3′ primer-template junction is not competed by dsDNA and that the large subunit of RFC in fact binds ssDNA (37Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA binding activity of human and Drosophila melanogaster RFC has also been observed by electron microscopy, and in this study RFC appeared to have no preference for 3′ or 5′ primer-template junctions (36Keller R.C. Mossi R. Maga G. Wellinger R.E. Hubscher U. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3433-3437Google Scholar). Given the variety of DNAs and techniques utilized by different research groups to examine RFC·DNA complexes, a study of the literature does not yield adequate data for a quantitative comparison of clamp loader interactions with different DNA structures. Thus, the question of how RFC selects only primed DNA for clamp assembly although it apparently binds single- and double-stranded DNA remains to be answered. Efficient assembly and function of a DNA replicase depends to a large extent on the ability of replication proteins to correctly and rapidly recognize DNA structures relevant to their activity. Here we have addressed the question of how the RFC clamp loader distinguishes between binding to primed DNA and single- or double-stranded DNA during PCNA clamp assembly. A quantitative analysis reveals that RFC binds all three DNA structures with high affinity and yet selects primed DNA almost exclusively in the presence of excess single- or double-stranded DNA, possibly via a primed DNA-specific change in its conformation/activity that is integral to the clamp assembly mechanism. Overexpression and purification of the complete five-subunit S. cerevisiae RFC complex, as well as truncated RFC complex (RFC1:Δ2–283) and PCNA (gifts from Dr. Mike O'Donnell, Rockefeller University, New York) are described here briefly; the detailed procedure will be published elsewhere. 2M. O'Donnell, manuscript in preparation. Genes for all five RFC subunits, RFC1, -2, -3, -4, and -5, were cloned from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA into a single pET vector, each under the control of a T7 promoter. The proteins were overexpressed in E. coli cells that also produced tRNAs for arginine, isoleucine, and leucine to correct for codon bias and purified by ion exchange chromatography over Q Sepharose and SP Sepharose columns. PCNA was cloned similarly into a pET vector, except with an amino-terminal His tag and cAMP-dependent protein kinase tag, which allowed single-step purification by nickel column chromatography and32P labeling of PCNA, respectively. E. coli SSB was a gift from Dr. Mike O'Donnell (40Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay and by absorbance at 280 nm in 6m guanidinium hydrochloride, using calculated extinction coefficients: RFC, 163520; trRFC, 162120; PCNA, 5600. Trypsin was purchased from Sigma, and T4 polynucleotide kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (5′–3′ exonuclease mutant) was a gift from Dr. Smita Patel (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Jersey). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences are as follows: 30-mer, 5′-CTG GTA ATA TCC AGA ACA ATA TTA CCG CCA-3′; 30A-mer, 30-mer plus 3′ A; 30cmpT, 5′-T TGG CGG TAA TAT TGT TCT GGA TAT TAC CAG-3′; 81-mer, 5′-GAG CGT TTT TTC CTG TTG CAA ACG ATT GGC GGT AAT ATT GTT CTG GAT ATT ACC AGC AAG GCC GAT AGT TTG AGT TCT TCT-3′; 56-mer, 5′-GAG CGT TTT TTC CTG TTG CAA ACG ATT GGC GGT AAT ATT GTT CTG GAT ATT ACC AG-3′; 56-mer-5p, 5′-TTG GCG GTA ATA TTG TTC TGG ATA TTA CCA GCA AGG CCG ATA GTT TGA GTT CTT CT-3′. Primer-template and duplex DNAs were prepared by mixing 30-mer or 30A-mer with the requisite complementary strand at a ratio of 1.1:1, respectively, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, followed by heating to 95 °C (2 min) and slow cooling for >6 h. Single-stranded M13 mp18 ssDNA was purified and annealed with a 30-nucleotide primer as described (41Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Google Scholar). ATP and ATPγS were purchased from Sigma; [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nitrocellulose membranes and PEI-cellulose TLC plates were purchased from Schleicher and Schuell and EM Science, respectively. The buffers are as follows: buffer H, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol; gel filtration buffer, buffer H plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl; protease buffer, buffer H plus 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT; T7 Pol buffer, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; SDS gel-loading buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol. PCNA (2 μm) was labeled at an N-terminal kinase recognition site in a 100-μl reaction with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 50 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in NEB kinase buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by filtration through Centricon-10 (Millipore Corp.). In the loading reaction, 0.03 μm32P-PCNA was mixed with 0.03 μm DNA (primed or unprimed M13mp18 ssDNA coated with 8.5 μm SSB or duplex pBluescript plasmid) and 0.5 mm ATP in 60 μl of gel filtration buffer. The reaction was initiated with 0.02 μm RFC or trRFC (RFC1:Δ2–283), incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and then filtered over a 5-ml Bio-Gel A-15m column equilibrated in gel filtration buffer. 200-μl fractions were collected, and aliquots were quantitated by scintillation counting. The DNA used in nitrocellulose membrane binding assays was 32P-labeled as follows: 0.05 μm annealed 30-mer/30cmpT was incubated in a 100-μl reaction with 10 μCi of [α-32P]dATP and 0.2 μm T7 DNA polymerase (premixed with a 5-fold molar excess of thioredoxin and 30 mm freshly prepared DTT) in T7 Pol buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Next, 100 μm dATP was added to the reaction, and after 5 min the reaction was quenched with 30 mm EDTA and 5 min at 90 °C. The DNA was separated from free nucleotide by spinning through a Bio-Gel P-30 column (Bio-Rad). The radiolabeled 3032P-A-mer/30cmpT DNA (0.03 μm) was mixed with appropriate unlabeled DNAs to prepare 30 μm stocks of single-stranded 30A-mer, primer-templates 30A-mer/81-mer, 30A-mer/56-mer (3′ primer-junction), and 30A-mer/56-mer-5p (5′ primer-junction) as well as duplex 30A-mer/30cmpT DNA, as described above. The stoichiometry of interaction between RFC and primer-template DNA was measured by nitrocellulose membrane binding assays in which a constant amount of 32P-labeled DNA was titrated with increasing concentrations of RFC. Nitrocellulose membranes were pretreated with 0.5 n NaOH for 2 min and then washed thoroughly with H2O and equilibrated in buffer H. The reactions (15-μl total volume) containing 0.5 μm32P-DNA and 0–3 μm RFC in buffer H were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, and 10-μl aliquots were filtered through the membrane in a dot-blot assembly (Schleicher and Schuell). The membrane was washed before and after filtration with 120 μl of buffer H. 1-μl aliquots were spotted onto a separate membrane to measure the total DNA in the reaction. Radioactivity on the membrane was quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and the molar amount of DNA bound to RFC was determined and plottedversus RFC concentration. Experiments measuring equilibrium dissociation constants for the RFC-DNA interaction were performed similarly except with a constant amount of RFC (0.016 μm) or trRFC (0.016 μm) and increasing 32P-DNA (0–0.6 μm) in buffer H in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm ATPγS or ADP; the effect of PCNA on RFC-DNA interaction was measured in similar experiments with 1 mmATPγS and 1 μm PCNA. The molar amount of DNA bound to RFC was plotted versus DNA concentration. The binding isotherms were fit to a quadratic equation to determine the apparent dissociation constant for the interaction,[D⋅R]=0.5{Kd+[Dt]+[Rt]−[(Kd+[Dt]+[Rt])2−4[Dt]]1/2}Equation 1 where D·R represents the amount of DNA bound to RFC, D t and R t are total DNA and RFC concentrations, respectively, and K d is the dissociation constant. Competitive DNA binding assays were performed by mixing 0.02 μm32P-labeled substrate DNA with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor DNA (0–1 μm) in buffer H (15-μl total volume), followed by the addition of 0.016 μm RFC and filtration through a nitrocellulose membrane after 10 min at 25 °C, as described above; complementary assays were performed with 0.02 μm unlabeled substrate and 0–1 μm labeled competitor. The amount of DNA substrate bound to RFC was plotted versus competitor DNA concentration, and the data were fit to a hyperbola to determine K12, the competitor concentration at which half of the substrate remains bound to RFC. The rate of dissociation of DNA from RFC was measured by incubating 0.016 μm RFC with 0.02 μm32P-DNA substrate in buffer H for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by the addition of 1 μm unlabeled competitor DNA. At various times, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane as described above (32P-DNA bound to RFC at time 0 was measured in the absence of competitor). The molar amount of DNA bound to RFC was plottedversus time, and the data were fit to a single exponential function to yield the dissociation rate,k off.[D·R]=Rt[exp(−kofft)]Equation 2 Tryptic digestion of RFC was performed at both high and low NaCl concentrations, in the absence and in the presence of various DNA substrates. The 65-μl reaction contained 2 μm RFC and either no DNA or 3 μm DNA in protease buffer at 100 or 30 mm final NaCl concentration. The digest was initiated by the addition of trypsin to a final concentration of 0.4 ng/μl in the reaction and incubation at 37 °C. At varying times (0–15 min), 10-μl aliquots of the reaction were quenched with 10 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer and heated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to analysis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The proteolytic products were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Steady-state ATPase activity of RFC was assayed by monitoring hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP plus Pi. 0.2 μmRFC was mixed with 1 mm ATP plus [α-32P]ATP, 1 μm PCNA, and 1 μm DNA (when in the reaction) in buffer H plus 0–400 mm NaCl at 25 °C. At varying times, 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn, quenched with 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and analyzed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography in 0.6m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.4. The molar amount of [α-32P]ADP formed was quantitated on a PhosphorImager and plotted versus reaction time to yield the ATPase rate constants (k cat), which were then plotted versus NaCl concentration. Rapid assembly of clamps at primed DNA sites is important to expedite genomic DNA replication, since clamps are essential for processive DNA polymerase activity. In eukaryotes, the RFC clamp loader loads PCNA clamps onto DNA in a reaction fueled by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In an earlier study, RFC was observed to footprint a 3′ primer-template junction, which suggested that the clamp loader specifically recognizes this DNA structure as the site for clamp assembly (33Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Google Scholar). However, the same report as well as other studies of clamp loaders from S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, mice, and humans indicate that RFC binds single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA as well (reviewed in Ref.15Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216Google Scholar). How can RFC distinguish a primed DNA site as the target for clamp assembly from the background of single- and double-stranded DNA at the replication fork? The experiments described below address this question by quantitatively analyzing the interactions between RFC and various DNA substrates. Previous reports on overexpression and purification of S. cerevisiae RFC fromE. coli indicated that the RFC subunits are insoluble when expressed individually. However, when genes for the small RFC subunits were co-expressed on a single plasmid in S. cerevisiae, a soluble complex was detectable (42Burgers P.M. Methods. 1999; 18: 349-355Google Scholar). More recently, a truncated version of the RFC complex with 273 amino acids deleted (of 861 total) from the amino terminus of the RFC1 subunit has been expressed and purified fromE. coli (43Gomes X.V. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Google Scholar). This truncated version of RFC is active in catalyzing PCNA clamp assembly on DNA; however, it is not yet known whether all of its properties are identical to those of the wild-type RFC clamp loader. We have purified the full-length, wild-type RFC complex from E. coli with a yield of close to 7 mg of pure protein/liter of cells. Fig.2 A shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of the RFC complex, which has all five subunits present in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. (The cloning and purification strategies will be described in detail elsewhere.)2 The clamp loading activity of recombinant RFC was examined by measuring the assembly of 32P-labeled PCNA onto circular DNA (Fig. 2 B). When incubated with singly primed, circular M13mp18 ssDNA coated with SSB, RFC loads the clamp onto DNA in the presence of ATP. The large PCNA·DNA complex elutes early from a gel filtration column (fractions 7–12), whereas free PCNA elutes later (fractions 14–25). The reaction is absolutely dependent on the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 B) and RFC (data not shown), since no PCNA loading is evident in the absence of either of these reactants. Furthermore, RFC does not load PCNA on ssDNA in the absence of a primer, whether the DNA is coated with SS"

We constructed BAG-1 full length and deletion mutated plasmids in a pCR3.1 vector and established stable transfections of BAG-1 isoforms in low BAG-1 expressing C33A cells. Treatment of the transfected cells with cisplatin, staurosporine, paclitaxel and doxorubicine showed that BAG-1 p50, p46 and p33 isoforms enhanced the resistance to apoptosis. BAG-1 p50, p46 and p33 exhibited different degrees of apoptosis inhibition in the transfected cells and BAG-1 p46 isoform had the most pronounced effect on anti-apoptosis. BAG-1 p29 failed to protect the transfected cells from apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis by BAG-1 isoforms was correlated with decreased caspase-3 activation. We also detected the expression of Bax, Bak, p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), AIF and MRP1 by Western blots. Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly increased in p50, p46 and p33 transfected cells, while the expression of Bax, Bak, p53, Bcl-X(L) and MRP1 was essentially unchanged. These in vitro results suggest that distinct isoforms of BAG-1 have different anti-apoptotic functions and their functions may be correlated to increased Bcl-2 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2324380049,"The ability to identify prostate tumor or prostate tissue specific genes that are expressed at high levels and use their protein products as targets could greatly aid in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based subtraction technique, we have recovered the recently described KLK4 (prostase) gene from human prostate cDNA. In this study, KLK4 gene expression in human prostate tumors was further characterized using cDNA quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry, demonstrating that the gene is specifically expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in normal human prostate tissue, and in both primary and metastatic prostate tumor samples. Quantitative mRNA analysis also demonstrated low level expression including adrenal gland, salivary gland and thyroid. Finally, it was demonstrated that prostate cancer patient sera contain antibodies that bind specifically to recombinant KLK4 protein. This antibody has been used to detect KLK4-specific peptides in epitope mapping experiments. The relatively specific expression profile and elevated level of KLK4 mRNA and protein in both tumor and normal prostate tissues, in addition to detectable KLK4-specific antibody in cancer patient sera, supports additional efforts to determine if KLK4 can play a role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the monitoring of residual disease, or act as a target for immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1966226976,"Genetic analysis of beta-catenin-induced oncogenic transformation in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) revealed the following prerequisites for oncogenicity: (1) removal of the N terminal phosphorylation sites targeted by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), (2) retention of the N terminal transactivation domain, and (3) retention of the armadillo repeats. The C terminal transactivation domain played an ancillary role in the transformation of CEF. There was a rough correlation between the transforming activity of various beta-catenin constructs and their transactivation of the TOPFLASH reporter. Expression levels of the candidate target genes of beta-catenin-LEF, cyclin D1 and myc were not correlated with each other or with the transforming activity of beta-catenin constructs. A new target gene, coding for inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IP6K2) was identified. Its expression showed concordance with the transforming activity of beta-catenin constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1969330171,"Cytoplasmic tails of LIMPII and the invariant chain contain similar leucine-based sorting signals, but the invariant chain interacts only with AP1 and AP2, whereas LIMPII interacts strongly with AP3. In a series of in vitro experiments, we investigated the effect of residues upstream of the leucine pairs and demonstrated that these residues determine adapter binding, and certain residues favor interactions with AP3. Furthermore, constructs that interacted stronger with AP3 interacted weakly with AP1 and vice versa. Exchanging residues upstream of the leucine-based signal in LIMPII with those of the invariant chain reduced LIMPII binding to AP3 in vitro, and in vivo the corresponding LIMPII mutant was rerouted via the plasma membrane like the invariant chain. These preferential interactions of different leucine signals with different AP complexes may thus be the determining step sorting proteins from the trans-Golgi network to their final destinations. Proteins that interact with AP3 are sorted directly to endosomes/lysosomes, whereas proteins that interact with AP1 are sorted via a different route. At the same time, constructs that exhibited specificity for either AP1 or AP3 might still interact with AP2, suggesting that AP2 may recognize a wider variety of leucine signals. This is consistent with the suggested role of AP2 in internalization of proteins containing general leucine-based signals, including proteins that have been missorted to the plasma membrane.

The adaptor protein complexes (APs) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, adaptor protein complex; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Ii, invariant chain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; MDCK cells, Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells; TGN, trans-Golgi network; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LIMPII, lysosomal integral membrane protein II AP1, AP2, AP3, and AP4 are important components of the intracellular sorting machinery. They associate with transport vesicles along the secretory and endocytic pathways and can interact with membrane proteins that contain signals for sorting into the appropriate transport vesicles (1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Google Scholar, 2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Google Scholar). Each AP contains four polypeptides, called adaptins: two large chains of ∼100 kDa, a medium chain of ∼50 kDa, and a small chain of ∼25 kDa. AP1 complexes are associated with transport clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) derived from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), AP2 complexes are associated with the endocytic CCVs, whereas the functional localization of AP3 and AP4 is not clear yet. It seems, however, that AP3 mediates sorting to lysosomes and related organelles and mediates sorting on endosomes, whereas AP4 has been implicated in basolateral sorting (3Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Google Scholar, 4Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 423-432Google Scholar, 5Simmen T. Honing S. Icking A. Tikkanen R. Hunziker W.

Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7278-7285Google Scholar). Two best characterized types of protein-sorting signals are tyrosine- and leucine-based sorting signals (see Refs. 2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Google Scholar, 3Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Google Scholar, and 10Sandoval I. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-296Google Scholar). It is believed that interactions between sorting signals and AP complexes is one of the determining steps in protein sorting, namely the sequestration of cargo membrane proteins into a specific type of transport vesicle for delivery to its intermediate or final destination. Interactions between various sorting signals and AP complexes have been demonstrated in a variety of experimental systems (reviewed in Refs. 1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Google Scholar and 11Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 699-727Google Scholar). All APs seem to recognize tyrosine-sorting signals via their respective medium chain, are associated with specific populations of transport vesicles, and confer distinct sorting properties onto these vesicles (1Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Google Scholar, 3Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Google Scholar). Interactions between AP complexes and leucine signals were studied less extensively, and different AP subunits have been reported to interact with leucine signals. Kirchhausen and co-workers (12Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Google Scholar) has reported interactions between several leucine signals and a large (β1) chain of the AP1 complex in a cross-linking assay. In our laboratories interactions between leucine signals and medium chains of AP1 and AP2 were observed in phage-display assays (13Bremnes T. Lauvrak V. Lindqvist B. Bakke O. Immunotechnology. 1998; 4: 21-28Google Scholar), in protein-protein interaction assays on magnetic beads (14Rodionov D.G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6005-6008Google Scholar), and in surface plasmon resonance assays (15Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Google Scholar). Two molecules containing leucine-sorting signals are of particular interest for this study: the invariant chain (Ii) and lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMPII). Ii is a type II transmembrane protein associated with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is believed that Ii has a multitude of functions that aid MHC class II in antigen presentation. Two of the main functions are to prevent endogenous polypeptides from binding to the MHC class II groove and mediate the sorting of the MHC class II to the endosomes either directly or via the plasma membrane (16Cresswell P. Cell. 1996; 84: 505-507Google Scholar, 17Germain R.N. Castellino F. Han R. Reis E.S. Romagnoli P. Sadegh-Nasseri S. Zhong G.M. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 151: 5-30Google Scholar, 18Bakke O. Nordeng T.W. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 171-187Google Scholar). Ii carries two leucine-sorting signals within its cytoplasmic tail, the membrane-distal signal (LI residues in positions 7 and 8), and the membrane-proximal signal (ML residues at positions 16 and 17). Ii is sorted to endosomes via the plasma membrane, and either signal is independently sufficient for endosomal localization of Ii (19Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Google Scholar, 20Kang S. Liang L. Parker C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20644-20652Google Scholar). LIMPII is a type III transmembrane protein, and has one leucine signal in its 20-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. This signal is necessary and sufficient for direct sorting of LIMPII to endosomes/lysosomes (10Sandoval I. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-296Google Scholar,21Vega M.A. Rodriguez F. Segui B. Cales C. Alcalde J. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16269-16272Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that sorting signals from Ii interactin vitro with AP1 and AP2, but not to AP3, which is consistent with the in vivo sorting of Ii to endosomes indirectly via the plasma membrane (15Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Google Scholar). On the other hand, the LI-motif of LIMPII preferentially binds to AP3 and in addition to thisin vitro observation, LIMPII is known to be sorted to endosomes/lysosomes via a direct transport route. which does not include appearance at the cell surface (10Sandoval I. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-296Google Scholar, 21Vega M.A. Rodriguez F. Segui B. Cales C. Alcalde J. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16269-16272Google Scholar). Because leucine-based motifs of Ii and LIMPII appear to be remarkably similar to each other (leucine pair and double acidic residues in the positions −4 and −5), we investigated the influence of nearby residues on the specificity of interactions between those signals and AP1, AP2, and AP3. We constructed a set of GST fusion proteins containing various chimeric Ii-LIMPII constructs, which were then tested for adaptor binding by surface plasmon resonance. To corroborate our in vitroobservations, we also analyzed the intracellular fate of the wild type LIMPII and LIMPII with the invariant chain signal, transfected into MDCK cells. For the in vitro studies, the cytoplasmic tails of the wild type Ii (Met 1 to Arg30) and its various mutants and wild type LIMPII (Gly460 to Thr478) and its various mutants (see Fig. 1) were made by PCR from the cytoplasmic tail of both of the proteins. They were then fused in-frame to the C terminus of the GST protein using BamHI and EcoRI sites in pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). For the in vivo studies, we received a full-length LIMPII cDNA from I. Sandoval (Madrid), and the construct was subcloned into pMEP4 vector to utilize its inducible promoter and stably transfected into MDCK cells. A LIMPII QRD mutant was constructed by PCR mutagenesis using full-length LIMPII as the template and the primer set, GCT TAG ACG CTA GCG ATG GCC CGA (upper primer) and CCA TTA AAT TGC GGC CGC TTA GGT TCG TAT GAG GTC TCG TTG TTC ATC TGC AGT (lower primer). The PCR product was then subcloned into pMEP4 using NheI and NotI sites and stably transfected into MDCK cells. The mouse monoclonal antibody 29G10 (a kind gift from Dr. I. Sandoval, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) was used to detect LIMPII as described elsewhere (23Barriocanal J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16755-16763Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 594 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). A rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody was obtained from DAKO AS (Denmark). All fusion proteins were expressed and purified as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, BL21 cells carrying the constructs of interest were induced with 0.25 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galacropyranoside for 3 h and collected by centrifugation. The fusion proteins were released by a series of 15-s sonication steps or by Bugbuster kit (Novagen) and then purified on GST-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The purity and size of the proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE. GST, which served as a negative control, and the chimeric constructs were used for adaptor binding measurements after dialysis against BIA buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol). MDCK cells (strain II) pretransfected with the EEA1 binding domain fused to GFP (24Nordeng T.W. Gregers T.F. Kongsvik T.L. Meresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Jourdan F. Motta A. Bakke O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; Google Scholar) were stably transfected with various LIMPII constructs by the calcium phosphate procedure of Ref. 25Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1979; 16: 777-785Google Scholar. Clones expressing the DNA constructs in pMEP4 vector under control of metallothionein promoter were selected in the presence of hygromycin B (0.3 mg/ml). Resistant clones were selected and incubated with 25 mmCdCl2 overnight to induce expression of the protein of interest. Clones that expressed constructs of interest were identified with anti-LIMPII antibodies. 3–4 positive clones with different expression levels of the protein of interest were selected in each case. MDCK cells expressing LIMPII constructs were grown in full growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin) in 6% CO2 in a 37 °C incubator. For metabolic labeling, transfected MDCK cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in full medium supplemented with 25 μm CdCl2. The cells were washed twice and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium (Bio Whittaker) and then incubated for 5 h with 50 μCi/ml of [35S]cysteine/methionine. After metabolic labeling, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0,1 M NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10mmNa2HPO4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0,25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml E-64). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. LIMPII was precipitated from the supernatant with 29G10 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies, rabbit anti-mouse IgGs coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed. The proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating in gel-loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The bands were detected with the Bio-Rad GS-250 PhosphorImager. The intensity of the bands was quantified with the Molecular Analyst 2.0.2 software (Bio-Rad). Transfected MDCK cells expressing various LIMPII constructs were grown on glass cover slips and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated for 30 min with a primary antibody followed by a 30-min labeling with a secondary antibody to label total LIMPII. Antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.1% saponin to label total intracellular protein or in PBS containing no saponin for the experiments where only surface labeling was desired. To monitor internalization of anti LIMPII antibodies from the cell surface, antibodies were added to the cells for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed with PBS chased in complete medium for different time periods before fixation. Secondary antibodies were then added in PBS with saponin. Fluorescence was detected, and images were acquired using a Leica TCS-NT digital scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60/1.2 water immersion objective. The pinhole value was kept below 1. The images were processed for presentation with Adobe Photoshop software. AP1 and AP2 were prepared from pig brain essentially as described elsewhere (26Lindner R. Celis J.E. Cell biology: A laboratory Handbook. Academic Press Inc., New York1994: 1Google Scholar). Briefly, clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from brain after homogenization and differential centrifugation. The adaptor proteins were released from clathrin-coated vesicles with 0.5 m Tris/HCL, pH 7.0 and applied to a Superose-6 column (2.5 × 75 cm, equilibrated in the same buffer) connected to an FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) system at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions containing AP1 and AP2 were identified by SDS-PAGE and separated from each other by subsequent hydroxylapatite chromatography as described elsewhere (27Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Google Scholar). Fractions containing either AP1 or AP2 were dialyzed against BIA buffer (see above), which was used for all experiments using surface plasmon resonance. For analyzing AP3 binding, pig brain cytosol was fractionated by gel filtration as described (22Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Google Scholar) using a 60-cm TSK SWXL 3000 size-exclusion column connected to a perfusion chromatography work station (Perseptive Biosystems). The AP3-containing fractions were shown to be devoid of AP1 and AP2 (for details, see Ref.22Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Google Scholar). The interaction between the different Ii constructs and adaptors was analyzed in real time by surface plasmon resonance (28Jönsson U.F.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627Google Scholar) using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (BIAcore AB). Ii constructs were immobilized via their GST moiety of the GST-Ii chimera to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip coated with anti-GST antibodies. The subsequent interaction experiments were performed at a flow-rate of 20 μl/min. Association was recorded for 2 min during which adaptor proteins at different concentrations were injected and followed by recording dissociation for 2 min during which buffer was perfused. A short pulse injection (15 s) of 20 mm NaOH, 0.5% SDS was used to regenerate the surface after each experimental cycle. The anti-GST surface retained its binding capacity for at least 15 cycles of association, dissociation, and regeneration. AP1 and AP2 were used at concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 nm. The cytosolic fractions enriched in AP3 were used at three dilutions. The association and dissociation constants k a andk d for the interactions were calculated by using the evaluation software of the BIAcore 3000. The mathematical models used are described in more detail elsewhere (27Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Google Scholar) In brief, the association was determined after 15–20 s following the switch from buffer solution to adaptor solution to avoid distortions due to injection and mixing. The dissociation rate constants were determined after 5–10 s following the switch to buffer solution. After a rapid (∼30 s) dissociation phase of adaptor from Ii-GST, the dissociation kinetics decreased to a low rate. The association constantk a, the dissociation constantk d, and the calculation of the equilibrium constant K D =k d/k a were determined by using the BIA evaluation software version 1.2, assuming a first order kinetic A + B = AB. Relative binding values were then calculated from the K D values. Standard deviations (in percentage of the mean value) for AP1 and AP2 equilibrium constants (K D), or AP3 affinity were measured relative to the wild type LIMPII construct using the same adaptor batch. We have previously demonstrated that AP1 and AP2 adaptor protein complexes could interact with the invariant chain in an in vitro assay monitored with surface plasmon resonance technique, and that such interactions were dependent on the intact leucine-sorting signals in the invariant chain (15Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Google Scholar). We have also shown that two other molecules that contain similar leucine signals, tyrosinase and LIMPII, only poorly interact with AP1 or AP2, but strongly bind to AP3 (15Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Google Scholar,22Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions between LIMPII and AP3 and the invariant chain and AP1 and AP2 were dependent on acidic residues upstream of the critical leucine signals (22Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Google Scholar, 29Kongsvik T.L. Honing S. Bakke O. Rodionov D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16484-16488Google Scholar). This latter finding suggested that residues in close apposition to the leucine-based motif could play a critical role in determining adaptor binding. We therefore investigated the role of other residues upstream of the leucine signals for their influence on AP1, AP2, and AP3 binding. To this end, we constructed a set of GST fusion constructs containing various chimeric constructs in which one or several amino acids upstream of the leucine signals were swapped between the invariant chain and LIMPII molecules (Fig.1) and measured their interactions with the adaptor complexes. Since the invariant chain has two independent leucine signals, we made two sets of constructs. Each set had one of the leucine signals knocked out by an alanine substitution, and amino acid swap was performed upstream of the other, intact signal. Fig. 2, panel A shows the effect of substituting one or several amino acids in the invariant chain membrane-distal signal on AP3 binding. As reported earlier (15Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Google Scholar), the invariant chain does not interact with AP3, and here we did not observe any interaction between AP3 and the L17A mutant of the invariant chain. We then swapped the three residues between the critical acidic residues and leucine residues, QRD, for the three corresponding residues from the LIMPII molecule, RAP. The resulting construct, L17A, QRD → RAP exhibited significant AP3 binding, around 25% of the wild-type LIMPII construct. Next, we made three more invariant chain constructs in which two out of these three residues were swapped with the corresponding residues from the LIMPII molecule. All three of these constructs were able to interact with AP3 (Fig.2 A). The L17A, QRD → RAD chimera retained the levels of AP3 binding exhibited by the triple substitution chimera (25% of wild type LIMPII). The L17A, QRD → QAP construct had somewhat decreased AP3 binding capacity, 13% of the wild-type LIMPII, whereas the L17A, QRD → RRP construct exhibited twice the amount of AP3 binding compared with the triple substitute construct (around 55% of the wild-type LIMPII binding). All three single amino acid substitutions were also made. When asparatic acid residue at position −1 upstream of the critical leucines was substituted with proline (the L17A, QRD → QRP construct), this chimera showed some AP3 binding (14% of the wild-type LIMPII). The other two single substitution constructs did not bind to AP3 (0–4% residual binding), suggesting an important role for the proline residue upstream of the leucine signal in AP3 binding. We also investigated AP1 and AP2 binding to these L17A constructs. As shown in Fig. 2 B, AP1 binding did not decrease dramatically in all but two chimeric constructs and stayed around 80% of that of the L17A construct. These two constructs, L17A, QRD → RAD, and L17A, QRD → RAP, exhibited AP1 binding of around 20–25% of that of the L17A construct. Interestingly, the construct that lost most of the AP1 binding capacity, L17A, QRD → RRP, also gained the highest AP3 binding. AP2 binding (Fig. 2 C) did not change for all but 2 constructs, L17A, QRD → QAP and L17A, QRD → QRP. These two constructs showed AP2 binding of ∼60% of the L17A construct. There was no apparent correlation between the loss of AP2 binding and increase in AP3 binding for this set of constructs. Next, we performed swaps of the residues upstream of the leucine pair between LIMPII and the second, membrane-proximal signal of the invariant chain. It is noteworthy, that in this case only two amino acids had to be swapped, since the membrane-proximal signal of the invariant chain also has a proline residue at the −1 position from the critical di-leucine (ML) signal. Fig. 3 A shows AP3 binding to the set of constructs containing swaps around the membrane-proximal leucine signal of the invariant chain. We found weak AP3 binding to the L7A mutant itself (5% of the wild-type LIMPII binding). The L7A, QLP → RAP mutant that had two amino acids swapped had higher AP3 binding (10% of the wild-type LIMPII), and surprisingly, both constructs that had only one residue swapped, L7A, QLP → RLP, and L7A, QLP → QAP, possessed even higher AP3 binding (20 and 18% of the wild-type LIMPII, respectively). Since the double arginine-containing construct (L17A, QRD → RRP) had such a dramatic effect on AP3 binding to the membrane-distal signal, we created a similar swap in the membrane-proximal signal. The resulting construct, L7A, QLP → RRP had 55% binding of the wild-type LIMPII, confirming that the double arginine and a proline just upstream of leucine signal confer stronger AP3 binding irrespective of the leucine pair composition (LI or ML leucine pairs). Finally, we investigated the role of upstream acidic residues on AP3 binding. Both LIMPII and membrane-distal signal of the invariant chain contain two acidic residues in the positions −4 and −5 of the leucine pair (DE and DD, respectively), whereas the membrane-proximal signal of the invariant chain has only one acidic residue at the −4 position. We therefore introduced an extra acidic residue at the −5 position into the membrane-proximal signal of the invariant chain together with the swap of residues in positions −2 and −3. The resulting construct, L7A, NEQLP → DERAP possessed much higher AP3 binding (80% of LIMPII) than the L7A, NERAP construct (also labeled as L7A, QLP → RAP) that had only 10% of LIMPII AP3 binding. Therefore, two acidic residues at the −4 and −5 positions seem to give rise to a better AP3 binding than a single acidic residue at the −4 position. As with the membrane-distal signal, we studied the effect of the amino acid swap upstream of the membrane-proximal signal on AP1 and AP2 binding. As seen from comparing Fig. 3 A and Fig.3 B, there is a strong correlation between the loss of AP1 binding and the increase in AP3 binding for all constructs studied. In the case of AP2 binding, a correlation between gain of AP3 binding and loss of AP2 binding was not significant, although two constructs that had the highest AP3 binding (L7A, QLP → RRP and L7A, NEQLP → DERAP) also showed some reduced AP2 binding (around 65% of the AP2 binding to the L7A construct). To corroborate our findings on the importance of residues neighboring the leucine signal, we then analyzed amino acids swaps between LIMPII and the invariant chain on the ability of LIMPII to bind AP3, AP1, and AP2. As shown in Fig. 4 A, when the RAP residues upstream of the leucine pair were swapped with the QRD residues from the invariant chain, the resulting construct exhibited a dramatic loss in AP3 binding (30% of the wild type LIMPII binding), a decrease comparable to that when the critical leucine residue was knocked out with an alanine (21% of the wild-type LIMPII AP3 binding). Therefore, we can conclude that the three residues upstream of the leucine pair are indeed part of the motif that mediates binding to AP3. The introduction of the QRD sequence into LIMPII molecule gave a slight increase in AP1 binding capacity (20%), compared with the wild-type LIMPII, but this was still only 12% of the wild-type Ii binding. When binding to AP2 was analyzed, the QRD introduction did not change the affinity for AP2 binding of the LIMPII mutant as compared with the wild type LIMPII, suggesting that binding of wild-type LIMPII to AP2 require also other structural elements than the amino acid changes we introduced. Since the introduction of the QRD sequence into the LIMPII molecule significantly reduced its AP3 binding capacity but increased its AP1 binding capacity in vitro, we decided to investigate thein vivo fate of the respective mutant proteins. Wild type LIMPII has been shown to be transported from the TGN to lysosomes via endosomes (presumably via interactions with AP3 complex) and has not been detected on the plasma membrane (30Sandoval I.V. Arredondo J.J. Alcalde J. Gonzalez Noriega A. Vandekerckhove J. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6622-6631Google Scholar). We speculated that the reduction in AP3 binding activity upon introduction of the QRD sequence into the wild-type LIMPII might result in the transport of LIMPII to the plasma membrane. Since several studies have shown that overexpression of certain proteins can lead to their general missorting and accumulation on the plasma membrane (31Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Google Scholar, 32Distel B. Bauer U. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 186-193Google Scholar), we had to ensure that overexpressing our mutant LIMPII constructs does not cause unspecific cell surface delivery.

https://openalex.org/W2328785576,"A hallmark of cancer cells is the ability to proliferate indefinitely. This acquisition of an immortal lifespan usually requires the activation of telomerase, the enzyme that elongates telomeres. Human telomerase is minimally composed of the reverse transcriptase subunit hTERT, and the RNA subunit hTR. While hTR is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, the hTERT subunit is generally transcriptionally repressed in most normal somatic cells, but is illegitimately activated to restore telomerase activity in cancer cells. Indeed, in the thousands of different human tumours assayed, 85% were scored positive for telomerase activity. However, the levels of telomerase activity detected in tumour samples can vary substantially and even some normal somatic cells have been found to have low levels of enzyme activity. As the functional significance of low levels of telomerase activity is unclear, we investigated whether there is a minimum level of telomerase activity required for tumourigenesis. Using mutants of hTERT that induce varying levels of telomerase activity, we show that there does indeed exist a threshold of activity required for the processes of immortalization, transformation and tumourigenesis. Thus, low levels of activity detected in certain somatic cells would not be expected to contribute to tumourigenesis, nor does the mere detection of telomerase in cancer cells necessarily signify an immortal lifespan."

Although platelets do not contain dystrophin, the identification of smaller C-terminal isoforms of dystrophin, including Dp71, which are expressed in a wide range of nonmuscle tissues and cell lines, has not been investigated. In this report, we have identified Dp71 protein variants of 55–60 kDa (designated Dp71Δ110) in the membrane cytoskeleton of human platelets. Both Dp71Δ110and utrophin sediment from lysed platelets along with the high speed detergent-insoluble pellet, which contains components of the membrane cytoskeleton. Like the membrane cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and spectrin, Dp71Δ110 and utrophin redistributed from the high speed detergent-insoluble pellet to the integrin-rich low speed pellet of thrombin-stimulated platelets. Immunoelectron microscopy provided further evidence that Dp71Δ110 was localized to the submembranous cytoskeleton. In addition to Dp71Δ110, platelets contained several components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, including β-dystroglycan and syntrophin. To better understand the potential function of Dp71Δ110, collagen adhesion assays were performed on platelets isolated from wild-type or Dp71-deficient (mdx3cv) mice. Adhesion to collagen in response to thrombin was significantly decreased in platelets isolated from mdx3cv mice, compared with wild-type platelets.

DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to the loss of dystrophin, a 427-kDa membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein. Analysis of dystrophin expression has led to the identification of several tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated C-terminal dystrophin isoforms generated through differential promoter usage and/or alternative splicing at the 3′-end of the gene (3Feener C.A.

Dp71, a dystrophin protein of 70–75 kDa, is the major dystrophin gene product found in a wide range of nonmuscle tissues (8Austin R.C. Howard P.L. D'Souza V.N. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol.

The Dp71 transcript, which is regulated by a promoter situated between exons 62 and 63 of the dystrophin gene, encodes the cysteine-rich and C-terminal domains of dystrophin. Because Dp71 transcripts are alternatively spliced for exons 71 and/or 78 in a wide range of nonmuscle tissues, multiple Dp71 protein products of 70–75 kDa are generated, all of which can be identified using dystrophin-specific antibodies directed against the C terminus of the protein (8Austin R.C. Howard P.L. D'Souza V.N. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1475-1483Google Scholar). In addition to these Dp71 isoforms, we have recently identified a subpopulation of Dp71 transcripts in human brain that do not contain exons 71–74 and are alternatively spliced for exon 78 (14). Consistent with the expected translation of these Dp71 transcripts, immunoblot analysis using dystrophin-specific C-terminal antibodies detected an immunoreactive protein of ∼58 kDa (designated Dp71Δ110) in total protein lysates from adult human brain. The observation that Dp71Δ110 fails to react with a monoclonal antibody (MANEX7374A) directed against epitopes within exons 73 and 74 provides further evidence that Dp71Δ110 is derived from Dp71 transcripts lacking exons 71–74. Other C-terminal isoforms of dystrophin have been identified in the retina (Dp260) (15D'Souza V.N. Man N.T. Morris G.E. Karges W. Pillers D.M. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 837-842Google Scholar) and in the peripheral (Dp116) (16Byers T.J. Lidov H.G.W. Kunkel L.M. Nat.

In addition, the autosomal homologue of dystrophin (18Love D.R. Hill D.F. Dickson G. Spurr N.K. Byth B.C. Marsden R.F. Walsh F.S. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 55-58Google Scholar), utrophin, is expressed in a wide range of nonmuscle tissues and cell lines (19Man N.T. Thanh L.T. Blake D.J. Davies K.E. Morris G.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 19-22Google Scholar, 20Matsumura K. Shasby D.M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 289-293Google Scholar). Although there is considerable information regarding the tissue distribution and structure of these C-terminal dystrophin isoforms, relatively little is known about their function. Dp71 associates with components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) (21Cox G.A. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 333-339Google Scholar, 22Greenberg D.S. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 340-344Google Scholar) and localizes to the plasma membrane (23Jung D. Filliol D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Rendon A. Neuromusc. Disord. 1993; 3: 515-518Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Dp71 plays a role in the formation and/or stabilization of the membrane cytoskeleton. This concept is further supported by studies showing that mice deficient in Dp71 have reduced levels of the DAPC in their brain (24Greenberg D.S. Schatz Y. Levy Z. Pizzo P. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1299-1303Google Scholar). However, direct evidence that Dp71 is a component of the membrane cytoskeleton or that it is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and/or transmembrane signaling is lacking. It is well established that platelets contain a complex membrane cytoskeleton that resembles, at least in part, the cytoskeleton found in muscle (25Daniel J.L. Tuzynski G.P. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Platelet Contractile Proteins. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, PA1987: 644-660Google Scholar, 26Tandon N.N. Holland E.A. Kralisz U. Kleinman H.K. Robey F.A. Jamieson G.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 535-542Google Scholar). Our previous studies have identified utrophin as a component of the platelet membrane cytoskeleton and indicate that it participates in cytoskeletal reorganization during platelet activation (27Earnest J.P. Santos G.F. Zuerbig S. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27259-27265Google Scholar). Although platelets do not contain full-length dystrophin, the presence of C-terminal dystrophin isoforms was not examined. In the present study, we provide evidence that Dp71Δ110 is expressed in human platelets, is a component of the platelet membrane cytoskeleton, and redistributes in integrin-induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton during thrombin-induced platelet activation. In terms of platelet function, adhesion to collagen in response to thrombin was significantly reduced in platelets from Dp71-deficient (mdx3cv) mice, compared with platelets from age-matched wild-type mice. These results suggest that Dp71Δ110 plays a potential role in thrombin-stimulated platelet adhesion, possibly by mediating cytoskeletal reorganization and/or signaling.

For platelet activation studies, purified platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 22 °C, washed twice in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.15 volume of ACD and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 109 platelets/ml in Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.36 mm sodium phosphate, 5.5 mmglucose, 1.8 mm calcium chloride, and 0.4 mmmagnesium chloride, pH 7.4). Platelets were activated by addition of 1 unit/ml α-thrombin (kindly provided by Dr. John Fenton II, New York Department of Health, Albany, NY). Human platelet lysates were produced by the addition of an equal volume of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) followed by immediate centrifugation at 15,600 × g at 4 °C for 4 min to pellet cytoplasmic actin filaments. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 2.5 h at 4 °C to pellet components of the membrane cytoskeleton (35Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal components were subjected to immunoblot analysis, as described below. Total RNA extracted from fresh human platelets using the TRIzol reagent procedure (Invitrogen) was stored at −70 °C in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. One microgram of platelet RNA was used to synthesize cDNA, using either a primer complimentary to a sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of the human dystrophin/Dp71 cDNA sequence (513, 5′-TGCATAGACGTGAAAACCTGCC-3′) or random hexamers, as described previously (8Austin R.C. Howard P.L. D'Souza V.N. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1475-1483Google Scholar). The PCR primers used to amplify DNA segments flanking exon 78 of the dystrophin cDNA were 837 (5′-CCTTCCCTAGTAGTTCAAGAGG-3′; position 11205–11223) and 2296 (5′-TCTAGAATTCTTATTCTGCTCCTTCTTC-3′; position 11352–11335). Random hexanucleotide-primed first-strand cDNA served as template for PCR analysis using primers GAP1 (5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′, sense) and GAP2 (5′-TCTAGACGGAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′, antisense) for glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. All primers were synthesized at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). PCR amplification took place in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2 μl of the RT reaction, 100 ng of primer, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a buffer consisting of 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 0.5 mm of each dNTP. All samples were subjected to amplification in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermal cycler (model 480) with a step program of 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified products were separated on a 1.5% agarose-TBE gel containing ethidium bromide. Total protein lysates from human platelets, muscle, or Dami cells were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 2 min, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and immunostained as previously described (8Austin R.C. Howard P.L. D'Souza V.N. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1475-1483Google Scholar). After incubation with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies, membranes were developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Molecular mass markers were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada) or Bio-Rad. Human platelets were fixed and partially permeabilized by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.001% Triton X-100. For immunogold labeling, platelets were allowed to adhere to plastic coverslips (Thermanox, Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing several times with PBS, followed by PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.15% glycine to quench residual aldehyde, coverslips were rinsed with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, and then incubated with the dystrophin-specific C-terminal antibody 1461 (dilution 1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. As a control, coverslips were incubated with normal rabbit IgG in place of rabbit anti-dystrophin IgG. After washing with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, coverslips were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 30-nm colloidal gold particles (Amersham Biosciences, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and once with PBS before being fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After a series of ethanol dehydration steps, samples were critical-point dried, rendered conductive with a thin layer of evaporated carbon, and then examined in a Jeol JSM 820 electron microscope using mixed backscatter/secondary imaging. For transmission electron microscopy, platelet samples were incubated with the 1461 antibody as described above, washed with PBS, and then incubated with a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes with PBS, the samples were incubated for 15 min in a fresh solution of 2.8 mmdiaminobenzidine in 50 mm TBS containing 0.02% hydrogen peroxide. Immunoperoxidase-labeled platelets were post-fixed in 1% OsO4/0.1 m sodium cacodylate, dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 with propylene oxide. Ultrathin sections cut with a diamond knife were then examined in a Jeol 1200EX electron microscope. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). mdx3cv mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mouse blood was collected from the inferior vena cava of anesthetized 10-week-old wild-type or mdx3cv mice into 0.15 volume of ACD and diluted 1:1 in Tyrode's buffer containing 5 μm PGE1(Sigma). Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation of the blood at 275 × g for 15 min at 22 °C through a discontinuous 55%/67% Percoll gradient. After an additional Percoll gradient centrifugation step, platelet-rich plasma was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 5 μm PGE1. Purified platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 10 min and resuspended at 1 × 108platelets/ml aliquots in Tyrode's buffer without PGE1(collagen-stimulated platelets), Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm theophylline, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 μm PGE1 (unstimulated platelets) or Tyrode's buffer containing 1 unit/ml α-thrombin (thrombin-stimulated platelets). Calf skin collagen, Type 1 (Sigma), resuspended in 0.1 mm acetic acid, was added to the wells of 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) at a concentration of 5 μg/well. After drying overnight in a fume hood, plates were washed three times with PBS. Platelets (1 × 107/well) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After gentle washing with PBS containing 5 mm glucose to remove nonadherent platelets, the remaining adherent platelets were fluorescently labeled for 10 min with 20 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate (Sigma) in PBS containing 5.5 mm glucose. The extent of platelet adherence was determined using a Fluorescence Plate Reader (Molecular Devices) by measuring the fluorescence emitted for each well at 530 nm after excitation at 485 nm. The results are presented as relative fluorescence units (RFU) per 1 × 107 platelets and represent the mean ± S.E. of quadruplicate measurements using platelets isolated from eight wild-type or six mdx3cv mice. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Significance of differences between wild-type and mdx3cv platelets were determined by one-way analysis of variance. If significant differences were detected, unpaired Student'st tests were performed. For all analyses, pvalues of <0.05 were considered significant. To determine whether human platelets contain dystrophin, C-terminal isoforms of dystrophin and/or utrophin, total platelet lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis. When immunostained with a dystrophin-specific antibody (1461) directed against the C-terminal 17 amino acids of muscle dystrophin, full-length dystrophin was observed in normal muscle but not in DMD muscle or platelets (Fig. 1 A). However, platelets contained an immunoreactive protein that migrated at an apparent molecular mass of 55–60 kDa (designated Dp71Δ110m) under both reducing (Fig.1 A) and nonreducing conditions (data not shown). Platelet proteins of similar molecular mass (designated Dp71Δ110a) were also identified using an antibody (462B) directed against the alternative 31-amino acid C terminus of dystrophin that results from alternative splicing of exon 78 (Fig. 1 B) or an antibody (NME-1) specific for the unique seven amino acid N terminus of Dp71 (Fig. 1 C). The observation that a monoclonal antibody (MANEX7374A) directed against epitopes within exons 73 and 74 failed to detect these proteins (data not shown) suggests that they are derived from Dp71 transcripts deleted for exons 71–74. As expected, a monoclonal antibody (MANDYS1) directed against the spectrin-like repeat domain of dystrophin did not react with these platelet proteins but did react strongly with full-length muscle dystrophin (Fig. 1 D). Consistent with our previous findings (27Earnest J.P. Santos G.F. Zuerbig S. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27259-27265Google Scholar), utrophin was identified in platelets using a monoclonal antibody (MANCHO3) against the C-terminal domain of utrophin (Fig.1 E). The reactivity and molecular mass of utrophin observed in platelets were comparable to that of utrophin found in DMD muscle (compare lanes 2 and 3). The observation that utrophin levels in DMD muscle are increased, compared with normal skeletal muscle, is consistent with previous reports (37Matsumura K. Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 360: 588-591Google Scholar, 38Karpati G. Carpenter S. Morris G.E. Davies K.E. Guerin C. Holland P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 119-128Google Scholar). As described previously for Dp71Δ110 in adult human brain (14Austin R.C. Morris G.E. Howard P.L. Klamut H.J. Ray P.N. Neuromusc. Disord. 2000; 10: 187-193Google Scholar), reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of the open reading frame of Dp71 in adult human platelets resulted in the expected 1.6-kb PCR product (data not shown). To ensure that platelet proteins detected by the dystrophin-specific C-terminal antibodies 1461 and 462B were derived from Dp71Δ110 transcripts alternatively spliced for exon 78, platelet RNA was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers flanking exon 78 (Fig. 2). As expected, a 160-bp fragment was generated from Dp71 cDNA containing an intact exon 78 (Fig. 2, lane 2). When platelet cDNA was used as the template, PCR products of 160 and 128 bp were generated (Fig. 2, lane 3). Double-stranded DNA sequencing of both strands revealed that the 160-bp fragment contained an intact exon 78, whereas the 128-bp fragment was absent for exon 78 (data not shown). As a negative control, omission of platelet cDNA in the reaction mixture resulted in a loss of these two PCR products (Fig. 2,lane 1). Thus, the 160- and 128-bp PCR products generated from platelet cDNA result from alternative splicing of the 32-bp exon 78 and provides further evidence that platelet Dp71Δ110 is alternatively spliced for exon 78. Because platelets are derived from megakaryocytes, we studied the expression of Dp71Δ110, dystrophin, and utrophin in Dami cells, a megakaryocytic cell line that exhibits many of the morphological and biochemical characteristics of bone marrow megakaryocytes (39Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Google Scholar). Total protein lysates from skeletal muscle, platelets, and Dami cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for the C terminus of dystrophin or utrophin (Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 3 A, Dp71Δ110m containing the C-terminal sequence of muscle dystrophin was found in platelets and Dami cells. However, compared with platelets, Dp71Δ110a containing the alternative 31-amino acid C-terminal sequence was not detected (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest that, in Dami cells, Dp71Δ110 is derived from Dp71 transcripts that retain exon 78. In support of this, RT-PCR analysis of Dami cell RNA revealed the presence of only Dp71Δ110 transcripts containing exon 78 (data not shown). As shown previously in Fig. 1, there was no evidence of Dp71Δ110 in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3,A and B). Dami cells, like platelets, do not contain full-length dystrophin (Fig. 3 C) but express utrophin (Fig. 3 D). Previous studies have shown that dystrophin and its C-terminal isoforms are associated with the membrane cytoskeleton in muscle and nonmuscle tissues (21Cox G.A. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 333-339Google Scholar, 22Greenberg D.S. Sunada Y. Campbell K.P. Yaffe D. Nudel U. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 340-344Google Scholar, 40Love D.R. Morris G.E. Ellis J.M. Fairbrother U. Marsden R.F. Walsh F.S. Edwards Y.H. Slater C.P. Parry D.J. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3243-3247Google Scholar, 41Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Google Scholar, 42Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Google Scholar). To determine whether Dp71Δ110 associates with the platelet membrane cytoskeleton, platelets were lysed with a Triton X-100-containing buffer, and the cytoskeletal components were isolated by differential centrifugation (Fig. 4). Compared with total platelet lysates (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), the cytoplasmic components of the platelet cytoskeleton, including actin filaments, were sedimented by centrifugation at 15,600 × g (low speed pellet, lane 2), while the detergent-insoluble membrane cytoskeleton was sedimented by centrifugation of the 15,600 × g supernatant at 100,000 × g (high speed pellet, lane 3). Dp71Δ110m containing the C-terminal sequence of muscle dystrophin was recovered exclusively in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). In contrast, equivalent amounts of Dp71Δ110acontaining the alternative 31-amino acid C-terminal sequence were recovered in both the detergent-insoluble and -soluble fractions (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with our previous findings (27Earnest J.P. Santos G.F. Zuerbig S. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27259-27265Google Scholar), utrophin was recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction, with a minor amount in the"

https://openalex.org/W2004048801,"Two mammary gland phenotypes were detected in pregnant MMTV-cyclin D2 transgenic mice; line D2-53 exhibited a lack of alveologenesis and failure to nurse, whereas line D2-58 featured a reduction in alveologenesis, but retained normal nursing behavior. In pregnant mammary glands, cyclin D2 protein levels were twofold (P<0.107) and 3.8-fold (P<0.0076) higher in line D2-58 and D2-53, respectively, compared to wild type. Concomitantly with the increase in cyclin D2 was a fivefold decrease in cyclin D1 hyper-phosphorylated isoform in mammary glands of pregnant cyclin D2-58 mice. Because cyclin D1 is a critical molecule in normal mammary lobuloalveolar development, these data suggest that overexpression of cyclin D2 may block mammary lobuloalveolar development through inhibition of cyclin D1 phosphorylation. During mammary gland development, p27(kip1) protein level oscillated in a similar profile in wild type and cyclin D2 transgenic mice, but was consistently higher in the cyclin D2 mice suggesting that p27(kip1) functions downstream of cyclin D2. The ratio of p27(kip1)-cdk4/p27(kip1)-cdk2 was 6.5-fold (P<0.0003) higher in cyclin D2 mammary glands compared to wild type in pregnant animals. This ratio reversed to 2.2-fold (P<0.005) higher in wild type compared to cyclin D2 mammary glands in involution suggesting that overexpression of cyclin D2 moderately induced apoptosis during pregnancy but accelerated involution. Collectively, the effects of cyclin D2 overexpression on mammary gland development during pregnancy and involution are attributed to two major factors, altered p27(kip1) protein level and inhibition of cyclin D1 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2333480555,The microarray array experimental system generates noisy data that require validation by other experimental methods for measuring gene expression. Here we present an algebraic modeling of noise that extracts expression measurements true to a high degree of confidence. This work profiles the expression of 19 200 cDNAs in 35 human gliomas; the experiments are designed to generate four replicate spots/gene with switching of probes. The validity of the extracted measurements is confirmed by: (1) cluster analysis that generates a molecular classification differentiating glioblastoma from lower-grade tumors and radiation necrosis; (2) By what other investigators have reported in gliomas using paradigms for assaying molecular expression other than gene profiling; and (3) Real-time RT-PCR. The results yield a genetic analysis of gliomas and identify classes of genetic expression that link novel genes to the biology of gliomas.

https://openalex.org/W2325543224,"A 19 kDa protein was identified to associate with the Dbl oncogene homology domain of Sos1 (Sos–DH) and was purified from rat brains by GST–Sos–DH affinity chromatography. Peptide sequencing revealed that the protein is identical to light chain 3 (LC3), a microtubule-associated protein. LC3 coimmunoprecipitated with Sos1, and GST–LC3 was capable of forming complexes with Sos1 in in vitro GST-pull down assay. Furthermore, LC3 was colocalized with Sos1 in cells, as determined by immunohistochemistry. While Sos1 stimulated the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction on Rac1, LC3 suppressed the ability of Sos1 to activate Rac1 in in vitro experiments using COS cell lysates. Consistent with this, overexpression of LC3 decreased the level of active GTP-bound Rac1 in COS cells. Sos1 expression induced membrane ruffling, a downstream target for Rac1, but LC3 expression inhibited this biological effect of Sos1. These findings suggest that LC3 interacts with Sos1 and thereby negatively regulates the Sos1-dependent Rac1 activation leading to membrane ruffling"
https://openalex.org/W2328499487,"Sam68 phosphorylation correlates with Fyn but not Lck expression in T cells. This substrate has been used here to explore the possible basis of the specificity of Fyn versus Lck. We show that this specificity is not based on a spatial segregation of the two kinases, since a chimeric Lck molecule containing the membrane anchoring domain of Fyn does not phosphorylate Sam68. Moreover, a Sam68 molecule targeted to the plasma membrane by the farnesylation signal of c-Ha-Ras remains poorly phosphorylated by Lck. In T cells, Fyn appears to be the active Src kinase in rafts, but Sam68 is not expressed in rafts, and its distinct phosphorylation by Fyn and Lck is not affected by raft dispersion. The Fyn/Lck specificity does not reflect a higher kinase activity of Fyn in general, as both Fyn and Lck are similarly recognized by an anti-active Src antibody. Both also strongly phosphorylate another Src substrate in vivo. Mainly, Lck phosphorylates Sam68 when the interaction between the SH3 domain and the SH2-catalytic domain linker is altered in heterologous Src molecules or after mutating key residues in the linker that increase the accessibility of the SH3 domain. Thus, the distinct potential of Fyn and Lck to phosphorylate Sam68 is likely controlled by the interaction of the kinase SH3 domain with the linker and Sam68, possibly on a competitive binding basis."
