Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion, Antoniadis et al. (p. 448 ) identified a millisecond pulsar as a neutron star twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary's orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution."

Failure of this quality-control mechanism contributes to Parkinson's disease. When damaged mitochondria lose membrane depolarization, the protein kinase, PINK1, accumulates on the mitochondrial surface, recruits Parkin, and promotes mitophagy. Chen and Dorn (p. 471 ) describe another component of this process, mitofusin 2, which appears to function as the receptor for Parkin on the surface of damaged mitochondria."

Thus, for robotics or artificial skin design, methods are needed for sensitive pressure detection. Wu et al. (p. 952 , published online 25 April) designed a device based on an array of zinc oxide nanowires that generate a small voltage when flexed that could be translated into a pressure signal. The device has a pressure-sensing range of up to 30 kPa, comparable to the 10 to 40 kPa range of a human finger."
https://openalex.org/W1984084102,"Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with X-rays or neutrons provide a comprehensive, resolution-limited observation of the thermodynamic state. However, methods for evaluating mass and validating SAS-based models and resolution have been inadequate. Here we define the volume of correlation, Vc, a SAS invariant derived from the scattered intensities that is specific to the structural state of the particle, but independent of concentration and the requirements of a compact, folded particle. We show that Vc defines a ratio, QR, that determines the molecular mass of proteins or RNA ranging from 10 to 1,000 kilodaltons. Furthermore, we propose a statistically robust method for assessing model-data agreements (χ2free) akin to cross-validation. Our approach prevents over-fitting of the SAS data and can be used with a newly defined metric, RSAS, for quantitative evaluation of resolution. Together, these metrics (Vc, QR, χ2free and RSAS) provide analytical tools for unbiased and accurate macromolecular structural characterizations in solution. Small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons is more readily applied to macromolecular complexes than is X-ray crystallography, and is particularly useful for protein complexes with high flexibility; here new quantitative metrics are presented that will allow solution-derived structures to be validated and assessed for mass, resolution and accuracy. Small-angle scattering (SAS) of X-rays or neutrons is more readily applied to macromolecular complexes than is X-ray crystallography, and is particularly useful for proteins and complexes with high flexibility. John Tainer and Robert Rambo have developed a new series of quantitative metrics that allow the accuracy of such solution-derived structures to be validated. This refinement strengthens the intrinsic capabilities of SAS for high-throughput analyses and should expand its application to studying flexible macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution."

Unfortunately, vaccines for diseases with the highest global health burdens, such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, are not yet available. Koff et al. (p. 1064 ) review the latest advances in vaccine development and why these particular diseases remain such a challenge. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children worldwide. Although a prophylactic antibody is available for children at high risk, a vaccine is much needed. As a potential step toward this goal, McLellan et al. (p. 1113 , published online 25 April) solved the cocrystal structure of a neutralizing antibody (D25) bound to the prefusion F protein of RSV. Knowledge of the structure of the prefusion protein should help to guide vaccine design and the development of additional therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2133342962,"Magnetic imaging is a powerful tool for probing biological and physical systems. However, existing techniques either have poor spatial resolution compared to optical microscopy and are hence not generally applicable to imaging of sub-cellular structure (for example, magnetic resonance imaging), or entail operating conditions that preclude application to living biological samples while providing submicrometre resolution (for example, scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy, electron holography and magnetic resonance force microscopy). Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states and rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks."

The boundary between these two regions is largely controlled by the melting point of iron at ∼330 GPa, which in turn influences heat transfer and geodynamo generation. Anzellini et al. (p. 464 , see the Perspective by Fei ) compressed iron in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, tracking its structure and texture by using time-resolved x-ray diffraction as the pressure increased to 200 GPa. The melting curve suggests the possibility of high heat flux and partial melting at the core-mantle boundary."

Can neurons change their transmitter phenotype to deal with alterations in the environment? Dulcis et al. (p. 449 ; see the Perspective by Birren and Marder ) exposed adult rats to different photoperiods mimicking summer and winter daylengths. Neurotransmitter expression switched between dopamine and somatostatin in hypothalamic neurons that regulate release of corticotropin-releasing factor. Transmitter switching occurred at the transcriptional level and was accompanied by changes in postsynaptic receptors.
https://openalex.org/W2026576172,"Tolerance Needed It's a common enough occurrence: You're sick as a dog with a cold, but the person in the office next door just has a few sniffles. What accounts for this difference? Most commonly, these sorts of differences are chalked up to differences in resistance—perhaps you have higher viral loads than your office mate. But such differences can also involve differences in the ability to tolerate the same amount of virus. Deciphering the contribution of resistance versus tolerance, however, is difficult. Jamieson et al. (p. 1230 , published online 25 April) studied a mouse model of viral and bacterial co-infection where tolerance and resistance could be separated. Mice infected with influenza virus were more likely to succumb to a secondary infection with Legionella pneumophila as a result of impaired tolerance to tissue damage, rather than because of a difference in bacterial burden."

Such phenological timings are likely to shift as our climate changes, but species exist in communities, and not all species can be expected to shift in concert. Reed et al.

Thus, overall, the population is resilient and has not declined."
https://openalex.org/W1963977752,"Tracking Secreted Proteins The proteins secreted by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest. However, systematic detection of secreted proteins is tricky because they tend to be present in small amounts within complex mixtures of proteins where other components are very abundant. Meissner et al. (p. 475 ) developed a method for screening the secreted proteins from cultured mouse macrophages in response to cues that cause inflammation. The amount of contaminating proteins was reduced by culturing the cells without added serum and then sensitive mass spectrometry techniques were used to detect and quantify secretion of nearly 800 different proteins. Secretion was compared from cells lacking the signaling adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF, or both. Secretion of some proteins were regulated redundantly and were secreted without one of the adaptors, but others required both signals for release. Some anti-inflammatory proteins were released at later times in response to synergistic signals from both adaptor proteins, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2112071635,"Indolic and kynuric pathways of skin melatonin metabolism were monitored by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in human keratinocytes, melanocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and melanoma cells. Production of 6-hydroxymelatonin [6(OH)M], N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and 5-methoxy-tryptamine (5-MT) was detected in a cell type-dependent fashion. The major metabolites, 6(OH)M and AFMK, were produced in all cells. Thus, in immortalized epidermal (HaCaT) keratinocytes, 6(OH)M was the major product with Vmax = 63.7 ng/106 cells and Km = 10.2 μM, with lower production of AFMK and 5-MT. Melanocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts transformed melatonin primarily into 6(OH)M and AFMK. In melanoma cells, 6(OH)M and AFMK were produced endogenously, a process accelerated by exogenous melatonin in the case of AFMK. In addition, N-acetylserotonin was endogenously produced by normal and malignant melanocytes. Metabolites showed selective antiproliferative effects on human primary epidermal keratinocytes in vitro. In ex vivo human skin, both melatonin and AFMK-stimulated expression of involucrin and keratins-10 and keratins-14 in the epidermis, indicating their stimulatory role in building and maintaining the epidermal barrier. In summary, the metabolism of melatonin and its endogenous production is cell type-dependent and expressed in all three main cell populations of human skin. Furthermore, melatonin and its metabolite AFMK stimulate differentiation in human epidermis, indicating their key role in building the skin barrier.—Kim, T.-K., Kleszczyński, K., Janjetovic, Z., Sweatman, T., Lin, Z., Li, W., Reiter, R.

Locally, these structures, commonly referred to as ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF), protect and sequester the broken DNA ends and modulate a number of cellular processes including transcription, chromatin transactions, and DNA repair. In parallel, IRIF also provide an important checkpoint signaling platform from which DNA damage-activated kinases such as ATM and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) can globally impact on cell cycle transitions, cell fate decisions, and transcriptional processes (1Ciccia A. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 179-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). Recruitment of numerous factors to the chromatin regions surrounding DSBs requires a ubiquitylation cascade that has been extensively characterized in recent years. Initially, ATM and related kinases phosphorylate H2AX (γ-H2AX), leading to recruitment of the central DDR scaffold protein MDC1, the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of which then provides a docking platform for the RING finger ubiquitin ligase RNF8 (2Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Assembly and function of DNA double-strand break repair foci in mammalian cells.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although the full spectrum of RNF8 ubiquitylation targets is likely to be broader than currently appreciated, one central substrate for DNA damage-induced, RNF8-mediated polyubiquitylation is H2A-type histones (4Huen M.S. Grant R. Manke I. Minn K. Yu X. Yaffe M.B. Chen J.

Although RNF8 seems to play an important role in initiating DSB-induced ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, it is a second ubiquitin ligase, RNF168, that together with Ubc13 catalyzes bulk DSB-associated histone ubiquitylation. RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by recognition of RNF8 ubiquitylation products via its three ubiquitin binding domains and specifically ubiquitylates Lys-13 and Lys-15 on H2A-type histones, residues that are distinct from the canonical H2A monoubiquitylation sites (6Mattiroli F.

A major consequence of local RNF8/RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation is the retention of genome caretaker factors such as BRCA1 and 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage.

BRCA1 is attracted to polyubiquitylated histones via its binding partner RAP80, which contains tandem ubiquitin interacting motifs that are optimally spaced for recognition of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains (13Kim H.

Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Menard P. Larsen D.H. Pepperkok R. Ellenberg J. Panier S. Durocher D. Bartek J. Lukas J. Lukas C.

However, unlike RAP80, 53BP1 does not contain obvious ubiquitin-binding motifs, and it is not known to interact with factors that can target it to ubiquitylated core histones. Recently, the accumulation of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage has been suggested to require the local unmasking of methylated histones, the prime interaction partner of the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain, catalyzed by RNF8-mediated displacement of L3MBTL1 and/or degradation of JDJM2 family proteins (18Acs K.

Although much has been gleaned about the mechanisms that initiate and propagate DSB-induced chromatin ubiquitylation, considerably less is known about the cellular activities that limit, restrain, and reverse this process. Available evidence suggests, however, that such regulatory mechanisms are both complex and multilayered. One way in which cells avoid the detrimental spreading of the DSB-induced ubiquitin signal along chromosome arms is through tight regulation of RNF168 levels by the ubiquitin ligases TRIP12 and UBR5 (20Gudjonsson T. Altmeyer M. Savic V. Toledo L. Dinant C. Grøfte M. Bartkova J. Poulsen M. Oka Y. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Neumann B. Heriche J.K. Shearer R. Saunders D. Bartek J. Lukas J. Lukas C.

In addition, RNF168 activity is kept in check by the DUB OTUB1, which binds to Ubc13 in a noncatalytic manner, restricting its interaction with cognate E3 binding partners including RNF168 (21Nakada S.

In addition to mechanisms that restrain DDR-associated histone ubiquitylation by direct regulation of RNF168 activity, several DUBs have been suggested to be catalytically active against RNF8/RNF168-generated ubiquitylation products. These include BRCC36, a BRCA1-associated DUB that has been proposed to edit ubiquitin chains on H2A to facilitate optimal recognition by RAP80; USP16, which was suggested to reverse RNF8/RNF168-mediated transcriptional silencing through H2A deubiquitylation; and USP3, which also deubiquitylates H2A and H2B and suppresses formation of 53BP1 foci when overexpressed (7Doil C.

Finally, POH1, a 19 S proteasome-associated DUB has recently been suggested to cleave Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains at sites of DNA damage (25Butler L.R. Densham R.M. Jia J. Garvin A.J. Stone H.R.

The relative importance of and interplay between these inhibitory mechanisms for the correct dosing of DSB-associated histone ubiquitylation are poorly understood. Here, we employed an overexpression approach involving the majority of human DUBs predicted to be catalytically active in a search for additional cellular DUBs that can counteract the RNF8/RNF168-dependent histone ubiquitylation pathway. We uncovered USP44 as a powerful new antagonizer of RNF8/RNF168-mediated H2A ubiquitylation, which is recruited to ubiquitin-modified DSB-flanking chromatin and may provide an additional regulatory weapon in the cellular arsenal that ensures tight control of DDR-associated histone ubiquitylation. Full-length cDNAs for human USP44, USP29, and USP3 were amplified by PCR and inserted into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) or pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) containing N-terminal Strep-HA or FLAG tags to generate doxycycline-inducible mammalian expression constructs for GFP- and Strep-HA-tagged USP44, Strep-HA-tagged USP29, and FLAG-tagged USP3, respectively. Other human DUBs were cloned into similar expression vectors by PCR-based cloning (supplemental Fig. S1). The USP44 catalytically inactive (CI) (C282A), USP29 CI (C294S), USP3 CI (C168S), and OTUB1 CI (C91S) point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Constructs expressing Myc-ubiquitin and FLAG-H2A were described previously (5Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Faustrup H. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas C.

Plasmid transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA transfections were done with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). siRNA target sequences used in this study were: Control (5′-GGGAUACCUAGACGUUCUA-3′), USP44(#1) (5′-GCAUGUGACAACAAAUCAA-3′), USP44(#2) (5′-GACUGCACCUCAAACGAUU-3′), USP3 (5′-GGAGUUAAGGAAUGGGAAAUU-3′ and 5′-GCAGUAGCUACAGUACAUA-3′), OTUB1 (5′-CCGACUACCUUGUGGUCUA-3′ and 5′-UGACGGCAACUGUUUCUAU-3′), RNF8 (5′-UGCGGAGUAUGAAUAUGAA-3′), and RNF168 (5′-GGCGAAGAGCGAUGGAGGA-3′). Human U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To generate cell lines constitutively expressing GFP-tagged WT and mutant USP44, U2OS cells were co-transfected with USP44 expression constructs and pBabe.puro, and positive clones were selected with puromycin (26Bekker-Jensen S.

To generate cell lines inducibly expressing tagged WT and mutant DUB alleles, U2OS cells were co-transfected with DUB expression plasmids and pcDNA6/TR, and positive clones were selected with Zeocin and Blasticidin S, as described (26Bekker-Jensen S.

To induce DNA double-strand breaks, cells were exposed to X-rays using a Y.SMART tube (YXLON A/S, Taastrup, Denmark) at 6 mA and 160 kV through a 3-mm aluminum filter. Unless stated otherwise, cells were exposed to a dose of 4 Gy and harvested 1 h later. Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and Strep-Tactin pulldowns were done as described (28Poulsen M. Lukas C. Lukas J. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Human RNF169 is a negative regulator of the ubiquitin-dependent response to DNA double-strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In vivo H2A ubiquitylation assays were performed as described previously (5Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Faustrup H. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J.

For acid extraction of histones, cells were lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and nuclei were recovered by centrifugation. Histones were extracted by resuspension of nuclei in 0.2 m HCl for 2 h at 4 °C. Antibodies used in this study included: mouse monoclonal antibodies to Myc (sc-40), GFP (sc-9996), MDM2 (sc-965), and HA (sc-7392) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FK2 (BML-PW8810, Enzo), H2B-Ub (05-1312) and γ-H2AX (05-636) (both from Millipore), FLAG (F1804, Sigma), and USP3 (H00009960-M01, Abnova); rat monoclonal antibodies to HA (11867423991 and 12013819001, Roche Applied Science); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to 53BP1 (sc-22760), p53 (sc-6243), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (sc-7907) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RAP80 (A300-763A) and H2A (ab18255, Abcam), OTUB1 (8451S, Cell Signaling), and RNF168 (kind gift from Dr. Daniel Durocher (University of Toronto, Canada)); and goat polyclonal antibodies to MCM6 (sc-9843) and GAPDH (sc-20357) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in DMEM for 1 h at room temperature. Following staining with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 and 568; Invitrogen) for 30 min, coverslips were mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) containing the nuclear stain DAPI. Confocal images were acquired on an LSM-780 (Carl Zeiss) mounted on a Zeiss-AxioObserver Z1 equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil immersion objective. Dual and triple color confocal images were acquired with standard settings for excitation of DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, and Alexa Fluor 647 dyes (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), respectively. Image acquisition and analysis was carried out with LSM-ZEN software. Laser microirradiation of cells was performed essentially as described (28Poulsen M. Lukas C. Lukas J. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Human RNF169 is a negative regulator of the ubiquitin-dependent response to DNA double-strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), except that the UV-A laser line used was 355 nm instead of 337 nm. For automated analysis of fluorescence intensities of nuclear foci, exponentially growing U2OS cells were treated with siRNAs (25 nm final concentration) for 3 days. Cells were then irradiated (0.25 Gy), and 30 min later, they were fixed and immunostained with FK2 and 53BP1 antibodies. Nuclear DNA was counterstained with DAPI (0.25 μg/ml). A series of random fields was recorded automatically using the Olympus ScanR imaging work station (Hamamatsu ORCA-R2 camera, UPLSAPO 40×/0.9 objective). The number and intensity of IR-induced nuclear foci were quantified using the ScanR image analysis software. To identify human DUBs that oppose ubiquitin-dependent protein recruitment to DSB-modified chromatin, we generated an inventory of expression vectors for the majority of human DUBs predicted to be catalytically active (29Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. A genomic and functional inventory of deubiquitinating enzymes.Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). We then assessed the ability of individually overexpressed DUBs to counteract IR-induced formation of 53BP1 foci, a process critically dependent on RNF8/RNF168-generated ubiquitylations (2Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Assembly and function of DNA double-strand break repair foci in mammalian cells.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Among ∼60 human DUBs analyzed by this approach, only five were able to consistently and potently abrogate 53BP1 focus formation (Fig. 1, A and D; supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that most DUBs do not promiscuously reverse RNF8/RNF168-catalyzed ubiquitylations when expressed at high levels. Of these, USP3 and OTUB1 have previously been described as antagonizers of 53BP1 focus formation (7Doil C. Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Menard P. Larsen D.H. Pepperkok R. Ellenberg J. Panier S.

Non-canonical inhibition of DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination by OTUB1.Nature. 2010; 466: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), confirming the validity of our approach, whereas three additional DUBs capable of preventing 53BP1 recruitment to IRIF, USP44, USP29, and USP26, have not been linked to the DDR. Consistent with such an involvement, these proteins all localized exclusively to the nucleus when overexpressed (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. S1). USP29 and USP26 are highly homologous proteins; indeed, USP26 is likely a testis-specific homologue of USP29 (29Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K.

Yang F. Page D.C. An abundance of X-linked genes expressed in spermatogonia.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), and we did not pursue this enzyme further in our study. In our screen, a number of DUBs that have been described as H2A DUBs in various cellular contexts (31Scheuermann J.C. de Ayala Alonso A.G. Oktaba K. Ly-Hartig N. McGinty R.K. Fraterman S. Wilm M.

The many faces of ubiquitinated histone H2A: insights from the DUBs.Cell Div. 2008; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) did not abrogate 53BP1 focus formation when overexpressed (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the mere ability of a DUB to target monoubiquitylated H2A is not sufficient to prevent 53BP1 recruitment to DSB sites and/or that the activity of these DUBs may be highly dependent on cofactors or the cellular context. USP3 is known to directly deubiquitylate H2A, whereas OTUB1 counteracts 53BP1 focus formation in a noncanonical manner involving disruption of the interaction between the E2 enzyme Ubc13 and cognate E3 ligases such as RNF168 (21Nakada S.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1972-1977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of OTUB1 to impair 53BP1 recruitment into IRIF did not require its catalytic activity as expected, in contrast to USP44, USP29, and USP3, the CI forms of which all failed to suppress formation of 53BP1 foci (Fig. 1, C and D). We conclude from these experiments that USP44, USP29, and USP26 are novel DUBs whose activities antagonize ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB-modified chromatin. We next attempted to identify the intervention points of USP44 and USP29 in the RNF8/RNF168-mediated ubiquitylation pathway that promotes 53BP1 recruitment to sites of DNA damage. Using a cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged RNF8, we noted that overexpression of USP44 or USP29 did not interfere with RNF8 accumulation at DSBs (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the ability of cells to concentrate the downstream ubiquitin ligase RNF168 in IR-induced foci was severely compromised in cells overexpressing active USP44 or USP29 (Fig. 2, C and D). This indicates that USP44 and USP29 counteract the ubiquitin-dependent step leading to RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites downstream of RNF8, reminiscent of the effect of knockdown of key regulatory factors including PIAS4 and HERC2, which impair DSB-induced histone ubiquitylation (33Bekker-Jensen S.

https://openalex.org/W2095976536,"Endothelial adhesion is necessary for the hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells. However, the metastatic breast tumor cell MDA-MB-231 does not bind to the endothelium under physiological flow conditions, suggesting alternate mechanisms of adhesion. Since monocytes are highly represented in the tumor microenvironment, and also bind to endothelium during inflammation, we hypothesized that the monocytes assist in the arrest of MDA-MB-231 on the endothelium. Using in vitro models of the dynamic shear environment of the vasculature, we show that TNF-α-activated THP1/primary human monocytes and MDA-MB-231 cells form stable aggregates, and that the monocytes in these aggregates mediate the adhesion of otherwise nonadherent MDA-MB-231 cells to inflamed endothelium under flow (55±2.4 vs. 1.7±0.82 at a shear stress of 0.5 dyn/cm(2), P<0.01). We also show that the hydrodynamic forces determine the size and orientation of aggregates adhered to the endothelium, and strongly favor the attachment of small aggregates with tumor cells downstream of flow (74-86% doublets at 0.5-2 dyn/cm(2), P<0.01). The 5-fold up-regulation of ICAM-1 on TNF-α-activated MDA-MB-231 cells through the Nf-κB pathway was found to be critical in MDA-MB-231-monocyte aggregation and endothelial adhesion. Our results demonstrate that, under inflammatory conditions, monocytes may serve to disseminate tumor cells through circulation, and the tumor-monocyte-endothelial axis may represent a new therapeutic target to reduce cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2082537419,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway of non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation, playing an important role in a variety of cellular responses including cell division, proliferation, and apoptosis. Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) is a component of proteasome regulatory subunit 19 S that regulates deubiquitinated proteins entering inside the proteasome core 20 S. The role of USP14 in protein degradation is still controversial. Several studies suggest that USP14 plays an inhibitory role in protein degradation. Here, in contrast, overexpression of USP14 induced I-κB degradation, which increased cytokine release in lung epithelial cells. Overexpression of HA-tagged USP14 (HA-USP14) reduced I-κB protein levels by increasing the I-κB degradation rate in mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE12). I-κB polyubiquitination was reduced in HA-USP14-overexpressed MLE12 cells, suggesting that USP14 regulates I-κB degradation by removing its ubiquitin chain, thus promoting the deubiquitinated I-κB degradation within the proteasome. Interestingly, we found that USP14 was associated with RelA, a binding partner of I-κB, suggesting that RelA is the linker between USP14 and I-κB. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induced serine phosphorylation of USP14 as well as further reducing I-κB levels in HA-USP14-overexpressed MLE12 cells as compared with empty vector transfected cells. Further, overexpression of HA-USP14 increased the LPS-, TNFα-, or Escherichia coli-induced IL-8 release in human lung epithelial cells. This study suggests that USP14 removes the ubiquitin chain of I-κB, therefore inducing I-κB degradation and increasing cytokine release in lung epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023485399,"Maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) seems associated with reduced birthweight in the offspring. This observation, however, is based on conventional epidemiological analyses, and it might be confounded by unobserved maternal characteristics related to both smoking habits and offspring birth weight. Therefore, we apply a quasi-experimental sibling analysis to revisit previous findings. Using the Swedish Medical Birth Register, we identified 677,922 singletons born between 2002 and 2010 from native Swedish mothers. From this population, we isolated 62,941 siblings from 28,768 mothers with discrepant habits of SDP. We applied conventional and mother-specific multilevel linear regression models to investigate the association between maternal SDP and offspring birthweight. Depending on the mother was light or heavy smoker and the timing of exposition during pregnancy (i.e., first or third trimester), the effect of smoking on birthweight reduction was between 6 and 78 g less marked in the sibling analysis than in the conventional analysis. Sibling analysis showed that continuous smoking reduces birthweight by 162 grams for mothers who were light smokers (1 to 9 cigarettes per day) and 226 g on average for those who were heavy smokers throughout the pregnancy in comparison to non-smoker mothers. Quitting smoking during pregnancy partly counteracted the smoking-related birthweight reduction by 1 to 29 g, and a subsequent smoking relapse during pregnancy reduced birthweight by 77 to 83 g. The sibling analysis provides strong evidence that maternal SDP reduces offspring birthweight, though this reduction was not as great as that observed in the conventional analysis. Our findings support public health interventions aimed to prevent SDP and to persuade those who already smoke to quit and not relapse throughout the pregnancy. Besides, further analyses are needed in order to explain the mechanisms through which smoking reduces birthweight and to identify other maternal characteristics that are common causes of both birthweight reduction and maternal smoking."

The largest of these clouds was observed twice; its brightness and cant angle evolved in a manner consistent with this hypothesis. Several arguments suggest that these clouds cannot be due to the primary impact of one solid meteoroid onto the rings, but rather are due to the impact of a compact stream of Saturn-orbiting material derived from previous breakup of a meteoroid. The responsible interplanetary meteoroids were initially between 1 centimeter and several meters in size, and their influx rate is consistent with the sparse prior knowledge of smaller meteoroids in the outer solar system."

https://openalex.org/W1987453771,"Carbohydrate structures play important roles in many biological processes, including cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, and host-pathogen interactions. Sugar nucleotides are activated forms of sugars used by the cell as donors for most glycosylation reactions. Using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based method, we identified and quantified the pools of UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, GDP-mannose, and GDP-fucose in Plasmodium falciparum intraerythrocytic life stages. We assembled these data with the in silico functional reconstruction of the parasite metabolic pathways obtained from the P. falciparum annotated genome, exposing new active biosynthetic routes crucial for further glycosylation reactions. Fucose is a sugar present in glycoconjugates often associated with recognition and adhesion events. Thus, the GDP-fucose precursor is essential in a wide variety of organisms. P. falciparum presents homologues of GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-l-fucose synthase enzymes that are active in vitro, indicating that most GDP-fucose is formed by a de novo pathway that involves the bioconversion of GDP-mannose. Homologues for enzymes involved in a fucose salvage pathway are apparently absent in the P. falciparum genome. This is in agreement with in vivo metabolic labeling experiments showing that fucose is not significantly incorporated by the parasite. Fluorescence microscopy of epitope-tagged versions of P. falciparum GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-l-fucose synthase expressed in transgenic 3D7 parasites shows that these enzymes localize in the cytoplasm of P. falciparum during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. Although the function of fucose in the parasite is not known, the presence of GDP-fucose suggests that the metabolite may be used for further fucosylation reactions.Background: GDP-fucose and other sugar nucleotide biosynthetic pathways are conserved in the P. falciparum genome.Results: These pathways are active in the intraerythrocytic life cycle of the parasite.Conclusion: The parasite biosynthesizes GDP-fucose and other sugar nucleotides not related to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol structuresSignificance: Their presence strongly suggests that they are involved in the biosynthesis of glycans not yet characterized.

Fucose is a sugar present in glycoconjugates often associated with recognition and adhesion events. Thus, the GDP-fucose precursor is essential in a wide variety of organisms. P. falciparum presents homologues of GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-l-fucose synthase enzymes that are active in vitro, indicating that most GDP-fucose is formed by a de novo pathway that involves the bioconversion of GDP-mannose. Homologues for enzymes involved in a fucose salvage pathway are apparently absent in the P. falciparum genome. This is in agreement with in vivo metabolic labeling experiments showing that fucose is not significantly incorporated by the parasite. Fluorescence microscopy of epitope-tagged versions of P. falciparum GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-l-fucose synthase expressed in transgenic 3D7 parasites shows that these enzymes localize in the cytoplasm of P. falciparum during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. Although the function of fucose in the parasite is not known, the presence of GDP-fucose suggests that the metabolite may be used for further fucosylation reactions. Background: GDP-fucose and other sugar nucleotide biosynthetic pathways are conserved in the P. falciparum genome. Results: These pathways are active in the intraerythrocytic life cycle of the parasite. Conclusion: The parasite biosynthesizes GDP-fucose and other sugar nucleotides not related to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol structures Significance: Their presence strongly suggests that they are involved in the biosynthesis of glycans not yet characterized. Malaria is a global health problem caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of infection, and there are around 200 million cases annually, leading to more than half a million deaths each year (1World Health Organization World Malaria Report 2011. World Health Organization, Geneva2011Crossref Google Scholar). Most of the people who die are children living in resource-poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Among the five Plasmodium species that cause malaria in humans (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium knowlesi), P. falciparum is the most deadly and is responsible for the majority of the malaria-linked deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (1World Health Organization World Malaria Report 2011. World Health Organization, Geneva2011Crossref Google Scholar). Chemotherapy is one of the central strategies for malaria treatment, but unfortunately, drug resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs has spread very rapidly (2Price R.N. Douglas N.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14452-14461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), O-glycans have never been unequivocally described in P. falciparum. Thus, although there have been significant efforts to understand the glycobiology of the parasite, several questions on this topic remain unanswered. Sugar nucleotides, the essential intermediates in carbohydrate metabolism and glycoconjugate biosynthesis, are activated forms of sugars produced by the cell as donor precursors for most of the glycosylation reactions. They are formed in two main ways: by a salvage pathway involving “activation” of the sugar using a kinase and a pyrophosphorylase or by a de novo pathway involving the bioconversion of an existing sugar or sugar nucleotide. Specific P. falciparum metabolic databases (25Ginsburg H. Progress in in silico functional genomics. The malaria metabolic pathways database.Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 238-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), based on the parasite genome sequence, predict the conservation of the de novo biosynthetic pathways for UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine, GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose, and UDP-glucose. Most of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for the enzymes involved in these pathways are also present in other Plasmodium species (P. vivax, P. knowlesi, Plasmodium chabaudi, Plasmodium yoelii, and Plasmodium berghei) (26Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Fischer S. Kissinger J.C. Heiges M. Aurrecoechea C. Gajria B. Roos D.S. PlasmoDB v5. New looks, new genomes.Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are conserved and encode for proteins playing important roles in the parasite. Indeed, UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine and GDP-mannose (through its product dolichol-phosphomannose) are essential donor substrates for the biosynthesis of GPI structures (27Ferguson M.A. The structure, biosynthesis and functions of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, and the contributions of trypanosome research.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because sugar nucleotides are the “basic building blocks” of glycoconjugates, the conservation of their biosynthetic metabolic routes strongly suggests the existence of further downstream glycosylation reactions in which these metabolites are involved (i.e. glycan biosynthesis). In this work, we identify and quantify the sugar nucleotides present in different stages of the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based assay, and we present the results in the context of the functional metabolic pathways reconstructed from the genome of the parasite. We demonstrate that P. falciparum is unable to take up significant amounts of tritiated fucose from the culture media. Furthermore, we show that the putative GDP-fucose biosynthesis enzymes are functional in vitro, by expressing them and detecting GDP-fucose production. Endogenous forms of these enzymes localize to the cytosol of P. falciparum. We show that the genes encoding these enzymes are expressed at low abundance, and their levels are modulated throughout the red blood cell stages of the parasite. Finally, we also demonstrate that the parasite expresses a protein o-fucosyltransferase homolog, and schizont extracts incorporate tritiated GDP-fucose. P. falciparum 3D7 (obtained from MR4-ATCC) parasites were cultured with human erythrocytes (3–4% hematocrit) in RPMI medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% AB+ human serum, incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 92% N2, 3% O2, and 5% CO2 using standard methods (28Trager W. Jensen J.B. Human malaria parasites in continuous culture.Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar). For sugar nucleotide analysis and labeling experiments, parasites were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen) to avoid possible variations due to the uses of different human serum batches. Parasite growth was monitored by counting the infected erythrocytes in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears under light microscopy. Osmotic lysis of red blood cells of sorbitol-synchronized cultures at different stages of the intraerythrocytic life cycle (rings, trophozoites, and schizonts, approximately 18, 35, and 44 h postinvasion, respectively) and 10–12% parasitemia was performed by resuspending erythrocyte pellet twice in 60 volumes of cold erythrocyte lysis buffer (10× stock solution: 0.15 m NH4Cl, 0.1 m KHCO3, 0.01 m EDTA). Non-infected red blood cells were lysed and included as controls in every analysis to discard noise due to the detection of sugar nucleotides carried away from the erythrocytes. The suspension was incubated on ice until lysis was completed (∼10 min) (29Di Girolamo F. Raggi C. Birago C. Pizzi E. Lalle M. Picci L. Pace T. Bachi A. de Jong J. Janse C.J. Waters A.P.

Pellets were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and sugar nucleotide analysis was performed as described elsewhere (30Turnock D.C. Ferguson M.A. Sugar nucleotide pools of Trypanosoma bruceiTrypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania major.Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1450-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasite pellets were lysed in 70% ethanol in the presence of 20 pmol of GDP-glucose internal standard, and sugar nucleotides were extracted using Envi-Carb columns (31Räbinä J. Mäki M.

The peak areas for each sugar nucleotide, along with their empirically determined molar relative response factors and the known amount of internal GDP-glucose, were used to quantify sugar nucleotides. Analyses were performed on three different sugar nucleotide extracts. Parasite cultures at 10–12% parasitemia were synchronized to the ring state and then washed and resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with Albumax II. Cells were incubated at 3–4% hematocrit for 16–18 h, until the trophozoite stage. The parasites were then washed with glucose-free RPMI supplemented with Albumax II and 20 mm fructose, and they were metabolically labeled with 3H-sugars (50 μCi/ml) for 1 or 4 h, adapting the conditions used in previous work (23Gowda D.C.

Triplicates of each condition were included, and controls were “mock-labeled” for a few seconds using medium at 4 °C supplemented with an excess (100-fold) of the unlabeled (cold) sugar. Labeled cultures and controls were washed three times with PBS at 4 °C and treated with saponin to release parasites. Free parasites were washed again three times with PBS at 4 °C and lysed, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To calculate the amount of sugar incorporated into the glycoprotein and glycolipid compartments, after the labeling, free parasites were further lysed, and the proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and filtered (glycoproteins), or the glycolipids were extracted with organic solvents (glycolipids) (34Azzouz N.

Cells were harvested and lysed in PBS including 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysis was ensured by sonication (Misonix Microson XL 2000). 0.5% Triton X-100 was added, and, after a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was added to 1 ml of PBS-washed GST beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected in chromatography columns, washed with >10 bead volumes of PBS before three elutions of 1 ml with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.

https://openalex.org/W2079595449,"Human IgG is a bivalent molecule that has two identical Fab domains connected by a dimeric Fc domain. For therapeutic purposes, however, the bivalency of IgG and Fc fusion proteins could cause undesired properties. We therefore engineered the conversion of the natural dimeric Fc domain to a highly soluble monomer by introducing two Asn-linked glycans onto the hydrophobic C(H)3-C(H)3 dimer interface. The monomeric Fc (monoFc) maintained the binding affinity for neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in a pH-dependent manner. We solved the crystal structure of monoFc, which explains how the carbohydrates can stabilize the protein surface and provides the rationale for molecular recognition between monoFc and FcRn. The monoFc prolonged the in vivo half-life of an antibody Fab domain, and a tandem repeat of the monoFc further prolonged the half-life. This monoFc modality can be used to improve the pharmacokinetics of monomeric therapeutic proteins with an option to modulate the degree of half-life extension."
https://openalex.org/W2050293409,"In the developing and adult CNS multipotent neural stem cells reside in distinct niches. Specific carbohydrates and glycoproteins are expressed in these niche microenvironments which are important regulators of stem cell maintenance and differentiation fate. LewisX (LeX), also known as stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 or CD15, is a defined carbohydrate moiety expressed in niche microenvironments of the developing and adult CNS. LeX-glycans are involved in stem cell proliferation, migration, and stemness. A few LeX carrier proteins are known, but a systematic analysis of the targets of LeX glycosylation in vivo has not been performed so far. Using LeX glycosylation as a biomarker we aimed to discover new glycoproteins with a potential functional relevance for CNS development. By immunoaffinity chromatography we enriched LeX glycoproteins from embryonic and postnatal mouse brains and used one-dimensional nLC-ESI-MS/MS for their identification. We could validate phosphacan, tenascin-C, and L1-CAM as major LeX carrier proteins present in vivo. Furthermore, we identified LRP1, a member of the LDL receptor family, as a new LeX carrier protein expressed by mouse neural stem cells. Surprisingly, little is known about LRP1 function for neural stem cells. Thus, we generated Lrp1 knock-out neural stem cells by Cre-mediated recombination and investigated their properties. Here, we provide first evidence that LRP1 is necessary for the differentiation of neural stem cells toward oligodendrocytes. However, this function is independent of LeX glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2052165604,"The nuclei of most vertebrate cells contain members of the high mobility group N (HMGN) protein family, which bind specifically to nucleosome core particles and affect chromatin structure and function, including transcription. Here, we study the biological role of this protein family by systematic analysis of phenotypes and tissue transcription profiles in mice lacking functional HMGN variants. Phenotypic analysis of Hmgn1(tm1/tm1), Hmgn3(tm1/tm1), and Hmgn5(tm1/tm1) mice and their wild type littermates with a battery of standardized tests uncovered variant-specific abnormalities. Gene expression analysis of four different tissues in each of the Hmgn(tm1/tm1) lines reveals very little overlap between genes affected by specific variants in different tissues. Pathway analysis reveals that loss of an HMGN variant subtly affects expression of numerous genes in specific biological processes. We conclude that within the biological framework of an entire organism, HMGNs modulate the fidelity of the cellular transcriptional profile in a tissue- and HMGN variant-specific manner."

https://openalex.org/W2146523001,"Imprinted genes are monoallelically expressed according to the parent of origin and are critical for proper placental and embryonic development. Disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted loci resulting in loss of imprinting (LOI) may lead to serious imprinting disorders (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome) and is described in some cancers (e.g., Wilms' tumor). As most research has focused on children with cancer or other abnormal phenotypes, the imprinting status in healthy infants at birth has not been characterized. We examined the prevalence of H19 and IGF2 LOI at birth by allele-specific expression assays analysis on 114 human individuals. Overall expression and methylation analyses were performed on a subset of samples. We found that LOI of H19 was observed for 4% of individuals in cord blood and 3.3% in placenta, and for IGF2 of 22% of individuals in the cord blood and 0% in placenta. Interestingly, LOI status did not correspond to aberrant methylation levels of the imprinted DMRs or with changes in overall gene expression for the majority of individuals. Our observations suggest that LOI is present in phenotypically healthy infants. Determining a “normal” human epigenotype range is important for discovering factors required to maintain a healthy pregnancy and embryonic development.—Rancourt, R. C., Harris, H.

https://openalex.org/W2093948920,"Lock and Load in the Cold Muscle extensibility can act as an energy storage vehicle, like springs bouncing back after being compressed. George et al. (p. 1217 , published online 25 April) now show that energy can also be stored within muscles as a function of their natural temperature gradient. In hawkmoth muscle myofilaments, reduced cross-bridge cycling regionally constrains myofilaments, resulting in a ""lock-spring lattice"" that enables elastic energy storage as both the myofilaments and cross-bridges deform. Elastic energy stored in cross-bridges that remain bound and elastically deformed at the end of the first half of a contraction cycle can be released during the second half, thus serving as an additional elastic force. Such ""bonus"" energy may be especially important given the high energetic demands of flight, but because temperature gradients are a natural result of energy generation and heat dissipation in muscle, this mechanism could be more broadly important in locomotion systems."
https://openalex.org/W1987856636,"Recent studies showed that deletion of ISC1, the yeast homologue of the mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase, resulted in an increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU). This raised an intriguing question as to whether sphingolipids are involved in pathways initiated by HU. In this study, we show that HU treatment led to a significant increase in Isc1 activity. Analysis of sphingolipid deletion mutants and pharmacological analysis pointed to a role for ceramide in mediating HU resistance.

Significance: This is the first specific sphingolipid species identified to play a role in the genotoxic response pathway. Bioactive sphingolipids constitute an important group of regulatory molecules in the eukaryotic cell, and they have been implicated in a multitude of cellular functions ranging from regulation of cell growth to angiogenesis, inflammation, and responses to stress stimuli. The group of bioactive sphingolipids includes ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, sphingosine, and ceramide 1-phosphate. Overall, ceramide has been appreciated as a transducer of stress stimuli; however, recent biochemical and analytical studies have revealed significant complexity and diversity in ceramide structure, and we have recently proposed that ceramides are actually a family of closely related molecules that may mediate distinct functions. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as a powerful model in the study of sphingolipid metabolism and function. Indeed, most of the key enzymes of metabolism of bioactive sphingolipids were initially identified in yeast (1Dickson R.C. Sphingolipid functions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: comparison with mammals.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Also, stress stimuli in yeast, such as heat stress, have been shown to regulate the acute production of bioactive sphingolipids, which in turn have been implicated in mediating many key responses such as cell cycle arrest, regulation of translation, and regulation of nutrient permeases (2Jenkins G.M.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we described a role for ISC1 in the genotoxic stress response to both the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor HU and the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (13Matmati N. Kitagaki H. Montefusco D. Mohanty B.K. Hannun Y.A. Hydroxyurea sensitivity reveals a role for ISC1 in the regulation of G2/M.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8241-8246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Isc1 has also been found to be involved in cellular morphogenesis under genotoxic stress (14Tripathi K. Matmati N. Zheng W.J. Hannun Y.A. Mohanty B.K. Cellular morphogenesis under stress is influenced by the sphingolipid pathway gene ISC1 and DNA integrity checkpoint genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2011; 189: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Deletion of the ISC1 gene conferred sensitivity to HU, mediated by the activation of a latent G2/M checkpoint. Mechanistically, the results implicated persistent phosphorylation on tyrosine 19 of the cyclin-dependent kinase Clb2-Cdc28, a known activator of the G2/M checkpoint (13Matmati N. Kitagaki H. Montefusco D. Mohanty B.K. Hannun Y.A. Hydroxyurea sensitivity reveals a role for ISC1 in the regulation of G2/M.J. Biol.

In turn, this was traced to persistent activation of the Swe1 kinase responsible for phosphorylating Clb2-Cdc28. Either mutation of the phosphorylation site tyrosine 19 of Clb2-Cdc28 or the deletion of SWE1 was able to rescue the growth defect of isc1Δ on HU. These results indicated that Isc1 regulates phosphorylation of Clb2-Cdc28 and the G2/M checkpoint activation mediated by controlling Swe1 activity. This unexpected involvement of an enzyme of lipid metabolism in mediating the response to HU raised a number of important questions. Here, we address the question of whether Isc1 mediates response to HU action as a downstream effector. We also endeavor to determine the specific lipid mediator of Isc1 in response to HU and the downstream targets of the lipid mediator involved in Swe1 level regulation. To address these questions, we employed biochemical and genetic approaches. The results demonstrated activation of Isc1 in response to HU. Genetic analysis suggested that phytoceramides were the likely mediators. Because yeast contain many species of ceramides, distinguished by the length of the fatty acyl group, α-hydroxylation of the fatty acid, and the hydroxylation of the sphingoid base, we employed a lipidomic approach. These results suggested more specifically a role for phytoceramide, but not dihydroceramides or α-hydroxyceramides, in the HU response. We next developed an approach to selectively enrich yeast cells in specific ceramides by providing selected fatty acid precursors. These results specifically supported a role for C18:1-phytoceramide in mediating the HU response. Our data define a highly specific pathway of sphingolipid metabolism in the response to HU and implicate Cdc55, the regulatory subunit of phosphatase PP2A, as the downstream target of C18:1-phytoceramide. The implications of these results for the delineation of ceramide-specific pathways are also discussed.

The plate was put in a cassette with a autoradiography film and incubated at −80 °C for 5 days. All data represent the median of at least three independent experiments unless otherwise stated on the figure legend. GraphPad Prism software was used in all illustrations. To determine whether ISC1 is involved in a regulatory pathway downstream of HU, we investigated the effects of HU on Isc1 activity. An in vitro enzymatic assay was performed in WT cells overexpressing ISC1, and the results showed a net increase in Isc1 activity in response to HU starting at 90 min, and the activity remained elevated throughout the time course that lasted 20 h as shown (Fig. 1A). To investigate if the Isc1 enzymatic activity is required for its role in protecting cells from HU toxicity, catalytically inactive mutants of Isc1 were expressed in an isc1Δ strain transformed with a pYES2 vector containing wild type ISC1 and the two inactive mutants, ISC1-G163A and ISC1-K168A. Neither catalytically inactive mutant was able to protect cells from HU toxicity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, wild type ISC1 allowed cells to resume growth on HU. The level of IPC, MIPC, and M(IP)2C decreased significantly when WT cells were treated with HU after 3 h (Fig. 1C). This change in complex sphingolipid due to HU treatment corresponds to the increase of Isc1 activity after HU. These results indicate that HU treatment increases activity of Isc1 and that this activity is needed to protect cells from HU toxicity. Because HU activated Isc1, it became important to determine the candidate lipid mediators of Isc1 action. This is a particularly difficult issue with bioactive sphingolipids because these molecules are interconvertible in cells. For example, the production of ceramide by Isc1 may result in further metabolism to sphingoid bases and then to their phosphates (long chain base phosphates) by the action of ceramidases and sphingoid base kinases, respectively. To pinpoint the functionally relevant class of sphingolipids, we adopted a combined genetic and pharmacological approach using deletion, inhibition, and overexpression of key enzymes involved in interconversion of bioactive sphingolipids. Analysis of the deletion mutants dpl1Δ, scs7Δ, sur1Δ, ipt1Δ, lag1Δ, lac1Δ, ysr3Δ, lcb3Δ, lcb4Δ, lcb5Δ, fen1Δ, sur2Δ, sur4Δ, csh1Δ, csg2Δ, ypc1Δ, and ydc1Δ (Fig. 2, A and B) revealed no effects for most of these genes except for dpl1Δ and sur4Δ, which were sensitive to HU. DPL1 is the dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate/phytosphingosine 1-phosphate lyase gene that catalyzes the formation of fatty aldehydes and phosphoethanolamine in yeast (20Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. The BST1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase.J. Biol.

The DPL1 gene is involved in mediating the response to nutrient deprivation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The dpl1Δ sensitivity to HU suggests that a generation of fatty aldehydes and/or ethanolamine phosphate or accumulation of sphingoid base phosphates can affect cellular responses to HU. The Sur4 enzyme catalyzes the fatty acid elongation step and is implicated in the production of dihydroceramides and phytoceramides with longer chain fatty acids (longer than C16) (22Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. ELO2 and ELO3, homologues of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ELO1 gene, function in fatty acid elongation and are required for sphingolipid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible importance of these particular ceramides in cell protection from HU. Furthermore, we found that double deletion of LAG1 and LAC1, the two highly homologous enzymes that codify for the acyl-CoA-ceramide synthase, also rendered cells more sensitive to HU (Fig. 2C). It is worthy of notice that the double mutant has a slow growth phenotype but was highly sensitive to HU treatment. Double deletion of LCB4 and LCB5, the two long chain base kinases that catalyze the production of the phosphorylated forms of phytosphingosine or dihydrosphingosine, showed no sensitivity to HU (Fig. 2D). Excluding results with dpl1Δ, analysis of all the other enzymes (Isc1, Sur4, Lag1, Lac1, Ypc1, and Ydc1) that showed sensitivity or resistance to the drug points specifically at ceramide as the product involved in HU response and not sphingoid bases or more complex sphingolipid species. The results also rule out a specific role for α-hydroxyceramide because SCS7 deletion mutant showed no response to HU treatment. To confirm that ceramides are important for protecting cells from HU toxicity, a pharmacological approach was additionally employed using fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthases. The results (Fig. 2E) showed that fumonisin B1-treated WT cells became sensitive to HU. Taken together, these results suggest that one or more ceramides play critical roles in cell survival in response to HU. Interestingly, deletion of the two ceramidases YPC1 and YDC1 rendered cells more resistant to HU. This was observed during the initial screening of sphingolipid deletion mutants (Fig. 2B) and was confirmed with additional spot tests illustrated in Fig. 2F. These results clearly support a role for ceramide and not further downstream metabolites (such as sphingoid bases or their phosphates) in mediating the resistance to HU. These are also corroborated by the studies with fumonisin B1. These results in turn suggested that YPC1 and/or YDC1 overexpression would make cells more sensitive because of the increased Ypc1 and/or Ydc1 activity and the consequent decrease of phytoceramide and/or dihydroceramide levels. When wild type cells overexpressed YPC1, they became more sensitive to HU (Fig. 2G). Thus, these results again support a role for ceramide and not further downstream products. Very interestingly, and in contrast to the results with YPC1, overexpression of YDC1 had no effect on the sensitivity of wild type cells to HU (Fig. 2G). These results begin to distinguish among “ceramide” species in the HU response by providing evidence that phytoceramides (the preferred substrates of YPC1) and not dihydroceramides (the preferred substrates of YDC1) (23Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Szulc Z.M. Obeid L.M. Cloning and characterization of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae alkaline ceramidase with specificity for dihydroceramide.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31369-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) are the candidate mediators of the action of Isc1 in response to HU. A map illustrating the yeast sphingolipid pathway indicates the responses to the sphingolipid deletion mutants (sensitivity or resistance) to HU (Fig. 3). Based on the above results, it became important to determine whether a subset of ceramide molecular species was involved in the HU response. In yeast, ceramides can exist in at least 40 distinct molecular species based on the length of the fatty acyl chain, hydroxylation of the sphingoid base (phyto series), and hydroxylation of the fatty acyl group (α-hydroxy series) (24Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Many ceramides.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27855-27862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Therefore, the sphingolipid response to HU was analyzed in the wild type and in isc1Δ cells, using LC-tandem mass spectrometry. Several ceramide species showed some changes in the various conditions; therefore, we elected to focus on specific ceramides that would show the following patter"

Previously, IRS2 has been identified as a 14-3-3 interaction protein. 14-3-3 proteins can bind their target proteins via phosphorylated serine/threonine residues located within distinct motifs. In this study the binding of 14-3-3 to IRS2 upon stimulation with forskolin or the cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP was demonstrated in HEK293 cells. Binding was reduced with PKA inhibitors H89 or Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. Phosphorylation of IRS2 on PKA consensus motifs was induced by forskolin and the PKA activator N(6)-Phe-cAMP and prevented by both PKA inhibitors. The amino acid region after position 952 on IRS2 was identified as the 14-3-3 binding region by GST-14-3-3 pulldown assays. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine 1137 and serine 1138 as cAMP-dependent, potential PKA phosphorylation sites. Mutation of serine 1137/1138 to alanine strongly reduced the cAMP-dependent 14-3-3 binding. Application of cycloheximide revealed that forskolin enhanced IRS2 protein stability in HEK293 cells stably expressing IRS2 as well as in primary hepatocytes. Stimulation with forskolin did not increase protein stability either in the presence of a 14-3-3 antagonist or in the double 1137/1138 alanine mutant. Thus the reduced IRS2 protein degradation was dependent on the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and the presence of serine 1137/1138. We present serine 1137/1138 as novel cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on IRS2 and show their importance in 14-3-3 binding and IRS2 protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W1966066902,"Disulfide bonds are important for the stability of many extracellular proteins, including bacterial virulence factors. Formation of these bonds is catalyzed by thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (TDORs). Little is known about their formation in Gram-positive bacteria, particularly among facultative anaerobic Firmicutes, such as streptococci. To investigate disulfide bond formation in Streptococcus gordonii, we identified five putative TDORs from the sequenced genome. Each of the putative TDOR genes was insertionally inactivated with an erythromycin resistance cassette, and the mutants were analyzed for autolysis, extracellular DNA release, biofilm formation, bacteriocin production, and genetic competence. This analysis revealed a single TDOR, SdbA, which exhibited a pleiotropic mutant phenotype. Using an in silico analysis approach, we identified the major autolysin AtlS as a natural substrate of SdbA and showed that SdbA is critical to the formation of a disulfide bond that is required for autolytic activity. Analysis by BLAST search revealed homologs to SdbA in other Gram-positive species. This study provides the first in vivo evidence of an oxidoreductase, SdbA, that affects multiple phenotypes in a Gram-positive bacterium. SdbA shows low sequence homology to previously identified oxidoreductases, suggesting that it may belong to a different class of enzymes. Our results demonstrate that SdbA is required for disulfide bond formation in S. gordonii and indicate that this enzyme may represent a novel type of oxidoreductase in Gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1987615701,"PKS11 is one of three type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although many PKSs in M. tuberculosis have been implicated in producing complex cell wall glycolipids, the biological function of PKS11 is unknown. PKS11 has previously been proposed to synthesize alkylpyrones from fatty acid substrates. We solved the crystal structure of M. tuberculosis PKS11 and found the overall fold to be similar to other type III PKSs. PKS11 has a deep hydrophobic tunnel proximal to the active site Cys-138 to accommodate substrates. We observed electron density in this tunnel from a co-purified molecule that was identified by mass spectrometry to be palmitate. Co-crystallization with malonyl-CoA (MCoA) or methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) led to partial turnover of the substrate, resulting in trapped intermediates. Reconstitution of the reaction in solution confirmed that both co-factors are required for optimal activity, and kinetic analysis shows that MMCoA is incorporated first, then MCoA, followed by lactonization to produce methyl-branched alkylpyrones."

Similarly, in humans, mutations in genes coding for the growth hormone receptor, Igf-I, or Igf-I receptor are associated with reduced retinal neovascularization (6Hellström A. Carlsson B.

IGF-I is a potent inductor of the expression of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF, through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α stabilization (7Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Monthouël-Kartmann M.N.

In addition to the effects on VEGF transcription, IGF-I may act cooperatively with VEGF to stabilize newly formed vessels (4Smith L.E. Shen W. Perruzzi C. Soker S. Kinose F. Xu X. Robinson G.

Transgenic mice overexpressing Igf-I in photoreceptors (TgIGF-I) have increased intraocular VEGF levels and develop many of the retinal vascular alterations characteristic of human diabetic eye disease, despite not being hyperglycemic (14Ruberte J.

Nonproliferative vascular alterations are found in young animals (2–3 months), and the phenotype progresses to overt pre-retinal neovascularization in adult mice (7–8 months) (14Ruberte J. Ayuso E.

Gliosis is observed in Igf-I -overexpressing retinas at nonproliferative stages, before neovascularization occurs, suggesting that Igf-I overexpression is likely causing other alterations on transgenic retinas that contribute to the phenotype.

We observed a progressive decline in ERG amplitudes in transgenic animals, leading to complete loss of response in old animals. This study demonstrates that the chronic overproduction of IGF-I in the retina induces a series of deleterious cellular processes, independent of neovascularization, that eventually surpass IGF-I pro-survival properties leading to neurodegeneration. CD1 heterozygous mice overexpressing Igf-I in the retina were used (14Ruberte J. Ayuso E. Navarro M. Carretero A. Nacher V. Haurigot V. George M. Llombart C. Casellas A. Costa C. Bosch A. Bosch F.

Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee in Animal and Human Experimentation of Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. ERG recordings were performed in deeply anesthetized and dark-adapted mice. Recordings were taken between a mouse electrode fixed on a corneal lens over the mouse eye (Burian-Allen electrode, Hansen Ophthalmic Development Lab), a reference electrode located in the mouth, and a ground electrode located in the tail. After pupil dilatation, flash-induced ERG responses were recorded from the right eye in response to light stimuli produced with a Ganzfeld stimulator. Light stimuli intensities ranged from −4 to 2 log cd·s·m−2 and, for each intensity, 4–64 consecutive light presentations were averaged. Each range of flashes allowed recording of particular responses as follows: from −4 to −1.52 for rod-mediated responses; from −1.52 to 0.48 for mixed rod and cone responses; 0.48 and at a recording frequency range of 100–1000 Hz for oscillatory potentials; from −0.52 to 2 log cd·s·m−2 on a rod-saturating background of 30 cd/m2 for cone-mediated responses; and at 1.48 log cd·s·m−2 on a rod-saturating background for flicker responses (20 Hz). The ERG signals were amplified, band filtered between 0.3 and 1000 Hz (Grass CP511 AC amplifier), and digitized at 10 kHz with a Power Lab data acquisition board (ADI Instruments). ERG measurements were taken by an observer blinded to the experimental conditions of the animals. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded eye sections were incubated with tomato lectin Lycopersicon esculentum (Sigma), anti-rhodopsin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-calretinin (Invitrogen), anti-PKCα (Sigma), anti-Brn3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), GFAP (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), and anti-cleaved caspase3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) Images were obtained with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCs SP2; Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) or a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Retinal layers (INL and ONL) length was measured with NIS Elements software (Nikon) in six central and six peripheral images (×20) from retinal sections showing the optic nerve. Three measurements were performed in each image for each layer, ensuring perpendicular distances between layer limits. The length of the posterior segment of rod photoreceptors was determined by the same method in central sections. For quantification of specific neuronal populations, total positive cells were counted per 20 images of central retinal sections with optic nerve. The protocol for RNA extraction recommended by Affymetrix was followed (Expression Analysis Technical Manual). Microarray analysis was performed by Progenika (Bilbao, Spain). The final gene list contained only those probe sets with a p < 0.05. For the interpretation, cross-checking, and visualization of the data, FatiGO Term Enrichment (release date Nov. 20, 2010), Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG database), and GeneCodis were used. Array data have been submitted to GEO database (accession number GSE46246). Retinas were homogenized in 200 μl of Tripure (Roche Applied Science), and retinal RNA was purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD). cDNA was synthesized with transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche Applied Science) with specific primers. For Western blot, retinas were homogenized in lysis buffer and 50–100 μg of retinal extract were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot was performed with anti-acetyl-NF-κB (Cell Signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), anti-GFAP (DAKO Cytomation), anti-MCP-1 (Abcam), or anti-tubulin (Abcam). Detection was performed using Immobilon Western reagent (Millipore). The pixel intensity of the bands obtained was determined with GeneSnap software for Gene Genius Bio Imaging System (Syngene, Synoptics Ltd.), and the ratio protein content/tubulin content was calculated for each sample to allow loading-independent comparison. Wild-type C57 mice were sacrificed, and eyes were enucleated. Retinas were dissected and incubated in DMEM (reference E15-810, PAA) complemented with 10% FBS (PAA, ref. A15–151) and antibiotic/antimycotic (PAA, ref. P11–002) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Medium was refreshed 24 h later. After 48 h, recombinant IGF-I (Sigma) was added to DMEM without FBS. Between 2 and 5 h prior to IGF-I addition, 5 μl of 200 μm wortmannin (Sigma) or DMSO (Sigma) were added to the culture media. After 48 h of stimulation, retinas were collected and frozen at −80 °C for total RNA isolation. Protein extracts were obtained as for Western blot analysis. 40 μl of a 1:10 dilution of the extracts was added to the reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium glutamate (Sigma), 20 mm MgCl2, 15 mm ATP (Sigma), 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), 1 μl of creatine phosphokinase (Sigma). After 1–2 min of preincubation of the mixture at 37 °C, the reaction was started by adding 8 μl of 125 mm hydroxylamine. Ten minutes later, the reaction was stopped with 120 μl of ferric chloride solution (0.37 m FeCl3, 0.67 m HCl, 0.20 m trichloroacetic acid) and placed on ice for 5 min. Afterward, the supernatant was collected from the wells, and absorbance was measured at 525 nm. Values were corrected by protein content of each sample and represented as percentage of wild-type values. Oxidized glutathione was measured in retinal extracts using the glutathione (total) detection kit from Enzo Life Sciences (catalog no. ADI-900-160) following the manufacturer's instructions. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were compared by unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p values less than 0.05. Retinal neurophysiology was assessed in wild-type (WT) and TgIGF-I mice through ERG studies. Both rod and cone-driven responses were evaluated by performing measurements in scotopic and photopic conditions, respectively. At 3 months of age, transgenic mice did not show any difference in comparison with WT littermates in the amplitudes of the responses obtained with different light intensities (Fig. 1, A–F). At 6 months of age, however, responses were heterogeneous among different animals (Fig. 1, A–F). The abnormal responses in TgIGF-I mice became statistically significant at 7.5 months of age (Fig. 1, A–F). By 9 months of age, the average response in transgenic mice was reduced to about 20% of that recorded in WT animals (Fig. 1, A–F). Clearly, retinal dysfunction was progressive, from normal responses at 3 months of age to almost complete loss of response by 9 months. To evaluate if this progressive retinal neurodegeneration was the consequence of the development of neovascularization, young (1.5-month-old) TgIGF-I mice were treated intravitreally with adenoassociated viral vectors carrying the gene of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a well known antiangiogenic factor (18Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Pigment epithelium-derived factor: a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis.Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). This treatment leads to long term production of PEDF, normalization of intraocular levels of VEGF, and prevention of neovascularization and retinal detachment in this animal model (19Haurigot V. Villacampa P. Ribera A. Bosch A. Ramos D. Ruberte J. Bosch F. Long-term retinal PEDF overexpression prevents neovascularization in a murine adult model of retinopathy.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e41511Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the evaluation of ERG responses at 7.5 month of age, i.e. 6 months after gene transfer, did not reveal any recovery in PEDF-treated animals (Fig. 1G), suggesting that vascular alterations were not the main mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in transgenic retinas. The thickness of retinal layers is a general indicator of the loss of neuronal populations. ONL and INL thicknesses were quantified in both the peripheral and central areas of retinal sections containing the optic nerve (Fig. 2A). In agreement with functional observations, at 3 months, the thickness of retinal layer was preserved in TgIGF-I retinas and only a slight, nonstatistically significant decrease was observed in 6-month-old animals, mainly in the ONL (data not shown). At 7.5 months of age, retinas of TgIGF-I mice were clearly thinner, with a 40% reduction in the width of both ONL and INL (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that a chronic increase in intraocular IGF-I levels resulted in neurodegeneration of photoreceptors and other neuronal cells. To identify which type of neurons was degenerating in transgenic retinas, specific markers were used to detect and quantify different neuronal populations in 7.5-month-old animals. The length of rod photoreceptor outer segment was markedly reduced in transgenic retinas, as determined by morphometric analysis on rhodopsin-immunostained sections (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, TgIGF-I retinas had normal cone arrestin content (data not shown), indicating that cone photoreceptors were not altered. Collectively, these observations suggested that the reduced ONL thickness observed (Fig. 2A) was likely due to the loss of rods, as rods and cones are the only cell types found in this nuclear layer. Bipolar and amacrine neurons specifically express the α- isoform of protein kinase C (PKCα) and calretinin, respectively. Retinal sections from 7.5-month-old TgIGF-I animals had a reduced number of PKCα+ cells and calretinin+ neurons (Fig. 2, C and D), in agreement with a thinner INL (Fig. 2A). Bipolar cells were the only cell type for which we detected a statistically significant reduction at earlier time points (6 months, data not shown). No differences were observed in the number of horizontal neurons (data not shown). Finally, the number of ganglion cells with positive immunostaining for the transcription factor Brn3a was also lower (Fig. 2E). Immunofluorescent detection of cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, revealed few caspase-3+ cells in the GL of transgenic retinas (Fig. 3). These findings, together with the decline in ERG responses, suggested there was a progressive loss of neurons in transgenic retinas. To identify the changes in gene expression that could account for the neuronal dysfunction induced by increased intraocular IGF-I, we performed microarray analysis on total retinal RNA from 4-month-old animals. At this age, transgenic retinas do not yet show neurodegeneration but only evidence of nonproliferative vascular alterations and gliosis (14Ruberte J. Ayuso E. Navarro M. Carretero A. Nacher V. Haurigot V. George M. Llombart C. Casellas A. Costa C. Bosch A. Bosch F. Increased ocular levels of IGF-1 in transgenic mice lead to diabetes-like eye disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After data normalization and filtering, we detected 37 genes differentially expressed in transgenic retinas, of which 25 were up-regulated and 12 were down-regulated more than 1.5-fold (Table 1). Most of the up-regulated genes were classified in three main categories as follows: retinal stress, gliosis, and angiogenesis, whereas down-regulated genes were mostly associated with angiogenesis and CNS development. Several of the up-regulated genes in the category of retinal stress corresponded to acute-phase proteins, such as α2-macroglobulin, lipocalin2, and components of the complement system. Microarray results were confirmed by quantitative PCR, and the expression of up-regulated genes was studied at different ages to identify the onset of each response (Fig. 4A). For most genes, expression was increased already by 1.5 months of age, and this rise was maintained or even exacerbated through the animal's life (Fig. 4A). Gliosis-related genes, including Gfap, S100b, and Gja1, showed an up-regulation pattern parallel to that of stress and acute-phase protein genes (Fig. 4A). Some of these genes were already up-regulated in retinas from transgenic animals as young as 3 weeks old (Fig. 4B). The expression of the transcription factor CEBP-δ, one of the main transcriptional activators of acute-phase genes (20Poli V. The role of C/EBP isoforms in the control of inflammatory and native immunity functions.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), was also increased in transgenic retinas (1.35-fold increase, GEO GSE46246). CEBP-δ up-regulation was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR in both young and old transgenic mice (Fig. 4C).TABLE 1Microarray expression analysis in young transgenic miceGene descriptionGene symbolFold changep valueRefSeqStress (retinal stress)Nuclear protein 1Nupr12.030.0003NM_019738Lipocalin 2Lcn22.000.0013NM_008491Oncostatin M receptorOsmr1.590.0039NM_011019Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3Ifimt31.580.0050NM_025378Complement component 4bC4b1.760.0084NM_009780α2-MacroglobulinA2m1.730.0090NM_175628Complement component 1, q subcomponent, α-polypeptideC1qa1.550.0095NM_007572Inhibitor of DNA binding 2Id21.700.0214NM_010496Histidine decarboxylaseHdc1.500.0260NM_008230Endothelin 2Edn22.000.0497NM_007902GliosisGlial fibrillary acidic proteinGfap3.100.0014NM_010277S100 protein, β polypeptideS100b2.020.0060NM_009115Doublecortin-like kinase 1Dclk11.540.0111NM_019978Gap junction protein, α1Gja12.060.0173NM_010288Aquaporin 4Aqp41.520.0199NM_009700AngiogenesisCarbonic anhydrase 3Car3−1.590.0005NM_007606EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1Efemp11.520.0056NM_146015Rac GTPase-activating protein 1Racgap11.530.0068NM_012025α2-MacroglobulinA2m1.730.0090NM_175628Procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer proteinPcolce1.600.0215NM_008788Polycystic kidney disease 1 homologPkd1−1.580.0272NM_013630Progesterone receptor membrane component 2Pgrmc2−1.580.0348NM_027558Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factorRgnef−3.450.0426NM_012026CNS formationNardilysin, N-arginine dibasic convertase, NRD convertase 1Nrd1−1.540.0002NM_146150Sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domainSema3f−1.520.0354NM_011349Cut-like homeobox 2Cux2−1.540.0426NM_007804MiscellaneousKeratin 18Krt18−1.650.0027NM_010664CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2)-associated protein 1Cdk2ap1−1.890.0027NM_013812β2-MicroglobulinB2m1.520.0086NM_009735Actin, α2, smooth muscle, aortaActa21.510.0107NM_007392Hemoglobin α, adult chain 1Hba-a11.660.0206NM_008218Hemoglobin α, adult chain 2Hba-a21.660.0206NM_001083955RIKEN cDNA 1200015N20 gene1200015N20Rik1.550.0325NM_024244Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7Chd7−1.550.0343NM_001081417RIKEN cDNA 5830417I10 gene5830417I10Rik−2.230.0345NM_027389Mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NFKB 1Mul1−2.320.0491NM_026689 Open table in a new tab By performing functional analysis using the GeneCodis web tool (21Nogales-Cadenas R.

This analysis revealed that 10.31% of the genes modified in TgIGF-I retinas presented binding sites for CEBP transcription factors, in agreement with CEBP-δ up-regulation (Fig. 4C). The GeneCodis analysis also revealed that 6.25% of the altered genes had in their promoters target sequences for NF-κB, another transcription factor implicated in the activation of acute-phase proteins (22Moshage H.

https://openalex.org/W2055837079,"Reverse signaling through CD137 ligand (CD137L) potently activates monocytes. However, the underlying mechanism is not well elucidated. This study provides evidence that tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) acts as a coreceptor for CD137L and mediates CD137L signaling. CD137L colocalizes with TNFR1 on the plasma membrane and binds directly to TNFR1 via its extracellular domain. Using the human monocytic THP-1 cell line, we demonstrate that engagement of CD137L by recombinant CD137 protein promotes cell adhesion, apoptosis, expression of CD14, and production of IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Concomitantly, the expression of TNFR1 protein is down-regulated in response to CD137L activation, due to enhanced extracellular release and internalization of TNFR1. Activation of TNFR1 by TNF protein additively augments CD137L-induced IL-8 expression. Conversely, inhibition of TNFR1 activity by a TNFR1-neutralizing antibody inhibits CD137L-mediated cell adhesion, cell death, CD14 expression, and IL-8 production. Taken together, these data show that TNFR1 associates with CD137L and is required for CD137L reverse signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2036407628,"Osterix (Osx) is an osteoblast-specific transcriptional factor and is required for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. A JmjC domain-containing protein NO66 was previously found to participate in regulation of Osx transcriptional activity and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation through interaction with Osx. Here, we report the crystal structure of NO66 forming in a functional tetramer. A hinge domain links the N-terminal JmjC domain and C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix domain of NO66, and both domains are essential for tetrameric assembly. The oligomerization interface of NO66 interacts with a conserved fragment of Osx. We show that the hinge domain-dependent oligomerization of NO66 is essential for inhibition of Osx-dependent gene activation. Our findings suggest that homo-oligomerization of JmjC domain containing proteins might play a physiological role through interactions with other regulatory factors during gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1967102460,"Telomeres are macromolecular nucleoprotein complexes that protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes from degradation, end-to-end fusion events, and from engaging the DNA damage response. However, the assembly of this essential DNA-protein complex is poorly understood. Telomere DNA consists of the repeated double-stranded sequence 5'-TTAGGG-3' in vertebrates, followed by a single-stranded DNA overhang with the same sequence. Both double- and single-stranded regions are coated with high specificity by telomere end-binding proteins, including POT1 and TPP1, that bind as a heterodimer to single-stranded telomeric DNA. Multiple POT1-TPP1 proteins must fully coat the single-stranded telomere DNA to form a functional telomere. To better understand the mechanism of multiple binding, we mutated or deleted the two guanosine nucleotides residing between adjacent POT1-TPP1 recognition sites in single-stranded telomere DNA that are not required for multiple POT1-TPP1 binding events. Circular dichroism demonstrated that spectra from the native telomere sequence are characteristic of a G-quadruplex secondary structure, whereas the altered telomere sequences were devoid of these signatures. The altered telomere strands, however, facilitated more cooperative loading of multiple POT1-TPP1 proteins compared with the wild-type telomere sequence. Finally, we show that a 48-nucleotide DNA with a telomere sequence is more susceptible to nuclease digestion when coated with POT1-TPP1 proteins than when it is left uncoated. Together, these data suggest that POT1-TPP1 binds telomeric DNA in a coordinated manner to facilitate assembly of the nucleoprotein complexes into a state that is more accessible to enzymatic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2025207630,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the only ligand-gated ion channel that hydrolyzes its agonist, ATP. CFTR gating has been argued to be tightly coupled to its enzymatic activity, but channels do open occasionally in the absence of ATP and are reversibly activated (albeit weakly) by nonhydrolyzable nucleotides. Why the latter only weakly activates CFTR is not understood. Here we show that CFTR activation by adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), adenosine 5'-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP), and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) is enhanced substantially by gain of function (GOF) mutations in the cytosolic loops that increase unliganded activity. This enhancement correlated with the base-line nucleotide-independent activity for several GOF mutations. AMP-PNP or ATPγS activation required both nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and was disrupted by a cystic fibrosis mutation in NBD1 (G551D). GOF mutant channels deactivated very slowly upon AMP-PNP or ATPγS removal (τdeac ∼ 100 s) implying tight binding between the two NBDs. Despite this apparently tight binding, neither AMP-PNP nor ATPγS activated even the strongest GOF mutant as strongly as ATP. ATPγS-activated wild type channels deactivated more rapidly, indicating that GOF mutations in the cytosolic loops reciprocally/allosterically affect nucleotide occupancy of the NBDs. A GOF mutation substantially rescued defective ATP-dependent gating of G1349D-CFTR, a cystic fibrosis NBD2 signature sequence mutant. Interestingly, the G1349D mutation strongly disrupted activation by AMP-PNP but not by ATPγS, indicating that these analogs interact differently with the NBDs. We conclude that poorly hydrolyzable nucleotides are less effective than ATP at opening CFTR channels even when they bind tightly to the NBDs but are converted to stronger agonists by GOF mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2151495377,"Formation of the fusion pore is a central question for regulated exocytosis by which secretory cells release neurotransmitters or hormones. Here, by dynamically monitoring exocytosis of large vesicles (2-7 μM) in astrocytes with two-photon microscopy imaging, we found that the exocytotic fusion pore was generated from the SNARE-dependent fusion at a ring shape of the docked plasma-vesicular membrane and the movement of a fusion-produced membrane fragment. We observed two modes of fragment movements, 1) a shift fragment that shifted to expand the fusion pore and 2) a fall-in fragment that fell into the collapsed vesicle to expand the fusion pore. Shift and fall-in modes are associated with full and partial collapses of large vesicles, respectively. The astrocytic marker, sulforhodamine 101, stained the fusion-produced membrane fragment more brightly than FM 1-43. Sulforhodamine 101 imaging showed that double fusion pores could simultaneously occur in a single vesicle (16% of large vesicles) to accelerate discharge of vesicular contents. Electron microscopy of large astrocytic vesicles showed shift and fall-in membrane fragments. Two modes of fusion pore formation demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying fusion pore expansion and provide a new explanation for full and partial collapses of large secretory vesicles."
