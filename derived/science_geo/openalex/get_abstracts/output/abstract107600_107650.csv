https://openalex.org/W1996413533,"We cloned p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in G1 phase arrest by TGF beta and cell-cell contact. p27Kip1 associates with cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes in vivo and in vitro, prevents their activation, and inhibits previously activated complexes, and p27Kip1 overexpression obstructs cell entry into S phase. p27Kip1 potently inhibits Rb phosphorylation by cyclin E-Cdk2, cyclin A-Cdk2, and cyclin D2-Cdk4. p27Kip1 is highly conserved and broadly expressed in human tissues, and its mRNA levels are similar in proliferating and quiescent cells. p27Kip1 has a region of sequence similarity to p21Cip1/WAF1, the Cdk inhibitor whose transcription is stimulated by p53. A p27Kip1 peptide corresponding to this region retains Cdk inhibitory activity. We suggest that cell contact, TGF beta, and p53 all restrain cell proliferation through related Cdk inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2092104789,"Using a yeast interaction screen to search for proteins that interact with cyclin D1-Cdk4, we identified a 27 kDa mouse protein related to the p21 cyclin-Cdk inhibitor. p27 interacts strongly with D-type cyclins and Cdk4 in vitro and more weakly with cyclin E and Cdk2. In mouse fibroblasts, p27 is associated predominantly with cyclin D1-Cdk4. Recombinant p27 is a potent inhibitor of cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin A-Cdk2 protein kinase activity and a weaker inhibitor of cyclin B1-Cdc2. Overexpression of p27 in Saos-2 cells causes G1 arrest. p27 protein levels do not change as serum-stimulated quiescent mouse fibroblasts progress through the cell cycle. p27 is identical to p27Kip1, a cyclin-Cdk inhibitor present in TGF beta-treated cells. p27 has the hallmarks of a negative regulator of G1 progression and may mediate TGF beta-induced G1 arrest."

https://openalex.org/W2063206483,"We show that the activities of two Ets-related transcription factors required for normal eye development in Drosophila, pointed and yen, are regulated by the Ras1/MAPK pathway. The pointed gene codes for two related proteins, and we show that one form is a constitutive activator of transcription, while the activity of the other form is stimulated by the Ras1/MAPK pathway. Mutation of the single consensus MAPK phosphorylation site in the second form abrogates this responsiveness. yan is a negative regulator of photoreceptor determination, and genetic data suggest that it acts as an antagonist of Ras1. We demonstrate that yan can repress transcription and that this repression activity is negatively regulated by the Ras1/MAPK signal, most likely through direct phosphorylation of yan by MAPK."

https://openalex.org/W2026688799,"The LIM domain protein rbtn2 is associated with T cell acute leukemias. We demonstrate that rbtn2 is a nuclear protein expressed in the erythroid lineage in vivo, and using homologous recombination, we show that it is essential for erythroid development in mice. The homozygous rbtn2 null mutation leads to failure of yolk sac erythropoiesis and embryonic lethality around E10.5. Moreover, in vitro differentiation of yolk sac tissue from homozygous mutant mice and sequentially targeted double-mutant ES cells demonstrates a block to erythroid development. This shows a pivotal role for a LIM domain protein in lineage specification during mammalian development and suggests that RBTN2 and GATA-1 are critical at similar stages of erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1996931202,"Cyclin A-kinase, an enzyme required for coordinating S phase progression, forms stable in vivo complexes with E2F-1, a growth-promoting transcription factor, which binds to the retinoblastoma gene product and is involved in the timely activation of genes whose products contribute to G1 exit and S phase traversal. Complex formation results in a negative biochemical effect of cyclin A-kinase: the shut-off of E2F-1-dependent DNA binding function in S/G2. Thus, specific and timely cell cycle-dependent interactions of E2F-1 with proteins that inhibit its function (i.e., RB during G1 and cyclin A-kinase during S/G2) may contribute to the periodicity of expression of certain E2F-1-responsive genes at the G1/S transition."

https://openalex.org/W2046510462,"Environmental light signals are sensed by multiple families of photoreceptors and transduced by largely unknown mechanisms to regulate plant development. In this report, genetic analysis suggested that light signals perceived by both phytochromes and a blue light receptor converge to repress the action of Arabidopsis COP9 in suppressing seedling photomorphogenesis. Molecular cloning of the gene revealed that COP9 encodes a novel protein of 197 amino acids whose expression is not regulated by light. COP9 functions as a large (>560 kDa) complex(es) that is probably subjected to light modulation. In addition, COP8 and COP11 are required for either the COP9 complex formation or its stability. Therefore COP9, together with COP8 and COP11, defines a novel signaling step in mediating light control of plant development."
https://openalex.org/W1486847030,"Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) associates with natural membranes in response to physiological increases in Ca2+, resulting in the selective hydrolysis of arachidonyl phospholipids. The isolation and sequence analysis of cPLA2 cDNA clones from four different species revealed several highly conserved regions. The NH2-terminal conserved region is homologous to several other Ca(2+)-dependent lipid-binding proteins. Here we report that the first 178 residues of cPLA2, containing the homologous Ca(2+)-dependent lipid-binding (CaLB) motif, and another recombinant protein containing the cPLA2(1-178) fragment placed at the COOH terminus of the maltose-binding protein (MBP-CaLB) associate with membranes in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. cPLA2 and MBP-CaLB also bind to synthetic liposomes at physiological Ca2+ concentrations, demonstrating that accessory proteins are not required. In contrast, delta C2, a truncated cPLA2 lacking the CaLB domain, fails to associate with membranes and fails to hydrolyze liposomal substrates. However, both delta C2 and cPLA2 hydrolyze monomeric 1-palmitoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine at identical rates in a Ca(2+)-independent fashion. These results delineate two functionally distinct domains of cPLA2, the Ca(2+)-independent catalytic domain, and the regulatory CaLB domain that presents the catalytic domain to the membrane in response to elevated Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1975803734,"The Drosophila eye consists of a reiterative hexagonal array of photoreceptor cell clusters, the ommatidia. During normal morphogenesis, the clusters in the dorsal or ventral halves of the disc rotate 90 degrees in opposite directions, forming mirror images across a dorsoventral equator. In the mutant nemo (nmo), there is an initial turning of approximately 45 degrees, but further rotation is blocked. Genetic mosaic analysis indicates that the nmo gene acts upon each cluster as a whole; normal nmo function in one or more photoreceptor cells appears to be sufficient to induce full rotation. The nmo gene sequence encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase homolog, suggesting that the kinase is required to initiate the second step of rotation. In another mutant, roulette, excessive rotation through varying angles occurs in many ommatidia. This defect is suppressed by nmo, indicating that nmo acts upstream in a rotation-regulating pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1494869776,"In inflamed tissue sites characterized by on-going matrix degradation, the matrix metalloproteinases are secreted as latent precursors which are capable of proteolysis only after extracellular activation. Such areas often contain locally increased numbers of mast cells capable of releasing complexes between heparin proteoglycans and fully active endopeptidases with either tryptic (tryptase) or both tryptic and chymotryptic (chymase) activity. We have examined the ability of purified human skin chymase to activate human interstitial procollagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1) in the absence and presence of heparin, the physiologic associate of chymase. Our studies indicate that chymase activates procollagenase in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Heparin was found to increase markedly the rate at which chymase activates procollagenase both by accelerating the cleavage of procollagenase and also by preventing its further degradation. Moreover, we found that chymase activates procollagenase directly by cleaving the Leu83-Thr84 bond, without formation of any intermediate species. This is a novel mechanism for procollagenase activation, which contrasts sharply with the activation mechanisms of other activators studied so far. The ability of chymase to activate procollagenase suggests that chymase plays an active role in matrix degradation at tissue sites where mast cells coexist with extracellular procollagenase."
https://openalex.org/W2067363518,"The mechanisms by which plants integrate light signals to modify endogenous developmental programs are largely unknown. One candidate for a signal transduction component that may integrate light with developmental pathways is the Arabidopsis DET1 gene product. Here we report the positional cloning of the DET1 locus and show that DET1 is a unique nuclear-localized protein. An analysis of a number of det1 mutants indicates that mutants with partial DET1 activity develop as light-grown plants in the dark. det1 null mutants share this phenotype, but also display severe defects in temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression. These results suggest that DET1 acts in the nucleus to control the cell type-specific expression of light-regulated promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2133708115,"The Drosophila gene pointed (pnt) encodes two putative transcription factors (P1 and P2) of the Ets family, which in the embryonic CNS are found exclusively in glial cells. Loss of pnt function leads to poorly differentiated glial cells and a marked decrease in the expression of the neuronal antigen 22C10 in the MP2 neurons, which are known to interact intimately with the pntP1-expressing longitudinal glial cells. Ectopic expression of pntP1 RNA forces additional CNS cells to enter the glial differentiation pathway. Interestingly, the additional glial-like cells are often flanked by cells that ectopically express the neuronal antigen 22C10. Therefore, both the pnt loss-of-function as well as the gain-of-function phenotype suggest that glial cells are able to induce 22C10 expression on neighboring neurons. This was further verified by cell transplantation experiments. Thus, pnt is not only required but also sufficient for several aspects of glial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4300497241,"Male patients with fragile X syndrome lack FMR1 protein due to silencing of the FMR1 gene by amplification of a CGG repeat and subsequent methylation of the promoter region. The absence of FMR1 protein leads to mental retardation, aberrant behavior, and macroorchidism. Hardly anything is known about the physiological function of FMR1 and the pathological mechanisms leading to these symptoms. Therefore, we designed a knockout model for the fragile X syndrome in mice. The knockout mice lack normal Fmr1 protein and show macroorchidism, learning deficits, and hyperactivity. Consequently, this knockout mouse may serve as a valuable tool in the elucidation of the physiological role of FMR1 and the mechanisms involved in macroorchidism, abnormal behavior, and mental retardation."
https://openalex.org/W1529251418,"Immunization of mice with conditioned media from human breast cancer cells yielded the monoclonal antibody SP-2, which recognized an antigen of approximately 90-95 kDa. This protein, designated 90K, was found to be present in the serum of healthy individuals and at elevated levels in the serum of subpopulations of patients with various types of cancer and AIDS. Here we report the primary structure of the SP-2 antigen and demonstrate its relationship to a family of proteins which carry a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain. Northern blot analysis of normal tissues, primary tumors, and tumor-derived cell lines indicates a broad expression spectrum of the 90K gene at widely varying levels. Functional characterization reveals stimulatory effects of 90K on host defense systems, such as natural killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity, and indicates that its immunostimulatory effects may be mediated through the induction of interleukin-2 and possibly other cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1532942255,"ClpP, the proteolytic component of the ATP-dependent ClpAP protease, is composed of 12 identical subunits and has intrinsic degradative activity against short peptides. Degradation of proteins and some peptides by ClpP requires the regulatory component ClpA and ATP. Peptide and protein substrates have been used to distinguish the roles of nucleotide binding and nucleotide hydrolysis in the activation of ClpAP protease. ATP binding alone promoted interaction between ClpA and ClpP, affected the substrate response curves for very short peptides, and activated degradation of larger peptides that were not degraded by ClpP alone. ATP hydrolysis did not increase in proportion to the increase in peptide bond hydrolysis of short peptides. However, ATP hydrolysis was strictly required for degradation of proteins such as alpha-casein; there was no indication of even limited cleavage of protein substrates when nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP were used. Most large peptides and proteins were degraded in multiple sites without release of high molecular weight intermediates. Partial inactivation of ClpP with diisopropyl fluorophosphate produced ClpP with one to three active subunits/dodecamer. When only a few active sites were available in the active complex of ClpAP, degradation of large peptides and proteins released significant amounts of high molecular weight intermediates. Thus, processive degradation of protein substrates is a function of the multiple array of proteolytic active sites within the ClpP dodecamer."
https://openalex.org/W1983916545,"In T. brucei, a transferrin-binding protein has been found to share sequence homology with pESAG-7 and -6, the products of two related genes present in the VSG gene polycistronic transcription unit. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, they appear as N-glycosylated proteins secreted in the medium (pESAG-7) and GPI anchored to the membrane (pESAG-6). These proteins are able to homo- or heterodimerize, probably through association in the same orientation. Only heterodimers can bind Tf, possibly two molecules per dimer. A comparison of Tf binding to pESAG-7/6-expressing oocytes and trypanosomes suggests that pESAG-7/6 is the Tf receptor of the parasite. In trypanosomes, the majority of pESAG-7/6 is released from the membrane and associates, together with Tf, with a glycosylated matrix present in the lumen of the flagellar pocket. Both pESAG-7/6 and Tf are internalized via coated pits and vesicles. These observations suggest a novel mode of Tf binding and uptake in trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1602850881,"The affinities of integrin alpha beta heterodimers for extracellular ligands are important regulators of cell adhesion. Intracellular signals provoke changes in the integrin extracellular domain resulting in activation, as manifested by an increase in affinity. Interactions of integrin cytoplasmic domains with intracellular elements may mediate this signaling. Here we report that overexpression of chimeras of the cytoplasmic domain of integrin beta 3 or beta 1 subunits, joined to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the Tac subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor, reduced integrin affinity. In contrast, chimeras containing the cytoplasmic domain of alpha 5 or alpha IIb or of beta 3 bearing a mutation that disrupts inside-out signaling lacked inhibitory activity. These data suggest that limiting quantities of intracellular factors bind to integrin beta 3 and beta 1 cytoplasmic domains to modulate ligand binding affinity. Structural mimics of these domains may provide a novel means to alter cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1542150214,"Escherichia coli ClpAP protease is an ATP-dependent protease composed of the proteolytic component ClpP and a regulatory ATPase, ClpA. ClpAP protease degraded a variety of peptide bonds in protein and peptide substrates at a slow rate (kcat or = 800 min-1) for a synthetic peptide composed of the first 19 amino acids of ClpP, MSYSGERDNFAPHMALVPV, referred to as the propeptide. The propeptide was not degraded by ClpP alone, but was degraded in the presence of ClpA and ClpP. Degradation was activated by nonhydrolyzable analogs of ATP, indicating that nucleotide-promoted interaction between ClpA and ClpP is sufficient to activate ClpP for propeptide cleavage. The propeptide, as well as truncated forms lacking either the first 9 or the last 3 amino acids, was cleaved at the same Met-Ala bond at which autoprocessing occurs in vivo. No hydrolysis of FAPHMALVPV derivatives was observed when Met was replaced by Glu, Lys, Ser, Tyr, Ile, and D-Met, but cleavage at the same position did occur with Leu or Trp substitutions. A peptide composed of a tandem repeat of FAPHMALVPV was cleaved between both Met-Ala bonds (Kcat values > or = 39 min-1). Propeptides inhibited degradation of alpha-casein by competition for a binding site on ClpA, and they stimulated the basal ATPase activity of ClpA in the absence of ClpP. Peptides and protein substrates interact at an allosteric site on ClpA, which appears to be the site at which specific substrates are recognized by the Clp protease."
https://openalex.org/W1584524384,"A genetic response of Escherichia coli to nitric oxide or to superoxide-generating agents such as paraquat is controlled by the soxRS locus. The intracellular redox signals generated by these agents are sensed by the SoxR protein which, when activated, functions as a potent activator of soxS transcription. The resulting increased level of SoxS protein then activates approximately 10 genes that constitute the soxRS regulon. Although the SoxS protein is homologous to the COOH-terminal region of the AraC family of regulatory proteins, the mechanism by which SoxS protein activates the soxRS regulon promoters is unknown. We identified in extracts of cells expressing high levels of SoxS protein a DNA binding activity specific for fragments containing soxRS-regulated promoters. This binding activity was purified to physical homogeneity and proved to be the SoxS protein, as confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. The purified SoxS protein bound specifically to the promoters of the micF, zwf, nfo, and sodA genes. Multiple DNA-protein complexes were formed by SoxS in a concentration-dependent fashion with each of these promoters. This binding of SoxS protein also facilitated the subsequent binding of E. coli RNA polymerase to both the micF and the nfo promoters. The binding sites of SoxS in the zwf and micF promoters were identified by DNase I footprinting, which revealed an extended protected region immediately upstream of the respective -35 sites. These results indicate that the small SoxS protein (M(r) of only 12,900) is a direct transcriptional activator of the oxidative stress genes of the soxRS regulon, although the possible involvement of other proteins in transcription activation by SoxS has not been ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W2160573501,"Two major classes of genes directing flower development have so far been described: early activated genes regulating meristem identity and later acting genes controlling organ identity. Here, we show that the fimbriata (fim) gene acts between these two classes in a sequence of gene activation. The fim gene, originally described in 1930, was cloned by transposon tagging from Antirrhinum majus and encodes a product with no detectable homology to other proteins. Mutations in fim result in partial homeotic transformations of floral organs and in reduced determinacy of the meristem. Expression and function of fim depends on the activity of meristem identity genes, and fim in turn controls the spatial and temporal expression of organ identity genes. The pattern of fim expression defines a new domain of the floral meristem that changes with time in a complementary manner to those of the meristem identity gene floricaula and the organ identity gene plena."
https://openalex.org/W1572740641,"Several mRNAs coding for a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (ratPDE3/IVd) with divergent 5' regions have been detected in mammalian cells. To determine the physiological significance of these differences, the expression of these mRNAs and the properties of the corresponding proteins were investigated. At least three mRNA species derived from the ratPDE3/IVd gene (ratPDE3.1, ratPDE3.2, and ratPDE3.3 mRNAs) are present in Sertoli and thyroid cells and in brain. Expression of ratPDE3.1 and ratPDE3.2 but not ratPDE3.3 mRNAs was dependent on hormone stimulation. The ratPDE3.2 and ratPDE3.3 mRNA variants were translated into polypeptides with immunochemical and biochemical properties identical to the native cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs) found in the Sertoli cell and thyroid FRTL-5 cells. Incubation of the recombinant PDEs with the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in a cell-free system caused the phosphorylation and activation of the ratPDE3.3 protein variant. Under the same experimental conditions, ratPDE3.1 and ratPDE3.2 protein variants were neither phosphorylated nor activated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Similar results were obtained by stimulating cells expressing the three recombinant PDE variants with dibutyryl cAMP. These findings demonstrate that the ratPDE3/IVd gene codes for PDE forms subject to different regulations."
https://openalex.org/W1624744767,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is cleaved within mammalian cells between Arg279 and Gly280 to generate an enzymatically active COOH-terminal fragment of 37 kDa which translocates to the cytosol and ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2. A protease, with toxin cleaving activity, was prepared from beef liver and subsequently characterized. After achieving a 500-fold enrichment in several chromatographic steps, a soluble form of this protease was identified as a furin-like enzyme. It cleaved PE on the COOH-terminal side of the sequence of RQPR (amino acids 276-279) producing the same fragments as those generated within cells. Cleavage had a pH optimum of 5.0-5.5, was inhibited by EDTA or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate but not by O-phenanthroline,N-ethylmaleimide, trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leukcylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane, or PMSF (or other well known inhibitors of serine proteases). The beef protease cleaved PE with an apparent Km of 7 microM. A mutant form of PE, PEala281, was cleaved at the same site, with the same pH optimum, a similar Km (9 microM) but with a Vmax 150 times faster than was seen with the native toxin. Mutational analysis of the amino acids located just before the site of cleavage, confirmed the importance of arginines at P-1 and P-4. It was also noted that the introduction of a dibasic pair at 278-279 did not increase toxicity or appreciably improve the rate of cleavage. Unnicked diphtheria toxin (DT) was also cleaved by the beef protease; cleavage was on the COOH-terminal side of the sequence RVRR (amino acids 190-193), was seen at pH values ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 and had an optimum at pH 8.0. Recombinant furin cleaved PE, PEala281, and DT with the same characteristics as the beef protease. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that anti-furin antibodies reacted specifically with components in the beef protease preparation. Immunodepletion experiments showed that all toxin-cleavage activity could be removed from the beef protease using anti-furin antibodies. The relevance of furin-mediated cleavage was further assessed by adding nicked toxins to intact cells. Nicked PE and DT both killed cells at a faster rate than their unnicked counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1982175937,"We have developed assays using cells and isolated membranes to identify factors mediating fusion of the ER-nuclear membrane network in yeast. When cells containing distinctly tagged ER-nuclear envelope membranes are observed during mating, the markers of both parental membranes become colocalized in a process sharing a genetic requirement with karyogamy. Using isolated membranes, we find that fusion between ER compartments requires ATP, but not cytosol, Sect 7p (α-SNAP), or Sec18p (NSF), the latter two being required at the fusion step in vesicular transport. Proteins tightly associated with the ER membrane are essential for fusion, as is Kar2p (BiP), an ER lumenal hsp70 homolog. BIP may activate an ER-localized fusogen, allowing nuclear fusion and karyogamy in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W1642592845,"The minimal requirements for transcription initiation from supercoiled templates were determined for the two major forms of TATA-binding factors found in cell extracts, the 300-kDa B-TFIID and the 1000-kDa D-TFIID complexes. As had been observed for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit (Parvin and Sharp, 1993), transcription from the IgH promoter minimally requires TFIID activity plus TFIIB and RNA polymerase II. This minimal reaction is only active on negatively supercoiled template DNA. In contrast, the supercoiled templates encoding the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP), or several other promoters, require the addition of TFIIF to the minimal reaction. Further addition of TFIIE and TFIIH boosts the level of transcription from these latter promoters but is not required. In contrast to the complete reaction on linear template, transcription from supercoiled IgH or MLP templates does not require the hydrolysis of the beta-gamma bond of ATP. Fourteen different core promoters were compared in complete and minimal basal transcription reactions reconstituted with one of the three TATA activities: TBP, B-TFIID, and D-TFIID. Of these 14 promoters, only the IgH was active in the absence of TFIIF, and the other promoters demonstrated different levels of transcription depending on which basal factors were present in reaction. It is proposed that a significant level of basal transcription only requires a minimal set of factors, and stimulation by upstream activators may in part be mediated by the inclusion of additional basal factors into the initiation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1491928599,"A galactose-binding protein of M(r) = 30,000 previously described in baby hamster kidney cells (Foddy, L., Stamatoglou, S. C., and Hughes, R. C. (1990) J. Cell Sci. 97, 139-148) has been analyzed by the cloning and sequencing of cDNA clones encoding the complete sequence and an amino-terminal fragment. The intact lectin CBP30 contains 245 amino acid residues, including the initiating methionine residue, and is closely homologous to mammalian S-type lectins of similar size characterized in human, rat, and mouse species. The carboxyl-terminal domain contains the carbohydrate binding activity and the amino-terminal domain, which is extremely sensitive to bacterial collagenase, contains a repetitive sequence rich in glycine, tyrosine, and proline. There are 8 repeats in hamster CBP30, as in the human homologue, compared with about 10 in rat and mouse and > 10 in dog homologues. This repeat sequence is also sensitive to the tissue metalloproteinases, gelatinase B and matrilysin, but, unlike the bacterial collagenase, the mammalian enzymes also cause extensive degradation of the carbohydrate binding carboxyl domain. Physical measurements using CD and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy indicate that the two domains of CBP30 are structurally, as well as functionally, distinct and independent. Cross-linking studies indicate that the amino-terminal lectin fragment can efficiently self-assemble into oligomeric species, and less efficient but significant aggregation of the intact lectin is also shown. Domain-specific antibodies to hamster CBP30 have been prepared and used to show that only the full-length, undegraded form of CBP30 is present in whole cell lysates."
https://openalex.org/W1538927317,"Fusion of influenza virus with target membranes is induced by acid and involves complex changes in the viral fusion protein hemagglutinin. At 0 degree C, in a first kinetically resolvable step, the hemagglutinin polypeptide 2 (HA2) N-terminal segment (fusion peptide) is exposed and inserts into the target membrane (Tsurudome, M., Gluck, R., Graf, R., Falchetto, R., Schaller, U., and Brunner, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20225-20232). We now report studies of the changes taking place at pH 5.0 and 37 degrees C, conditions that result in fusion or, in the absence of a target membrane, in inactivation of the virus' fusion capacity. To this end, we synthesized the new photosensitive phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-[decanedioyl mono-[2-(125I)iodo-4-(3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-benzyl]e ster]- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (specific radioactivity, > 2000 Ci/mmol), and worked out a protocol to incorporate this lipid into the viral membrane. Subsequent photoactivation of the reagent resulted in selective labeling of the C-terminal portion of the HA2 polypeptide chain, in agreement with the membrane topology of hemagglutinin. When, however, prior to reagent activation, the viruses were exposed at pH 5.0, 37 degrees C, both the HA2 C-terminal and the N-terminal regions were labeled, suggesting that the HA2 N-terminal segment (fusion peptide) inserted into the viral membrane. Possible implications for fusion and virus inactivation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528494487,"Previous studies have shown that the prohormone convertase 1 (PC1, or SPC3), a member of the new eukaryotic subtilisin-like proteinase family, undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events during its biosynthesis. The first cleavage, of the amino-terminal prosegment, is probably involved in enzyme activation, while the secondary cleavages at the carboxyl terminus are of unknown significance and occur mainly in cells possessing a regulated secretory pathway. In this work, we found that 87-kDa PC1, a homogeneous recombinant protein, could spontaneously convert to 74- and 66-kDa forms in vitro. Limited digestion of 87-kDa PC1 using chymotrypsin and trypsin could also generate 74- and 66-kDa-like PC1s, which were enzymatically active against the fluorogenic peptide carbobenzoxy-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin. The 74/66-kDa PC1 generated by spontaneous conversion was purified away from the 87-kDa form and enzymatically characterized. Compared to the 87-kDa form, 74/66-kDa PC1 was more active but less stable. In addition, 74/66-kDa PC1 exhibited a narrower pH optimum (between 5.0 and 5.5) and was activated by higher concentrations of calcium. Carboxyl-terminally truncated PC1 also appeared to be more sensitive to certain protease inhibitors than 87-kDa PC1. Taken together, our results suggest that autocatalysis could be involved in carboxyl-terminal cleavages of PC1. These carboxyl-terminal cleavages of PC1 result in alterations in certain PC1 properties and may therefore possess potential significance with respect to prohormone processing."
https://openalex.org/W1520812065,"Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a major in vivo substrate protein of protein kinase C, isolated from calf brain contains various species phosphorylated to different degrees. To establish the in vivo phosphorylation sites, the protein was digested with lysyl endoprotease, and the digests were analyzed by the capillary high performance liquid chromatography interfaced on-line to an electrospray mass spectrometer. Six out of 17 peptides were found to be phosphorylated. Of the 7 phosphorylated serine residues identified by Edman degradation, only 1 was within the known phosphorylation domain by protein kinase C. All the other phosphorylated serine residues originated from the N-terminal half of the molecule and were immediately followed by proline. Therefore, MARCKS, a major in vivo substrate of protein kinase C, is also an in vivo substrate of proline-directed protein kinase(s) such as mitogen-activated protein kinase or Cdk5 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1607893122,"We investigated the role of sphingolipids in regulating oxidant release in adherent human neutrophils. Stimulation of adherent neutrophils with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) resulted in the accumulation of ceramide at a time when H2O2 release is terminated. H2O2 release in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils was suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner by the exogenous addition of several free sphingoid amines and short chain ceramides. Sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, N-acetylsphingosine, and N-acetylphytosphingosine, but not N-acetyldihydrosphingosine, inhibited formyl peptide-stimulated oxidant release. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of N-acetylsphingosine and N-acetylphytosphingosine were 0.51 and 0.38 microM, respectively. Sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine were less potent inhibitors with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 1.78, 15.4, and 1.48 microM, respectively. The 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate-induced respiratory burst was inhibited by 5 microM of sphingosine but not by 5 microM of N-acetylsphingosine. The effects of N-acetyl-conjugated sphingols (C2 ceramides) on phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase were markedly different from the effects of the related sphingoid bases. Both C2 ceramides and sphingoid bases partially inhibited the diradylglycerol formation by the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D pathway. Under the same conditions, however, N-acetyldihydrosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine failed to suppress H2O2 release in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that C2 ceramides inhibit H2O2 generation in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils via protein kinase C- or sphingoid base-independent mechanisms. The effect of ceramide in inhibiting the respiratory burst is structurally specific, because either a 4,5-trans double bond or 4-hydroxyl group is required for the inhibition. Therefore, ceramides may regulate oxidant release in adherent neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1502136193,"The central role of the ras oncogenes in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human malignancies is well established. Toward developing specific transcriptional inhibitors of the human Ha-ras oncogene, we have designed oligonucleotides to target a region of the Ha-ras promoter (-8 to -28) which contains two of the three Sp1 binding sites essential for transcriptional activity. Gel mobility analysis and DNase I footprinting demonstrate that an oligonucleotide (HR21ap) forms a sequence-specific triple helix with its target site in an antiparallel orientation with respect to the purine-rich duplex strand through predominantly G*G:C triplets. Within the Ha-ras promoter, HR21ap binds exclusively to the proximal target Sp1 sites over a similar nontarget distal sequence which, like the target, contains a consensus Sp1 site. Protein binding assays demonstrate that triplex formation by HR21ap inhibits Sp1 binding to the Ha-ras promoter. Moreover, oligonucleotide-directed triplex formation arrests Ha-ras promoter-dependent transcription in vitro. The results presented here suggest that triplex formation by the Ha-ras promoter targeted oligonucleotide may provide a means to specifically inhibit transcription of this oncogene in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1581726339,"The major rat glucocorticoid-inducible cytochrome P450 (CYP3A1) is known to be regulated at a transcriptional level by glucocorticoids and at a post-translational level by substrate-dependent stabilization. We have investigated mechanisms of substrate/ligand stabilization using primary hepatocytes, isolated liver microsomes from dexamethasone-treated rats, and purified enzymes. Treatment of hepatocytes with glucagon caused a 3-fold increase in CYP3A1 phosphorylation as well as an enhanced degradation rate of the enzyme. Specific CYP3A1 substrates or ligands, such as erythromycin, triacetyloleandomycin, and clotrimazole (CTZ) protected the enzyme from degradation in hepatocytes and inhibited in a concomitant manner (r = 0.99) glucagon-induced phosphorylation of the enzyme. In vitro experiments with purified CYP3A1 and isolated liver microsomes revealed one major site (Ser393) phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase, a reaction inhibited by ligands. Experiments in microsomes showed the presence of an endogenous cAMP-dependent kinase active on CYP3A1. Addition of exogenous cAMP-dependent kinase increased the rate of microsomal CYP3A1 phosphorylation, a reaction further stimulated by NADPH, but inhibited by CTZ. The microsomal phosphorylation caused a pronounced denaturation of cytochrome P450, as revealed spectrophotometrically, whereas CTZ protected from this reaction. Similar effects were noted when the CYP3A1-dependent 6 beta-hydroxylation of testosterone was monitored. It is suggested that the cellular CYP3A1 level is regulated to a significant extent posttranslationally by substrate-regulated cAMP-dependent phosphorylation on Ser393, followed by denaturation and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1548190938,"Plastocyanin and the 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex (OE33) are two of several thylakoid lumen-located proteins that are made in the cytosol, imported into chloroplasts, and subsequently transported into thylakoids. Recently, competition studies showed that there are two pathways for protein transport into the thylakoid lumen and that plastocyanin and OE33 are on the same pathway (Cline, K., Henry, R., Li, C., and Yuan, J. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 4105-4114). Our expectation is that transport requirements reflect the steps of the process and that proteins on the same pathway share similar requirements. Unfortunately, the transport requirements for plastocyanin and OE33 are not well established. Here, we investigated transport in a reconstituted system with isolated thylakoids. Efficient transport of OE33 and plastocyanin was only obtained when stromal extract was included in the assay. Heat or protease treatment of stromal extract eliminated its ability to stimulate transport. Transport was abolished by treatments designed to deplete ATP or to prevent its formation and was greatly reduced in the presence of ionophores that dissipate the trans-thylakoidal proton gradient. These results show that transport of OE33 and plastocyanin requires ATP and is stimulated by stromal protein(s) and the trans-thylakoidal proton gradient. Taken together, these and previous results suggest that there are two mechanistically distinct pathways for protein transport into the thylakoid lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1897343028,"Casein kinase II of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of two distinct catalytic subunits, alpha and alpha', and two distinct regulatory subunits, beta and beta' (Padmanabha, R. and Glover, C. V. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1829-1835; Bidwai, A. P., Reed, J. C., and Glover, C. V. C. (1994) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 309, 348-355). We report here the cloning, sequencing, and disruption of the CKB2 gene encoding the beta'-subunit. The deduced amino acid sequence of Ckb2 displays only 40-45% identity to other beta-subunit sequences reported to date, allowing a better definition of conserved features of this protein. Most notable is the conservation of a cysteine-containing sequence, CPX3C-X22-CPXC, which may constitute a novel metal-binding motif. The degree of sequence divergence of Ckb2 is comparable to that of the Drosophila Stellate protein, a testis-specific protein of unknown function, suggesting that the latter may function as a second beta-subunit in Drosophila. CKB2 is located on the right arm of chromosome XV between the HIR2 and WHI2 loci and has not been previously identified genetically. Haploid and homozygous diploid cells harboring a ckb2 null allele are viable, demonstrating that the beta'-subunit does not have an essential function distinct from that of beta. Strains lacking a functional CKB2 gene appear to grow normally on both fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources, mate and sporulate normally, and display normal resistance to nitrogen starvation and heat shock. However, haploid strains harboring disruptions of both the beta' gene and either of the catalytic subunit genes exhibit a synthetic phenotype consisting of slow growth and flocculation in rich glucose medium. The occurrence of this synthetic phenotype implies that the beta'-subunit interacts physically and/or functionally with both the alpha- and alpha'-subunits in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2133745243,"One mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells inflict target cell death depends upon secreting the contents of their specialized cytoplasmic granules, containing a pore-forming protein, perforin, and a family of homologous serine proteases (granzymes) with various enzyme activities. We used a granzyme B-specific mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody 2C5 and Western blotting to demonstrate that nuclear extracts of human interleukin-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the human NK leukemia cell line YT, and the rat NK leukemia cell line RNK-16 contain abundant granzyme B. In interleukin-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, more than 50% of the total cellular granzyme B was present in the nuclear lysate. Nuclear granzyme B had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 32 kDa in human cells and approximately 30 kDa in RNK-16 and was eluted from immobilized heparin at the same NaCl concentration as granzyme B from cytoplasmic granules. Granzyme B that was affinity-purified with 2C5 from the nuclei of YT or human LAK cells was capable of efficiently cleaving synthetic peptide thiobenzyl ester substrates with the same specificity (peptide cleavage after aspartic acid) as granule-localized granzyme B. By contrast perforin, which colocalizes with granzymes in cytotoxic granules, was not detectable in nuclear lysates. Granzyme B was also demonstrated to be present in the nucleus and cytoplasmic granules of YT by immunohistochemical staining with monospecific anti-granzyme B antisera. Other protease activities (tryptase and peptide cleavage after methionine) were also readily detectable in nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates of YT, RNK-16, and LAK cells, as determined by the cleavage of the synthetic substrates N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT) and Boc-Ala-Ala-Met-S-benzyl, except that BLT-esterase activity was absent from the nucleus of YT. The localization of serine proteases in the nucleus was restricted to lymphocytes with cytotoxic capacity, as non-cytotoxic cell lines expressed high levels of peptide cleavage after methionine and tryptase activities in their cytoplasm, but possessed no nuclear serine protease activity. Furthermore, non-cytotoxic monkey kidney COS-7 cells transfected with an SV40-driven expression plasmid incorporating full-length human granzyme B cDNA contained abundant cytoplasmic granzyme B, but demonstrated minimal nuclear granzyme B accumulation. We conclude that serine proteases of NK cells are not restricted to cytolytic granules and, further, that their capacity to access the nucleus may have implications for the role of these enzymes in eliciting target cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1559244741,"The E6 and the E7 genes of the high-risk types of human papillomavirus (types 16 and 18) are associated with the induction or maintenance of malignant growth. The molecular mechanism by which these oncogenes contribute to the malignant phenotype is not clear. To study the effects of E7 on cellular processes, we constructed a stable cell line that inducibly expressed the E7 gene of HPV16. By using this cell line, we provide evidence that expression of E7 of HPV16 stimulates c-fos gene expression. Also, by doing transient transfection experiments, we show that the expression of either E6 or E7 induces transcription from the c-fos promoter. Analysis of a series of c-fos promoter mutants indicates that the activation by both E6 and E7 is dependent on the cyclic AMP response element. To further investigate the mechanism(s) of the activation of the c-fos gene and their relation to the oncogenic properties of E6 and E7, several mutants of the E6 and E7 genes were analyzed. The results of these studies indicate that the CR1 and CR2 regions in the E7 protein, and sequences distinct from the p53-binding region in the E6 protein, are critical for activation of the c-fos promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1554928898,"The primary sequence of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase from rabbit liver was determined by amino acid sequencing of the purified enzyme. The enzyme contains 201 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 22,779 Da. The enzyme is located in the cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates. Carbodiimide-activated 5-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate and the pentaglutamate form of the substrate both irreversibly inactivate the enzyme by forming a covalent bond to Lys-18. Non-activated 5-formyltetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate protected against this inactivation. Substrate specificity studies showed that increasing the number of glutamate residues from zero to five on 5-formyltetrahydropteroate results in a 2 order of magnitude increase in the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme but only a 3-fold increase in the value of Vmax."
https://openalex.org/W1539859994,"Architecture of higher plant chloroplast ribosomes involves additional protein domains over that found in the Escherichia coli ribosome, although the rRNAs in these two kinds of ribosomes are very similar in length and sequence (Subramanian, A. R. (1993) Trends Biochem. Sci. 18, 177-180). Here, we show that two chloroplast-specific protein domains (a novel chloroplast ribosomal protein of the 30 S subunit, called Psrp-1 or S22, and a divergent protein of the 50 S subunit with long terminal extensions and low homology to its E. coli counterpart, L21) are both incorporated in E. coli ribosomes and polysomes when their gene constructs are expressed in E. coli. Also, the 67-residue NH2-terminal extension in chloroplast L21 by itself is incorporated. Thus, our results indicate preexisting binding sites for novel chloroplast-specific ribosomal proteins/domains on eubacterial ribosomes. Additionally, we observed cleavage of the chloroplast-targeting transit peptide (present in the expressed Psrp-1 precursor), indicating protease(s) of the required specificity in E. coli cells. The expression of chloroplast L21 with its NH2-terminal extension was inhibitory to E. coli growth, suggesting a drastic effect of the latter on some property of L21. Expression of Psrp-1 was neutral, consistent with a function only in chloroplast translation. Based on analysis of the assembly of Psrp-1 and various L21 fragments in E. coli ribosomes, a general model for studying ribosomal protein-ribosome interactions is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1571963303,"Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania synthesize a complex lipophosphoglycan (LPG), which is the major cell surface macromolecule. The LPG from Leishmania major contains beta-D-Arap-terminating side chains that are involved in regulating the attachment of the parasite to the midgut epithelium of its insect vector. An arabinose sugar nucleotide donor was identified in soluble extracts of L. major promastigotes. This sugar nucleotide was biosynthetically labeled with D-[2-3H]Glc and with D-[5-3H]Ara. The labeled sugar nucleotide generated [3H]Ara and GDP after mild acid hydrolysis. The absolute configuration of the arabinose was determined after reduction and acylation with a pure enantiomer of Mosher's acid chloride. The pyranose ring configuration was inferred from the ability of GDP-Ara to form borate complexes, and the anomeric configuration was deduced from the results of mild base hydrolysis experiments. Taken together these data suggest that the sugar nucleotide has the structure GDP-alpha-D-Arap. This sugar nucleotide has not been previously described from natural sources and may be unique to trypanosomatid protozoan parasites. Ara-1-PO4 and GDP-Ara were the only soluble metabolites labeled with [3H]Ara, and pulse-chase experiment data are consistent with them being precursors of the arabinosyl residues of LPG."
https://openalex.org/W1509206766,"The ANFA protein is the transcriptional activator of the sigma 54-dependent anfHDGK operon, which codes for the structural genes of the third nitrogenase system in Azotobacter vinelandii. We have purified, in soluble active form, an N-terminally truncated form of the protein, delta ANFA, which activates transcription from the anfH promoter and other sigma 54-dependent promoters in a purified transcription system. Sequences upstream of the anfH promoter and the presence of the integration host factor protein stimulate transcription, and we have shown that delta ANFA binds to sites situated between 200 and 300 base pairs upstream of the anfH promoter. In common with other sigma 54-dependent activators, ANFA has a highly conserved ATP binding motif in its central domain, and we have demonstrated that ATP or GTP is required for productive complex formation and that the purified truncated protein has a constitutive ATPase activity, which is presumably required to drive open complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1492818640,"Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid was depressed when 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and microsomes were included in incubations. This reduction was due to the esterification of the substrate into the acceptor by microsomal 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine acyltransferase. The first cycle of the beta-oxidation of 7,10,13,16-docosatetraenoic acid was independent of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and microsomes. However, when arachidonate was produced it was esterified rather than serving as a substrate for continued beta-oxidation. When arachidonate and linoleate were incubated with peroxisomes alone, 2-trans-4,7,10-hexadecatetraenoic acid and 2-trans-4-decadienoic acid were the respective end products of beta-oxidation. 2-Oxo-8,11-heptadecadienone, a catabolite produced from linoleate, was most likely a nonenzymatic decarboxylation product of 3-oxo-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. In addition to the termination of beta-oxidation by microsomal-peroxisomal communication, our results with linoleate and arachidonate suggest that the reaction catalyzed by 2-trans-4-cis-dienoyl-CoA reductase is the control step in double bond removal. In addition, the beta-ketothiolase step may play a regulatory role in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of linoleate but not arachidonate or 7,10,13,16-docosatetraenoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1537612851,"L-Tryptophan 2',3'-oxidase is a novel enzyme that specifically catalyzes the alpha,beta-dehydrogenation of L-tryptophan derivatives. It was extracted from Chromobacterium violaceum and purified 108-fold to apparent homogeneity with a 34% overall recovery. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is approximately 680,000, and its isoelectric point is nearly equal to 4. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme is composed of two components with molecular weight of approximately 74,000 and 14,000. It also contains a noncovalently bound heme prosthetic group, as judged from a typical spectrum showing maxima at 427, 530, and 560 nm. The catalyzed reaction is completed without side-product formation over a broad pH range comprised between 3 and 8. The enzyme is reoxidized at the expense of molecular oxygen by producing one molecule of H2O2. Kinetic parameters for modification of N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide were determined (Km = 19.5 microM; kcat = 45.2 s-1). A Hill coefficient of about 1 suggests the absence of any cooperative effect. As inferred from both its kinetic and stability optimal conditions, L-tryptophan 2',3'-oxidase constitutes a promising tool for chemical modification of tryptophanyl side chain in peptides and proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1548168569,"The phosphorylation of glucose and recycling between glucose and glucose-6-P was determined in hepatocytes from fasted rats by a novel method. The cells were incubated with [U-14C]glucose as sole substrate in media containing 3HOH and D2O. Recycling was calculated from the yield of protons in glucose and glycogen. Results with 3HOH and D2O were identical. Phosphorylation was obtained as the sum of recycling plus the U-14C yields in products. At 10 mM glucose, more than 4 out of 5 molecules of glucose-6-P were recycled. About 1.2 mumol of glucose min/g of liver was phosphorylated, 1 mumol was recycled, and 0.2 mumol was glycolyzed. The effect of two phenacylimidazolium compounds (designated as glycosyns) and low concentrations of fructose (0.05-0.2 mM) on phosphorylation and recycling were examined. The glycosyns doubled glucose uptake, mainly as glycogen, nearly abolished glycolysis, and decreased recycling from 80 to 50-60%. There was little change in phosphorylation. Fructose doubled the yield of tritium from [2-3H]glucose in short term incubations (20-30 min), confirming the results of Van Schaftingen ((1993) Diabetologia 36, 582-588). The effect was transient, and cells became refractory to fructose. There was no glycogen synthesis and little effect on recycling. A new phenacylimidazolium compound stimulated glycogen synthesis and suppressed glycolysis and recycling, like the compound designated as proglycosyn by Yamanuchi et al. ((1992) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 294, 609-615). This new compound (glycosyn-2) was fully active at lower concentrations (maximal effect at 0.02 mM)."
https://openalex.org/W1541245675,"The interaction of histones H2A and H2B with closed circular DNA maintained in either a positive or negatively coiled state has been studied. The methods involved separation of complexes by sucrose gradients and by agarose gel electrophoresis. Histones H2A and H2B have a 10-fold preference for DNA that contains performed negative coils as compared to DNA that is positively coiled or topologically unrestrained. It was also observed that histones H2A and H2B, when initially reconstituted onto positively coiled DNA, transfer very efficiently to negatively coiled DNA at 100 mM NaCl. Transfer is virtually complete within 5 s at 4 degrees C. By utilizing a cross-linking agent (disuccinimidyl suberate), it was found that histones H2A and H2B could be cross-linked into a tetrameric structure when on negatively coiled DNA but not on positively coiled DNA. It is concluded that protein-protein interactions facilitate the transfer. The importance of these protein-protein interactions is further demonstrated in experiments in which H3,H4 were included, and, in this instance, the strong interaction of H2A,H2B with H3,H4 negates the preference of H2A,H2B for negatively coiled DNA. These observations are discussed with regard to the mobility of histones during the transcription process during which transcription-induced stresses may be produced."
https://openalex.org/W1595329275,"The activity of Escherichia coli phosphofructo-1-kinase depends upon the dissociation of a group with a pK of approximately 6.6. Mutation of the 2 active site residues most likely to be titrated in this range, Asp-127 and Asp-129, lowered activity but produced little change in the pH dependence, suggesting that these residues while important to activity were not responsible for the pH dependence of the enzyme. Alternatively, the pH dependence was thought to correspond to the negative charge on the phosphoryl group being transferred in the reaction. Mutation of Arg-72 to histidine, while lowering the activity substantially, shifted the pH optimum to approximately 6.2 with a secondary plateau on the alkaline limb that was eliminated in the double mutant R72H/R171H. Mutation of Arg-171 alone produced only a small decrease in maximal activity and little change in pH dependence from the wild type enzyme. The data support an associative mechanism with a transition state stabilized by the interaction between the negative charge on the phosphoryl group being transferred and the arginyl residue at position 72 on the enzyme."
