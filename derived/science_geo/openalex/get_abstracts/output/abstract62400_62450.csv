https://openalex.org/W1485175801,"Abstract The results presented in this paper provide preliminary evidence for the concept that the of the d-lactic dehydrogenase-coupled transport systems in isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli may be electron transfer intermediates. Initial rates of lactose transport and d-lactic dehydrogenase activity respond identically to temperature and both processes have the same activation energy of 8400 cal per mole. The steady state levels of lactose accumulation at a variety of temperatures represent equilibrium states in which there is a balance between influx and efflux. This balance can be easily influenced by raising or lowering the temperature. Temperature-induced efflux is a saturable process with an apparent affinity constant that is approximately 60 times higher than the affinity constant for influx determined under the same experimental conditions. The apparent maximum velocity of temperature-induced efflux, on the other hand, is the same as that of influx. Potassium cyanide also induces a saturable efflux phenomenon which has an apparent Km that is much higher than that of the influx process. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibits d-lactic dehydrogenase-coupled transport of lactose, galactose, arabinose, glucuronate, glucose-6-P, proline, glutamic acid, serine, alanine, tyrosine, lysine, and tryptophan, and inhibition of each system by p-chloromercuribenzoate is reversed by dithiothreitol. Furthermore, p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibits temperature-induced efflux of intramembranal lactose, exchange of external lactose with [14C]lactose in the intramembranal pool, and lactose efflux induced by 2,4-dinitrophenol. Inhibition of these experimental parameters and of d-lactic dehydrogenase by p-chloromercuribenzoate is reversed by dithiothreitol. Reduction of the respiratory chain between d-lactic dehydrogenase and cytochrome b1 is responsible for carrier-mediated efflux of lactose. Anaerobiosis, cyanide, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, each of which inhibits electron transfer after cytochrome b1, cause marked efflux. Amytal causes slow efflux, and oxamate and p-chloromercuribenzoate do not cause efflux despite marked inhibition of d-lactic dehydrogenase and the initial rate of lactose transport. Addition of amino acids which are also transported by d-lactic dehydrogenase-coupled transport mechanisms results in little or no inhibition of lactose transport. These findings are discussed in terms of a conceptual working model in which the carriers are depicted as electron transfer intermediates between d-lactic dehydrogenase and cytochrome b1."

No significant dealanylation or further degradation of the insulin occurs under the specified conditions. This in vitro system appears to provide a useful model for studies of the in vivo converting enzyme system localized in the β-cells of the islets of Langerhans."

The effect is magnified by the simultanieous injection of a nonspecific immunostimulant, BCG. The rejection of the methylcholanthrene tumor is immunospecific and can be induced only with tumor cells, treated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase, identical in type with the growing tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1561221323,"A phage-specific DNA-polymerase has been discovered in Escherichia coli P3478 (a polymerase I-negative mutant) infected with phage T7. The polymerase, purified 700-fold, moves as a single band during electrophoresis at pH 8.0 on polyacrylamide gels and is free of endonucleolytic activity. In order to be active the purified enzyme requires deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates, Mg++, 2-mercaptoethanol, and single stranded DNA templates. Duplex DNAs, such as native T7 DNA, cannot serve as templates. Like the phage T4 polymerase and E. coli DNA-polymerase I, the T7 enzyme preparation catalyzes a hydrolysis of DNA from the 3′ terminus, but unlike the E. coli enzyme, it cannot initiate hydrolysis at the 5′ terminus. However, it has not been shown unequivocally that the exonuclease activity is part of the polymerase. We have identified gene 5 as the structural gene for the T7 DNA polymerase. Phage T7am28, which carries an amber mutation in gene 5, fails to induce polymerase activity in the nonpermissive host. Furthermore, a DNA-polymerase with increased heat lability has been purified from cells infected with the temperature-sensitive gene 5 mutant, T7ts11. The exonucleolytic activity of the purified T7ts11 enzyme is also more heat labile than that of the wild type enzyme. Cells infected with T7ts11 at the nonpermissive temperature fail to synthesize phage DNA, suggesting that the phage polymerase is essential for T7 DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1592242797,"Abstract The histidine-containing protein (HPr) which serves as a phosphoryl carrier in the phosphoenolpyruvate-glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) has been purified from Escherichia coli. The protein has a molecular weight of about 9500. The amino acid composition of the protein is unusual in that HPr has no detectable tryptophan, tyrosine, or cysteine and thus exhibits a characteristic phenylalanine spectrum. Moreover, HPr does not contain carbohydrate or phosphorus. One phosphoryl group can be incorporated into HPr, and is attached to histidine; HPr contains 2 histidine residues. Characterization of the phosphohistidine isolated from the phosphoprotein, together with the hydrolysis rates of the phosphorylated HPr indicate that the phosphoryl group is linked to N-1 of a histidine imidazole ring. During purification, two additional homogeneous proteins (designated HPr-1 and HPr-2) were obtained; they differed from HPr in electrophoretic mobilities and activities in the PTS. These proteins were identical with HPr in amino acid composition; evidence is presented that HPr-1 and HPr-2 are derived from HPr by loss of amide groups during the isolation procedure."

https://openalex.org/W2041637873,"Errors in the identification of objects have been made frequently because of faulty interpretation of their flat images or sections. Such errors are perpetuated through a strange psychological chain reaction. 1) The first author who observes sections of an object, although presenting faithful pictures of sections of it, identifies its shape incorrectly. Such an initial mistake may be due to identification of the flat image with the object itself or to failure to consider the shape of the image as a function of the shape of the real object and the angle and level of cutting. 2) The first author describes verbally his personal concept of the object. 3) The reader reads the text of a publication before or without examining the pictorial evidence. 4) The reader's belief in the authority of the printed word immunizes him against critical evaluation of the evidence. 5) The reader regards a published opinion as a ""fact."" 6) A mechanism of suppression of new evidence is set up in the brain of the reader in favor of previously published, verbalized concepts. His brain unconsciously rejects new concepts that might arise intracerebrally. The printed word supersedes visual evidence. 7) A secondary mechanism parallels steps 3 to 6. An observer notices an unfamiliar figure in the microscope. Following established procedures for scientific investigations, he refrains from forming an opinion about his observation. Instead he rushes to the library searching for similar, published observations. If he finds a previous report about a similar shape, he accepts it as a ""fact"" and he ""confirms"" the previously printed viewpoint. Let me interject a personal experience concerning this mechanism. I investigated the arrangement of blood vessels in the human liver by means of corrosion preparations. The work was divided between an assistant and me. He was assigned the task of preparing drawings of two specimens. In his drawings he showed a structure which was absent from the specimens but had been described in a previous publication. This article shows simple ways for correct initial identification of shape and structure and for the breaking of the reverberating circuit of erroneous thinking."
https://openalex.org/W1588939728,"Abstract Based on leucine exchange measurements of cells labeled with [14C]leucine, we had previously reported (J. Biol. Chem., 245, 2889 (1970)) that only a limited class of of Escherichia coli B is subject to a first order process of rapid degradation. The rate of degradation (half-life of 60 min or faster) and the total amount of undergoing degradation (2 to 7%) was the same during growth and during various kinds of starvation. We extend this finding and report here that the release of this degrading protein is unaltered not only during growth and starvation but also during growth in an enriched medium (step-up), in a poor medium (step-down), and during the diauxic phase of induced β-galactosidase synthesis. The extent of this observed degradation (less than 10%) is lower than reported by other workers (20 to 35%). This discrepancy is not a consequence of experimental manipulation or cellular damage but reflects differences in bacterial strains. Although strains ML and K-12 under conditions of growth release radioactivity similar in amount and half-life to the rapid degradation process observed in strain B, during several conditions of starvation, degradation of an additional class of cellular can be measured by leucine exchange in these two strains but not in B. The starvation-induced degradation occurs at a rate of 2.5 to 6% per hour, and the amount of the cellular that degrades as a result of starvation amounts to 20 to 40% of the total bacterial protein. Simultaneous with this starvation-induced degradation is the excretion of nucleic acid degradation products into the medium amounting to 40 to 60% of the ordinarily stable nucleic acid of growing cells. Starvation-induced nucleic acid degradation occurs in all strains equally. With the findings of these strain differences, much of the conflict in the literature can be explained satisfactorily. We conclude that a continuous process of degradation occurs in bacterial cells at all times, and an additional process of degradation concomitant with nucleic acid degradation is initiated following starvation of nutrients. Some of the properties of the degradation processes under starvation conditions are as follows. While almost all of the degradation products released in the presence of carrier leucine are acid soluble, a large portion of nucleic acid degradation products released from the cells are precipitable by cold trichloroacetic acid. Both and nucleic acid degradation occur under starvation of either glucose, nitrogen, or phosphate. Inhibition of synthesis by chloramphenicol at 100 µg per ml inhibits the starvation-induced degradation, but does not affect the degradation of the rapidly degrading protein."

https://openalex.org/W1508398729,"Enolase has been purified from aqueous extracts of Escherichia coli acetone powder by (a) heat treatment, (b) fractionation with acetone, (c) TEAE-cellulose chromatography, (d) Sephadex G-100 chromatography, and (e) crystallization. The purified, crystalline enzyme migrates as a single band in disc gel electrophoresis and is homogeneous by ultracentrifugal analysis. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 90,000, as determined by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The subunit molecular weight estimated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate is 46,000, suggesting that the enzyme is composed of two subunits of equal size. Functionally there are many similarities between E. coli enolase and other enolases studied. Thus, the dependence on Mg2+ for activity and the inhibition by fluoride in the presence of phosphate are quantitatively very similar for all enolases. Other catalytic parameters (Km, Vmax, and pH optimum) are also similar, but minor quantitative distinction indicates that E. coli enolase is more closely related to yeast enolase than to enolases from vertebrate muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1604210027,"Abstract Acetate kinase (ATP:acetate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.1) catalyzes an ADP-ATP and an acetate-acetyl phosphate exchange. The rate of the nucleotide exchange is unaffected by the presence of acetate. The specific rate of the ADP-ATP exchange is 200 times greater than that of the acetate-acetylphosphate exchange. The exchanges and the over-all reaction have pH rate profiles which are separate and distinct from one another. Mercuric ion inhibits to the same degree the over-all reaction and the acetate-acetyl phosphate exchange but is without effect on the ADP-ATP exchange. Catalysis of the two exchanges accords with the mediation of a phosphoenzyme in the action of acetate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2253277222,"Abstract Tryptic and chymotryptic peptide fragments obtained from performic acid-oxidized porcine neurophysin-I were isolated and purified by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, paper electrophoresis, and paper chromatography. The larger tryptic peptides were further hydrolyzed by papain, chymotrypsin, pepsin, or HCl to yield shorter fragments amenable to Edman degradation. The sum of the compositions of the tryptic peptides, however, exceeded the total number of amino acid residues of porcine neurophysin-I reported earlier. Re-examination of the amino acid composition and further investigation of COOH-terminal peptides showed that the porcine neurophysin-I preparation was not homogeneous with respect to the COOH terminus. The preparation contained two species of neurophysin molecules, in approximately equal amounts, differing in length only by 1 amino acid residue at the COOH terminus. The complete amino acid sequence of both species of porcine neurophysin-I, containing 92 and 91 residues, was determined by conventional methods. The larger molecule contains the entire sequence of the shorter molecule plus an extra leucyl residue at its COOH terminus. Alanine is the NH2-terminal residue of both molecules. Phenylalanine is the COOH terminus of the shorter molecule. Single methionine and tyrosine residues occupy positions 2 and 49, respectively. The location of the seven disulfide linkages of porcine neurophysin-I remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1503325893,"Abstract The in vitro synthesis of lysozyme and RNA polymerase directed by DNA of bacteriophage T7 starts with different lag periods after addition of the template. The difference in lag period before appearance of enzyme could be attributed to a difference in the time needed for transcription. Assuming that the difference in lag phase is caused by a difference in the distance between the promoter and the corresponding gene, and taking into account the average rates of transcription and translation, the locations of the polymerase gene and the lysozyme gene on the phage genome were estimated. The distance between the promoter and the distal end of the lysozyme gene corresponds to an RNA of the molecular weight 2.2 x 106. The polymerase gene is closer to the promoter. Transcription of T7 DNA by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro does indeed result in a polycistronic messenger RNA containing the information for synthesis of both RNA polymerase and lysozyme."

https://openalex.org/W1606964978,"Abstract A total of three pyridoxyl-peptides were isolated from the inducible arginine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli B following reduction with NaBH4 and proteolysis with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Sodium borohydride reduces the Schiff base formed between pyridoxal-5'-P and the e-amino group of a lysyl residue of the protein. The sequence analysis of the three peptides is consistent with a unique pyridoxal-P binding site which has the structure Ala-Thr-His-Ser-Thr-His-(P-Pxy)Lys-Leu-Leu-Asn-Ala-Leu-Ser-Gln-Ala-Ser-Tyr. This sequence has several residues (including a histidyl residue adjacent to P-pyridoxyl lysine) which are identical with or very similar to the corresponding residues of glutamate decarboxylase from E. coli W; their possible participation in catalysis is discussed. Data are presented which demonstrate the power of a differential technique for the isolation of pyridoxyl-peptides; this approach, similar to the diagonal procedure of Brown and Hartley (Biochem. J., 89, 59P (1963)) is based on the altered elution of these peptides from ion exchange resins after treatment with alkaline phosphatase."

https://openalex.org/W1541727459,"Abstract The bifunctional enzyme chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase catalyzes the first two reactions specific for phenylalanine biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium. Both activities are subject to feedback inhibition by phenylalanine. In the presence of phenylalanine the sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme is increased from approximately 5.6 to 8.0 S and the molecular weight is increased from approximately 109,000 to 220,000. This apparent dimerization is dependent upon the concentrations of phenylalanine and enzyme. Chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase that has been rendered insensitive to feedback inhibition either chemically or by mutational alteration does not dimerize. Therefore, dimerization appears somehow related to end product control. However, dimerization is not obligatory for feedback inhibition of either activity. At low protein concentration some enzyme does not dimerize in the presence of phenylalanine. Such enzyme can still be inhibited by phenylalanine. It is therefore suggested that phenylalanine binds to the monomer (smallest active species) to produce an inhibited monomer which dimerizes at appropriate protein concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1487185175,"Abstract It has been previously reported that the accumulation of the regulatory nucleotide ppGpp (MS I), which is governed by the RC gene of Escherichia coli, does not occur in the presence of rifampicin. Since this drug inhibits RNA chain initiation, it was suggested that the formation of ppGpp is somehow dependent on the presence of nascent RNA chains (Wong, J. T.-F., and Nazar, R. N., J. Biol. Chem., 245, 4591 (1970)). We find that this effect of rifampicin depends on amino acid activation: when valyl-tRNA synthetase is specifically inactivated, then ppGpp accumulation proceeds in rifampicin despite complete inhibition of RNA synthesis. The effect of rifampicin on ppGpp formation is therefore indirect, and probably reflects the recharging of transfer RNA due to the fact that the rate of protein synthesis drops in rifampicin-treated cells."
