https://openalex.org/W2026550373,"Extracellular signaling proteins encoded by the hedgehog (hh) multigene family are responsible for the patterning of a variety of embryonic structures in vertebrates and invertebrates. The Drosophila hh gene has now been shown to generate two predominant protein species that are derived by an internal autoproteolytic cleavage of a larger precursor. Mutations that reduced the efficiency of autoproteolysis in vitro diminished precursor cleavage in vivo and also impaired the signaling and patterning activities of the HH protein. The two HH protein species exhibited distinctive biochemical properties and tissue distribution, and these differences suggest a mechanism that could account for the long- and short-range signaling activities of HH in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2089844380,"Autoimmune polyglandular disease type I (APECED) is an autosomal recessive autoimmune disease characterized by a variable combination of the failure of the endocrine glands. The pathogenesis of this unique autoimmune disease is unknown; unlike many other autoimmune diseases, APECED does not show association to specific HLA haplotypes. Unravelling the APECED locus will identify a novel gene outside the HLA loci influencing the outcome of autoimmune diseases. We have assigned the disease locus to chromosome 21q22.3 by linkage analyses in 14 Finnish families. Linkage disequilibrium studies have significantly increased the informativeness of the analyses and helped to locate the critical DNA region for the APECED locus to just 500 kilobases, a much more precise definition than linkage analyses alone could achieve."
https://openalex.org/W2093548319,"The renin-angiotensin system is an enzymatic cascade that produces a potent vasoconstrictor octapeptide angiotensin II, through its physiologically inactive intermediate decapeptide angiotensin I, from their precursor angiotensinogen. In the present study, we generated angiotensinogen-deficient mice by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. These mice do not produce angiotensinogen in the liver, resulting in the complete loss of plasma immunoreactive angiotensin I. The systolic blood pressure of the homozygous mutant mice was 66.9 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, significantly lower than that of wild-type mice (100.4 +/- 4.4 mm Hg). This profound hypotension in angiotensinogen-deficient mice demonstrates an indispensable role for the renin-angiotensin system in maintaining blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2010027324,"Exocytosis in mammalian spermatozoa (the acrosome reaction) is a process essential for fertilization. Both progesterone and zona pellucida induce exocytosis in spermatozoa, which may encounter both during penetration of the oocyte's vestments. When mouse spermatozoa were exposed first to progesterone and then to zona pellucida, exocytosis was enhanced to a greater degree than that seen when the agonists were presented together or in the inverse order, which suggests that the steroid exerts a priming effect. Progesterone similarly primed the generation of intracellular messengers evoked by zona pellucida. The effects triggered by progesterone were mimicked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and were blocked by bicuculline, which indicates that the steroid acts on a GABAA receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2015373718,"The HLA-DM genes encode an unconventional HLA (human leukocyte antigen) class II molecule that is required for appropriate binding of peptide to classical HLA class II products. In the absence of DM, other class II molecules are unstable upon electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and are largely associated with a nested set of peptides derived from the invariant chain called CLIP, for class II-associated invariant chain peptides. DMA and DMB associated and accumulated in multilaminar, intracellular compartments with classical class II molecules, but were found infrequently, if at all, at the cell surface. Thus, DM may facilitate peptide binding to class II molecules within these intracellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2056950366,"Scanning tunneling microscopy is based on the flow of an electrical current and thus cannot be used to directly image insulating material. It has been found, however, that a very thin film of water (about one monolayer) adsorbed to a surface exhibits a surprisingly high conductivity that is sufficient to allow scanning tunneling microscope imaging at currents below 1 picoampere. Hydrophilic insulators, such as glass and mica, can thus be imaged in humid air. The same is true for biological specimens deposited on such surfaces, as demonstrated by the scanning tunneling microscope imaging of plasmid DNA on mica."
https://openalex.org/W1651282701,"In addition to their role in bacterial killing, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) produced by the NADPH oxidase may participate in the regulation of intracellular pathways. We have recently demonstrated that ROI produced by the oxidase regulate tyrosine phosphorylation in neutrophils, possibly by alterations in the cellular redox state. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the identities of certain of the redox-sensitive tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates and the significance of the increased phosphorylation. As a prominent 42-44-kDa phosphorylated band was noted in oxidant-treated cells, we investigated the possible phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase under these conditions. Immunoprecipitation of MAP kinase followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated that a 42-44-kDa polypeptide was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to treatment of cells, either with the oxidizing agent diamide or with H2O2 in cells where catalase was inhibited. Using an in vitro renaturation assay with myelin basic protein as the substrate, oxidant-induced stimulation of kinase activity of a 42-44-kDa band was observed in both whole cell extracts and in MAP kinase immunoprecipitates. The mechanism of redox-sensitive activation of MAP kinase was examined. First, exposure of cells to oxidants caused a significant increase in the activity of MEK (the putative activator of MAP kinase), as determined by an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant catalytically inactive glutathione S-transferase-MAP kinase as the substrate. Additionally, oxidant treatment of cells resulted in inhibition of the activity of CD45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase known to dephosphorylate and inactivate MAP kinase. We conclude that oxidant treatment of neutrophils can activate MAP kinase by stimulating its tyrosine and (presumably) threonine phosphorylation via MEK activation, a response that may be potentiated by inhibition of MAP kinase dephosphorylation by phosphatases such as CD45."
https://openalex.org/W1507341638,"The type 1 angiotensin II (AT1) receptor undergoes rapid endocytosis and down-regulation after agonist binding. In studies on the structural determinants of agonist-induced endocytosis, serial deletions in the cytoplasmic tail of the rat AT1a receptor showed that the carboxyl-terminal 22 amino acids are not necessary for its internalization. However, internalization was markedly impaired by the removal of one additional amino acid (Leu337) and was reduced by 95% after removal of Ser335 and Thr336. Single alanine replacements of amino acids in this region showed that individual substitutions of Thr332, Ser335, Thr336, Leu337, and Ser338 caused moderate but significant impairment of the internalization rate. Replacement of both Ser335 and Thr336 with alanine residues further impaired the internalization rate, and triple alanine replacement of the Ser-Thr-Leu motif reduced internalization to almost the same extent as the corresponding tail deletion mutant. The Ser-Thr-Leu motif is highly conserved in mammalian AT1 receptors but is not present in the noninternalizing type 2 angiotensin II receptor. These data demonstrate that a serine/threonine-rich region including Leu337 in the cytoplasmic tail of the AT1 receptor is a major requirement for endocytosis of the hormone-receptor complex and support the concept that similar motifs in other G protein-coupled receptors are determinants of their agonist-induced internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2090051935,"Scanning force microscopy was used to resolve λ Cro protein when bound as a single dimer or multiple dimers to its three operator (OR) sites. The bend angles induced by binding of Cro to specific and nonspecific sites were determined and are 69° ± 11° for specific and 62° ± 23° for nonspecific complexes. Bending of the nonspecific sites is advantageous for a protein such as Cro that bends its specific site, because it increases the binding specificity of the protein and it can be used by the protein to sample contacts required for the recognition of its target sequence. It is proposed here that bending of nonspecific DNA may be a general property among DNA binding proteins that bend their specific sites."

https://openalex.org/W1725095175,"The oligomeric structure of the Escherichia coli primary replicative helicase DnaB protein in relation to the functions of the enzyme and the energetics of its stability has been characterized. Sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and ligand binding studies show that, in solutions containing magnesium ions, the DnaB helicase exists as a stable hexamer over a wide protein concentration range (approximately 10(-7) to 10(-5) M (hexamer)). The sedimentation coefficient of the hexamer (s0(20,w) = 10.3 +/- 0.3 S) provides an apparent frictional ratio of 1.09 +/- 0.03, which suggests that the hexamer has a nonspherical shape and, when modeled as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution, has an axial ratio of a/b = 2.6 +/- 0.6. Magnesium ions play a crucial structural role in stabilizing the hexameric structure of the DnaB helicase. In the absence of Mg2+, the DnaB protein forms a trimer that, at low protein concentrations, dissociates into monomers. Analysis of the sedimentation data indicates that the dimerization of the trimers into the active DnaB hexamer is accompanied by an uptake of approximately 4 magnesium cations. The sedimentation coefficient of the DnaB monomer (s0(20,w) = 2.8 +/- 0.3 S) provides an apparent frictional ratio of 1.22 +/- 0.05, which indicates that the monomer has an elongated structure with an axial ratio of a/b = 5.2 +/- 0.8 when modeled as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution. Analysis of the ratio of the sedimentation coefficients (the sedimentation ratio) of the DnaB hexamer and monomer, which depends solely on the shape of the protomer and the mode of aggregation, strongly suggests that elongated DnaB promoters aggregate with cyclic symmetry in which the protomer-protomer contacts are limited to only two neighboring subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2004379008,"Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have a distinct compartment in which class II molecules are proposed to acquire antigenic peptides. Genetic evidence suggests that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DM, an unusual class II molecule, participates in this process. Peptide acquisition was reconstituted in nonprofessional APCs by transfection of class II, invariant chain (li), and H-2M, the murine equivalent of DM. The H-2M heterodimer appeared in an endosomal compartment, not at the cell surface, and the localization was independent of li. The data presented show that H-2M, class II, and li are the minimally required components for efficient formation of stable class II-peptide complexes, and thus for a functional class II compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2055348787,The nucleoli of vertebrate cells contain a number of small RNAs that are generated by the processing of intron fragments of protein-coding gene transcripts. The host gene (UHG) for intro-encoded human U22 is unusual in that it specifies a polyadenylated but apparently noncoding RNA. Depletion of U22 from Xenopus oocytes by oligonucleotide-directed ribonuclease H targeting prevented the processing of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at both ends. The appearance of 18S rRNA was restored by injection of in vitro-synthesized U22 RNA. These results identify a cellular function for an intron-encoded small RNA.

https://openalex.org/W1509902327,"We have previously described the stable association of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) in NIH 3T3 cells. This interaction was stimulated by cell adhesion in vivo and by autophosphorylation of recombinant FAK in vitro. In this report, we show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) could also specifically stimulate this association in vivo. This stimulation is independent of cell adhesion or the integrity of the cytoskeleton, suggesting potentially different mechanisms by which the cell surface PDGF receptor and integrins regulate PI3K:FAK associations. We also found that this increased association in response to PDGF occurred in the membrane fractions, consistent with the recruitment of PI3K to the cell surface by the activated PDGF receptor. These results provide a novel mechanism of cross-talk between the signaling pathways initiated by PDGF and that initiated by integrins and raise the intriguing possibility that FAK might participate in some of the cellular effects of the growth factors in modulating cell morphology and migration."
https://openalex.org/W1992375764,Deletions and other genome rearrangements can be caused by radiation and are associated with carcinogenesis and inheritable diseases. The pink-eyed unstable (p(un)) mutation in the mouse is caused by a gene duplication and reverts to wild type by deletion of one copy. Reversion events in the mouse embryo were detected as black spots on the fur of the animals or microscopically as partially black hair in a background of colorless hair. The frequency of partially black hair was increased by x-rays at very low doses. A linear dose-response relation was found between 1 and 100 centigray.

https://openalex.org/W1619763858,"Abstract Synthesis of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan, the major structural component of the yeast cell wall, is synchronized with the budding cycle. Membrane-bound, GTP-stimulated (1-->3)-beta-glucan synthase was dissociated by stepwise treatment with salt and detergents into two soluble fractions, A and B, both required for activity. Fraction A was purified about 800-fold by chromatography on Mono Q and Sephacryl S-300 columns. During purification, GTP binding to protein correlated with synthase complementing activity. A 20-kDa GTP-binding protein was identified by photolabeling in the purified preparation. This preparation no longer required GTP for activity, but incubation with another fraction from the Mono Q column (A1) led to hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP with a concomitant return of the GTP requirement. Thus, fraction A1 appears to contain a GTPase-activating protein. These results show that the GTP-binding protein not only regulates glucan synthase activity but can be regulated in turn, constituting a potential link between cell cycle controls and wall morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1483530675,"Although extensive amino acid homology exists among the various Repeats in ToXin (RTX) family of bacterial cytolysins, the cellular and species specificities remain unique for individual toxins (i.e. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (LtxA) kills human monomyelocytes while a related toxin, Pasteurella hemeolytica leukotoxin (LktA) kills bovine lymphoid cells). To determine the Ltx domain responsible for species specificity, ltxA/lktA chimeric toxin genes were expressed in tandem with the ltxC gene under control of the P lambda promoter. The ability of lysates to kill either HL-60 (human) or BL-3 (bovine) cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The critical area required for the chimeric toxins to recognize human target cells is a 253-amino acid fragment (residue 688-941) that contains the GGXGXDX(L[I[V[W[Y[F)X repeats. A panel of 12 neutralizing anti-LtxA monoclonal antibodies also recognized specificities within the 253-amino acid fragment. Epitope mapping of the monoclonal antibody panel showed that all antibodies bound to one of three sites on the LtxA molecule. One monoclonal recognized epitope A which was composed of LtxA residues 698-709 (KLDYYYTNKGFK), six antibodies recognized epitope B, a peptide composed of residues 746-757 (LIYGYDGDDRLY), whereas the remaining five monoclonals recognized epitope C, which is composed of residues 926-937 (DRARLKRQFELQ)."
https://openalex.org/W1493546447,"The interactions of trans-acting factors with their respective cis-acting elements in the 5' upstream region of the beta myosin heavy chain gene (MyHC) regulate its tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression. The role of three conserved elements, an MCAT or TEF-1 binding site, a C-rich region, and a beta e3 region, in muscle-specific gene expression was analyzed in vivo. Each cis-acting site was ablated in the context of the beta MyHC promoter, fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, and used to generate transgenic mice. In contrast to results obtained in vitro, the data demonstrate that mutating any one of these cis-acting elements does not affect the level or tissue specificity of transgene expression. Sequences upstream of -600 can functionally substitute for any one of these regulatory cassettes and are important both for high levels of expression as well as for controlled muscle specificity. Mutation of any two of the cis-acting elements also does not affect transgene expression. However, simultaneous mutation of the three sites significantly reduces expression, indicating that these conserved sequences do play an important role and that combinatorial interactions underlie the beta MyHC's regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1586117576,"The subcellular distribution and targeting of the non-lysosomal aspartic proteinase cathepsin E have been studied using mouse L cells and monkey Cos 1 cells that were transfected with cDNA encoding cathepsin E. The cathepsin E was retained in L cells for at least 20 h without significant degradation and its single N-linked oligosaccharide remained sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase H. When cathepsin E was overexpressed by transient transfection in Cos 1 cells, it was very slowly secreted into the media. The intracellular form of the enzyme contained a high mannose oligosaccharide which was processed to a complex type species upon secretion. In double label immunofluorescence studies, cathepsin E co-localized with cathepsin D-myc-KDEL, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker. Subcellular fractionation on a Percoll density gradient showed that the cathepsin E co-migrated with membranous vesicles that were distinct from dense lysosomes. Only a trace amount of the enzyme was recovered in the soluble fraction. These findings indicate that in L cells and Cos 1 cells, the intracellular location of cathepsin E is the endoplasmic reticulum. To identify the protein sequences required for ER retention, we made chimeric proteins between cathepsin E and pepsinogen, an aspartic proteinase that is rapidly secreted by Cos 1 cells. We found that amino acids 1-48 of cathepsin E are important for its retention in the ER. Within this region, Cys7, which is involved in covalent dimer formation, plays a significant role in the retention."
https://openalex.org/W1601910626,"A deoxyinosine-specific endonuclease, deoxyinosine 3'-endonuclease (Yao, M., Hatahet, Z., Melamede, R. J., and Kow, Y. W. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16260-16268), from Escherichia coli was found to recognize mismatches in DNA. Using DNA duplexes containing a unique mismatch, the enzyme was found to hydrolyze the second phosphodiester bond 3' to the mismatch. The cleavage efficiency of deoxyinosine 3'-endonuclease on mismatch-containing DNA was affected by the nature of the mismatches. The cleavage activity was also affected by the sequence context surrounding the mismatches. The presence of a G/C or C/G pair immediately 3' or 5' to the mismatch substantially reduced the ability of the enzyme to nick the mismatch-containing DNA. The presence of two G/C pairs, one 5' and the other 3' to the mismatch, abolishes the ability of the enzyme to recognize the mismatch. Interestingly, deoxyinosine 3'endonuclease showed strong strand specificity on DNA containing mismatches, and only one strand of the mismatch-containing DNA was nicked by the enzyme. This strand specificity of mismatch cleavage was not affected by the nature of the mismatch. Preliminary data suggest that the strand specificity is terminus dependent; the enzyme cleaves the strand with the mismatch closer to its 5' terminus. However, when DNA duplexes containing deoxyinosine were used as substrates, deoxyinosine 3'-endonuclease cleaved exclusively the strand containing deoxyinosine. Deoxyinosine 3'-endonuclease also cleaved single-stranded DNA containing deoxyinosine, but not DNA containing normal deoxynucleotides or deoxynebularine, suggesting the enzyme uses different mechanisms of recognition for deoxyinosine and mismatches in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1500885089,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates phosphatidylinositol PtdIns) hydrolysis in many cell types by effecting the specific interaction between the EGF receptor and phospholipase C gamma. Several studies have suggested that PtdIns 4-kinase activity can also be regulated by EGF, but the mechanism of this stimulation was unclear. We report here that EGF treatment of intact A431 cells increased the association of type II PtdIns kinase with the EGF receptor within 1 min at 37 degrees C. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated EGF receptor also increased the association of PtdIns 4-kinase. Furthermore dephosphorylation of phosphoserine residues on the stimulated receptor immune complex led to inactivation of the bound PtdIns 4-kinase, while dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine residues led to activation. Unlike the stimulated activity measured in total cell and plasma membrane lysates, the changes in activity of the immunoprecipitates were apparent at high substrate concentration. Metabolic labeling was used to show that a 55-kDa phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine-containing protein comigrated with renatured PtdIns 4-kinase activity on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while in vitro labeling revealed only serine phosphorylation. These data are discussed with reference to the direct regulation of PtdIns 4-kinase by phosphorylation, PtdIns compartmentalization, and the formation of a multienzyme signal transduction complex."
https://openalex.org/W1571775272,"Macrophages respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with the activation of various genes, including the lysozyme gene. Here, we show that the level of lysozyme mRNA increases following treatment of chicken myelomonocytic HD11 cells with LPS. By transient and stable transfection of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene controlled by regulatory elements of the lysozyme gene, we identified a subfragment of the -6.1 kilobase (kb) lysozyme enhancer that mediates the LPS-induced lysozyme expression. This subfragment contains two elements (D and E), each of which matches the highly degenerate consensus sequence of binding sites for C/EBP-like transcription factors. Furthermore, we found protein complexes to interact with elements D and E whose binding activity to elements D and E is LPS-inducible in myelomonocytic HD11 cells. Immunomobility shift assays show that NF-M, a myeloid-specific C/EBP beta-related transcription factor is an essential component of these protein complexes. Mutations of the C/EBP binding sites within D and E cause a reduction of basal activity and abolish LPS responsiveness of the -6.1 kb lysozyme enhancer. These results show that the -6.1 kb lysozyme enhancer, in addition to its role in cell type-specific expression, can mediate, by interacting with NF-M, LPS-induced expression of the lysozyme gene in chicken myelomonocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1651837389,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), whose cDNA has a predicted 208-codon open reading frame, is synthesized as a membrane-spanning precursor that is processed to release mature mitogenic proteins of approximately 73-87 amino acids in length. Previous work has focused on the structural and biological properties of secreted HB-EGF. In this study, human recombinant transmembrane HB-EGF, produced by expression of HB-EGF1-208 cDNA in a baculovirus system, has been isolated, purified, and characterized structurally and biologically. Two isoforms of transmembrane HB-EGF (HB-EGFTM) were purified from membrane fractions of infected insect cells by a combination of heparin affinity chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The isoform designated as HB-EGFTM-1, a 21.5-kDa protein, yielded no N-terminal sequence, suggesting that it is N-terminally blocked. However, HB-EGFTM-II, a 24-kDa protein, was N-terminally sequenced and found to be initiated at Asp63 in the 208-amino acid residue primary translation product. This N terminus is the same as that determined for a 18-kDa isoform of secreted HB-EGF purified from the conditioned medium of insect cells expressing HB-EGF1-149 cDNA and is also identical to the N terminus of the longest form of secreted HB-EGF initially purified from human macrophage-like U-937 cell conditioned medium. HB-EGFTM-II cross-reacted on a Western blot with an antibody directed against the 16 C-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of HB-EGF, indicating that it contains a putative transmembrane domain. HB-EGFTM-II was bioactive and stimulated the proliferation of BALB/c 3T3 cells and smooth muscle cells and the motility of smooth muscle cells, albeit with approximately 10-25% of the specific activity of secreted HB-EGF isoforms. We concluded that transmembrane HB-EGF is bioactive when isolated, consistent with the possibility of its functioning as a juxtacrine growth factor when still tethered to the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1554779196,"The biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) in mammals and yeast involves a step not observed in trypanosomes. This reaction, which is the inositol acylation of glucosamine phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI), occurs as the third step in the biosynthetic pathway. In this study, conditions were developed to stimulate this reaction in vitro. The synthesis of the GlcN-PI(acyl) from either UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc or [6-3H] GlcNAc-PI by murine lymphoma cell microsomes was greatly enhanced by the addition of either CoA or palmitoyl-CoA. Stimulation of this reaction was optimal with 1 microM of either compound and required that the precursor, GlcN-PI, be synthesized in the presence of GTP, a specific effector of the formation of this glycolipid. That GlcN-PI(acyl) was generated from GlcN-PI was established by pulse-chase analysis. Because no acyl-chain specificity for acyl-CoA stimulation of GlcN-PI(acyl) synthesis was found and attempts to demonstrate direct transfer of [3H]palmitate from [3H]palmitoyl-CoA to the third intermediate in GPI biosynthesis were unsuccessful, the possibility that free CoA was the activator of this reaction was considered. CoA-stimulated GlcN-PI acylation occurred in the absence of ATP, an essential cofactor for acyl-CoA synthesis, indicating that free CoA is the endogenous effector of the third step in mammalian GPI biosynthesis. This finding is consistent with this inositol acylation being catalyzed by a CoA-dependent transacylase. Mannose-containing GPI intermediates were synthesized in vitro when GDP-mannose was added in the presence of GTP and CoA. Therefore, when effectors of the initial reactions in GPI biosynthesis are included, later steps in this pathway can be studied in mammalian cell-free systems."
https://openalex.org/W1515990643,"Abstract The binding of fluorescent nucleotide analogs to the Escherichia coli primary replicative helicase DnaB protein causes strong quenching of protein tryptophan fluorescence. It results from the efficient fluorescence energy transfer (E) from tryptophans to analogs bound in the nucleotide-binding site, indicating that protein tryptophans are clustered in close proximity to the binding site. This is in contrast to the lack of detectable energy transfer to the fluorescent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) derivative, suggesting a distant separation between two function-linked structural elements of the enzyme, the nucleotide- and ssDNA-binding sites. The dependence of E upon the average number of bound nucleotides/DnaB hexamer is nonlinear, implying a larger separation between tryptophans and the bound nucleotide in the low affinity sites. Spectroscopic studies reveal that tryptophan residues are located on the surface of the DnaB helicase in a hydrophobic cleft, whereas the environment of the tyrosines is heterogeneous, with 6 out of 10 tyrosine residues located on the surface of the helicase. The efficiency of the fluorescence energy transfer from the tyrosines to tryptophans suggests that the centers of mass of the residues are separated, possibly reflecting the separation of the nucleotide- and ssDNA-binding sites, with tyrosines constituting part of the ssDNA-binding region."
https://openalex.org/W1532796899,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a large, highly organized assembly of several different catalytic and regulatory component enzymes. The structural core of the complex is the E2-X subcomplex, consisting of 60 dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (E2) subunits arranged in a pentagonal dodecahedron; 6 protein X and 2 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase molecules are tightly associated with this E2 60-mer. The native E2-X subcomplex exhibits a sedimentation coefficient of 32 S. The effects of several chaotropes (guanidinium chloride, potassium thiocyanide, and urea) on the E2-X subcomplex were assessed. Treatment of the E2-X subcomplex with 4 M guanidinium chloride caused a complete loss of enzymatic activity and the dissociation of the subcomplex into monomeric 1.5-3 S species. Removal of the chaotrope by dialysis for 18 h resulted in complete restoration of E2 enzymatic activity and reassembly of a 32 S subcomplex; this reassembled subcomplex contained less protein X than the native subcomplex. Sedimentation velocity analysis of reassembled E2-X subcomplex demonstrated the presence of an 8 S assembly intermediate; this sedimentation coefficient is characteristic of globular proteins of molecular weights similar to that expected for a trimer of E2. Shorter periods of dialysis also gave rise to the 8 S species; the amount of this intermediate decreased with increasing times of dialysis. The 8 S species associated non-cooperatively to yield additional assembly intermediates exhibiting sedimentation coefficients of 10-32 S."
https://openalex.org/W1499674236,"Abstract One of the most abundant proteins in postsynaptic densities is identical or very similar to the alpha-subunit of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Autophosphorylation of this protein in isolated postsynaptic densities was studied under various conditions, following inhibition of endogenous phosphatase activity with microcystin-LR. Phosphorylation accompanied by a shift in the enzyme's electrophoretic mobility was observed upon incubation with Ca2+ and calmodulin at 37 degrees C. Brief incubation with Ca2+ and calmodulin at 0 degrees C resulted in a low level of phosphorylation and no change in mobility. Following this limited Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation, however, a high level of phosphorylation could be achieved in the absence of Ca2+, upon incubation at 37 degrees C. Comparison of reverse-phase HPLC phosphopeptide elution profiles obtained following phosphorylation at 37 degrees C, in the presence and absence of Ca2+, as described above, showed differences, suggesting that certain distinct sites may be phosphorylated under each condition. A major phosphopeptide peak, however, with the amino acid sequence Met-Leu-Thr(P)-Ile-Asn-Pro-Ser-Lys was identified under both conditions. This sequence is identical to the predicted sequence containing Thr-253 of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The results suggest that phosphorylation at Thr-253 requires an initial Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation, which may be at a different site, but does not depend on the continued presence of Ca2+ to proceed. The observed mode of regulation of autophosphorylation at Thr-253 appears to be unique to the postsynaptic density-associated enzyme."

The E60A and E60L mutants of Lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthase catalyzed tritium exchange from [5-3H]dUMP for solvent protons faster than dTMP formation, indicating accumulation of a steady-state intermediate and a change in partitioning of the intermediate. A covalent complex consisting of E60A or E60L thymidylate synthase, dUMP, and the cofactor CH2H4 folate was isolated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and shown to be chemically and kinetically competent to form dTMP. These results provide proof of the formation of a covalent steady-state intermediate in the reaction pathway of thymidylate synthase and demonstrate that the rate-determining step in the mutants occurs during conversion of the covalent intermediate to dTMP."

The mechanism that controls this mutually exclusive expression is unknown. A previous study has shown that the 51A surface antigen gene is regulated at the level of transcription (Gilley, D., Rudman, B. M., Preer, J. R., Jr., and Polisky, B. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 1538-1544). We show here that the 51B surface antigen gene is also transcriptionally regulated, and when the 51A and 51B genes are cotransformed into an A-, B- mutant, the 51A antigen is dominant at 27 degrees C just as in wild type cells. We have utilized this cotransformation system to experimentally determine that 273 base pairs of DNA upstream of the 51A gene is sufficient to allow the dominant expression of A, but 150 base pairs is not adequate. A hybrid gene that contains the upstream region of 51B attached to the 51A transcribed region was cotransformed with the 51B gene into the A-, B- mutant. Despite containing the same upstream sequences, only the hybrid 51B/A was transcribed at 27 degrees C. These results suggest the upstream region is required but not sufficient for mutually exclusive transcriptional control."
https://openalex.org/W1529429892,"The active site of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) is shared between subunits, Arg-243 of one chain interacting with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate or fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in the active site of an adjacent chain. In this study, Arg-243 was replaced by alanine using techniques of site-specific mutagenesis and the cloned pig kidney enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli. Compared with wild-type enzyme, kinetic parameters of the altered enzyme characterizing catalytic efficiency, magnesium binding, and inhibition by AMP differed but by less than an order of magnitude; affinity for substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 10-fold poorer, and affinity for inhibitor fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was 1000-fold poorer. Molecular dynamics simulations were undertaken to determine possible alterations in active sites of the enzyme due to replacement of Arg-243 by Ala and suggested that in the mutant enzyme loss of one cationic group leads to reorganization of the active site especially involving lysine residues 269 and 274. The differences in properties of the mutant enzyme indicate the key importance of Arg-243 in the function of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and confirm on a functional basis the shared active site in this important metabolic enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W100935495,"Adenovirus early 1 (E1) region gene products, including E1A and E1B, are required for transformation of primary cultured rodent cells. In order to investigate in vivo action of the E1 region, we established a line of transgenic mice carrying the oncogenic E1A and E1B genes of human adenovirus type 12 under control of the human angiotensinogen promoter. Histopathological analyses indicated that transgenic mice heritably develop neuroectodermal tumors arising from the pelvic region with varying degrees of incidence. The transgene was expressed in the neuroectodermal tumors as well as in TNT-1 cells, a cell line established from the tumors, where the human angiotensinogen promoter was constitutively active. The high level expression of c-, L-, and N-myc without gene amplification was notable in the original tumors and TNT-1 cells, but not in another tissue examined. The co-expression of the three sets of myc family genes in both the original tumors and the established cell line provided the possibility that the target cells for transformation may belong to a specific cell type that expresses all these oncogenes during development."
