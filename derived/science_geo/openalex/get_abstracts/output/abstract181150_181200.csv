https://openalex.org/W1987924718,"Fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) have the potential to revolutionize biological imaging, but their use has been limited by difficulties in obtaining nanocrystals that are biocompatible. To address this problem, we encapsulated individual nanocrystals in phospholipid block-copolymer micelles and demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo imaging. When conjugated to DNA, the nanocrystal-micelles acted as in vitro fluorescent probes to hybridize to specific complementary sequences. Moreover, when injected into Xenopus embryos, the nanocrystal-micelles were stable, nontoxic (<5 x 10(9) nanocrystals per cell), cell autonomous, and slow to photobleach. Nanocrystal fluorescence could be followed to the tadpole stage, allowing lineage-tracing experiments in embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2092301242,"Spectrofluorimetric measurements on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) isolated in aqueous surfactant suspensions have revealed distinct electronic absorption and emission transitions for more than 30 different semiconducting nanotube species. By combining these fluorimetric results with resonance Raman data, each optical transition has been mapped to a specific (n,m) nanotube structure. Optical spectroscopy can thereby be used to rapidly determine the detailed composition of bulk SWNT samples, providing distributions in both tube diameter and chiral angle. The measured transition frequencies differ substantially from simple theoretical predictions. These deviations may reflect combinations of trigonal warping and excitonic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2004364435,"The nanoporous metal-organic framework Fe2(azpy)4(NCS)4.(guest) (azpy is trans-4,4'-azopyridine) displays reversible uptake and release of guest molecules and contains electronic switching centers that are sensitive to the nature of the sorbed guests. The switching of this material arises from the presence of iron(II) spin crossover centers within the framework lattice, the sorbed phases undergoing ""half-spin"" crossovers, and the desorbed phase showing no switching property. The interpenetrated framework structure displays a considerable flexibility with guest uptake and release, causing substantial changes in the local geometry of the iron(II) centers. The generation of a host lattice that interacts with exchangeable guest species in a switchable fashion has implications for the generation of previously undeveloped advanced materials with applications in areas such as molecular sensing."

https://openalex.org/W2161171034,"N-linked protein glycosylation is the most abundant posttranslation modification of secretory proteins in eukaryotes. A wide range of functions are attributed to glycan structures covalently linked to asparagine residues within the asparagine-X-serine/threonine consensus sequence (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). We found an N-linked glycosylation system in the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni and demonstrate that a functional N-linked glycosylation pathway could be transferred into Escherichia coli . Although the bacterial N-glycan differs structurally from its eukaryotic counterparts, the cloning of a universal N-linked glycosylation cassette in E. coli opens up the possibility of engineering permutations of recombinant glycan structures for research and industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2000766006,"We use pore fluid measurements of the chloride concentration and the oxygen isotopic composition from Ocean Drilling Program cores to reconstruct salinity and temperature of the deep ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our data show that the temperatures of the deep Pacific, Southern, and Atlantic oceans during the LGM were relatively homogeneous and within error of the freezing point of seawater at the ocean's surface. Our chloride data show that the glacial stratification was dominated by salinity variations, in contrast with the modern ocean, for which temperature plays a primary role. During the LGM the Southern Ocean contained the saltiest water in the deep ocean. This reversal of the modern salinity contrast between the North and South Atlantic implies that the freshwater budget at the poles must have been quite different. A strict conversion of mean salinity at the LGM to equivalent sea-level change yields a value in excess of 140 meters. However, the storage of fresh water in ice shelves and/or groundwater reserves implies that glacial salinity is a poor predictor of mean sea level."

Molecules containing 4 to 11 diamond-crystal cages were isolated and crystallized, and we obtained single-crystal x-ray structures for representatives from three families. Rigidity, strength, remarkable assortments of three- dimensional shapes, including resolvable chiral forms, and multiple, readily derivatizable attachment sites make them valuable nanometer-size molecular building blocks."
https://openalex.org/W2171158644,"It has been proposed that Earth's climate could be affected by changes in cloudiness caused by variations in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays in the atmosphere. This proposal stems from an observed correlation between cosmic ray intensity and Earth's average cloud cover over the course of one solar cycle. Some scientists question the reliability of the observations, whereas others, who accept them as reliable, suggest that the correlation may be caused by other physical phenomena with decadal periods or by a response to volcanic activity or El Niño. Nevertheless, the observation has raised the intriguing possibility that a cosmic ray–cloud interaction may help explain how a relatively small change in solar output can produce much larger changes in Earth's climate. Physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain how cosmic rays could affect clouds, but they need to be investigated further if the observation is to become more than just another correlation among geophysical variables."
https://openalex.org/W2082707643,"The Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein, the product of the spinal muscular atrophy-determining gene, is part of a large macromolecular complex (SMN complex) that functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Using cell extracts and purified components, we demonstrated that the SMN complex is necessary and sufficient to mediate the ATP-dependent assembly of the core of seven Sm proteins on uridine-rich, small nuclear ribonucleic acids (U snRNAs). In vitro experiments revealed strict requirements for ordered binding of the Sm proteins and the U snRNAs to the SMN complex. Importantly, the SMN complex is necessary to ensure that Sm cores assemble only on correct RNA targets and prevent their otherwise promiscuous association with other RNAs. Thus, the SMN complex functions as a specificity factor essential for the efficient assembly of Sm proteins on U snRNAs and likely protects cells from illicit, and potentially deleterious, nonspecific binding of Sm proteins to RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2091242259,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor mediates cholesterol homeostasis through endocytosis of lipoproteins. It discharges its ligand in the endosome at pH &lt; 6. In the crystal structure at pH = 5.3, the ligand-binding domain (modules R2 to R7) folds back as an arc over the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain (the modules A, B, β propeller, and C). The modules R4 and R5, which are critical for lipoprotein binding, associate with the β propeller via their calcium-binding loop. We propose a mechanism for lipoprotein release in the endosome whereby the β propeller functions as an alternate substrate for the ligand-binding domain, binding in a calcium-dependent way and promoting lipoprotein release."

https://openalex.org/W2135356125,"The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is known to be able to use molecular hydrogen as a respiratory substrate when grown in the laboratory. We found that hydrogen is available in the gastric mucosa of mice and that its use greatly increased the stomach colonization by H. pylori . Hydrogenase activity in H. pylori is constitutive but increased fivefold upon incubation with hydrogen. Hydrogen concentrations measured in the stomachs of live mice were found to be 10 to 50 times as high as the H. pylori affinity for hydrogen. A hydrogenase mutant strain is much less efficient in its colonization of mice. Therefore, hydrogen present in animals as a consequence of normal colonic flora is an energy-yielding substrate that can facilitate the maintenance of a pathogenic bacterium."

We have considered disks with initial masses and temperature profiles consistent with those inferred for the protosolar nebula and for other protoplanetary disks. We show that long-lasting, self-gravitating protoplanets arise after a few disk orbital periods if cooling is efficient enough to maintain the temperature close to 50 K. The resulting bodies have masses and orbital eccentricities similar to those of detected extrasolar planets."

This method takes into account heterogeneity in Earth models, such as three-dimensional variations of seismic wave velocity, density, and crustal thickness.

https://openalex.org/W2131114792,"A 4–base pair deletion in the neuronal serine protease neurotrypsin gene was associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation (MR). In situ hybridization experiments on human fetal brains showed that neurotrypsin was highly expressed in brain structures involved in learning and memory. Immuno-electron microscopy on adult human brain sections revealed that neurotrypsin is located in presynaptic nerve endings, particularly over the presynaptic membrane lining the synaptic cleft. These findings suggest that neurotrypsin-mediated proteolysis is required for normal synaptic function and suggest potential insights into the pathophysiological bases of mental retardation."
https://openalex.org/W1996457403,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormally expended polyglutamine domain. There is no effective treatment for HD; however, inhibition of caspase activity or prevention of mitochondria dysfunction delays disease progression in HD mouse models. Similarly administration of cystamine, which can inhibit transglutaminase, prolonged survival of HD mice, suggesting that inhibition of transglutaminase might provide a new treatment strategy. However, it has been suggested that cystamine may inhibit other thiol-dependent enzymes in addition to transglutaminase. In this study we show that cystamine inhibits recombinant active caspase-3 in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations cystamine is an uncompetitive inhibitor of caspase-3 activity, becoming a non-competitive inhibitor at higher concentrations. The IC50 for cystamine-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 activity in vitro was 23.6 μm. In situ cystamine inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the activation of caspase-3 by different pro-apoptotic agents. Additionally, cystamine inhibited caspase-3 activity to the same extent in cell lines stably overexpressing wild type tissue transglutaminase (tTG), a mutant inactive tTG, or an antisense for tTG, demonstrating that cystamine inhibits caspase activity independently of any effects it may have on the transamidating activity of tTG. Finally, treatment with cystamine resulted in a robust increase in the levels of glutathione. These findings demonstrate that cystamine may prolong neuronal survival and delay the onset of HD by inhibiting caspases and increasing the level of antioxidants such as glutathione.

Although, the precise mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of HD remain to be elucidated, there is evidence to suggest that the genetic defect in huntingtin is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction leading to an increase in oxidative stress conditions (2Beal M.F. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 275-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Further, recent studies support a role for caspases in the progression of HD (3Chen M. Ona V.O., Li, M. Ferrante R.J. Fink K.B. Zhu S. Bian J. Guo L. Farrell L.A. Hersch S.M. Hobbs W. Vonsattel J.P. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Ona V.O., Li, M.

Nature. 1999; 399: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), and aberrant protein-protein interactions related to the abnormally expanded polyglutamine stretches likely play a critical role in the etiology of HD (5Nucifora F.C., Jr. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 6Steffan J.S.

Indeed, the presence of neuronal intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions composed of mutant huntingtin in HD brain constitutes a striking neuropathological hallmark of the disease (7Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). However, the role of the aggregates in HD pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Another feature of HD brain is a significant increase in tissue transglutaminase (tTG) (9Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Karpuj M.V. Garren H. Slunt H. Price D.L. Gusella J. Becher M.W. Steinman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized that tTG may contribute to the etiology of several neurodegenerative disorders such as HD (9Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Tissue TG (also called type 2 TG) belongs to a family of thiol-dependent transamidating enzymes that catalyze a calcium-dependent acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of a polypeptide-bound glutamine and the ε-amino group of a polypeptide-bound lysine residue to form an ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine isopeptide bond (for review see Ref. 9Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Transglutaminases can also catalyze the incorporation of a polyamine leading to the formation of a (γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bond (11Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). The recent resolution of the x-ray crystallographic structure of human tTG has defined its structural and functional domains (12Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Tissue TG is organized into four domains: a β-sandwich domain, followed by a transamidation catalytic core domain, and two carboxyl-terminal β-barrel domains (12Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 13Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C., Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The catalytic core of tTG comprises a catalytic triad constituted of the residues cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid (Cys-277, His-335, and Asp-358 in human tTG) (14Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This catalytic triad is conserved in all members of the TG family and presents remarkable similarity with the papain-like catalytic center (13Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C., Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 15Pedersen L.C. Yee V.C. Bishop P.D., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting a common evolutionary lineage (13Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C., Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and providing the structural features suggesting that the mechanism of the TGs is similar to the reverse mechanism of the cysteine proteinases (15Pedersen L.C. Yee V.C. Bishop P.D., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Given the fact that a polypeptide-bound glutamine is the primary determining factor for a tTG-catalyzed reaction it has been suggested that tTG may contribute to the formation of huntingtin aggregates in HD (16Green H. Cell. 1993; 74: 955-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Indeed, tTG levels and TG activity are significantly elevated in brain area affected in HD (10Karpuj M.V. Garren H. Slunt H. Price D.L. Gusella J. Becher M.W. Steinman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Lesort M. Chun W. Johnson G.V.W. Ferrante R.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2018-2027PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have raised the hypothesis that inhibition of TG may be an effective therapeutic strategy for HD. However, in a recent study we demonstrated that tTG is not necessary to the formation of mutant huntingtin aggregates (18Chun W. Lesort M. Tucholski J. Ross C.A. Johnson G.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Further, treatment of HD mouse with the TG inhibitor cystamine did not affect the appearance or the frequency of neuronal inclusions (19Karpuj M.V. Becher M.W. Springer J.E. Chabas D. Youssef S. Pedotti R. Mitchell D. Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, cystamine treatment has beneficial effects in an HD mouse model (19Karpuj M.V. Becher M.W. Springer J.E. Chabas D. Youssef S. Pedotti R. Mitchell D. Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Because cystamine inhibits tTG, likely by forming a mixed disulfide, it has been suggested that, in addition to inhibiting TG, cystamine might interfere with and inhibit other thiol-dependent enzymes such as the caspases (20Lorand L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is particularly relevant in the context of HD as inhibition of caspases delays the disease progression in HD mouse models (3Chen M. Ona V.O., Li, M. Ferrante R.J. Fink K.B. Zhu S. Bian J. Guo L. Farrell L.A. Hersch S.M. Hobbs W. Vonsattel J.P. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Ona V.O., Li, M. Vonsattel J.P.

Nature. 1999; 399: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further analyze the properties of cystamine and particularly to determine whether cystamine inhibits caspase activity and thereby contributes to the protective effects that have been described in cellular (21Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M. Hayashi Y. Takano H. Date H. Oyake M. Sato T. Sato A. Egawa S. Ikeuchi T. Tanaka H. Nakano R. Tanaka K. Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Nat.

Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Cystamine was obtained from Sigma, the glutathione reductase (lot B43049) and MG132 were purchased fromCalbiochem, and the caspase substrate AC-DEVD-AMC was obtained from Alexis. The purified recombinant active human caspase-3 (CPP32) (lot MO62912) and the monoclonal antibody for poly(ADP-ribose) (PARP) were obtained from BD Pharmingen/Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal tTG antibody TG100 was from Neomarkers. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 20 mmglutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5% fetal clone II serum (HyClone), and 10% horse serum. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. SH-SY5Y cells that stably overexpress tTG, mutated inactive tTG (C277S), or antisense tTG were described previously (22Lesort M. Tucholski J. Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were maintained in the same media containing 100 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin). SH-SY5Y cells were plated at a density of ∼105 cells/60-mm dish 48 h before apoptosis-inducing treatments. To determine the effects of cystamine on caspase-3 activity, cells were placed in serum-free media and incubated in the absence of cystamine or in the presence of various concentrations of cystamine for 10 h prior to treatment with apoptotic stressors. Cells were subsequently treated with the indicated concentrations of the proteosome inhibitor MG132 for 16 h, which previously has been shown to induce apoptosis in various cell types (24Qiu J.H. Asai A. Chi S. Saito N. Hamada H. Kirino T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Naujokat C. Sezer O. Zinke H. Leclere A. Hauptmann S. Possinger K. Eur. J. Haematol. 2000; 65: 221-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), or with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide for the time indicated prior to measurement of caspase-3 activation or PARP cleavage. The release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium was used as a quantitative measurement of cell viability. The measurement of LDH was carried out as described previously (26Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The percentage of LDH released was defined by LDH activity in the medium divided by total LDH activity. Cells were collected in the media and spun at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to being resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 10 μg/ml concentration of each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, sonicated on ice and spun at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) method (Pierce). Cell lysates were diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 2× reducing stop buffer (0.25m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, 25 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue as tracking dye) and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 7.5 and 10% for immunoblotting PARP and tTG, respectively. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies to PARP and tTG, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed using peroxidase substrate chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). In situ caspase-3 activity was measured using a previously described protocol (27Bijur G.N., De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In brief, 200 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing the peptide substrate for caspase-3 (AC-DEVD-AMC) was added to each well (final concentration of 25 ng/μl) of a 96-well clear bottom plate (Corning). Cell lysate (20 μg of protein) was added to start the reaction. Triplicate measurements were done for each sample. Background fluorescence was measured in wells containing assay buffer, substrate, and lysis buffer without the cell lysate. Assay plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and fluorescence was measured on a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT) set at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. Purified recombinant active human caspase-3 was incubated in 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose (total volume 200 μl). Τhe reaction was started by adding to each well the peptide substrate for caspase-3 (AC-DEVD-AMC). When the effects of cystamine on caspase-3 activity were examined, cystamine was added at the concentrations indicated immediately before addition of the caspase-3 substrate. Cells (60-mm plate, ∼0.2–0.4 mg of protein) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and deproteinized with 200 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). Forty microliters of a 1 mHEPES/1 m KOH solution was added to protein-free SSA, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m KOH. Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) was measured by an enzymatic recycling procedure in which it was sequentially oxidized by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and reduced by NADPH in the presence of glutathione reductase (28Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). The rate of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic formation was monitored at 412 nm, and the concentration of glutathione determined by comparison of that result with a standard curve generated with known amounts of GSH. Data were analyzed using Student'st test. Values were considered significantly different when the two-tailed p value was <0.05. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Cystamine is known to inhibit TG activity (29Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), probably by forming a mixed disulfide, raising the possibility that cystamine may react in a similar manner with other thiol-dependent enzymes such as the caspases (20Lorand L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the activity of human recombinant caspase-3 (5–20 ng) was measured in the absence or presence of various concentrations of cystamine (0–500 μm) (Fig. 1, Aand B). Under these experimental conditions, recombinant caspase-3 in the absence of cystamine exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in activity (Fig. 1 A) and the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of AC-DEVD-AMC curve was within a linear range (r = 0.97) over a time course of at least 60 min (Fig. 1 B). To examine the effects of cystamine the activity was measured using different amounts of recombinant active caspase-3 (5–20 ng) incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of cystamine (31.2–500 μm). The results from a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 1 and revealed that cystamine inhibited caspase-3 activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A andB). Caspase-3 activity was significantly decreased (∼60%) in the presence of 31.2 μm cystamine and almost completely inhibited in the presence of 500 μm cystamine (Fig. 1, A and B). The IC50 for cystamine-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 activity was 23.6 μm. A Lineweaver-Burk analysis (Fig. 2) demonstrated that cystamine is an uncompetitive inhibitor of caspase-3 activity, with aK i of 38.5 μm; however, at the highest concentration (500 μm) cystamine became a non-competitive inhibitor of caspase-3 activity. Thus, in vitro cystamine is an inhibitor of caspase-3 activity.Figure 2Lineweaver-Burk plot of data from the cystamine-mediated inhibition of recombinant caspase-3 activity.Cystamine acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor of caspase-3 activity, becoming a noncompetitive inhibitor at higher concentrations (n = 4 independent experiments; representative data of a typical experiment are presented). The concentration of cystamine is indicated for each line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of cystamine on caspase-3 activity were examined next in situ. Prior to measuring the effects of cystamine on caspase-3 activityin situ, the effects of cystamine on cell viability were analyzed by measuring LDH release. Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with cystamine (31.2–500 μm) for 24 h did not result in a significant increase in LDH release compared with cells exposed to the vehicle alone, revealing that cystamine did not induce a significant loss in cell viability at these concentrations (data not shown). To examine the effects of cystamine on caspase-3 activity in situ, SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated with or without cystamine (31.2–500 μm) for 10 h prior to incubation in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (200 nm) for 16 h. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MG132 alone resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity compared with cells treated with vehicle alone (Fig. 3 A). The MG132-mediated increase in caspase activity was further confirmed by the caspase-dependent proteolysis of PARP (Fig. 3 B). Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with cystamine (31.2–500 μm) prior treatment with MG132 prevented in a dose-dependent manner the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3 A). The MG132-mediated increase in caspase-3 activity was significantly attenuated by 125 μm cystamine and completely inhibited by 500 μm cystamine (Fig. 3 A). The finding that cystamine inhibited caspase-3 activity induced by MG132 was further supported by a reduced degree of PARP proteolysis in cells incubated with cystamine prior to treatment with MG132 (Fig. 3 B). To further examine the effect of cystamine on caspase-3 activity another apoptotic paradigm was used: H2O2-induced increases in caspase-3 activity. In the absence of cystamine, 100 μmH2O2 treatment resulted in an increase in caspase-3 activity starting at 2 h after H2O2 treatment and reaching a maximum after 6 h (Fig. 4 A). The time-dependent proteolytic cleavage of PARP to the 85-kDa fragment after treatment with 100 μmH2O2 corresponded to the time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4 B). Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with cystamine (250 μm) significantly attenuated the increase in caspase-3 activity mediated by treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 4 A). The effect of cystamine on inhibiting the H2O2-mediated increase in caspase-3 activity were further confirmed by the reduced degree of caspase-mediated PARP proteolysis in cells that had been pretreated with cystamine prior to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4 B). Thus,in situ cystamine significantly prevents the activation caspase-3 mediated by two different apoptotic stressors. Further, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with cystamine completely prevented the increase in caspase-3 activity resulting from the withdrawal of trophic factors from the media (data not shown), revealing that the effect of cystamine in preventing the increase in caspase-3 activity did not result from a direct effect of cystamine on the proapoptotic agents used to treat the cells but rather from an effect in the cell, presumably by acting on caspase-3. Cystamine is known to inhibit tTG activity (29Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar); therefore we next examined the potential contribution of the cystamine-induced inhibition of tTG on the cystamine-prevented activation of caspase-3. For this, the effects of cystamine on caspase-3 activity were examined in cell lines stably overexpressing the wild type tTG, mutated inactive C277S tTG, an antisense for tTG, and as a control, the empty vector. These different cell lines have been extensively characterized in previous studies (22Lesort M. Tucholski J. Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The levels of tTG expression in the different cell lines used in this experiment are shown in Fig. 5 A. The level of tTG expression was low in cells stably transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA) and not detected in cells stably transfected with the antisense tTG (Fig. 5 A). However, in cells stably expressing wild type tTG (tTG cells) or mutant inactive tTG (C277S cells), tTG expression was significantly higher, and similar expression levels were detected in both cell lines (Fig. 5 A). In the four different cell lines treatment with MG132 (200 nm for 16 h) resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity compared with cells treated with the vehicle alone (data not show). Pretreatment of the different cell lines with cystamine (250 μm) prior exposure to MG132 almost completely prevented the MG132-mediated activation of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5 B), and cystamine inhibited caspase-3 activity to the same extent for all the cell lines demonstrating that cystamine inhibits the activation of caspase-3 independently of any effects it may have on the transamidating activity of tTG. Because it has been previously suggested that cystamine treatment may affect the state of the glutathione system (30Jokay I. Kelemenics K. Gyuris A. Minarovits J. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 27-33Crossref Google Scholar, 31Djurhuus R. Svardal A.M. Mansoor M.A. Ueland P.M. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the effects of cystamine on the level of glutathione in the cell were examined. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 250 μm cystamine for 8 h prior to collection and measurement of the levels of glutathione (GSH + GSSG) (Fig. 6). In the absence of cystamine the level of glutathione in the cells was 12.7 ± 4.2 nmol/mg of protein. Treatment with cystamine significantly increased the levels of glutathione to 40.2 ± 11.04 nmol/mg of protein (Fig. 6). Tissue TG is a multifunctional enzyme that has been implicated in several physiological processes and pathological conditions (for review see Ref. 9Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that a dysregulation of tTG may contribute to the pathology of polyglutamine disorders such as HD (9Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Green H. Cell. 1993; 74: 955-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 32Cooper A.J. Sheu K.F. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Gentile V. Peluso G. Blass J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The potential role of tTG in the etiology of HD and other polyglutamine diseases is particularly intriguing as it has been suggested that tTG may contribute to the formation of insoluble nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates that constitute a striking neuropathological hallmark of many of these diseases including HD (7Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). However, in a recent study we demonstrated that modulating the level and activity of tTG did not affect the frequency or localization of huntingtin aggregates, revealing that tTG was not necessary for their formation (18Chun W. Lesort M. Tucholski J. Ross C.A. Johnson G.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In support of these findings, ablation of tTG in an HD mouse model (R6/1 mice) resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of huntingtin aggregates (33Mastroberardino P.G. Iannicola C. Nardacci R. Bernassola F., De Laurenzi V. Melino G. Moreno S. Pavone F. Oliverio S. Fesus L. Piacentini M. Cell Death Diff. 2001; 9: 873-880Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Further, administration of cystamine, initially characterized as a TG inhibitor, to 7-week-old transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of huntingtin containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat (R6/2 mice) did not influence the appearance or frequency of neuronal nuclear inclusions (19Karpuj M.V. Becher M.W. Springer J.E. Chabas D. Youssef S. Pedotti R. Mitchell D. Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that tTG is not necessary for aggregate formation in HD; however, in the R6/2 mice cystamine treatment was beneficial as it prolonged survival of the mice and decreased the abnormal movements and associated tremor (19Karpuj M.V. Becher M.W. Springer J.E. Chabas D. Youssef S. Pedotti R. Mitchell D. Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Further in a cell culture system, cystamine decreased the apoptotic cell death induced by the expression of a truncated dentatotubral-pallidoluysian atrophy protein containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat domain (21Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M. Hayashi Y. Takano H. Date H. Oyake M. Sato T. Sato A. Egawa S. Ikeuchi T. Tanaka H. Nakano R. Tanaka K. Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Based on the effects of cystamine, it has been suggested that inhibition of tTG may provide a new treatment strategy for HD (19Karpuj M.V. Becher M.W. Springer J.E. Chabas D. Youssef S. Pedotti R. Mitchell D. Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, it has been hypothesized that cystamine inhibits tTG by forming a mixed disulfide in the active site, raising the possibility that a similar reaction may also occur with other thiol-dependent enzymes such as caspases (20Lorand L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, the results of this study unequivocally demonstrate thatin vitro and in situ cystamine inhibits caspase-3 activity in a tTG independent manner. However, at low concentrations cystamine acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor of caspase-3, revealing that cystamine preferentially inhibits caspase-3 after formation of the complex enzyme-substrate, rather than preventing interaction of the substrate with caspase-3. This suggests that the interaction of caspase-3 with a substrate causes a conformational change in caspase-3 allowing cystamine to interact with the target thiol group. Cystamine by inhibiting caspase-3 may contribute to the observed neuroprotective effects of cystamine in the HD mouse model. Several studies have demonstrated that caspases may play a critical role in the etiology of HD. For example, lymphoblasts derived from HD patients showed increased stress-induced apoptotic cell death associated with caspase-3 activation (34Sawa A. Wiegand G.W. Cooper J. Margolis R.L. Sharp A.H. Lawler J.F., Jr. Greenamyre J.T. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Similarly treatment of R6/2 mice with the tetracycline-derivative drug minocycline inhibits caspase-1 and caspase-3 expression and delays disease progression (3Chen M. Ona V.O., Li, M. Ferrante R.J. Fink K.B. Zhu S. Bian J. Guo L. Farrell L.A. Hersch S.M. Hobbs W. Vonsattel J.P. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further, the combined inhibition of both caspase-1 and caspase-3 is required for effective pharmacotherapy in the R6/2 mouse model of HD (3Chen M. Ona V.O., Li, M. Ferrante R.J. Fink K.B. Zhu S. Bian J. Guo L. Farrell L.A. Hersch S.M. Hobbs W. Vonsattel J.P. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Finally, crossbreeding the R6/2 mice with transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant of caspase-1 in the brain extended the survival and delayed neurotransmitter receptor alterations and onset of the symptoms (4Ona V.O., Li, M. Vonsattel J.P. Andrews L.J. Khan S.Q. Chung W.M. Frey A.S. Menon A.S., Li, X.J. Stieg P.E. Yuan J. Penney J.B. Young A.B. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that in the R6/2 mice caspases may play an important role in the etiology of the disease (4Ona V.O., Li, M. Vonsattel J.P. Andrews L.J. Khan S.Q. Chung W.M. Frey A.S. Menon A.S., Li, X.J. Stieg P.E. Yuan J. Penney J.B. Young A.B. Cha J.H. Friedlander R.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Considering the potential implication of caspases in HD etiology, it is likely that the cystamine-mediated inhibition of caspase-3, and potentially other caspases, could contribute to the prolonged survival observed in HD mouse models. Our results show that cystamine treatment of SH-SY5Y cells induces a robust increase in the intracellular level of glutathione, which plays a key role in protecting cells against oxidative damage by reacting with hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides. There is compelling evidence to demonstrate that the HD gene defect is associated with impaired oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in oxidative damage (35Albin R.L. Greenamyre J.T. Neurology. 1992; 42: 733-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beal M.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 37Browne S.E. Bowling A.C. MacGarvey U. Baik M.J. Berger S.C. Muqit M.M. Bird E.D. Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Indeed, biochemical analysis of postmortem brain tissues provided evidence of impaired mitochondrial enzyme activity in brain regions affected in HD (37Browne S.E. Bowling A.C. MacGarvey U. Baik M.J. Berger S.C. Muqit M.M. Bird E.D. Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Further, increased oxidative damage is also well documented in HD brains (38Browne S.E. Ferrante R.J. Beal M.F. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar); these include increased evidence of DNA strand break and increased levels of oxidative damage products such as 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, and malondialdehyde in brain regions affected in HD (38Browne S.E. Ferrante R.J. Beal M.F. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a neuroprotective strategy for HD might include the prevention of mitochondria dysfunction and the resulting oxidative damage. Indeed, dietary creatine supplementation significantly improved survival and slowed the formation of huntingtin-positives aggregates in HD mouse models (39Ferrante R.J. Andreassen O.A. Jenkins B.G.

Considering these and others findings, it can be hypothesized that by increasing the level of antioxidants such as glutathione and inhibiting caspases, cystamine may prolong neuronal survival and contribute to the delay in the onset of the disease.

Homoploid hybrid speciation occurred readily between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Hybrids had high self-fertility (about 82%), low fertility when backcrossed to either parental species (about 7.5%), and vigorous growth under different thermal environments that favored one or the other of the parental species. Extensive karyotypic changes (tetrasomy) were observed in the hybrids, although genic incompatibilities accounted for 50% of the variation in self-fertility."

These data demonstrate that the Na,K-ATPase α2 isoform could be important in the modulation of neuronal activity in the neonate. Na,K-ATPase is a plasma membrane enzyme necessary for maintaining the sodium and potassium ion gradients in the cell, and it drives the sodium-dependent transport of calcium and amino acids as well as the reuptake of neurotransmitters. The ion gradients generated by Na,K-ATPase are also used to regulate the volume of the cell and to support and modulate electrical activity through direct (electrogenic) and indirect effects on membrane potential. Na,K-ATPase is a heteromeric protein composed of an α catalytic subunit that binds sodium and potassium ions, ATP, and cardiac glycosides, and β and γ (FXYD) subunits that can modulate substrate affinity. There are different genes that code for multiple α, β, and γ isoforms. Four α isoforms (α1, α2, α3, and α4) have been identified, and all but α4 are expressed in the brain (1Shamraj O.I. Lingrel J.B.

To understand further the specific roles of individual Na,K-ATPase isoforms, we have analyzed mice in which the α2 isoform gene has been knocked out. The animals died shortly after birth but did not display obvious gross morphological defects in any tissue, including the brain. Lack of motor activity was significant, but muscle contractility was not found to be critically impaired. Consequently we investigated the cellular distribution of α2 in the newborn brain and the function of an intrinsic neuronal circuit that could contribute directly to immediate death: generation of the breathing rhythm. Mice heterozygous for the Na,K-ATPase α2 isoform were generated as described previously (16James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B. Mol.

Heterozygous females were mated with heterozygous males, and the resulting offspring were genotyped by Southern blot as described previously (16James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R.

Blood was taken from decapitated mouse pups immediately after birth, collected in capillary tubes, and measured for carbon dioxide and oxygen content using a Chiron blood gas analyzer (Norwood, MA model 384). Blood glucose levels were analyzed using an Accudata GTS Glucose Test Station (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Within 15–30 min after birth, newborn mouse pups were sacrificed, and the lungs were carefully removed and immersed in 10% formalin. The tissues were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and digital pictures were taken using a microscope setting on ×10 magnification. Tissues from at least four embryonic day 18.5 pups of the same genotype (α2+/+, α2+/−, or α2−/−) were pooled and microsomes prepared as described (16James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R.

The pellet was resuspended in 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co.).

The primary antibodies used were a α1 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody, α6F, 1The α6F monoclonal antibody developed by Dr. Fambrough was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by Dept. of Biological Sciences, the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242. an α2 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody, McB2, and an α3 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody, MΑ3-915 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). The signal was detected using an ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). For whole mount diaphragm preparations, diaphragms from embryonic day 18.5 mice were prepared as described previously (19Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Diaphragms were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NMJ, neuromuscular junction blocked in 0.1m glycine in PBS, and then permeabilized in 2% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS (TPBS) overnight. The muscles were then incubated with rabbit antibodies to synaptophysin (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco) and then incubated simultaneously with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) and tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 2% bovine serum albumin in TPBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TPBS, diaphragms were mounted on coverslips in glycerol-paraphenylenediamine to retard fading, viewed with epifluorescence and filters that were selective for rhodamine or fluorescein, and evaluated with an Axionplan2 microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Images were captured with a digital camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) and imaging software (QED Imaging, Pittsburgh, PA). Diaphragms with ribs attached were removed from embryos (day 18.5) and placed in Krebs solution containing (in mm) 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 0.026 EDTA, and 11 glucose, equilibrated with 95% CO2 and 5%O2. The diaphragm was cut to obtain a muscle strip from the central region with ribs attached to the tendon at each end. Triangular clips were attached at each end of the muscle strip, and the muscle was held in the clip against the ribs. Muscles were mounted in a constant temperature, sealed chamber and fixed to a stainless steel post at one end with the clip and the other end fixed to an isometric force transducer (Kistler Morse, Redmond, WA). The muscle length was adjusted to produce a resting tension of 3 millinewtons. The muscles were electrically field stimulated using two platinum electrodes positioned along either side of the muscle. Supramaximal voltage and frequency were determined empirically using a series of short (1-s) tetani and subsequently increasing the voltage or the frequency for each tetanus. The stimuli employed capacitor discharges of equal but alternating polarity (60 Hz at 15 V) with three to five instances of tetani or twitches at a duration of 2 ms. Digital recordings of force production were obtained with the BioPac data acquisition system (BioPac System, Inc., Goleta, CA) and evaluated to determine maximal twitch tension. A pregnant wild-type mouse of the same genetic background as the α2−/− mice was euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, and the embryonic day 18.5 pups were removed, decapitated, and the neck and head were immediately perfused and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS overnight. The tissues were cryoprotected and embedded and then cryosectioned in 6–8-μm-thick sections. The sections were dried on slides and then postfixed, prehybridized, hybridized, and developed as described previously (20Aronow B.J. Lund S.D. Brown T.L. Harmony J.A. Witte D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Harper M.E. Marselle L.M. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized with 35S-labeled rUTP from plasmids that contain either α1 or α2 Na,K-ATPase isoform-specific sequences (9Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10436-10442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slices used for immunofluorescence were prepared in an ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (mm) 118 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, and 30 d-glucose, pH 7.4, which was not bubbled with gas. Most slices were transferred immediately into fixative, consisting of 2% paraformaldehyde in periodate-lysine buffer (PLP fixative) (22McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar). A few slices were maintained in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid for up to 40 min before fixing. Slices were immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight and then embedded and frozen in TBS tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC) in aluminum boats. Cryostat sections (12–14 μm) were picked up on ProbeOn Plus positively charged microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20 °C until use. Unstained slides were warmed to room temperature, and a PAP pen (Kiyota International, Elk Grove, IL) was used to draw a hydrophobic ring around the sections. Slides were rinsed in PBS for 5 min, transferred to 95 °C 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, in a Coplin jar standing in a boiling water bath, and incubated for 20 min. This antigen retrieval method enhanced the detection and specificity of the stain. The Coplin jar containing the slides was then removed from the bath and allowed to cool for 20 min. Slides were reequilibrated in several changes of room temperature PBS over 30 min. For all subsequent incubations, the slides were laid flat in a dark moist box. The sections were covered (∼50 μl/section) with 5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBSt) for 1 h at room temperature. This blocking solution was removed with an aspirator, and primary antibody McB2 was applied (1:4 dilution). The specificity of McB2, a monoclonal antibody specific for the α2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase, has been described previously (23Pacholczyk T. Sweadner K.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody, rinsed in PBS (three times at 10 min each time), and then incubated in Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Accurate, Westbury, NY) in PBSt for 2 h. Finally, they were rinsed in PBS and coverslipped in Vectashield fluorescence mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were examined and images were collected on a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 scanning laser confocal system, version 3.2. Because we were using an anti-mouse secondary antibody on mouse tissue, there was light nonspecific staining of large cells and blood vessels. We tried using different blocking solutions, secondary antibodies (different host species, and different fluorophores), and using immunohistochemistry with horseradish peroxidase/diaminobenzidine (not shown), but the nonspecific stain was always visible in control sections (treated only with secondary antibodies, no primary antibody). Nonetheless, the cellular nonspecific stain could be differentiated easily from positive stain because it was very light and was only seen in the cytoplasm. Positive α2 stain, on the other hand, was much brighter and was only seen on the plasma membrane. 600–700-μm-thick transverse medullary slices were obtained from 31 embryonic (day 18.5) mice according to procedures for neonatal mice described in detail elsewhere (24Telgkamp P. Ramirez J.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2163-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tail samples were frozen for later genotyping. Slices used in physiology were prepared in an ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing (in mm) 118 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4 and 30 d-glucose and equilibrated with carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4). KCl was elevated to 8 mm over a span of 30 min before commencing recordings. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Extracellular population activity was recorded and integrated as described previously (25Lieske S.P. Thoby-Brisson M. Telgkamp P. Ramirez J.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The data were digitized with a Digidata acquisition board (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), stored on an IBM compatible PC with the software program Axotape (Axon), and analyzed offline using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All recordings had a signal:noise ratio sufficient for quantitative evaluation. Statistical comparisons among all three genotypes were performed using analysis of variance. Comparisons among groups were performed subsequently using the Tukey post-test. These post-tests sometimes yielded a significant difference between the α2−/− group and only one of the α2+/− or wild-type groups. Because in no case did the α2+/− and wild-type groups differ significantly, we grouped the α2+/− and wild-type recordings together to perform the t tests and nonparametric tests reported in the text. Mice lacking the α2 isoform are born and display no gross anatomical or histological abnormalities. However, these mice appear limp and do not respond to pinch. By opening the chest cavity of newborn pups immediately after birth we established that the hearts from the α2−/− pups were beating, indicating that the mice were alive when born. Several minutes after birth the wild-type and α2+/− mice breathe and turn pink, but the α2−/− animals do not appear to breathe. Therefore we measured blood gas levels in newborn mouse pups within 15–30 min after birth. Both the wild-type and α2+/− mice showed normal levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide (26Vaillancourt C. Berger N. Boksa P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 160: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas the α2−/− newborn pups displayed very low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels consistent with failure to breathe (Table I, Table II).

Lungs removed from pups ∼15–30 min after birth as well as from day 18.5 embryos were fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. As shown in Fig. 1, lungs from the α2−/− mice appeared developmentally normal at both embryonic day 18.5 and at birth compared with wild-type. Saccules of the α2−/− mice at embryonic day 18.5 were less expanded, however, consistent with a failure of normal prenatal breathing motions that exchange lung fluid with amniotic fluid and assist in the maturation of the lung (27Harding R. Hooper S.B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Postnatally, the saccules contained more cellular debris because of hemorrhage in the lungs, which most likely represents a secondary shock lesion in the dying pup. The α2−/− lungs at birth also showed less postnatal dilation of saccules, confirming that the animals did not breathe after birth. In contrast, the lungs from the wild-type pups show dilated respiratory bronchioles and saccules consistent with partially expanded lungs, indicating there has been some breathing activity. We examined tissues from α2−/− mice to check for any alteration in Na,K-ATPase isoform expression. Western blot analysis of seven tissues from embryonic day 18.5 mice shows that in wild-type animals, the α2 isoform was detected with similar abundance in brain and diaphragm, and a faint signal was found in heart (Fig. 2). 3It has been reported that α2 is expressed in alveolar cells when their phenotype changes from ATII-like to ATI-like in culture (46Ridge K.M. Rutschman D.H. Factor P. Katz A.I. Bertorello A.M. Sznajder J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L246-L255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there have been several reports that α2 mRNA is lacking in lung (9Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10436-10442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47O'Brodovich H.

Physiol. 1996; 270: L619-L629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the absence of the protein reported here. In the α2−/− pups, there did not appear to be a significant change in abundance of the α1 or α3 isoform in any tissue compensating for the loss of the α2 isoform. Because the α2 isoform was expressed primarily in muscle and brain around the time of birth we examined these tissues further for abnormalities resulting from the absence of the α2 isoform. If the diaphragm were not functioning properly it could be caused by either a defect in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in which the signal from nerve to muscle is defective or the diaphragm muscle itself could be unable to contract. In agrin-deficient mice, for example, acetylcholine receptors are reduced in number and density at the NMJ, and these mice die at birth from an inability to breathe (19Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). We used rhodamine-labeled bungarotoxin to detect acetylcholine receptors as a marker for NMJ development. Synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle-specific membrane protein, is expressed abundantly in nerve terminal synaptic vesicle boutons, and we used synaptophysin antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody to detect this protein as a marker for the nerve terminal. Whole mount immunohistochemistry revealed normal NMJ development in α2−/− mice (Fig. 3). We then tested whether the NMJ was functional by electrically stimulating the phrenic nerve. The diaphragm was able to contract, indicating that the synaptic connection between muscle and nerve was functional. To test whether the absence of the α2 isoform in diaphragm altered contractility we developed a method of electrically stimulating and measuring isometric contractility in muscle preparations from day 18.5 embryos. Because of the small size of the diaphragm muscle as well as the presence of the attached ribs, accurate weights were difficult to obtain. Thus, assuming that the thickness of each diaphragm was the same in all preparations we normalized the tension data to muscle area (length times width) of the diaphragm strips. No significant differences in maximum twitch force of contraction were observed between wild-type and α2−/− mice (Fig. 4). Two other normalization routines were evaluated: force normalized to length and force normalized to width. In all cases of normalization (Fig. 4 A) as well as the raw tension data (Fig. 4 B), a similar trend was observed, with the α2−/− muscle producing a force within 10% of the wild-type muscle with no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05, Student's t test). Together, these results demonstrate that embryonic diaphragm muscle without the α2 isoform is able to contract both by direct electrical stimulation and by stimulation via the phrenic nerve with a force similar to that of wild-type. Therefore the brain, which also showed expression of the α2 isoform at embyronic day 18.5, was examined further for physiological defects associated with the absence of the α2 isoform. Previous reports on Na,K-ATPase α2 isoform expression have shown that it is expressed primarily in astrocytes of adults (for review, see Ref. 28Peng L. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. Glia. 1998; 24: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, little data exist on the expression of α2 at the time of birth in mice. Therefore, as an initial step toward the evaluation of the α2−/− mice, we determined the expression profile of the α2 isoform from embyronic day 18.5 wild-type mice by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analysis of mRNA and protein, respectively, to determine the cell type and the regions of the brain that express it. Fig. 5 shows in situhybridization of sagittal brain sections in which signals for α1 and α2 isoforms can be compared. In Fig. 5, A andB, the choroid plexus is shown. This highly elaborated secretory epithelium that emerges from the ventricular lining shows strong hybridization for α1 isoform mRNA with the antisense probe, but little or no hybridization above background with the α2 antisense probe. In contrast, in Fig. 5 D, it can be seen that the α2 isoform antisense probe showed extremely heavy hybridization over the pia mater, a tissue that is known to express the α2 isoform, whereas the α1 isoform antisense probe showed less (Fig. 5 C). Neither the α1 isoform antisense nor the α2 isoform sense probes labeled the pia. These data validate the methods by confirming the known distribution of the α1 isoform in choroid plexus and the α2 isoform in pia. In the cortical layer, the α1 probe showed a more uniform pattern of diffuse signal in all of the cells, small and large. In contrast, the α2 probe showed much more cell to cell variability, with some neuronal somas showing strong expression. Fig. 5, E and F, shows hybridization in a region of the brainstem just ventral and caudal to the position of the choroid plexus in the floor of the fourth ventricle. Similar results were seen deeper in the brainstem and also in the cerebral cortex. It can be seen that large diameter neural cell bodies were sometimes labeled for the α1 isoform but more heavily for the α2 isoform. There was also signal above background over regions between neurons, particularly for the α2 isoform, which is presumably in glia, which have a less localized cytoplasm. The sense probe controls (Fig. 5, G and H) showed scattered background grains that were not localized to any structure. Fig. 6 shows immunostain for the α2 isoform in wild type and α2−/− mice. Unlike the sagittal sections used for in situ hybridization, these sections were from tissue slices like those used for electrophysiological recording below, i.e. brainstem cut at an angle that includes the cellular elements required for respiratory rhythm generation. The images shown in Fig. 6, A andB, were from the region of the pre-Bötzinger complex, but a similar stain was seen in most of the section. Stain appeared to be present in both neurons and glia, most prominently in stained somas and fine processes characteristic of neurons. Fig. 6 B is a portion of Fig. 6 A at higher magnification and with fewer stacked optical sections to show more cellular detail. Fig. 6 C, which shows a section through the midline raphe, shows stain in bundles of fibers on either side of the midline raphe. In Fig. 6, D and E, are the controls, showing light stain of neurons and blood vessels with the anti-mouse secondary antibody used to detect the α2-specific antibody (Fig. 6 D) and a lack of specific anti-α2 stain in the α2−/− mouse (Fig. 6 E). These results show that neurons throughout different regions of the brain contain abundant levels of both mRNA and protein for the Na,K-ATPase α2 isoform at the time of birth. The electrochemical ion gradients generated by Na,K-ATPase are essential for the electrical excitability of cells. Because the α2 isoform was expressed abundantly in neurons of wild-type mice, we tested the possibility that the α2 isoform may be required for the integrated function of an essential neural circuit: the generation of respiratory rhythm. The respiratory center of the brain was examined in embryonic day 18.5 mice. The respiratory rhythm network in the normal brain"

It was suggested that the presence of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences in the 5′-untranslated regions allow these mRNAs to be actively translated despite the overall cessation of protein synthesis. Here we tested the hypothesis that the IRES elements of genes that are involved in the control of cell survival are distinctly regulated by cellular stresses. We show that the transient conditions of cellular stress favor the translation of pro-survival IRES, while the severe apoptotic conditions support translation of pro-death IRES elements. Furthermore, activation of pro-death IRES during the etoposide-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent and correlates with the expression of apoptotic fragments of two members of the eIF4G translation initiation factor family, p97/DAP5/NAT1 and eIF4GI. Our results suggest that the regulation of IRES translation during stress contributes to the fine-tuning of cell fate. Many cellular stresses lead to the inhibition of protein synthesis.

Induction of apoptosis leads to the selective cleavage of translation initiation factors that results in an inhibition of cap-dependent protein synthesis (1Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Despite this, resistant tumor cells arise that up-regulate proteins promoting their survival. Therefore, it is critical to identify the proteins and the mechanism promoting their preferential translation. Translational control is a final regulatory step in gene expression. Cellular mRNAs are translated by the so-called ribosome scanning mechanism (2Jackson R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 127-183Google Scholar). This mechanism involves the specific recognition of the 5′-end m7G structure by the cap-binding protein eIF4E. The eIF4E is a part of the larger cap-binding protein complex eIF4F that consists of eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4E. The binding of eIF4F to mRNA further recruits other initiation factors as well as the 40 S ribosomal subunit. This complex is then thought to proceed in the 3′ direction until an AUG initiation codon in a favorable context is encountered, and protein synthesis is initiated. A broad range of cellular stresses lead to the inhibition of translation. This is accomplished by (i) the phosphorylation of some initiation factors and/or their regulators (3Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) or (ii) by the proteolytic cleavage of several initiation factors (1Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The rapid inhibition of protein synthesis is believed to function as a protective homeostatic mechanism. In this context, it is noteworthy that mRNAs encoding several oncogenes, survival factors, and proteins critically involved in apoptosis are preferentially translated by a poorly understood cap-independent mechanism under conditions of compromised translation initiation (4Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These mRNAs contain IRES1 (internal ribosome entry sequence) elements in their respective 5′-UTR and were shown to be translated during apoptosis (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that IRES-mediated translation plays a critical role in the regulation of cell fate (4Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, how cellular IRES facilitate translation or how this translation mechanism is regulated. We have described previously that the IRES element of a key intrinsic inhibitor of apoptosis, XIAP, is actively translated during serum starvation and low dose γ-irradiation (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 21Holcik M. Yeh C. Korneluk R.G. Chow T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4174-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Importantly, the IRES-mediated translation of XIAP is critical for enhanced survival of cells under acute, but transient conditions of cellular stress, thus supporting the notion that IRES-mediated translation regulates cell fate (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In this study we wished to investigate the XIAP IRES translation under different cellular stresses. Furthermore, we wished to test the hypothesis that the IRES elements of other cellular mRNAs that are involved in the cell survival are regulated by physiological stress. We demonstrate that XIAP IRES is active in the conditions of transient stress. In addition, we find that while transient cellular stress favors the translation of pro-survival IRES, severe apoptotic conditions support translation of pro-death IRES. Importantly, the activation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements during etoposide-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent and correlates with the expression of apoptotic fragments of eIF4G initiation factor family members eIF4GI and p97/DAP5/NAT1. Human embryonic kidney (293T), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human bladder carcinoma (T24), human glioblastoma (SF539), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cell lines were cultured in standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (293T, HeLa, NIH3T3, SF539), F-12 (CHO), or McCoy's 5A (T24) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamate, and antibiotics. Transient DNA transfections were done using LipofectAMINE Plus (NIH3T3 and T24 cells) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (293T, HeLa, CHO, and SF539 cells) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in six-well plates and were transfected 24 h later in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of DNA. The transfection mixture was replaced 3 h later with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (LipofectAMINE Plus) or left on the cells overnight (LipofectAMINE 2000). Cells were collected for analysis 24 h post-transfection. For the cellular stress experiments 293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in six-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (5 μg/ml) along with transfection mixture (12 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 + 2 μg DNA in 500 μl of Opti-MEM per well). 24 h after seeding and transfection the cells were exposed to either anoxia (90% N2, 5% H2, 5% CO2 in a MACS-VA500 microaerophilic work station), heat stress (42 °C), etoposide (200 μm), or zVAD.fmk (100 μm) for indicated time and then collected for analysis. Co-transfections of 293T cells were done as described above except that 1 μg of bicistronic plasmid was combined with 1 μg of indicated expression plasmid. When monocistronic plasmids were used, 0.5 μg of pCI-lacZ reporter plasmid was included in each transfection to normalize for transfection efficiency. The bicistronic vectors pβgal/hUTR/CAT (containing the human XIAP IRES), pβgal/EMCV/CAT (containing the IRES of EMCV), and pβgal/Apaf-1/CAT were described previously (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C.

The other IRES elements were reverse transcriptase-PCR amplified from total RNA isolated from BJAB cells using the following primers tagged with XhoI restriction site: DAP5 (6Henis-Korenblit S.

The reverse transcriptase-PCR fragments were TOPO TA cloned (Invitrogen) and then inserted into the linker region of the bicistronic vector pβgal/CAT (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The correct sequence and the orientation of all constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Monocistronic plasmids were constructed from bicistronic construct by removing the β-gal reporter cassette. Plasmids pCI-p97 and pCI-p86 were constructed by inserting the FLAG-tagged p97/DAP5 and p86/DAP5 cDNAs (a generous gift from Adi Kimchi) into the expression vector pCI (Invitrogen). Expression plasmids pCI-N-FAG (containing the N-terminal fragment of eIF4GI, amino acids 1–495 (25Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), and pCI-M-FAG (containing the middle fragment of eIF4GI, amino acids 494–1139 (25Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) were constructed by PCR amplification from Jurkat cells cDNA (Invitrogen) of the respective fragments of eIF4GI into the expression vector pCI (Invitrogen). The primers for PCR amplification were as follows: N-FAG forward, 5′-ctcgagaaatgaacacgccttctcag; reverse, 5′-tctagatcaatccagaaggtctccaacag; M-FAG forward, 5′-gtcgactggatgccttcaaggaggcgaac; reverse, 5′-tctagatcaatcaagccggtccccacggt. Both constructs also contained the FLAG tag at their N terminus for Western blot analysis. Transiently transfected cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in the CAT ELISA kit lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cell extracts were prepared using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase enzymatic activity in cell extracts was determined by the spectrophotometric assay usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (26MacGregor G.R. Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Murray E.J. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 217-235Google Scholar), and the CAT levels were determined using the CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The relative IRES activity was determined as a ratio of CAT/β-gal in three independent experiments performed in triplicates. Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was assayed by protein assay kit (Bradford Assay; Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene), mouse monoclonal HIF-1α (BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-Hsp70 (Stressgen), or rabbit cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies at the manufacturer's suggested dilutions followed by secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG; Amersham Biosciences). Antibody complexes were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from transiently transfected cells with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with 1 unit of DNase I. The32P-labeled antisense RNA probes were synthesized using the MaxiScript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) and gel-purified. The RNA probes span the entire Apaf-1 or DAP5 5′-UTRs and overlap with additional 47 nucleotides of the CAT gene and 30 nucleotides of the β-gal gene. Ribonuclease protection assay analysis was performed using the ribonuclease protection assay III kit (Ambion) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 5 × 104 cpm of high specific activity RNA probe and then digested with RNase A/RNase T1 mix. The digested samples were ethanol-precipitated and separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The protected fragments were visualized by detection to x-ray film. To allow direct comparison of translation mediated by various IRES elements we used the previously described bicistronic plasmid pβgal/CAT that uses β-galactosidase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as first and second cistrons, respectively (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The IRES elements of XIAP, DAP5, Apaf-1, c-Myc, BiP, and EMCV were PCR-amplified and inserted into this construct (Fig. 1). Bicistronic plasmids were transfected into 293T cells, and the activity of IRES-directed translation was determined. Surprisingly, the activity of Apaf-1, DAP5, BiP, and c-Myc IRES elements was only 3–4-fold above that of the control plasmid (each IRES element in the antisense orientation). In contrast, the IRES elements of XIAP and EMCV directed translation at ∼40- and 80-fold, respectively, above background (Fig. 2). The activity of all IRES elements in the antisense orientation was indistinguishable and was the same as that of the empty bicistronic vector (data not shown). It has been suggested that cellular IRES elements may require specific protein factors for their function (27Martinez-Salas E. Ramos R. Lafuente E. Lopez De Quinto S. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One reason why we observed very low levels of activity for Apaf-1, DAP5, BiP, and c-Myc IRES could have been that these auxiliary factors vary among various cell lines and are not present or are present at low concentration in 293T cells. We therefore transfected the IRES-containing plasmids into five different cell lines (Fig. 2). In all cell lines tested the translation directed by IRES of DAP5, Apaf-1, BiP, and c-Myc was very low when compared with EMCV and XIAP IRES elements. The exception was the T24 bladder carcinoma cell line where the translation of XIAP IRES was very low. In contrast, translation of EMCV IRES was stronger in this cell line than in any other cell line tested. These results suggest that the activity of cellular IRES elements vary dramatically. In all cases the cellular IRES elements were not as efficient in directing the translation of the downstream cistron as the viral (EMCV) IRES. IRES-directed translation is cell line-dependent, which likely reflects the availability or status of trans-acting protein factors that are involved in the facilitation of IRES translation. It is noteworthy that although the cellular IRES elements used in this study originate from human mRNAs they were able to direct translation in human as well as rodent cell lines (CHO, NIH3T3), confirming that the mechanism of IRES-dependent translation is evolutionary conserved.Figure 2The relative translational efficiency of distinct IRES elements is cell line-specific. Human embryonic kidney (293T), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human bladder carcinoma (T24), human glioblastoma (SF539), CHO, and mouse fibroblast (NIH3T3) cell lines were transfected with indicated bicistronic plasmids as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the cells were collected for analysis 24 h post-transfection by washing in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysing in the CAT ELISA kit lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cell extracts were prepared using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase enzymatic activity in cell extracts was determined by the spectrophotometric assay usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (26MacGregor G.R. Nolan G.P. Fiering S. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Murray E.J. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology.

The relative IRES activity was determined as a ratio of CAT/β-gal. The activity of each IRES construct in an antisense orientation was set as 1 in each experiment.

Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), because it employs different regulatory mechanisms than cap-dependent translation. In addition, IRES-mediated translation may enable selective regulation of IRES-driven genes in response to divergent cellular stress. Indeed, we have shown that translation of XIAP IRES is enhanced during serum starvation or low dose γ-irradiation (5Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 21Holcik M. Yeh C. Korneluk R.G. Chow T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4174-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similarly, the IRES of c-Myc was shown to be maintained following genotoxic stress despite overall reduction of protein synthesis (28Subkhankulova T. Mitchell S.A. Willis A.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To further test this hypothesis, transiently transfected 293T cell were subjected to three different types of cellular stress (heat stress, anoxia, and etoposide), and the efficiency of cap-dependentversus IRES-dependent translation was determined for each IRES element. While both heat stress and anoxia could be considered as transient conditions, the treatment of cells with etoposide will induce apoptosis and represents severe conditions of cellular stress. As summarized in Fig. 3, diverse treatments evoked distinct changes in the translation mediated by different IRES elements. Heat stress resulted in significant reduction of IRES translation. In particular, the translation mediated by the IRES of Apaf-1 and DAP5 was completely abolished. The anoxic conditions resulted in an initial reduction of IRES translation that was followed by partial (DAP5) or almost full (BiP, c-Myc) restoration of IRES activity. Significantly, translation mediated by XIAP and EMCV elements was enhanced following prolonged anoxic treatment. In contrast, translation mediated by the IRES element of Apaf-1 was completely repressed. The treatment of cells with etoposide resulted in the induction of cell death with only 15–20% of surviving cells at 48 h (data not shown). Interestingly, the translation mediated by XIAP, BiP, and c-Myc IRES elements was reduced, while the translation of EMCV IRES remained largely unaffected. Significantly, however, the activity of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES was substantially enhanced 48 h following the addition of etoposide. This increase in IRES activity was due to both the reduction of cap-dependent as well as enhancement of cap-independent translation (TableI). These results suggest that during transient stress there exists a mechanism that blocks translation of pro-apoptotic molecules such as Apaf-1 while allowing translation of anti-apoptotic XIAP. Conversely, severe apoptotic conditions support translation of pro-death molecules such as Apaf-1 and DAP5, while the translation of anti-apoptotic XIAP remained reduced.Table IEtoposide-induced apoptosis enhances Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES-dependent but not cap-dependent translationConstruct1-aCells were transfected with the indicated plasmid and treated with etoposide (200 μm) or Me2SO (control) for 48 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.”β-Gal1-bβ-Gal (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.CAT1-bβ-Gal (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.Relative IRES activity1-cRelative IRES activity was determined as CAT/β-gal.Apaf-1 (control)0.205 (±0.029)0.980 (±0.031)4.780Apaf-1 (etoposide)0.129 (±0.016)1.418 (±0.082)10.993DAP5 (control)0.198 (±0.019)1.023 (±0.107)5.167DAP5 (etoposide)0.114 (±0.012)1.520 (±0.103)13.3341-a Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid and treated with etoposide (200 μm) or Me2SO (control) for 48 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b β-Gal (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.1-c Relative IRES activity was determined as CAT/β-gal. Open table in a new tab We and others have suggested previously that caspase-mediated proteolytic fragments of the eIF4G family of initiation factors could specifically modulate IRES translation of selected IRES elements following the induction of apoptosis (1Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2853-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We wished to test whether the observed activation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements during etoposide-induced apoptosis could be mediated by such mechanism. To test this hypothesis the 293T cells transfected with either Apaf-1 or DAP5 IRES containing bicistronic plasmid were pretreated with broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk and then treated with etoposide for 48 h. The pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitor blocked etoposide-induced cell death (data not shown). More importantly it also prevented the induction of translation of both Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements, suggesting that the activation of caspases is required for the stimulation of IRES activity (Fig. 4 A). Since the naturally occurring cellular mRNAs exist as monocistronic mRNAs, we next wished to test whether the enhanced translation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES is also true in the monocistronic context. Treatment of transiently transfected cells with etoposide and/or caspase inhibitor zVAD resulted in the enhancement of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES-containing monocistronic reporter constructs to levels similar to those observed with the bicistronic constructs (Fig. 4 A). Since induction of apoptosis leads to many intracellular changes, including activation of nucleases, we wished to determine whether the changes in Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES activity could be due to activation of nucleases with subsequent production of functionally monocistronic reporter mRNAs. However, no differences in the integrity or the amount of the bicistronic RNA were observed between etoposide-treated and control cells excluding this possibility (Fig. 4 B). Induction of apoptosis leads to the caspase-mediated cleavage eIF4G family members (eIF4GI, eIF4GII, and p97/DAP5/NAT1), which in turn inhibits translation (6Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the apoptotic fragments of the eIF4G proteins would allow preferential translation of IRES-containing mRNAs (1Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2853-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, the initiation factor p97/DAP5/NAT1 is processed by caspases to produce a truncated form DAP5/p86, which can stimulate the translation of its own IRES thus establishing a positive feedback loop (6Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similarly, both eIF4GI and eIF4GII are cleaved by caspases to produce distinct fragments, although their ability to support IRES translation has not been determined (25Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,30Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. Mol. Cell.

While the caspase cleavage of eIF4GII produces several fragments that do not persist in the apoptotic cell (32Marissen W.E. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. Lloyd R.E. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the middle part of the caspase-cleaved eIF4GI, termed M-FAG/p76, retains the core region capable of binding eIF3 and eIF4A that supports translation initiation (33De Gregorio E. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and is associated with ribosomes in apoptotic cells (25Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to test whether apoptotic fragments of the eIF4G family could be responsible for the induction of cellular IRES elements, particularly Apaf-1 and DAP5, in our experimental system. 293T cells were co-transfected with IRES bicistronic plasmids and either GFP (pGFP), p97/DAP5/NAT1 (p97), DAP5/p86 (p86), N-FAG/p76, or M-FAG expression plasmids, and the relative activity of IRES translation was determined (Fig. 4, C and D, and Table II). We observed that the overexpression of p86/DAP5 resulted in a significant increase in the activity of Apaf-1 and DAP5, but not the other IRES elements. The overexpression of p97/DAP5/NAT1 had no effect on the translation of either IRES element tested. Similarly, the expression of M-FAG/p76 stimulated translation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements, while the expression of the N-terminal fragment of eIF4GI, N-FAG, had no effect on IRES translation. It should be noted, however, that the p86/DAP5 fragment had a stronger effect on the IRES translation than M-FAG/p76.Table IIApoptotic fragments of eIF4G and p97/DAP5/NAT1 enhance Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES-dependent but not cap-dependent translationConstruct2-a2 μg of total plasmid DNA per transfection.β-Gal2-bβ-Gal (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.CAT2-bβ-Gal (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.Relative IRES activity2-cRelative IRES activity was determined as CAT/β-gal.Apaf-1 + pGFP0.215 (±0.024)0.980 (±0.033)4.558Apaf-1 + pCI-p970.189 (±0.021)0.873 (±0.071)4.619Apaf-1 + pCI-p860.149 (±0.018)7.024 (±0.284)47.142Apaf-1 + pCI-N-FAG0.309 (±0.036)1.387 (±0.122)4.490Apaf-1 + pCI-M-FAG0.289 (±0.021)5.928 (±0.315)20.511DAP5 + pGFP0.218 (±0.017)1.103 (±0.103)5.060DAP5 + pCI-p970.178 (±0.019)0.888 (±0.091)4.989DAP5 + pCI-p860.152 (±0.021)16.457 (±0.327)108.27DAP5 + pCI-N-FAG0.251 (±0.031)1.287 (±0.099)5.126DAP5 + pCI-M-FAG0.244 (±0.028)12.506 (±0.198)51.2532-a 2 μg of total plasmid DNA per transfection.2-b β-Gal (cap-dependent) and CAT (IRES-dependent) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown per 1 μg of total protein.2-c Relative IRES activity was determined as CAT/β-gal. Open table in a new tab In this study we have shown that distinct cellular IRES elements are regulated by different cellular mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that IRES elements of cellular mRNAs involved in the control of cell survival are differentially regulated by physiological stress. It was anticipated that physiological conditions favoring translation of pro-death mRNAs such as DAP5, Apaf-1, or c-Myc would suppress translation of pro-survival molecules such as XIAP and vice versa. Indeed, we observed that different conditions favored distinct IRES elements. Although heat stress reduced activity of all IRES elements studied, XIAP, c-Myc, and BiP were affected to a lesser extent than Apaf-1 or DAP5. Conversely, following 48 h of anoxia the activity of XIAP IRES was enhanced, while the activity of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES were reduced. The most dramatic difference was seen following the treatment of cells with the apoptosis-inducing agent etoposide. This resulted in the significant increase in Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES activity, while XIAP, BiP, and c-Myc IRES were repressed. Importantly, these results suggest that the cellular IRES elements may belong to separate and distinct classes that will likely share either common regulatory mechanisms or trans-acting factors. For example, both Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES were severely inhibited by heat stress and induced by the etoposide treatment, while other IRES were not. Similarly, XIAP and EMCV elements were the only two IRES induced by anoxia. The identification of the shared elements among various IRES elements awaits further experiments. To further understand the mechanisms of regulation of IRES translation during cellular stress, we investigated the etoposide-induced enhancement of IRES translation in more detail. We found that the activation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements is caspase-dependent, since the pretreatment of cells with caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk prevented IRES translation enhancement. Significantly, we found that this specific activation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements correlated with the expression of apoptotic fragments of the eIF4G family of initiation factors p97/DAP5/NAT1 and eIF4GI. This observation is perhaps not surprising considering that DAP5/p86 and M-FAG/p76 share 32% sequence homology. Furthermore, both fragments retain the portion of the full-length proteins that interacts with eIF3 and eIF4A and are therefore considered sufficient to maintain translation initiation (33De Gregorio E. Preiss T. Hentze M.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, while both DAP5/p86 and M-FAG/p76 induced translation of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements, the effect was much stronger with DAP5/p86, although the relative levels of both proteins were comparable. This suggests that these two apoptotic fragments may be involved in the regulation of IRES translation under different cellular circumstances. It should be noted, however, that in our experimental system the apoptotic fragments of p97/DAP5/NAT1 and eIF4GI were expressed transiently in cells that were not undergoing apoptosis and therefore contained endogenous full-length p97/DAP5/NAT1 and eIF4GI. The presence of the endogeneous proteins may have therefore attenuated the stimulatory effect of the apoptotic fragments on IRES translation. It was suggested previously that the DAP5/p86 fragment could function as a molecular switch that would enable IRES-mediated translation during the conditions of cellular stress (4Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 6Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that both DAP5/p86 and M-FAG/p76 can fulfill this function. Significantly, however, both fragments support translation of “pro-death” IRES elements, suggesting that they participate in the acceleration of the cell death. Recently, an independent study showed that the DAP5/p86 fragment can enhance translation of XIAP, Apaf-1, c-Myc, and DAP5 IRES elements (34Henis-Korenblit S. Shani G. Sines T. Marash L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, in contrast we did not observe any effect of overexpression of DAP5/p86 on the translation of XIAP and c-Myc IRES elements. Furthermore, in our experiments we observed 6-fold and 21-fold induction of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES, respectively, while Henis-Korenblit et al. (34Henis-Korenblit S. Shani G. Sines T. Marash L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) reported modest 2- and 3-fold increases in the activity of the same IRES elements. In addition, our results oppose the finding of Henis-Korenblit et al. (34Henis-Korenblit S. Shani G. Sines T. Marash L. Shohat G. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that the overexpression of M-FAG/p76 has no effect on IRES translation. While it is difficult to determine the reason for these discrepancies, it is possible that the use of different reporter systems and/or the levels of overexpressed proteins could contribute to these differences. However, in our study the in vivocaspase-dependent induction of Apaf-1 and DAP5 IRES elements by etoposide parallels the induction seen by overexpression of either DAP5/p86 or N-FAG/p76. This suggests that only these two IRES elements are physiologically inducible by the apoptotic fragments of eIF4G family of proteins. Furthermore, the p97/DAP5/NAT1 is a promoter of apoptosis (6Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and therefore it would be expected to enhance translation of pro-death (Apaf-1 and DAP5) but not the pro-survival (XIAP) IRES elements. Our data support the hypothesis that IRES-mediated translation escapes the control mechanisms that regulate cap-dependent translation during the conditions of cellular stress. In addition, conditions of transient cellular stress, such as anoxia, favor translation of pro-survival IRES, such as XIAP, while the severe apoptotic conditions result in the activation of pro-death IRES of Apaf-1 and DAP5. While the exact molecular pathways that regulate IRES translation in transient cellular stress need to be further investigated, our results indicate that the apoptotic fragments of eIF4G translation initiation factor family mediate up-regulation of pro-death IRES elements during apoptotic stress and may contribute to the acceleration of cell death.

Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3)1 is a member of a growing family of mixed lineage kinases (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of MLK3 or NGF withdrawal leads to neuronal cell death, which can be prevented by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of MLKs, CEP-1347 (2Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G., Xu, Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol.

Similarly, CEP-11004, an analog of CEP-1347, has also been shown to prevent neuronal cell death upon NGF withdrawal (3Murakata C. Kaneko M. Gessner G. Angeles T.S. Ator M.A. O'Kane T.M.

These results indicate a significant and direct involvement of MLKs in regulating cell death; however, the detailed mechanism by which MLKs are regulated is still unknown. The c-jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, heat shock, UV, γ-irradiation, and by other cellular stresses (4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar, 5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar). The signals in stress-activated JNK pathway are transmitted through three core modules: MAP3Ks such as members of the mixed lineage kinases or MEKK members, a MAP2K such as SEK1/MKK4 or MKK7, and MAPK such as JNK family members (4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar, 5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar). The activated MAP3K phosphorylates and activates MKK7 or SEK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates JNK. JNKs phosphorylate several nuclear transcription factors that include ELK1, c-Jun, and ATF2 (4Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

In several cell types, the activation of JNKs is directly linked to cell death (6Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D., Xu, J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11382-11386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, one mechanism of cell survival could be to block JNK pathway induction. The activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) correlates with increased cell survival, and this effect is largely mediated through the activation of a serine/threonine kinase, AKT (also known as PKB). PI3K agonists such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been shown to inhibit anisomycin and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced JNK activation (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H.

Earlier, we have shown that MLK3 is a potent activator of JNK pathway and that the activation of JNK by MLK3 is through direct phosphorylation and activation of SEK1/MKK4 (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). MLK3 has also been shown to activate MKK7 (12Merritt S.E. Mata M. Nihalani D. Zhu C., Hu, X. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10195-10202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), another MAPKK member in the JNK pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that MLK3 is a direct substrate of AKT1 and their interaction is regulated by insulin. This regulatory event has measurable consequences for MLK3 downstream signaling including inhibition of MKK7, JNK activities, and apoptosis by MLK3. These findings suggest that MLK3 is a physiological target of AKT and raises the intriguing possibility that cell death rendered by MLK3 in a cell-specific context could be regulated through this mechanism. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were maintained as described previously (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected with the appropriate expression vectors using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). All of the treatments including those of LY294002, wortmannin, and insulin (Calbiochem) were preceded by 12-h starvation in medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum and then harvested for further experiments. For immunoblotting, the equal protein content of cell extracts or the immunoprecipitated protein samples was taken. The proteins were separated on denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with antibodies as indicated. Antibodies used were JNK and MKK7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-GST (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), HA tag (BAbCo, Richmond, CA), and anti phospho-JNK (Promega, Madison, WI). Antibody for immunoprecipitating endogenous JNK was provided by Dr. Joseph Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). For immunoprecipitating endogenous MLK3, the antibody against the C-terminal peptide-(CRAQTKDMGAQAPWVPE) of the protein was developed in our laboratory. HEK 293 or HepG2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer as described previously (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and protein contents were measured using the Bradford method. Immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were performed either by specific antibodies or glutathione-Sepharose beads, respectively. After thorough washing of the immunoprecipitates, they were either processed for immunoblotting or kinase assay as described previously (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For in vitro kinase assay, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK 293 cells were labeled for 3 h with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of human MLK3 was performed with a QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene). The MLK3 (S674A) mutant cDNA was generated with the oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGAGCGCGGGGAGaCCCCGACAACACCCCCC-3′ (mismatch with the wild-type MLK3 template is indicated by lowercase letter). HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP along with the vectors encoding the proteins as indicated. 36 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). The DAPI-stained nuclei in GFP-positive cells were analyzed for apoptotic morphology by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. PI3K−AKT pathway, which is induced by insulin or IGF-1, has been reported to act as a cell survival pathway in many cell types (13Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 14Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5138) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that JNK pathway is down-regulated by insulin or IGF-1 treatments (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Okubo Y. Blakesley V.A. Stannard B. Gutkind S. Le Roith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25961-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which results in greater cell survival (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to identify the molecule(s) in the JNK pathway that could be regulated by PI3K−AKT signaling. We first examined whether stress-induced JNK activation is regulated by pretreatment with insulin. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with insulin significantly attenuated the effect of anisomycin on JNK activation. The inhibitory effect of insulin was more profound on JNK2 compared with JNK1 (Fig. 1, A andB). The pretreatment of HepG2 cells with the PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, prevented the inhibitory effect of insulin on JNK, indicating that the JNK pathway could be down-regulated by PI3K−AKT pathway. MKK7 and SEK1/MKK4 are two distinct MAPKK members that can directly phosphorylate and activate downstream target JNK (5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that SEK1 activity is inhibited by insulin, and this leads to the inhibition of JNK activity (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have also observed that SEK1 kinase activity is inhibited by insulin (data not shown). Because MKK7 is a specific activator of JNK pathway, unlike SEK1 in which SEK1 can activate the p38 MAPK as well as JNK pathways (5Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3644) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of insulin on anisomycin-induced MKK7 activity. Endogenous MKK7 from HepG2 cells was also inhibited by insulin, and pretreatment with PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, were able to block the effect of insulin on MKK7 kinase activity (Fig. 1 C). We have reported earlier that MLK3 activates JNK pathway through direct phosphorylation and activation of SEK1 (1Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and MLK3 has also been demonstrated to phosphorylate MKK7 (12Merritt S.E. Mata M. Nihalani D. Zhu C., Hu, X. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10195-10202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MLK3 kinase activity, estimated by using MKK7 (Ala) as substrate, was similarly inhibited by pretreatment with insulin, and the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, blocked the inhibitory effect of insulin on MLK3 kinase activity as well as the MLK3 autophosphorylation (Fig. 1 D). The inhibitory effect of insulin on MKK7 and MLK3 was modest but quite consistent and was not as profound as on anisomycin-induced JNK activity, indicating that there could be other targets of insulin regulating JNK activity. Recently, it has been shown that SEK1, an immediate upstream kinase to JNK, is also down-regulated by insulin through PI3K-AKT pathways (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas the JNK activator ASK1 is similarly inhibited by AKT (15Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Thus, the modest but consistent inhibition of JNK upstream activator (i.e. MKK7 and MLK3) was not unexpected; rather, the potent inhibition of JNK by insulin points to the fact that the inhibitory effect of insulin on JNK is an additive effect of insulin targets within the JNK pathway. AKT recognizes its substrate proteins at the conserved consensus sequence of RXRXX(S/T)X (16Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar,17Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). A putative consensus AKT phosphorylation sequence (RERGESP) is present at amino acids 669–675 of human MLK3. The putative AKT consensus phosphorylation sequence is not present on either MLK1 or MLK2; however, two AKT consensus phosphorylation motifs are present on dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK). Because insulin inhibited JNK activity and MLK3 contains a potential AKT phosphorylation site, we postulated that the inhibitory effect of the PI3K−AKT pathway on JNK pathway is partly mediated proximally through MLK3. To test this hypothesis, we probed for endogenous association of MLK3 with AKT in HepG2 cells. MLK3 co-precipitated with AKT under basal conditions, but this association was attenuated upon insulin treatment. The treatment of cells with LY294002 and wortmannin prevented the insulin-induced decrease in association between AKT and MLK3 (Fig. 2 A). Whether DLK having the putative AKT phosphorylation sites associates with AKT and is regulated by insulin in a manner similar to MLK3 is an area yet to be investigated. The potential AKT phosphorylation site on MLK3 is located in the C-terminal half of the protein. To determine whether the interaction between MLK3 and AKT is mediated through this region on MLK3, the N-terminal half (amino acids 1–386) or the C-terminal half (amino acids 511–847) of MLK3 was each transfected into HEK 293 cells. Both full-length and the C-terminal portion of MLK3 were found to interact with AKT, but the N-terminal half of MLK3 failed to bind (Fig. 2 B). Since we observed that insulin regulates endogenous interaction between AKT and MLK3 in HepG2 cells and that the full-length as well as C-terminal domain of MLK3 interacted with AKT in HEK293 cells, we examined the effect of insulin on the interaction between C-terminal half of MLK3 with AKT. Whereas recombinant full-length MLK3 interacted with AKT in a manner similar to the endogenous MLK3, interaction of the C-terminal truncated mutant with AKT was not regulated by insulin, suggesting that the truncation mutant lacks a domain necessary for dissociation from AKT (Fig. 2 C). We next examined the effect of PI3K-AKT pathway activation on MLK3-mediated JNK activation. In HEK 293 cells, overexpression of AKT inhibited JNK activation through MLK3, whereas insulin treatment further inhibited the JNK activation (Fig. 2 D). In the same experiment, we measured the kinase activity of the MLK3 and found it to be inhibited by insulin in presence of AKT, and this effect was reversed by LY294002 (Fig. 2 E). Since a potential AKT consensus phosphorylation site in MLK3 was present at serine 674 (Fig. 3 A), we examined whether serine 674 in MLK3 is targeted by AKT. We mutated this residue to alanine in full-length MLK3 and also within the C-terminal regulatory tail and performed in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of recombinant AKT. Although a low level of phosphorylation of MLK3-(511–847) S674A was observed, the full-length kinase inactive MLK3 and MLK3 truncation mutant (amino acids 511–847) were both phosphorylated to higher degree by AKT (Fig. 3 B). The significant decrease in the phosphorylation of S674A mutant suggests that serine 674 represents an important phosphorylation site. In vivo, metabolic 32P-labeling experiments in HEK 293 cells showed that active AKT was able to phosphorylate kinase-inactive MLK3, whereas phosphorylation of the MLK3 (K144A) S674A mutant was very low, in agreement with the in vitro phosphorylation data (Fig. 3 C). In transfection experiments, AKT and insulin treatment could not regulate the activity of MLK3 S674A mutant (Fig. 3 D), and consequently, no alteration in the JNK activation was observed under similar conditions (Fig. 3 E), proving that serine 674 in the MLK3 is the target of AKT. It has been shown that cell death caused by overexpression of MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and DLK is rescued by overexpressing active AKT in neuronal cells (18Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because MLK1 and MLK2 do not contain putative AKT phosphorylation sites, the one possible way by which AKT can exert its cell survival effect could be through phosphorylating and inactivating SEK1, since SEK1 has been shown to be down-regulated by AKT (9Park H.S. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, in the case of MLK3-mediated cell death, the effect of AKT could be the synergistic outcome through inactivating MLK3 as well as SEK1. The DLK contains two putative AKT phosphorylation sites, one at serine 551 and another at threonine 626. It is possible that DLK could be regulated in a manner similar to MLK3 by AKT, which needs to be determined. Since MLK3 has been implicated in neuronal cell death (2Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Connors T.J. Durkin J.T. Angeles T. Gessner G., Xu, Z. Meyer S.L. Savage M.J. Greene L.A. Scott R.W. Vaught J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25302-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we examined whether MLK3 overexpression causes cell death in HeLa cells similar to neuronal cells and whether the cell death induced by MLK3 can be regulated by AKT. Transfection of MLK3 into HeLa cells resulted in an increase in apoptotic cell death, and this effect was inhibited by co-expressing a constitutively active AKT (Myr-AKT). The co-expression of a mutant of MLK3 (lacking the putative AKT phosphorylation site) with AKT induced apoptosis, suggesting that the AKT-mediated blockage of MLK3 induced death was dependent upon phosphorylation of serine 674 (Fig. 3 F). It is possible that AKT in some cellular contexts may keep MLK3 kinase activity suppressed under normal conditions. For example, in PC-12 cells and sympathetic neurons, which die in a MLK-dependent manner upon NGF withdrawal (18Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), NGF-dependent survival may in part reflect AKT inhibition of MLK3. This hypothesis is further substantiated by a recent finding (19Harris C. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr E.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in which cerebellar granule neurons maintained under high potassium and low serum, the condition under which PI3K-AKT pathway is active, showing profound JNK activation and rapid cell death upon LY294002 treatment. However, this JNK activation and cell death are prevented if cells are treated with CEP-1347 along with LY294002, indicating that PI3K-AKT pathway down-regulates the MLK-mediated JNK activation and cell death process. IGF-1 and IGF-2 inhibits TNF-α-induced JNK activation in HEK 293 (10Okubo Y. Blakesley V.A. Stannard B. Gutkind S. Le Roith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25961-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and CG4 cell lines, respectively (20Nicholas R.S. Stevens S. Wing M.G. Compston D.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2002; 124: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that TNF-α also induces MLK3 activity in Jurkat T Cells (22Sathyanarayana P.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and that TNF-α-induced cell death was inhibited by CEP-11004, a specific mixed lineage kinase inhibitor in PC-12 cells (21Mielke K. Herdegen T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations along with our present results suggest that insulin mediated inhibition of TNF-α-induced JNK pathway may be partly mediated through inhibition of MLK3 activity by AKT. Taken together, our results identify AKT as the first reported negative regulator of MLK3 kinase activity. Further studies may help to unravel the mechanism leading to neuronal apoptosis as well as other cell death pathways and also help in the development of targeted pharmacological interventions in neurodegenerative disorders involving neuronal apoptosis such as in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

https://openalex.org/W2040578305,"Ras GTPases include the isoforms H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras. Despite their great biochemical and biological similarities, evidence is mounting suggesting that Ras proteins may not be functionally redundant. A widespread strategy for studying small GTPases is the utilization of dominant inhibitory mutants that specifically block the activation of their respective wild-type proteins. As such, H-Ras N17 has proved to be extremely valuable as a tool to probe Ras functions. However, a comparative study on the inhibitory specificities of H-, K-, and N-Ras N17 mutants has not been approached thus far. Herein, we demonstrate that H-, K-, and N-Ras N17 mutants exhibit markedly distinct inhibitory effects toward H-, K-, and N-Ras. H-Ras N17 can effectively inhibit the activation of all three isoforms. K-Ras N17 completely blocks the activation of K-Ras and is only slightly inhibitory on H-Ras. N-Ras N17 can mainly inhibit N-Ras activation. In light of the recent data on the compartmentalization of H-Ras and K-Ras in the plasma membrane, here we present for the first time a description of N-Ras cellular microlocalization.

Overall, our results on Ras N17 mutants specificities exhibit a marked correlation with the localization of the Ras isoforms to distinct membrane microdomains. Ras GTPases are essential mediators in signaling pathways that convey extracellular signals from surface receptors to the interior of the cell, functioning as molecular switches in processes governing cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (1Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Fronts. Biosci. 1998; 3: 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Crespo P. Leon J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1613-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The three mammalian ras genes encode for four proteins: H-Ras, K-Ras4A, K-Ras4B, and N-Ras, of 189 amino acids (188 in K-Ras4B) and 21 kDa. These proteins are identical over the N-terminal 85 residues, and their identity is up to 90% within the following 80 residues. The main divergence among Ras isoforms is restricted to the 24 C-terminal amino acids, in which less than 15% of the residues are identical between any pair of proteins, with the sole exception of cysteine 186. For this reason, this segment has been termed the heterogeneous or hypervariable region (3Lowy D.R. Willumsem B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). This region contains an essential signal for localizing Ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, the CAAX box (C = cysteine, A = alyphatic amino acid, andX = serine/methionine), located at the extreme C terminus. The CAAX box suffers a post-translational modification that makes it more hydrophobic. The cysteine is farnesylated, the AAX sequence is proteolyzed, and the newly C-terminal cysteine is carboxymethylated (4Willumsem B.M. Christensen A. Hubbert N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A second signal is required for efficiently positioning Ras in the membrane. This is accomplished by palmitoylation of cysteine 181 in N-Ras and cysteines 181 and 184 in H-Ras. In the case of K-Ras4B the second signal consist of a polybasic motif of six lysines (175–180) that is believed to interact electrostatically with the negatively charged membrane (5Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 6Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In mammalians, the three ras genes are ubiquitously expressed, even though the expression pattern for each gene is quantitatively different depending on the organ (8Leon J. Guerrero I. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Fiorucci G. Hall A. Biochym. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 950: 81-83Google Scholar). Variations in the expression pattern also exist throughout embryonic development (8Leon J. Guerrero I. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,10Muller R. Slamon D.J. Adamson E.J. Tremblay J.M. Muller D. Cline M.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and during differentiation processes (2Crespo P. Leon J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1613-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). But despite these differences, no instance has been reported in which the expression of any one of the three ras genes is completely absent. This has lead to the notion that, regardless of their great similarities, the functions of the three Ras proteins may not be completely redundant. In this line, during these past years a considerable amount of data has been accumulated that speaks in favor of the three Ras proteins having differential functions. As such, different ras genes are activated in different human tumors (11Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rodenhuis S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 241-247PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the three ras genes have different transforming potential depending on the cell line (13Maher J. Baker D.A. Manning M. Dibb N.J. Roberts I.A.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar), suggestive of cell-specific activities. Ras proteins exhibit distinct sensitivities to inhibition by GAPs (14Bollag G. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 351: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and to activation by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine-nucleotide exchange factor; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MBP, myelin basic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein (15Jones M.K.

Hayward N. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32260-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Also, regarding effector interactions, Ras isoforms vary in their ability to activate Raf, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Rac-1 (17Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 18Voice J.K. Klemke R.I. Le A. Jackson J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15609-15615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). But perhaps the most compelling evidence advocating for the three Ras proteins having distinct functions has been provided by gene targeting experiments. It has been found that N-ras knock-out mice develop and reproduce normally (20Umanoff H. Edelman W. Pellicer A. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). H-ras knock-out animals are also normal (21Ise K. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Shimuzu S. Harada H. Ichise T. Miyoshi J. Gondo Y. Ishikawa T. Aiba A. Katsuki M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2951-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Strikingly, H- and N-ras double knock-outs also exhibit no detectable abnormalities (22Esteban L.M. Vicario-Arbejon C. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fernandez- Melarde A. Swaminathan N. Yienger K. Lopez E. McKay R. Ward J.M. Pellicer A. Santos E. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2001; 21: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). On the other hand, K-ras-deficient mice die during embryonic development (23Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson M.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 24Koera K. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Miyoshi J. Toyoshima K. Hatta T. Otani H. Aiba A. Katsuki M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting that K-Ras possesses functions not shared by H- or N-Ras. Recently, a considerable body of evidence has been accumulated suggesting that the aforementioned biochemical and biological differences among Ras isoforms could be due, in part, to variations in plasma membrane microlocalization (25Prior I.A. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this line, it has been shown that H-Ras is equally localized in caveolae, lipid rafts, and disordered membrane. By contrast, K-Ras is preferentially located in disordered, nonraft plasma membrane (26Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), although some may be present in caveolae depending on the cell type (27Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenar W.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1880-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, N-Ras localizes to caveolin-positive and caveolin-negative domains (27Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenar W.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1880-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but its detailed microlocalization has not been examined so far. Recent reports also demonstrate that all of the information required for membrane localization is contained in the hypervariable regions of the Ras isoforms (28Welman A. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Jaumot M. Yan J. Clyde-Smith J. Sluimer J. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 272-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that also dictate how Ras proteins traffic to their final locations. Whereas H- and N-Ras traffic to the plasma membrane along the secretory pathway through the Golgi complex, K-Ras4B is directly routed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the membrane by still unknown mechanisms (30Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 31Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Multiple strategies have been utilized thus far to unveil the functions of Ras proteins in cells. Among these, the use of dominant inhibitory mutants is now widely established (32Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Ever since its identification (33Sigal I. Gibbs J.B. D'Alonzo J.S. Temeles G.H. Wolanski B.S. Socher S.H. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) the Ras mutant with a substitution of serine 17 by aspargine (Ras N17) and its homologues have been invaluable tools in the extensive progress that has been made in our understanding of the roles of Ras-related GTPases in general and of Ras in particular. It is now accepted that Ras N17 mutants work in vivo by competing with wild-type Ras for binding to exchange factors. Because N17 mutants have a higher affinity for exchange factors than does normal Ras, and they cannot interact with downstream effectors, this results in the formation of unproductive complexes, thereby preventing the activation of endogenous Ras (32Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As such, it could be concluded that rather than inhibiting Ras itself, N17 mutants inhibit the function of exchange factors. Consistently, because most Ras exchange factors can activate H-, K-, and N- Ras, at least in vitro (35Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossmann K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the expression of one Ras N17 mutant could be predicted to block the activation of the other two Ras isoforms. This conceptual pitfall may have precluded a more extensive use of the N17 mutants for the study of the differential functions of the three Ras isoforms. However, a comparative study on the specificities of H-, K-, and N-Ras dominant inhibitory mutants has not been approached experimentally so far. Herein, we have undertaken that challenge. We demonstrate that H-, K-, and N-Ras N17 mutants exhibit markedly distinct specificities on their inhibitory functions. H-Ras N17 can inhibit the activation of all three isoforms. K-Ras N17 completely inhibits the activation of K-Ras and, slightly, that of H-Ras. Likewise, N-Ras N17 can chiefly inhibit N-Ras activation. These results can be explained in light of the recent data on the compartmentalization of Ras proteins. In this respect, we present for the first time a detailed description of N-Ras cellular microlocalization. Plasmids encoding for CAL-DAG I and III were provided by M. Matsuda; Ras-GRP (CAL-DAG II) was provided by J.C. Stone; Ras-GRF2 was provided by M.F. Moran. K-Ras4B N17, N-Ras N17, and H-Ras ΔCAAX (lacking Cys186) and N-Ras S186C were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. Sequences of the oligonucleotides utilized are available upon request. The inserts were cloned in pCEFL, a modified pCDNA3 in which the cytomegalovirus promoter was substituted for the EF-1α promoter, containing an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA), a FLAG or an AU5 tag, or a Src myristoylation signal, as indicated. H-Ras, N-Ras, and N-Ras C-terminal 26 amino acids (hypervariable region) were cloned in pEGFP-C1. COS-7, NIH3T3, and MDCK cells were regularly grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (new born, for NIH3T3). COS-7 subconfluent cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran technique (36Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

MEFs were regularly grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine 2 mm, 0.1 mm minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids, β-mercaptoethanol 55 μm. MEFs, NIH3T3, and MDCK cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. EGF and PDGF were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. LPA was from Sigma. ERK2 kinase activities were determined as previously described (37Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J.

Total lysates and immunoprecipitates were fractionated in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters as described (38Ajenjo N. Aaronson D.S. Ceballos E. Richard C. León J. Crespo P.

Immunocomplexes were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel). Mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-AU5 and anti-HA antibodies were from Babco. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG was from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-H-Ras, -K-Ras, -N-Ras, and -caveolin were from Santa Cruz Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal anti-Pan-Ras was fromCalbiochem. Ras GTP loading was performed basically as described (39Arozarena I. Matallanas D. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21878-21884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-Ras-transfected cells were lysed in HEM buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 4% glycerol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. HA-Ras was affinity sequestered with bacterially synthesized GST-Raf Ras-binding domain (amino acids 1–149). Immunoblots were performed as described above using anti-HA antibody and quantitated by densitometry, using the program NIH Image 1.60. Ras-GTP levels were related to total Ras protein levels as determined by anti-HA immunoblotting in the corresponding total lysates. Subcellular fractionation was performed in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4 buffer, basically as described (37Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cells were collected and resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100, rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were set to a sucrose concentration of 41%. Layers of 8.5 ml of 35% sucrose (in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and of 2.5 ml 16% sucrose were sequentially overlaid and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 18 h at 35000 rpm. Eleven or twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, precipitated in 6.5% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in loading buffer, and fractionated in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. MDCK cells transfected with vector, GFP-H-Ras, GFP-N-Ras, and GFP-N-Ras-hypervariable region were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were scraped, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and centrifuged for 10 min. The pellets were washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol at −20 °C, embedded in Lowicryl K4M at −20 °C, and polymerized with ultraviolet irradiation. Ultrathin sections were mounted on nickel grids and sequentially incubated with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 15 min, with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and finally with the monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (clones 7.1 and 13.1; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h (diluted 1:100 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m glycine). After washing, the sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to 10-nm gold particles (BioCell; diluted 1:50 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin). After immunogold labeling, the ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM208 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. As controls, ultrathin sections were treated as described above but omitting the primary antibody. To avoid misinterpretations, an initial requisite in this project was to verify that the Ras isoforms under study were expressed in those cell lines to be utilized. Using antibodies that specifically recognize H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, we ascertained that these proteins were detectable in lysates from COS-7, NIH3T3, and MDCK cells (Fig. 1 A), thereby validating these three cell lines for further experimentation. As a first approach to investigate the specificity of H-, K(4B)-, and N-Ras N17 mutants (referred to as H-N17, K-N17, and N-N17 hereafter), we compared the inhibitory potential that each of the Ras dominant interfering mutants displayed against a Ras-activating stimulus such as EGF (40Kamata T. Feramisco J.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As a readout, we utilized the activation of ERK2, whose activation by EGF in COS-7 cells has been previously shown to be potently inhibited by the original H-N17 (41Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). For this purpose, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-ERK2 and with increasing concentrations of the three inhibitory mutants. Upon stimulation with EGF it was found that H-, K-, and N-N17 were capable of diminishing EGF-induced activation of ERK2, although to different extents. At the maximum expression levels, H-N17 caused a total repression on ERK2 activation, K-N17 inhibited EGF-induced ERK2 activity by 88%, and N-N17 exhibited the least inhibitory effect, only reaching a 55% inhibition (Fig. 1 B). We also monitored the protein levels of the three N17 mutants using antibodies specific for H-, K-, and N-Ras, verifying that, in all three cases, the augmentation in their inhibitory effects correlated with an increase in their protein levels (Fig. 1 B, bottom panels). Because intrinsic variations in the affinity of the Ras isoform-specific antibodies precluded a comparison of the isoforms protein levels, we also utilized a pan-Ras antibody that recognizes equally the three Ras isoforms to ascertain that variations in the inhibitory potential of the N17 mutants were not due to differences in their expression. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the protein levels of the three N17 mutants, resulting from the transfection of 250 ng of their coding constructs, were similar. To make sure that the inhibitory effects of the Ras N17 mutants were not due to some unspecific, Ras-independent process, we co-transfected a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 (MEKE), known to act downstream from Ras (36Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), with H-N17, K-N17 and N-N17 mutants. It was found that the activation of ERK2 by MEKE was completely unaffected by the Ras inhibitory mutants (Fig. 1 D), thus verifying that the inhibitory effects of H-, K-, and N-Ras dominant interfering mutants were Ras-mediated. It is well known that the inhibitory effects of Ras N17 can be overcome by the increased expression of wild-type Ras (34Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 42Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the inhibition of EGF-induced activation of ERK2 by H-, K-, and N-Ras inhibitory mutants could be rescued by an overexpression of their respective wild-type proteins. As such, the cells were transfected with H-N17, K-N17, and N-N17 in addition to increasing concentrations of plasmids encoding for their wild-type homologues. It was found that even at their lowest concentration, a 2-fold excess, H-, K-, and N-Ras wild types remarkably rescued the restrain exerted by their respective N17 mutants on the activation of ERK2 induced by EGF (Fig. 2). These rescues were not due to a direct activation of ERK2 by the wild-type Ras proteins, because even at their highest levels of expression, wild-type H-, K-, and N-Ras activated ERK2 very poorly (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether the inhibitory effect exerted by a given Ras N17 mutant could be restored by the overexpression of any of the three wild-type Ras isoforms. For this purpose cells transfected with AU5-ERK2 were co-transfected with equal amounts of HA-tagged H-N17, K-N17, and N-N17 and of FLAG-tagged H-, K-, and N-Ras wild types. Then ERK2 activation was determined in anti-AU5 immunoprecipitates upon EGF stimulation. The rescue of the dominant negative constructs by overexpression of the wild-type proteins is likely to be a threshold effect. As such, small variations on the ratio of N17 and wild-type proteins may tip the balance between inhibition and activity. Therefore it was very important to control the relative levels of expression of the transfected wild types and inhibitory mutants in every case. Even though the different affinities exhibited by the FLAG and HA antibodies towards their respective epitopes precluded a precise comparison of the concentrations of each protein, the ratio between the HA and FLAG signals was extremely valuable to monitor changes in the expression of the wild-type and the inhibitory proteins relative to each other. Interestingly, the blockade on EGF-induced ERK2 activation brought about by H-N17 could only be effectively rescued by H-Ras, whereas K-Ras and N-Ras were solely capable of slight rescues of 12 and 16%, respectively (Fig 3 A). These differences on the rescue capabilities of each Ras isoform could not be attributed to major differences on their relative protein concentrations, because the HA/FLAG ratio was almost identical in all cases (Fig. 3A, lower panels). In a similar fashion, the inhibitory effect exerted by K-N17 could be entirely overcome by H-Ras, and K-Ras was capable of a restoration up to 79%, whereas N-Ras was completely ineffective for rescuing the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 3 B). Likewise, the inhibition caused by N-N17 was fully restored by N-Ras, and up to 78% was restored by H-Ras, but it was unaffected by the expression of K-Ras (Fig. 3 C). These results constituted the first evidence for differential behavior of H-, K-, and N-Ras N17 mutants on their inhibitory properties. We moved further to examine whether the membrane attachment signal could influence the ability of a Ras isoform to overcome the inhibitory effect of its respective N17 mutant. To do so, we generated an H-Ras in which cysteine 186 was deleted (H-ΔCAAX) and added a c-Src myristoylation signal to its N terminus (Myr-H-ΔCAAX), in addition to an AU5 tag to facilitate its detection. We thereby substituted a farnesylation/palmitoylation with a myristoylation/palmitoylation post-translational modification, both of which are effective membrane anchors (43Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A (left panel), although H-ΔCAAX upon loosing its farnesylation site was solubilized and appeared exclusively in the cellular soluble fraction, Myr-H-ΔCAAX was mainly localized in the particulate fraction. As such, Myr-H-ΔCAAX could induce a slight activation of ERK2, comparable with that elicited by H-Ras wild type. On the other hand, H-ΔCAAX was incapable of activating ERK2 to any extent (Fig. 4 A, right panel). When we tested the ability of these constructs to rescue the inhibition exerted by H-N17 on ERK2 activation by EGF, it was found that Myr-H-ΔCAAX was as competent as wild-type H-Ras for overcoming the blockade brought about by H-N17. On the other hand, H-ΔCAAX was completely ineffective (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, our results indicated that myristoylated Ras proteins were as efficient as farnesylated forms for overcoming the repressing effects of Ras dominant inhibitory mutants. In light of this result, we asked whether the substitution of the farnesyl by a myristoyl post-translational modification could render other Ras isoforms competent for rescuing the inhibitory effects of H-N17. To do so, we added a c-Src myristoylation signal to the N terminus of a farnesylation-deficient N-Ras in which cysteine 186 was substituted by serine (Myr N-C186S). It was found that although wild-type N-Ras was only capable of a minor rescue on the inhibitory effect exerted by H-N17 on EGF-induced ERK2 activation, Myr N-C186S, which slightly activated ERK2 per se (data not shown), could significantly overcome H-N17 inhibition, although not as effectively as Myr-H-ΔCAAX (Fig. 4 C). It was of the utmost importance to determine to what extent each of the Ras dominant inhibitory mutants could inhibit the activation of three Ras isoforms. For this purpose, we examined how AU5-tagged H-N17, K-N17, and N-N17 interfered with the GDP/GTP exchange induced by EGF on HA-tagged H-, K-, and N-Ras, when transfected in COS-7 cells. These analyses were performed by the GTP-Ras pull-down assay, using Raf Ras-binding domain fused to GST (44Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it was found that the nucleotide exchange induced by EGF on K-Ras was completely blocked by H-N17 and K-N17 but was unaffected by N-N17 (Fig. 5 A), even though N-N17 was expressed at levels comparable with those of H-N17 and K-N17, and the wild type and N17 relative concentrations, assessed by the HA/AU5 signals ratio, were similar in all instances (Fig. 5 A,lower panels). On the other hand, the activation of H-Ras was potently suppressed by H-N17, whereas K-N17 caused a 22% inhibition, and N-N17 reduced its nuc"

It is thought that the high calcium buffering capacity of neurons necessitates that the sensor for calcium-triggered exocytosis be situated close to the source of calcium entry, i.e. near the inner mouth of presynaptic calcium channels (1Neher E.

Accordingly, a region within the cytoplasmic linker connecting domains II–III of mammalian N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, termed the synaptic protein interaction (synprint) site, was shown to bind tightly to a number of different proteins of the presynaptic vesicle release complex, including syntaxin1A, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (4Sheng Z.H.

In mammalian neurons, the requirement for a physical complex between presynaptic calcium channels and the SNARE1 complex is supported by the observation that injection of peptides corresponding to thesynprint site blocks synaptic transmission, presumably through a competitive decoupling of the SNARE protein-calcium channel complex (2Rettig J. Heinemann C. Ashery U. Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6647-6656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A.

A. 1998; 95: 14523-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The physiology of invertebrate synapses appears to correlate closely with their mammalian counterparts. With few notable exceptions, most vertebrate proteins involved in synaptic transmission have structurally conserved orthologs in invertebrates (9Lloyd T.E. Verstreken P. Ostrin E.J. Phillippi A. Lichtarge O. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 45-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, none of the invertebrate calcium channels identified fromDrosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans (10Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) appear to carry a structural motif that would resemble synprint, indicating that a correlate role of synprint does not exist in invertebrates. However, this postulate has not yet been tested directly because invertebrate models that are suitable for genetic analysis of synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (such as C. elegans and Drosophila) are not amenable to direct physiological analysis at the level of single pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Conversely, most invertebrate model systems that are amenable for physiological analysis, until recently, lacked molecular information that is required to interpret the physiological data. To determine how transmitter release in invertebrates occurs in the absence of calcium channels with a synprint motif, we have taken advantage of identified Lymnaea neurons, which are directly accessible to both physiological and molecular analysis at the level of single pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We have identified the sequences of the major calcium channel subunits and key synaptic elements, including SNARE proteins that are expressed in the presynaptic neuron. We provide evidence that synaptic transmission is dependent on a Lymnaea homolog of mammalian presynaptic calcium channels that does not associate with the SNARE complex. Yet, despite the lack of a synprint region in theLymnaea channel isoform, the injection of mammaliansynprint peptide into Lymnaea synapses still inhibits synaptic transmission. Thus, we challenge the current thinking of an unequivocal role of synprint in the molecular assembly of synaptic proteins with calcium channels at the active synaptic zone. Instead, we show that synaptic transmission in Lymnaea is critically dependent on the expression of an alternatively spliced C-terminal region of the presynaptic channel homolog that physically and functionally interacts with the scaffolding proteins Mint1 and CASK. Our data suggest that these proteins might be involved in anchoring presynaptic calcium channels at the active zones, thus optimizing calcium entry for transmitter release. Parts of novel Lymnaea cDNAs were identified by PCR cloning using degenerate primers (see Table I), designed from regions with high sequence identity in aligned protein orthologs described in the GenBankTM data base (NCBI, Bethesda) using cDNA that was synthesized from brain ganglia RNA of adult Lymnaea stagnalis.Table IMolecular cloning, identification, and primer pair sets for Lymnaea genesLymnaea gene nameLymnaea GenBank™ gi:Size of cDNAClosest human protein gi:Vs. human % similarity/% identityDegenerate primer pairs for PCR cloning of Lymnaea orthologsPrimer pairs for real time quantitative PCR detectionbpLCav1aAF4840797391450252762.255.2ATYACMTTYCARGARCARGGNGACCRAAWACYTGCATNCCDATC terminus, GCATGTGGTTAGCACCTGAGACAGCAATCCCAACAATTATTTCALCav1bAF48408070974502527ATIACIATGGARGGITGGACCCCICCRAAIARYTGCATC terminus, GCCAAGAGGTGAGCCAAAGTGACCAGTGCCTGATGCTGLCav1cAF48408117014502527LCav2aAF48408282391338650062.054.7ATIACIATGGARGGITGGACCCICCRAAIARYTGCATC terminus, GCCATACAGCGTTGCAAGAGTTCAACACCAGTCATCGTCATCTLCav2bAF484083560313386500ATSGGNATGCARGTNTTYGGTCCTGCCARGCYTCNCCNGTNGCC terminus, GATGCCGCCCAGTGATGTCATTCGAGTCACTCTAACAGCAGAI–I linker, TGGGATCGTTCTTCATGCTAAATCTGCGGTTTTCTACCCTTTCTII–III linker, TTTGCCGCTCAAGGGAGACCGGTGATGGAGGACAAATGTTLCav3AF48408483501-aEstimate based on expected size.2136107755.347.0GTBGTBGARAAYTTYCAYAARTGGYRTCYTTCATDATNCCRTTCCACCCAGTTGTGCCATCATTACCAGGTGAGGTCTGGACAATGGALCav4AF484085AF48408662501-aEstimate based on expected size.380083065.355.8GTSTTYHTSGGNTGYATGATHGGTGCATDATNTYRTTCCARTCYTCNCCTGTTTGATTCCATCCTTCACTACAGCACCTTGTTCCTTCCACCATAAGLCavβ1AF48408719501992311969.461.8GTSACMGAYATGATGCARAARATGCRTCYTCWARYTGRKTYTCRTCCACCATGACGATGACTACGACAGTTCGGAGAAGTGTGGCTGTGALstx1AAF4840881278250108480.273.3AARGARGARYTNGARGARYTNATGCATNGCCATRTCCATRAACATRTCAAAACGACAATTGGCCATAACTG TGATTATCCCTTGAGTGAAGATTGCLSNAP25AF48408918111876573364.450.7ATGYTSGACGANCARGGNGARCACATYTCGTCYTCNCKNGCRTCRTTACGTTCGTGTGGATGAAGCA ATCTTCATGGCCCGATCACTLsyt1AF4840901933503213970.862.5AARAAYYTNAARAARATGGAYGTARNGTRTGCCAYTGNGCDATNGGGCGTTCTCGGCTGCAACT CTGTAGTGTGTGCCACTGTGCTATLsyb1AF484091784925725172.462.9TTYAARGTSAARACNACNGCNCCACATSKRCTGNACCATRAAYTTRTGGCTGGTGCATCACAGTTTGAA TGCCAATGATAGCTCCCAAGALnSec1AF4840922099450729773.866.3AARYTSGAYGCNTAYAARGCNGAYGAYTTRTYYTTRTGCCARTGNCCRTAGGTGTGACCTACTCTGAAATGAGATG AATGTGGGTCGCACCTATGAGLVAchTAF4840932327450699160.251.0GAYAAYATGYTNTAYATGGTNATHGTGTRTCDATSARDGCDATNCCRAARCACGAACTGTGAGATTGGTTTGATG TCACCCTCTGTTGTTTCCATAACTTLVMATAF4840942100450698966.157.6ATGGGNATYGCHYTSGGNGGNYTNGCCARAANGCNRCRTCNGCDATNGCRTACACCAGCGAAGGAAGAGAAAAT GGGCTCTTGTCATTCTGATTGTATGLMINT1AF48409545522203555048.440.0AARYTSAAYATHGGNGAYCARATGGCATNGTYTTCATRTGDATYTCTTGTCACCCTATTGGCCAGTT TGGAACATCCTGACCAGTTAGAAGLCASK1AF4840963001450256775.867.9ATHATGCAYGGNGGNATGATHCACYTGCCACCARTKRTGRTCRTCYTTTTTTTATTGCAGCACCCACACT GTAGGCCTTTTCCAGCAGCTTl-Aldolase173032614501-aEstimate based on expected size.455730584.777.6TGGCGGTCAATCTGAAGAAGA GAGCTCGGCCATATGAGAATGTl-β-Tubulin 96251709450772995.593.7AGGCGGAATCCAACATGAAC CCCCTCAGCTTCTTCCTCATC1-a Estimate based on expected size. Open table in a new tab cDNA clones were isolated by screening of λZAP cDNA libraries of the Lymnaea central nervous system. Full-length cDNA clones were generated, using primer walking and 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. PCR fragments were amplified with DNA polymerases, Herculase, or TurboPfu (Stratagene), and final sequences were assembled from at least three independent PCRs. All sequencing was completed in both sense and antisense directions using ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Conceptual translations were derived from the longest open reading frame. When the protein translation initiation site was uncertain, start sites were inferred from closely related orthologs described in GenBankTM. Lymnaea orthologs and results of comparison of sequence of putative Lymnaea proteins with human orthologs are shown in Table I. BLASTP retrieved orthologs (GenBankTM) of Lymnaea proteins were aligned by modified progressive pairwise, multiple alignment in PILEUP (UNIX-based, GCG Wisconsin Package 2002, Accelrys, Madison, WI) and were visually displayed (PLOTSIMILARITY, Accelrys). Primer pairs for qPCR detection of Lymnaeagene transcripts were designed with Primer Express 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Each candidate primer pair generated an amplicon of the expected size of 85–120 bp, and PCR efficiencies were tested onLymnaea central nervous system cDNA using serial dilutions of template. Primer dimers were identified by measurable product in the absence of qPCR template. All qPCR primer pairs (see Table I) averaged an amplification efficiency of ∼1.9–2.0. cDNA templates for the qPCR were prepared from single, identified neurons with axons attached by gentle mechanical suction with pulling pipette from each of six Lymnaea brain ganglia preparations. cDNA were synthesized as follows: 1) directly from freshly isolated neurons; 2) as unpaired pre- and postsynaptic neurons after 18 h of primary culture on hemolymph-coated coverslips; or 3) as synaptically paired neurons cultured for 18 h (see primary cell culture technique described below for more details). The freshly isolated and cultured cells were transferred as a collective into a prepared microcentrifuge tube in a minimal volume of culture medium (<3 μl) for immediate total RNA isolation and first strand synthesis, using a protocol as described by Van Kesterenet al. (14van Kesteren R.E. Syed N.I. Munno D.W. Bouwman J. Feng Z.P. Geraerts W.P. Smit A.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For qPCR, primer pairs at 2 pmol each were used in a final PCR volume of 20 μl, using a master-mix of SYBR Green PCR core reagents. The threshold line for determining the value of the cycle of threshold, Ct, was set on 0.3 ΔRn(base-line subtracted values) with curves reaching maximally 6–8 ΔRn and base lines of ∼0.02 ΔRn. Data were considered only if the ΔCT values of control and experimental samples were >8 cycles. The overall cDNA expression levels per sample were normalized to the expression of controlsl-aldolase and to l-β-tubulin which both show consistent expression for each cell type, and corresponded proportionally to the different cell diameters. Bacterial fusion proteins used in binding assays were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified DNA in-frame into pTRCHis or pRSET (Invitrogen) or pGEX (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins for studying yeast two-hybrid interactions were prepared in-frame with bait LexA DNA binding domain of pHybLex and prey B42 activation domain of pYESTrp2. The following fusion protein constructs for expression were prepared (name, protein residue numbers, vector) as follows: rat Cav2.2 synprint: 718–963, pTRCHisC; rat stx1A: 1–268, pGEX-KG;LCa v 2a N terminus: 1–67,pYESTrp2; LCa v 2a I–II linker: 346–509, pYESTrp2, LCa v 2bII–III linker: 714–888, pRSETA.

Detailed methods for the bacterial expression, purification, andin vitro binding assay of the fusion proteins have been described previously (11Jarvis S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E.

Sci. 2001; 22: 519-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All fusion protein constructs were verified by sequencing and evaluated for measurable expressibility on a size-selected SDS-PAGE gel, using Coomassie Blue protein stain. Preparation of protein extracts of Lymnaea brain ganglia and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (11Jarvis S.E. Magga J.M. Beedle A.M. Braun J.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Lymnaea syntaxin1A was detected by commercial antibody (ANR-002, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). For analysis of two-hybrid interactions, yeast bait and prey fusion vectors were transformed into L40 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, and the binding affinity of the interactions was measured by β-galactosidase activity using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside substrate, qualitatively by filter lift according to manufacturer's instructions (Hybrid Hunter, Invitrogen) and quantitatively in liquid extracts. Identified neurons of L. stagnalis were isolated and cultured in either a soma-soma configuration or neurite-neurite configuration as described previously (13Feng Z.P. Klumperman J. Lukowiak K. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In knockdown experiments, identified neurons were initially plated on hemolymph-pretreated glass coverslips (to prevent neuronal adhesion) in conditioned medium bathed in 10 μmantisense/mismatch DNA oligonucleotide probes (14van Kesteren R.E. Syed N.I. Munno D.W. Bouwman J. Feng Z.P. Geraerts W.P. Smit A.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 10 μg of dsRNA (for RNA interference) for 3 days. The oligonucleotide or dsRNA-treated neurons were then transferred and paired on poly-l-lysine-pretreated glass coverslips in the presence of CM. In some knockdown experiments, RNAi-treated neurons were tested for non-synaptic release using a “sniffer cell” (15Spencer G.E. Lukowiak K. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8077-8086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Transmitter release was detected from a dopamine-releasing cell, RPeD1, using one of its postsynaptic neurons, VK, which displays a depolarizing response to dopamine. 15-mer double-stranded DNA antisense calcium channel probes were designed across the start site ofLCa v 2: GAACGTGGCCATCCA (95–109), a sequence shared in all Lymnaea isoforms identified. Mismatch probes for LCa v 2 consisted of three base changes to the antisense sequence GAAGGTGCCCAACCA. Before treatment to neurons, antisense/mismatch probes were reconstituted inLymnaea saline, passed through a 0.8-μm filter, boiled for 2 min, and cooled on ice. For RNA interference technique, dsRNA probes were synthesized by the transcription in both sense and antisense strands (MEGASCRIPT; Ambion, Austin, TX) using T7 and T3 promoters in Bluescript II KS+vector between base pairs 2237 and 2710 (II–IIII loopLCa v 2a), 2237–2761 (II–III loopLCav2b), 6083–6520 (C-terminalLCa v 2a), and 1893–2750 (LCASK). RNA probes were resuspended in Lymnaeasaline, boiled for 2 min, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min, and then allowed to cool to room temperature, enabling single complementary RNA strands to anneal properly. RNA samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Synaptic transmission was monitored by simultaneous intracellular recordings of pre- and postsynaptic neurons using hardware and acquisition/analysis software as described previously (13Feng Z.P. Klumperman J. Lukowiak K. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium channel activities of VD4 neurons were measured using established whole-cell recording technique (16Feng Z.P. Grigoriev N. Munno D. Lukowiak K. MacVicar B.A. Goldberg J.I. Syed N.I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 53-65Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Lymnaea soma-soma synapse is a rapidly emerging model for investigating synaptic function. Until recently, the full potential of this system had not been realized due to lack of genomic information. We have thus used degenerate PCR cloning and screening of Lymnaea cDNA libraries of whole brain ganglia to identify orthologs of presynaptic vesicle release proteins and of the pore-forming α1 subunits of the structural superfamily of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Lymnaea calcium channel orthologs include representatives of the major high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channel classes, L-type (LCa v 1) and non-L-type (LCa v 2), and (LVA) T-type (LCa v 3) channels, as well as a calcium channel β subunit (LCa v b). In addition, we identified a representative of the functionally unidentified class, dubbed U-type (17Lee J.H. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E.

These subunits (four α1 and one β) are reminiscent of the representation in Drosophila andC. elegans genomes (10Littleton J.T. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 2000; 26: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and likely provide a complete complement of such genes in the Lymnaea nervous system. LCa v 2 is a structural homolog of both mammalian N- (Cav2.2) and P/Q-type (Cav2.1) calcium channels considered responsible for transmitter release at mammalian synapses (18Takahashi T. Momiyama A. Nature. 1993; 366: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 19Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and of invertebrate gene relatives inDrosophila (DmCa1A/cac) and C. elegans (unc-2) (20Kawasaki F. Felling R. Ordway R.W. J.

From an alignment of various Cav2 homologs (Fig. 1, C andD), a high degree of sequence conservation is seen in the β subunit interaction site in the domain I–II linker (AID sequence) (23Pragnell M., De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and in the major transmembrane domains, but no apparent sequence identity is evident in the domain II–III linker, the locus of the synaptic protein interaction (synprint) site in vertebrate channels (Fig. 1, C and D). Indeed, the II–III linker region in LCa v 2appears considerably shorter than that of vertebrate Cav2 channels, and repeated attempts to identify anLCa v 2 channel with a longer,synprint-containing II–III linker in LymnaeacDNA were unsuccessful. In trying to do so, however, we isolated an additional LCa v 2 isoform (LCa v 2b) that varied by 17 amino acids in the II–III linker (see Fig. 1). The apparent lack of thesynprint motif in Lymnaea and other invertebrates contrasts with the high sequence homology among presynaptic vesicle release proteins such as syntaxin1A, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (see Table I). Taken together, these observations indicate that although SNARE proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution, the appearance of a synprint motif may be an evolutionary specialization in vertebrates. To demonstrate the expression of the identified calcium channel genes, we examined mRNA transcripts in single identified pre- and postsynaptic neurons that are major players in our established soma-soma and neurite-neurite synapse models (13Feng Z.P. Klumperman J. Lukowiak K. Syed N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S.

To ensure unequivocal identification of the cell type, we first acquired an expression profile of cell type-specific markers in three identified neurons as follows: visceral dorsal 4 (VD4), left pedal dorsal 1 (LPeD1), and right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1) which form a critical component of a central respiratory rhythm-generating network. Cells were individually isolated from the intact ganglia and subjected to quantitative, real time PCR (qPCR) analysis. For cholinergic/peptidergic presynaptic VD4 neurons, we detected characteristically high LVAchT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter) and LFMRFamide heptapeptide gene expression levels (Fig. 2). In contrast, the postsynaptic serotonergic neuron (LPeD1) and giant dopamine cell (RPeD1) typically display the higher expression levels ofLVMAT, the vesicular transporter for monoamines (Fig. 2,inset). We then performed real time qPCR in the presynaptic VD4 neuron, using specific primers for the three major types of voltage-gated calcium channels. As seen in Fig. 2, all types of calcium channel α1 subunits, as well as the β subunit were present in measurable abundance in VD4, including the two C-terminal splice variants of both the LCa v 1 andLCa v 2 channels (Fig. 2). In addition, expression of a number of key synaptic proteins such as VAMP, syntaxin1A, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin1, and nsec1/munc18–1 was also detected (not shown, but see Fig. 7 D). Hence,Lymnaea VD4 neurons robustly express many of the proteins thought to be involved in mammalian synaptic transmission.Figure 7Mint1 and CASK regulate Lymnaeaneurotransmission. A, yeast two-hybrid assay illustrating the binding of Mint1 and CASK to the alternatively spliced C-terminal region of LCa v 2. Both Mint1 and CASK bind to this region but to separate domains with Mint1 interacting with the extreme C-terminal tail (CT2 region), and CASK binding to an upstream proline-rich region (CT3 region). Site-directed mutagenesis of the tail of the CT2 peptide from DDWC to DDKC abolishes the Mint interaction. Data are expressed in form of β-galactosidase activity determined from liquid extracts. The top of the figure depicts a graphic representation of theLCa v 2 channel C-terminal region with the location of CT peptides illustrated above. B, sample traces showing that RNAi depletion of VD4 neurons of CASK greatly reduced neurotransmission. In 4 of 7 cells, no EPSPs could be detected, whereas in the remaining cells they were greatly reduced. C, effect of injection of CASK interacting CT3 peptides and of wild type and DDKC mutant LCa v 2 CT2 peptides into VD4 neurons on synaptic transmission. Note that the wild type CT2 peptide disrupted neurotransmitter release, whereas the mutant CT2 peptide and the CT3 peptide did not. D, qPCR analysis of gene expression of cultured VD4 and LPeD1 neurons, comparing those cultured overnight as VD4/LPeD1 synaptic pairs or unpaired. Whereas the expression of synaptic proteins such as syntaxin1A (Lstx1A) and synaptotagmin1 (Lsyt1) or calcium channels is not regulated during synapse formation, the expression ofLMint1 is dramatically increased in paired cells.Inset, gene expression levels ofLsyt1 and LMint1 in unpaired neurons and synaptic pairs. Data are represented as the cycle threshold of detection (CT), normalized to the expression ofl -aldolase. Note the virtual absence ofLMint1 in unpaired neurons. Also note that these experiments differ from those shown in Fig. 2, where only freshly isolated neurons of a single identified type were used for analysis under each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To minimize the possibility that an unidentifiedLCa v 2 domain II–III linker splice isoform with a synprint-like motif could exist inLymnaea neurons, we examined the relative abundance of theLCa v 2 II–III linkers relative to the domain I–II linker region of LCa v 2 which is highly conserved (23Pragnell M., De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and, thus, a measure of the overall levels ofLCa v 2 transcript. As seen in Fig. 2, when we used primers that specifically detected common sequences in bothLCa v 2a andLCa v 2b but did not produce any gel bands of longer sizes (not shown), we found that the expression of the short II–III linker was strikingly similar to that of the I–II linker. These data suggest that the identified short II–III linkers ofLCa v 2a andLCa v 2b predominate in VD4, and if an isoform of LCa v 2 with an identifiablesynprint-containing domain II–III loop were to exist, it can only be of low and almost immeasurable abundance. To assess the role ofLCa v 2 channels in neurotransmitter release, the presynaptic cell VD4 was pre-treated with antisense and subsequently paired with its postsynaptic partner LPeD1. Specifically, antisense (15-mer) probes were designed at the start site ofLCa v 2 channels, and presynaptic VD4 neurons were pre-incubated at a concentration of 10 μmfor 3 days before synaptic pairing with postsynaptic LPeD1 neuron. Synapses were subsequently tested with simultaneous intracellular recordings. Unlike control conditions, or in cells injected with mismatch antisense probes (Fig. 3 A, n = 12), excitatory synaptic transmission was perturbed between the soma-soma paired cells (Fig. 3 A, n = 9) in which VD4 cells were selectively treated with antisense-LCa v 2 prior to pairing with LPeD1. Under these experimental conditions, the postsynaptic LPeD1 cells, however, continued to exhibit an excitatory response to exogenously applied ACh, suggesting that the antisense treatment did not affect the postsynaptic cell (Fig. 3 A). Pre-treatment of VD4 with LCa v 1-antisense had only a minor effect on synaptic transmission that appeared as a fatiguing of the postsynaptic response over time (not shown). To complement the antisense experiments, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) techniques to degrade catalytically mRNA in VD4 prior to its pairing with LPeD1. Double-stranded RNA probes were designed against the short II–III linkers found in bothLCa v 2a andLCa v 2b. VD4 was incubated for 3 days prior to soma-soma pairing in 8–10 μg of these RNAi probes. To test for the effectiveness of the RNAi knockdown, total HVA barium currents were measured in whole-cell patch configuration (Fig. 3 B). RNA interference of LCa v 2 resulted in a dramatic depression of HVA currents, leaving only a residual current with noticeably different inactivation kinetics, which may be due toLCa v 1, the other HVA channel type identified in VD4. Synaptic transmission was completely abolished with selective RNAi knockdown of the gene containing the identified short II–III linker (Fig. 3 C, n = 7). As RNAi knockdown was targeted specifically to thisLCa v 2 sequence, the absence of a postsynaptic response indicates that neurotransmission relies exclusively on a calcium channel homolog that lacks asynprin"

Immunity. 2000; 13: 287-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, cytokines exert their actions concomitantly in stressful situations including inflammation, ER stress, and viral infections (16Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y.

Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Therefore, the response of SOCS proteins to cellular stress remains to be investigated.When cells are under physiological and environmental stress, such as nutrient deprivation, disturbance of intracellular stores of Ca2+, or virus infection, the accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins occurs, which induces a stress response, a process called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR induces a rapid repression of protein synthesis to reduce unfolded protein levels or to interfere with viral replication (16Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 17Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). This repression of protein synthesis occurs mainly through the phosphorylation of eIF2α on serine 51, which interferes with the formation of an active 40 S translation-initiation complex. Reduction of 40 S initiation complexes results in suppression of translation initiation of most mRNAs and reduces protein synthesis of many proteins (18Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 19Clemens M.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 27: 57-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, not all of the proteins are translationally repressed by eIF2α phosphorylation. For example, in mammalian cells expression of transcription factor ATF4 is induced by eIF2α phosphorylation (20Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar).

The UPR also activates transcription factors ATF6 and XBP1, which induce the ER stress-response genes, chaperones, and folding catalysts as well as the proapoptotic gene, CHOP/GADD153 (22Lee K.

This N-terminal truncated product of SOCS3, herein referred as ΔN-SOCS3, lacks the major ubiquitination site lysine 6 of the full-length protein, and therefore, it is resistant to 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation. We also provide evidence that ΔN-SOCS3 is induced by conditions that enhance eIF2α phosphorylation such as ER stress or activation of the protein kinase PKR. Furthermore, ΔN-SOCS3 appears to be more biologically active than the full-length protein in suppressing cytokine signaling. Our data provide strong evidence for a regulation of SOCS3 expression and function at the translational level.

We utilized primary neuronal cultures in which cell bodies and distal axons reside in separate compartments to investigate the requirement of NPC1 protein for transport of cholesterol from cell bodies to distal axons. We have recently observed that in NPC1-deficient neurons compared with wild-type neurons, cholesterol accumulates in cell bodies but is reduced in distal axons (Karten, B., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B., and Vance, J. E. (2002) J. Neurochem. 83, 1154–1163). We now show that NPC1 protein is expressed in both cell bodies and distal axons. In NPC1-deficient neurons, cholesterol delivered to cell bodies from low density lipoproteins (LDLs), high density lipoproteins, or cyclodextrin complexes was transported into axons in normal amounts, whereas transport of endogenously synthesized cholesterol was impaired. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with pravastatin in wild-type and NPC1-deficient neurons reduced axonal growth. However, LDLs restored a normal rate of growth to wild-type but not NPC1-deficient neurons treated with pravastatin. Thus, although LDL cholesterol is transported into axons of NPC1-deficient neurons, this source of cholesterol does not sustain normal axonal growth. Over the lifespan of NPC1-deficient neurons, these defects in cholesterol transport might be responsible for the observed altered distribution of cholesterol between cell bodies and axons and, consequently, might contribute to the neurological dysfunction in NPC disease.

In addition, homeostatic responses to exogenously supplied cholesterol, for example down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression, and activation of cholesterol esterification, are blunted (11Roff C.F.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). More recent evidence suggests that the intracellular trafficking of all cholesterol that transits the plasma membrane is affected in cells lacking functional NPC1 (14Cruz J.C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Lange Y., Ye, J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NPC1 is therefore thought to play a role in transporting cholesterol out of lysosomes/late endosomes. The conclusion that NPC1 plays a key role in cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis is consistent with the observation that the protein contains a sequence that is homologous to a putative sterol-sensing domain identified in two other proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis, namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and SCAP (sterol response element-binding proteincleavage-activating protein) (16Olender E.H. Simon R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently, NPC1 has also been shown to contain regions of homology to the RND family of prokaryotic permeases and has been proposed to mediate fatty acid transport (18Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Science. 2000; 290: 2295-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).The intracellular itinerary of endocytosed LDL cholesterol involves passage into late endosomes where cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed, and the released unesterified cholesterol is subsequently distributed to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane (19Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar,20Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The internalization of LDLs and the ensuing hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters are normal in NPC1-deficient cells (12Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17002-17008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon exit from sorting late endosomes, cholesterol appears to travel initially to the plasma membrane and subsequently to NPC1-containing late endosomes. In the absence of NPC1, cholesterol accumulates in multivesicular/multilamellar vesicles (9Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).Vesicular trafficking of endocytosed material has been investigated extensively in nonpolarized cells such as fibroblasts (reviewed in Refs. 21Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar and 22Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons, as in other polarized cells, an additional targeting step is required for delivery of protein cargo specifically to axonal or dendritic membranes (corresponding to apical or basolateral domains, respectively, of other polarized cells). Generally, this targeting is mediated by the trans-Golgi network (reviewed in Ref. 23Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The transport of lipids has received less attention. Several studies indicate that membrane lipids are inserted into axonal membranes in the vicinity of their final destination (24Zakharenko S. Popov S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Zakharenko S. Popov S. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that lateral diffusion of lipids within the axonal membrane is too slow to provide sufficient membrane materials for axonal growth (26Khanin R. Segel L. Futerman A.H. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 193: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Unlike the major membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, which is synthesized in both cell bodies and distal axons of sympathetic neurons (27Vance J.E., De Chaves E.P. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), cholesterol is synthesized only in cell bodies and must be transported into axons for assembly into their plasma membranes (28Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Newly made cholesterol is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane by a rapid, energy-dependent mechanism that bypasses the Golgi apparatus (30Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31DeGrella R.F. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured sympathetic neurons do not require exogenously supplied cholesterol for growth but can obtain all the cholesterol they need from endogenous synthesis (32de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Similarly, cholesterol in the brain is derived mainly from endogenous synthesis (33Turley S.D. Burns D.K. Rosenfeld C.R. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1953-1961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Turley S.D. Burns D.K. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E1099-E1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Edmond J. Korsak R.A. Morrow J.W. Torok-Both G. Catlin D.H. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, Mahley (36Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar) has proposed that after peripheral nerve injury, cholesterol is salvaged from degenerating neurons and myelin and reutilized for axonal regeneration in a process involving endocytosis of apoE-containing lipoproteins secreted by endoneurial macrophages (37Goodrum J.F. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1709-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In NPC1-deficient mice, this pathway appears to be defective (38Goodrum J.F. Pentchev P.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, cholesterol is thought to be recycled by a similar process during axon remodeling. Although most plasma lipoproteins do not cross the blood-brain barrier, cerebrospinal fluid contains lipoprotein particles (reviewed in Refs. 39Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M.

Neurol. 1993; 334: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, several LDL receptor family members are expressed in the central nervous system (reviewed in Ref. 45Herz J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have studied the metabolism and transport of cholesterol in compartmented cultures of sympathetic neurons (46Campenot B. Lund K. Senger D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) from wild-type and NPC1-deficient mice. We show that NPC1 is expressed in both cell bodies and distal axons and that the amount of LDL-derived cholesterol that reaches distal axons is the same in wild-type and NPC1-deficient neurons. However, the transport of endogenously made cholesterol is impaired. Moreover, LDL-derived cholesterol does not support axonal growth of NPC1-deficient neurons when endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis is inhibited.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the anterograde transport of cholesterol in sympathetic neurons from a murine model of NPC disease. Although neurons of the central nervous system are primarily affected in this disease, we selected sympathetic neurons as our model system because these neurons can be grown in compartmented cultures that are amenable to studying transport of lipids and proteins between cell bodies and axons, as well as axonal growth (46Campenot B. Lund K. Senger D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 56Campenot R.B. Stevenson R.B. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 275-298Google Scholar). The major findings are: (i) distal axons of wild-type sympathetic neurons contain NPC1 protein as well as the lysosomal protein, LAMP1; (ii) the amount of LDL-derived cholesterol transported from cell bodies to distal axons is normal innpc −/− neurons, whereas the transport of endogenously synthesized cholesterol is modestly impaired; (iii) despite the apparently normal anterograde transport of LDL cholesterol, this source of cholesterol is not available for growth ofnpc −/− neurons; and (iv) neither U18666A nor progesterone phenocopies NPC1 deficiency in neurons.Transport of Cholesterol from Cell Bodies to Distal AxonsWe compared the transport of cholesterol from cell bodies to distal axons in neurons of the three npc genotypes using cholesterol synthesized endogenously from [14C]acetate, as well as cholesterol derived from exogenously added [3H]cholesteryl ester-labeled lipoproteins and [3H]cholesterol complexed to cyclodextrin. The anterograde transport of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and MβCD-complexed cholesterol into distal axons was not significantly different among npc +/+,npc +/−, and npc −/−sympathetic neurons. However, we observed a small (∼18%) but statistically significant decrease in the transport of endogenously synthesized cholesterol into distal axons ofnpc −/− neurons. The apparently normal anterograde transport of LDL-derived cholesterol innpc −/− neurons was unexpected because lysosomes and late endosomes (the sites of accumulation of LDL cholesterol in npc −/− fibroblasts) are commonly thought to be restricted to neuronal cell bodies (68Parton R.G. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).These data raise the question of how LDL-derived cholesterol that has been added to cell bodies reaches distal axons without functional NPC1. Two alternative pathways might mediate this anterograde transport. One possibility is that LDL-derived cholesterol is transported into axons without entering late endosomes. This, however, seems unlikely because LDL cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed at a normal rate innpc −/− neuronal cell bodies, and no LDL-derived cholesteryl esters are found in distal axons of eithernpc genotype. In addition, in sympathetic neurons from LDL receptor null mice hydrolysis and anterograde transport of LDL-derived cholesteryl esters were reduced by 86% compared with wild-type neurons. Thus, the majority of LDL-derived cholesterol taken up by cell bodies is processed via the endocytic pathway. We therefore hypothesize that innpc −/− neurons LDL-derived cholesteryl esters reach late endosomes (that would normally contain NPC1) in cell bodies and that these endosomes are delivered to axons independent of NPC1. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that NPC1 and LAMPI are present in distal axons.Cruz et al. have proposed a model for cholesterol trafficking in Chinese hamster ovary cells in which endocytosed LDL-derived cholesterol arrives rapidly at the plasma membrane, regardless of the presence of NPC1, and is subsequently internalized into NPC1-containing sorting endosomes (69Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A lack of NPC1 was proposed to delay the export of cholesterol from this sorting compartment (69Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Such an itinerary for LDL cholesterol would seemingly be consistent with our observation that normal amounts of LDL cholesterol are transported into distal axons ofnpc −/− neurons. However, the initial delivery of cholesterol to the plasma membrane, according to the model of Cruzet al., would occur in a rapid step that would not have been specifically monitored by the long term transport assay we used. In NPC1-deficient fibroblasts, late endosomes have been proposed to fuse with lysosomes and be transformed into multilamellar hybrid vesicles (9Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that innpc −/− neurons, similar cholesterol-laden late endosomes are formed in cell bodies and move into axons. However, egress of cholesterol from these endosomes might be impaired, which would result in an inability of LDL-derived cholesterol to reach the location required for supporting growth. Hollenbeck and co-workers have indicated that at least part of the endosomal pathway is present in axons (70Overly C.C. Lee K.D. Berthiaume E. Hollenbeck P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3156-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 71Overly C.C. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although others have concluded that lysosomes and late endosomes, as well as their associated degradative enzymes, are restricted to neuronal cell bodies (62Parton R.G. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 68Parton R.G. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is possible that the movement of at least a subset of NPC1-containing late endosomes into axons is a normal mechanism for delivery of cholesterol, in accordance with our observation that NPC1 and LAMP1 are present in axons.Supply of Cholesterol for Axonal GrowthOur laboratory has previously demonstrated that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in rat sympathetic neurons inhibits axonal growth and that delivery of cholesterol from LDLs restores normal growth (32de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 72de Chaves E.P. Bussiere M. MacInnis B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36207-36214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings we now show that axonal growth of neurons of the three npc genotypes is also reduced when cholesterol biosynthesis is inhibited in the absence of an exogenous source of cholesterol. We were thus able to establish whether or not exogenously added cholesterol could be used for axonal growth ofnpc −/− neurons. We found that LDLs restored a normal rate of axonal extension to pravastatin-treatednpc +/+ and npc +/−neurons but not npc −/− neurons. Therefore, although a normal amount of LDL cholesterol arrives in distal axons from cell bodies of npc −/− neurons, this source of cholesterol cannot be used for axonal extension. In line with these observations, Goodrum and Pentchev (38Goodrum J.F. Pentchev P.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that peripheral nerve regeneration, which is thought to involve the endocytic uptake of lipoproteins, is impaired innpc −/− mice.Comparison of Phenotypes Induced by NPC1 Deficiency, Progesterone, and U18666A in Sympathetic NeuronsOur experiments demonstrate that U18666A, progesterone, and NPC1 deficiency produce overlapping, as well as distinct, modifications of cholesterol metabolism and transport in neurons. As in fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 63Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,64Butler J.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these drugs induce an accumulation of cholesterol-filled vesicles in the cytoplasm of neurons, similar to the situation in NPC1 deficiency (49Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, neither U18666A nor progesterone mimicks the growth and transport defects occurring innpc −/− neurons (summarized in Table I). For example, U18666A, but not NPC1 deficiency or progesterone, strongly inhibits the anterograde transport of cholesterol derived from lipoproteins. In addition, U18666A inhibits axonal growth, whereas progesterone and NPC1 deficiency do not. Moreover, U18666A, but not progesterone or NPC1 deficiency, inhibits cholesterol synthesis to an extent similar to pravastatin.We speculate that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by U18666A might, at least partially, be responsible for the defect in cholesterol transport (Fig. 4) and axonal growth (Fig. 6) induced by U18666A (65Sexton R.C. Panini S.R. Azran F. Rudney H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5687-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A recent study by Fan et al. (73Fan Q.W., Yu, W. Gong J.S. Zou K. Sawamura N. Senda T. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J.

These observations might explain why inhibition of cholesterol synthesis impairs cholesterol transport in neurons. However, the mechanism by which U18666A inhibits axonal growth is likely more complex than inhibition of cholesterol synthesis alone because LDLs restore normal growth to neurons treated with pravastatin alone or progesterone with pravastatin but not to neurons incubated with U18666A. In this respect, U18666A mimicks NPC1 deficiency. These observations suggest that in npc −/− neurons and in wild-type neurons exposed to U18666A, LDL cholesterol is not delivered to the site required for axonal growth.ConclusionsOur experiments show that LDL cholesterol is transported into axons of npc −/− neurons but cannot be used effectively for axonal growth, presumably because the cholesterol is not released from endosomes. In addition, transport of endogenously synthesized cholesterol into axons ofnpc −/− neurons is impaired. These findings support our previous observations that the amount of cholesterol in cell bodies of npc −/− neurons is increased compared with that in npc +/+ neurons, whereas the cholesterol content of distal axons is decreased (49Karten B.

This deficit in axonal cholesterol might become more pronounced over the long life of neurons in intact animals, particularly if the majority of axonal cholesterol originated from endogenous synthesis, as appears to be the case in cultured sympathetic neurons (32de Chaves E.I.

Eventually, a reduction in the cholesterol content of NPC1-deficient axons in vivo, rather than an accumulation of cholesterol in cell bodies, might result in defective axonal regeneration and/or remodeling, which might account, at least in part, for the progressive neurodegeneration in NPC patients.

Recently, a novel enzyme belonging to this class of enzymes has been characterized for its capability to oxidize preferentially spermine and designated as spermine oxidase. This is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing enzyme, and it has been expressed both in vitro and in vivo systems. The primary structure of mouse spermine oxidase (mSMO) was deduced from a cDNA clone (Image Clone 264769) recovered by a data base search utilizing the human counterpart of polyamine oxidases, PAOh1. The open reading frame predicts a 555-amino acid protein with a calculatedM r of 61,852.30, which shows a 95.1% identity with PAOh1. To understand the biochemical properties of mSMO and its structure/function relationship, the mSMO cDNA has been subcloned and expressed in secreted and secreted-tagged forms intoEscherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells. The recombinant enzyme shows an optimal pH value of 8.0 and is able to oxidize rapidly spermine to spermidine and 3-aminopropanal and fails to act upon spermidine and N 1-acetylpolyamines. The purified recombinant-tagged form enzyme (M r∼68,000) has K m and k catvalues of 90 μm and 4.5 s−1, respectively, using spermine as substrate at pH 8.0.

J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have reported the cloning and characterization of novel mammalian PAO enzymes capable of oxidizing preferentially Spm and for this reason named spermine oxidase (SMO) (30Vujcic S.

J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it was postulated that in addition to the traditional interconversion pathway in which Spm is first acetylated by spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase and then oxidized by PAO, mammalian cells contain an enzyme capable of directly oxidizing Spm to Spd (30Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Data base searching analysis using PAOh1 cDNA sequence recovered a mouse cDNA clone (Image Clone 264769) corresponding to the murine counterpart, which was supplied by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council Human Genome Mapping Resource Centre (Cambridge, United Kingdom) consortium and herein defined as mSMO. To enhance the knowledge of enzymology of mammalian SMO and shed light on the structure/function relationship of this enzyme, the mSMO cDNA was further subcloned and expressed in secreted and secreted-tagged forms into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells. This paper describes the expression and the main biochemical features of mouse spermine oxidase. Notwithstanding the low amino acid sequence homology shown by the animal and plant PAOs (45% sequence homology between MPAO and mSMO), molecular modeling of mSMO based on MPAO three-dimensional structure (18Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Structure. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) suggests that the general features of MPAO active site are conserved in mSMO.DISCUSSIONPlant or animal recombinant PAOs have been never reported to be expressed in E. coli cells to our knowledge. This is the first report of a vertebrate polyamine oxidase overexpressed in secreted and secreted-tagged forms in such a heterologous system. SMO recombinant enzymes are targeted to the periplasmic membrane compartment, and the catalytically active proteins are expressed at a level of ∼6 units/liter of culture broth. The data obtained for the secreted recombinant mSMO perfectly match the ones obtained for the secreted-tagged enzyme form.The analysis of the expressed mSMO protein gave an improved understanding of the biochemical features of this enzyme, since the purified recombinant enzyme was able to oxidize only Spm and failed to act upon Spd and the N 1-acetyl derivatives. The enzyme specificity reported herein is in agreement with the one described in transfected human cells by Vujcic et al.(30Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The precise nature of the reaction products and the cleavage position on the Spm substrate are those typical of an animal PAO enzyme. In line with this finding, the specific inhibition of mSMO enzyme activity was obtained with MDL72527 but not with pargyline.The absorption spectrum of the native enzyme showed the typical three-banded spectrum for flavoproteins. Furthermore, the addition of the Spm substrate in anaerobic conditions resulted in a dramatic absorbance decrease, while reoxygenation of the enzyme restored the initial spectrum, indicating the involvement of a FAD group in the catalytic cycle.An analysis of the molecular model of mSMO as compared with MPAO three-dimensional structure suggests that the catalytic tunnel of the former enzyme is wider. It is tempting to speculate that the preference for Spm over Spd as a substrate observed for mSMO is linked to the different shape of the catalytic tunnel in which the short Spd substrate would be bound in a “floppy” fashion, thus rendering less efficient the enzyme catalysis, which has been hypothesized to rely on an “in register” binding of the substrates.The substitution of Glu-62 by a His residue in mSMO can provide an explanation for the peculiar pH dependence of the activity. In fact, it can be reasonably assumed that His-62 is partially protonated at pH values lower than 7.0. Thus, the binding of the cationic polyamine substrates would be unfavorable and enzyme activity would be very low as observed experimentally. At pH values higher than 7.0, His-62 would deprotonate, thus facilitating substrate binding and leading to an increase in enzyme activity, which is maximal at pH values of ∼8.0.In conclusion, in mammalian cells, polyamine catabolism seems to be mediated by the activity of two enzymes, PAO and the novel SMO, described in this work (30Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The precise significance of both polyamine oxidase activities in the metabolism of polyamines remains to be established, particularly regarding the role of each enzyme in regulating polyamine concentrations in mammalian tissues in relation with growth processes and malignant transformation.

J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it was postulated that in addition to the traditional interconversion pathway in which Spm is first acetylated by spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase and then oxidized by PAO, mammalian cells contain an enzyme capable of directly oxidizing Spm to Spd (30Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Data base searching analysis using PAOh1 cDNA sequence recovered a mouse cDNA clone (Image Clone 264769) corresponding to the murine counterpart, which was supplied by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council Human Genome Mapping Resource Centre (Cambridge, United Kingdom) consortium and herein defined as mSMO. To enhance the knowledge of enzymology of mammalian SMO and shed light on the structure/function relationship of this enzyme, the mSMO cDNA was further subcloned and expressed in secreted and secreted-tagged forms into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells. This paper describes the expression and the main biochemical features of mouse spermine oxidase. Notwithstanding the low amino acid sequence homology shown by the animal and plant PAOs (45% sequence homology between MPAO and mSMO), molecular modeling of mSMO based on MPAO three-dimensional structure (18Binda C. Coda A. Angelini R. Federico R. Ascenzi P. Mattevi A. Structure. 1999; 7: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) suggests that the general features of MPAO active site are conserved in mSMO. DISCUSSIONPlant or animal recombinant PAOs have been never reported to be expressed in E. coli cells to our knowledge. This is the first report of a vertebrate polyamine oxidase overexpressed in secreted and secreted-tagged forms in such a heterologous system. SMO recombinant enzymes are targeted to the periplasmic membrane compartment, and the catalytically active proteins are expressed at a level of ∼6 units/liter of culture broth. The data obtained for the secreted recombinant mSMO perfectly match the ones obtained for the secreted-tagged enzyme form.The analysis of the expressed mSMO protein gave an improved understanding of the biochemical features of this enzyme, since the purified recombinant enzyme was able to oxidize only Spm and failed to act upon Spd and the N 1-acetyl derivatives. The enzyme specificity reported herein is in agreement with the one described in transfected human cells by Vujcic et al.(30Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The precise nature of the reaction products and the cleavage position on the Spm substrate are those typical of an animal PAO enzyme. In line with this finding, the specific inhibition of mSMO enzyme activity was obtained with MDL72527 but not with pargyline.The absorption spectrum of the native enzyme showed the typical three-banded spectrum for flavoproteins. Furthermore, the addition of the Spm substrate in anaerobic conditions resulted in a dramatic absorbance decrease, while reoxygenation of the enzyme restored the initial spectrum, indicating the involvement of a FAD group in the catalytic cycle.An analysis of the molecular model of mSMO as compared with MPAO three-dimensional structure suggests that the catalytic tunnel of the former enzyme is wider. It is tempting to speculate that the preference for Spm over Spd as a substrate observed for mSMO is linked to the different shape of the catalytic tunnel in which the short Spd substrate would be bound in a “floppy” fashion, thus rendering less efficient the enzyme catalysis, which has been hypothesized to rely on an “in register” binding of the substrates.The substitution of Glu-62 by a His residue in mSMO can provide an explanation for the peculiar pH dependence of the activity. In fact, it can be reasonably assumed that His-62 is partially protonated at pH values lower than 7.0. Thus, the binding of the cationic polyamine substrates would be unfavorable and enzyme activity would be very low as observed experimentally. At pH values higher than 7.0, His-62 would deprotonate, thus facilitating substrate binding and leading to an increase in enzyme activity, which is maximal at pH values of ∼8.0.In conclusion, in mammalian cells, polyamine catabolism seems to be mediated by the activity of two enzymes, PAO and the novel SMO, described in this work (30Vujcic S. Diegelman P. Bacchi C.J. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The precise significance of both polyamine oxidase activities in the metabolism of polyamines remains to be established, particularly regarding the role of each enzyme in regulating polyamine concentrations in mammalian tissues in relation with growth processes and malignant transformation.

Using the COOH-terminal region of NG2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the glutamate receptor interaction protein GRIP1, a multi-PDZ domain protein, as an interacting partner. NG2 exhibits a PDZ binding motif at the extreme COOH terminus which binds to the seventh PDZ domain of GRIP1. In addition to the published expression in neurons, GRIP1 is expressed by immature glial cells. GRIP1 is known to bind to the GluRB subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor expressed by subpopulations of neurons and immature glial cells. In cultures of primary oligodendrocytes, cells coexpress GluRB and NG2. A complex of NG2, GRIP1, and GluRB can be precipitated from transfected mammalian cells and from cultures of primary oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, NG2 and GRIP can be coprecipitated from developing brain tissue. These data suggest that GRIP1 acts as a scaffolding molecule clustering NG2 and AMPA receptors in immature glia. In view of the presence of synaptic contacts between neurons and NG2-positive glial cells in the hippocampus and the close association of NG2-expressing glial cells with axons, we suggest a role for the NG2·AMPA receptor complex in glial-neuronal recognition and signaling.

Res. 2000; 61: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The AN2 proteoglycan (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the mouse homolog of NG2 (4Schneider S. Bosse F. D'Urso D. Muller H. Sereda M.W. Nave K. Niehaus A. Kempf T. Schnolzer M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 920-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing and adult nervous system many NG2-positive cells abound in both white and gray matter whose classification as oligodendrocyte or astrocyte lineage cells remains unclear but whose electrophysiological properties are typical of immature glial cells (5Diers-Fenger M. Kirchhoff F. Kettenmann H. Levine J.M. Trotter J. Glia. 2001; 34: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, Bergles and colleagues (6Bergles D.E. Roberts J.D. Somogyi P. Jahr C.E. Nature. 2000; 405: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) identified a novel type of synapse in the developing and adult rat hippocampus where pyramidal neurons of the CA3 area form morphologically identifiable synaptic boutons on NG2-positive cells. Furthermore, stimulation of the neurons resulted in a Ca2+signal in the NG2-positive glial cells which was dependent on the activity of the AMPA1 class of glutamate receptors. AMPA receptors are known to be expressed by subclasses of glial cells including oligodendrocyte precursor cells (7Patneau D.K. Wright P.W. Winters C. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. Neuron. 1994; 12: 357-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) where their function is thought to include an inhibitory influence on proliferation and lineage progression of oligodendrocyte progenitors (8Yuan X. Eisen A.M. McBain C.J. Gallo V. Development. 1998; 125: 2901-2914PubMed Google Scholar). NG2 is a single pass transmembrane proteoglycan with a large extracellular domain and two LAM G (LNS) domains near the NH2 terminus, suggesting a role as an adhesion molecule. NG2 has a short intracellular tail of 76 amino acids. The PDZ protein MUPP1 was identified recently by yeast two-hybrid screening of a library from E9.5/10.5 mouse embryo as an intracellular binding partner of rat NG2 (9Barritt D.S. Pearn M.T. Zisch A.H. Lee S.S. Javier R.T. Pasquale E.B. Stallcup W.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although the biological significance of this finding remains unclear. Because the COOH terminus of NG2 exhibits a putative PDZ binding motif and PDZ domain proteins are adaptor proteins that target and cluster protein complexes including neurotransmitter receptors to the cell surface (10Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), we sought to identify intracellular partners of NG2 in glial progenitor cells. The cytoplasmic domain of murine NG2 was used as bait in yeast two-hybrid analysis to screen a library from early postnatal mouse brain. This screen revealed the glutamate receptor interaction protein (GRIP) 1 as a binding partner. We show that GRIP1 acts as a direct molecular link between AMPA receptors and the glycoprotein NG2 in immature glial cells. This protein complex, together with as yet to be identified additional members, may contribute to a postsynaptic microdomain in immature glial cells and contribute to glial-neuronal signaling. NMRI mice were obtained from the central animal facilities of the University of Heidelberg. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal (mc) GRIP1 (Becton Dickinson), polyclonal (pc) antibodies against GRIP1 (kind gift from Dr. R. Klein), and pc GluRB 2The AMPA receptor subunits GluRA, B, C, and D are sometimes referred to as GluR1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany). The antibodies recognize specifically the short GluRB form (COOH-terminal peptide: SVKI*), which binds to GRIP1. We also used pc AN2 antibodies (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-GST880S16 (pc AN2 against a GST fusion protein consisting of amino acids 1255–1545, mc AN2 antibodies (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J.

Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), mc anti-Myc (Sigma), and mc 8-18-C5 against MOG (a kind gift from Dr. C. Linington). The COOH-terminal region of mouse NG2 (NH2-RKRNKT … NGQYWV-COOH, GenBank accession number AF352400) was fused to the GAL4 binding domain by cloning it into the pGBT9 vector (Clontech) with EcoRI/BamHI. The resulting bait construct was designated pGBT9cyto. Using the lithium acetate method, the yeast strain CG1945 was transformed sequentially with pGBT9cyto and a postnatal mouse brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library in pACT2 (Clontech). 33 × 106 transformants were screened. Transformants were grown on SD medium-Leu-Trp-His plates; 5 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was added to the medium to suppress leaky HIS3 reporter gene expression. Positive clones were tested for β-galactosidase gene activity: yeast colonies were grown on SD-Leu-Trp-His, transferred onto reinforced nitrocellulose membrane, submerged in liquid nitrogen, and placed on a Z-buffer/X-gal-soaked Whatman (Z-buffer: 16.1 g/liter Na2HPO4*7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4*H2O, 0.75 g/liter KCl, 0.246 g/liter MgSO4*7H2O, pH 7; Z-buffer/X-gal solution: 100 ml of Z-buffer, 0.27 ml of β-mercaptoethanol, 1.67 ml of 20 mg/ml X-gal stock solution). Blue color was allowed to develop for 30 min-3 h. DNA-sequencing results revealed 48 isolates and 10 independent clones of GRIP1. All clones included the seventh PDZ domain and the COOH terminus of GRIP1. The specificity of the NG2-GRIP1 interaction was confirmed by a β-galactosidase test and growth selection of cotransformed yeast cells with pGBT9cyto and isolated library plasmids. Unspecific NG2 interactions were excluded by contransformation of yeast cells with pGBT9cyto and GRIP1 constructs in pGADGH lacking the seventh PDZ domain (kind gift from Dr. R. Klein). Unspecific interactions of the seventh PDZ domain of GRIP1 were excluded by cotransformation of yeast with a pGBT9 construct encoding the cytoplasmic COOH terminus of an unrelated transmembrane protein M6A. 3H. Werner and K. Nave, unpublished data. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to map the interaction site of GRIP1 with NG2. Results from the sequencing of GRIP1 revealed the seventh PDZ domain as putative interaction site. Mouse GRIP1 deletion constructs in pACT2 were used as resulting from the screen: mouse GRIP1 4p-7 (LEIEFD … EPTNTL), mouse GRIP1 5–7 (KHSVEL … EPTNTL), mouse GRIP1, 7 (ATIMSG … EPTNTL). Further control constructs of rat GRIP1 were kind gifts from Dr. R. Klein: rat GRIP1 4–6 (TSPRGT … KLSDVY), rat GRIP1, 6 (EDNSDE … KQTDAQ), rat GRIP1 6–7 (GAIIYT … EPTNTL). The NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences above correspond to sequences from mouse GRIP1 library plasmids or to the published rat GRIP1 sequence (12Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cotransformed yeast cells were grown on double dropout medium and assayed for β-galactosidase gene activity and additionally selected for growth on triple dropout medium. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to test the interaction of NG2 and the seventh PDZ domain of GRIP2. The GRIP2 cDNA sequence was generated by reverse transcription PCR, which introduced EcoRI/BamHI sites and then cloned into the pACT2 vector: rat GRIP2, 7 (RSREVGT … SSPQMI); the sequence corresponds to the published rat sequence (13Dong H. Zhang P. Song I. Petralia R.S. Liao D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was verified by sequencing. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to map the PDZ binding motif at the extreme COOH terminus of NG2. Individual mutations of the 0, −1, −2, and −3 positions of the COOH-terminal peptide QYWV* were introduced by PCR, cloned into pGBT9, and designated as NG2 0G (Val mutated to Gly), NG2 −1G (Trp mutated to Gly), NG2 −2G (Tyr mutated to Gly), NG2 −2F (Tyr mutated to Phe), NG2 −3G (Gln mutated to Gly). Mutant NG2 constructs were contransformed with mouse GRIP1 PDZ7 and rat GRIP2 PDZ7. Yeast cells were grown on double dropout medium and assayed for β-galactosidase gene activity and additionally selected for growth on triple dropout medium. COS7 cells were transfected by electroporation (0.25 kV, 250 microfarads). Plasmids were used at 15 μg/300 μl of cell suspension (4 × 106 cells/ml, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum). The NG2 deletion mutant was generated by trimolecular ligation of two PCR-amplified regions of NG2 with artificially introduced restriction sites in the pRK5 vector (14Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A. Lentz R. Raab H. Cell. 1990; 61: 361-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant consists of the signal sequence, one-fourth of the very NH2-terminal extracellular portion (including both LNS domains), the transmembrane domain, and the complete intracellular region. Mouse GRIP1/PDZ7 and mouse GRIP1/PDZ5–7 expression constructs were generated by cloning murine sequences into pRK5 vector withEcoRI/BamHI andEcoRI/HindIII sites introduced by PCR, respectively. The constructs contain a translation initiation sequence (15Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar) and encode an NH2-terminal Myc tag. GluRB full-length, flop, short form was a kind gift from Dr. H. Monyer. Constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfected COS7 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after transfection, starved for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium, then metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys for 4 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors), and the lysates were chilled for 30 min and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to remove nuclei. For immunoprecipitation the following antibodies were used: mouse mc Myc (Sigma), rabbit pc AN2 (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pc GluRB (Chemicon). Lysates were preabsorbed with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, then subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C. Precipitation was performed with protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7) and once with PBS before adding sample buffer and resolving the proteins by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, exposed to screens, and evaluated with a PhosphorImager. Total mouse brains (P7) were homogenized in buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 320 mmsucrose, protease inhibitors) using an Ultra Turrax. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm, 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C. The pellet was extracted in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged afterward for 1 h, 100,000 ×g, 4 °C. The supernatant was preabsorbed with protein A-Sepharose and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. Precipitates were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 buffer and once with PBS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Primary oligodendrocytes were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, and the lysates were chilled on ice, centrifuged, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 4% milk powder in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. The blots were washed with PBST and incubated with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Dianova). They were washed twice with PBST and once with PBS and subsequently developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). 12 × 106 cells (primary oligodendrocytes) were extracted in 750 μl of 1% Triton X-100 buffer, chilled for 30 min, and centrifuged (see “Coimmunoprecipitation”). 750 μl of extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose with 750 μl of 80% sucrose. The extract was overlaid with 1.75 ml of 30% sucrose and 1.5 ml of 5% sucrose in an SW60 tube (Beckman). After centrifugation (4 h at 218,000 × g, 4 °C) eight fractions were collected (17Klein C. Kramer E.M. Cardine A.M. Schraven B. Brandt R. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 698-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by 4–10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Primary oligodendrocytes were cultured according to Trotter and colleagues (11Trotter J. Bitter-Suermann D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,18Sontheimer H. Trotter J. Schachner M. Kettenmann H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), shaken-off oligodendrocytes were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 2 days in SATO medium containing 1% horse serum, 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, and 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and blocked with β-mercaptoethanol and 10% horse serum. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with β-mercaptoethanol and 10% horse serum and incubated for 30 min with appropriate secondary Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated pc antibodies (Dianova), diluted in blocking buffer. The washed coverslips were mounted in Moviol and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). The complete mouse NG2 cytoplasmic region consisting of 76 amino acids (RKRN … QYWV*, * = translation stop codon) was used as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid analysis to screen a postnatal mouse brain cDNA library. 33 × 106 transformants were screened. Ten independent library plasmids represented fragments of the same sequence, which was identical to murine GRIP1, a multi-PDZ domain protein (Fig. 1 a). GRIP1 was originally identified as an interacting protein of AMPA receptor subunits GluRB and GluRC (12Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) The GRIP1 clones isolated in the screen were grouped according to their PDZ domain composition: group1 encodes a partial PDZ domain 4 through PDZ domain 7 (GRIP1/4p-7), group2 PDZ domain 5 through 7 (GRIP1/5–7), group3 a partial PDZ domain 6 through 7 (GRIP1/6p-7), group4 encodes PDZ domain 7 only (GRIP1/7). This analysis already identified the seventh PDZ domain as the putative interaction site. Yeast two-hybrid technology was used to verify the interaction of GRIP1 with the cytoplasmic region of NG2 and to confirm the interaction site by excluding binding of NG2 to GRIP1 PDZ domains other than PDZ7. Yeast was cotransformed with isolated GRIP1 plasmids and pGBT9cyto, grown on double dropout medium, and subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The yeast colonies were additionally selected for growth on triple dropout medium. As shown in Fig. 1 b, yeast two-hybrid analysis and subsequent β-galactosidase assay confirmed the binding of NG2 to GRIP1/PDZ4p-7, GRIP1/PDZ5–7, GRIP1/PDZp6–7, and GRIP1/PDZ7. When rat GRIP1 constructs consisting of PDZ domains 4–6 and the sixth domain only were tested for interaction, the yeast cells were negative for β-galactosidase activity, and failed to grow on triple dropout medium. Rat constructs containing the seventh PDZ domain such as GRIP1/PDZ6p-7 and GRIP1/PDZ6–7 restored the interaction of NG2 and GRIP1 and clearly identified the seventh PDZ domain of GRIP as the interaction site. GRIP2, a GRIP1 homolog, also consists of seven PDZ domains and is expressed in the central nervous system (13Dong H. Zhang P. Song I. Petralia R.S. Liao D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because the sequences of the corresponding PDZ domains of GRIP1 and GRIP2 are very well conserved, we tested whether the interaction with NG2 was similarly conserved. The results in Fig. 1 c demonstrate that NG2 also interacts with the seventh PDZ domain of GRIP2, even though no clone for GRIP2 was isolated in the original screen. PDZ domains bind to COOH-terminal peptides of the interacting protein. The COOH-terminal tetrapeptide of NG2 (QYWV*) is conserved among rat, mouse, human, and Drosophila. It is similar to the PDZ binding motifs of ephrin B1 (YYKV*), which binds to PDZ6 of GRIP1/2 (19Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and neurexins (EYYV*), which bind to CASK (20Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a valine at position 0 and a tyrosine at the −2 position. To test whether QYWV* of NG2 is indeed a PDZ binding motif, positions 0, −1, −2, and −3 were mutated individually to glycine (Fig. 2). The mutations 0G, −1G, and −2G eliminated the interaction of NG2 and GRIP1/2, confirming that there is a PDZ binding motif at the extreme COOH terminus of NG2. Mutating the −3 position was without effect. The −2 position has been reported to be critical for the interaction. To characterize further the relevance of the amino acid at the −2 position, tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine (Fig. 2), thus testing whether the hydroxyl group was essential for the interaction as is the case of PSD95 binding to the third PDZ domain of CRIPT (21Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), where a hydrogen bond forms with the residue of the binding groove. However, this mutation (−2F) did not interfere with the interaction of NG2 and GRIP, showing that it is not the OH group that is essential but rather the hydrophobic nature of the aromatic side chain. PDZ7 of GRIP1/2 thus belongs to class II PDZ domains, which bind to motifs with hydrophobic amino acids at positions 0 and −2: ΦXΦ* (where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid, andX is any amino acid (10Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 22Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar)). NG2 associates with GRIP1 or GRIP2 in mammalian cells. NG2-GRIP1 and NG2-GRIP2 associations were further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of NG2 together with GRIP1 or GRIP2 expressed in COS7 cells. First, cells were analyzed after transfection with an NG2 construct (NG2del, Fig. 3 a), comprising the signal sequence, approximately one-fourth of the extracellular portion, the transmembrane domain, and the complete intracellular region. The protein was incorporated into the membrane and recognized by pc AN2 antibodies (Fig. 3 b). Subsequently the cells were transfected with the NG2del construct together with Myc-tagged GRIP1/PDZ7 or GRIP2/PDZ7, respectively (Fig. 3 a). Anti-Myc antibodies precipitated GRIP1 and associated NG2del from cotransfected COS7 cells (Fig. 3 c, lane 2) and pc AN2 antibodies recognizing mouse NG2 precipitate NG2del and associated GRIP1 (Fig. 3 c, lane 3). Anti-Myc antibodies also precipitate GRIP2 and associated NG2del from transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 3 c, lane 4) expressing both these constructs. To confirm the NG2-GRIP1 interaction in vivo, extracts from P7 total mouse brain were subjected to immunoprecipitation using AN2 antibodies followed by Western blot analysis of coprecipitated GRIP1. The results (Fig. 3 d) demonstrate that GRIP1 associates with NG2 in vivo. Pc AN2 antibodies precipitate NG2 (lane 1) and associated GRIP1 as revealed by Western blotting with antibodies against GRIP1 (lane 2). Lanes 3 and4 are controls showing the presence of GRIP1 and NG2 in the brain extracts before precipitation. Biochemical studies of GRIP1 have largely focused on neuronal expression, where GRIP1 is enriched in the postsynaptic density and at synaptic plasma membranes (13Dong H. Zhang P. Song I. Petralia R.S. Liao D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wyszynski M. Kim E. Yang F.C. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because NG2 is expressed by immature glial cells including oligodendrocyte progenitors (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was important to demonstrate that the interaction partner GRIP1 is also expressed in these cells. A Western blot analysis of lysates of the murine oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line Oli-neu (24Jung M. Kramer E. Grzenkowski M. Tang K. Blakemore W. Aguzzi A. Khazaie K. Chlichlia K. von Blankenfeld G. Kettenmann H. Trotter J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1245-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and cultures of mouse primary oligodendrocytes consisting of a range of differentiation stages with antibodies against GRIP1 demonstrated a band of 130 kDa (Fig. 4 a,lanes 1 and 2). A total lysate from P9 mouse brain exhibited a band at the same molecular mass (lane 3) as in the control blot with rat cerebrum (lane 4). These results demonstrate that GRIP1 is indeed expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Because GRIP also binds to the GluRB subunit of AMPA receptors (12Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and AMPA receptors are expressed by glial cells (7Patneau D.K. Wright P.W. Winters C. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. Neuron. 1994; 12: 357-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we examined whether NG2-positive cells also express GluRB. First, a Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies to GluRB (Fig. 4 b). A band of 108 kDa was detected in lysates of primary oligodendrocytes (lane 2) and in the control lysate (P9 total mouse brain, lane 3). No expression was detected in the Oli-neu cell line (lane 1). To define GluRB expression in individual cells, mixed cultures of primary oligodendrocytes were costained with AN2 antibodies and GluRB antibodies (Fig. 4 c). All oligodendrocyte lineage cells staining with antibodies to GluRB coexpressed NG2; however, not all NG2-positive cells expressed GluRB. GluRB staining was restricted to more immature cells with a few processes and revealed a punctate distribution of the protein along the major processes in addition to an intense intracellular staining. More mature oligodendrocytes characterized by a more complex morphology no longer expressed GluRB (see also Fig. 6 d, white star). NG2 expression shows a partial overlap with the expression of the O4 marker (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which characterizes a late stage of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (25Trotter J. Schachner M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1989; 46: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and is retained on more mature oligodendrocytes (26Sommer I. Schachner M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no overlap of NG2 and proteins expressed by more mature oligodendrocytes (3Niehaus A. Stegmüller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the timing of GRIP1 and GluRB expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Fig. 5), mixed cultures of primary oligodendrocytes were used as an in vitro model for oligodendrocyte maturation (27Pfeiffer S.E. Warrington A.E. Bansal R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and analyzed after 2, 8, and 14 days in culture by Western blotting. These cultures represent a dynamic population of different developmental stages that initially consists (div2) of predominantly immature cells. GRIP1 expression is high in immature cultures and decreases slowly as oligodendrocytes mature. In contrast, GluRB expression drops dramatically as oligodendrocytes mature. Maturation of oligodendrocytes is shown by increasing expression of MOG, a marker of mature oligodendrocytes. Staining of such cultures demonstrates that NG2 and MOG are never coexpressed and that GluRB-expressing cells are always MOG-negative. GRIP1 expression persists over a longer period of maturation than GluRB expression, implying that GRIP1 may have multiple binding partners during the course of oligodendroglial development. Transfected COS7 cells were subjected to radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation to investigate whether a complex consisting of NG2, GRIP1, and GluRB can be isolated. Cells were transfected with the NG2del, Myc-tagged GRIP1 and the AMPA subunit GluRB (flop, short form). NG2 as well as the GluRB subunit were incorporated into the plasma membrane. The GRIP1 construct encodes PDZ domains 5–7 (Fig. 6 a). GluRB was reported to bind to PDZ4–5 of GRIP (12Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), and we have shown that NG2 binds to GRIP/PDZ7. Fig. 6 b shows immunoprecipitation of the complex: pc AN2"

Although EWS is predicted to be an RNA-binding protein, an inherent EWS nuclear function has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that EWS associates with a transcriptional co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and the hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II, which are included preferentially in the transcription preinitiation complex. These interactions suggest the potential involvement of EWS in gene transcription, leading to the hypothesis that EWS may function as a co-activator of CBP-dependent transcription factors. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of EWS on the activation of nuclear receptors that are activated by CBP. Of nuclear receptors examined, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-dependent transcription was selectively enhanced by EWS but not by an EWS mutant defective for CBP binding. These results suggest that EWS as a co-activator requires CBP for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-mediated transcriptional activation.

These results suggest that EWS as a co-activator requires CBP for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-mediated transcriptional activation. The EWS gene was originally identified in Ewing's sarcoma with the t(11,22) chromosomal translocation where it is fused to the ETS transcription factor Fli-1 gene (1Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. et al.Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies indicated that other ETS transcription factor genes fuse to theEWS gene and produce fusion proteins in Ewing's sarcoma. In addition to the fusion with ETS transcription factors in Ewing's sarcoma, the EWS gene has been shown to form fusion proteins with ATF-1 in malignant melanoma of soft parts, WT-1 in desmoplastic small round cell tumors, and nuclear orphan receptors in myxoid chondrosarcomas (2Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5747-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In EWS fusion proteins, the N-terminal domain (NTD) 1The abbreviations used are: NTD, N-terminal domain; Luc, luciferase; tk, thymidine kinase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; HNF4, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; G6P, glucose 6-phosphatase; Apo, apolipoprotein; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; Pol, polymerase of EWS is retained, whereas the C-terminal domain of EWS is replaced by corresponding fusion partners. However, the roles of EWS in normal cellular functions and the mechanisms whereby EWS fusion proteins lead to these malignant tumors remain unclear. EWS contains the transcriptional activation domain in its NTD and the RNA-recognition motif and arginine-glycine-glycine repeats (RGG), both of which are found in RNA-binding proteins (3Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) in its C-terminal domain. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing are closely coupled events in vivo (4Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and based on its structural features, it is likely that EWS participates in RNA transcription and mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the NTD of EWS associates with the basal transcription factor TFIID (5Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and with certain subunits of the RNA polymerase II complex (5Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 6Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, EWS interacts with the splicing factors SF1 (7Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), U1C (8Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), TASR-1/TRSR-2 translocation liposarcoma protein-associated serine-arginine protein (9Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and Y-box protein-1 (10Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3586-3590PubMed Google Scholar). A current expectation is that EWS may act as an adaptor molecule linking between gene transcription and mRNA processing by interacting with RNA polymerase II and the splicing factors (2Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5747-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this study, we indicated the interaction of EWS with the transcriptional co-activator CBP and the hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II. CBP enhances many DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins including nuclear receptors and other signal-regulated activators by its histone acetyltransferase activity and recruitment of RNA polymerase II-dependent basal transcription complex or other cofactors to target gene promoters (11Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Therefore, these identified interactions suggest the potential involvement of EWS in gene transcriptional activation. However, the fact that EWS does not have any significant DNA-binding motifs or binding activity to specific gene promoters prompted us to propose the hypothesis that EWS may function as a co-activator of CBP-dependent DNA-binding transcription factors. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated the possible effects of EWS on transactivation mediated by nuclear receptors. We showed that EWS selectively enhances the nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4)-mediated transcription cooperatively with CBP. These results suggest that EWS not only functions as an adaptor molecule for splicing events but also as a co-activator with CBP for transcriptional initiation. Human EWS deletion mutants were generated by PCR-based subcloning into pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pHNF4x8-tk-Luc and pβREx2-tk-Luc have been described previously (13Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Chakravarti D.

Apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII)-Luc and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6P)-Luc were constructed by PCR-based methods. Human ApoCIIIpromoter (−890 to +44) or human G6P promoter (−826 to +3) fragment was inserted into pPicaGene-Basic vector II. Angiotensinogen 13-Luc was constructed by digesting a 1266-bp (−1222 to +44) fragment from human angiotensinogen promoter 13cat, which has been described previously (15Yanai K. Hirota K. Taniguchi-Yanai K. Shigematsu Y. Shimamoto Y. Saito T. Chowdhury S. Takiguchi M. Arakawa M. Nibu Y. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol.

Anti-EWS rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a GST-EWS-(246–504). Anti-HNF4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a GST-HNF4-(133–366). Anti-CBP rabbit polyclonal antiserum-(5614) was described previously (16Miyagishi M. Fujii R. Hatta M. Yoshida E. Araya N. Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was from Sigma; anti-HNF4α (C-19) and anti-RNA polymerase II (N-20) polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and anti-RNA pol II monoclonal antibodies (8WG16 and H14) were from BAbCo. HEK293T cells and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and HEK293 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For the reporter gene assay, transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method. A Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase plasmid was included in each transfection experiment to control for transfection efficiency. The luciferase activity was measured with an ARVOTMSX (Wallac Berthold). The values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. HEK293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (13Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG coupled with protein G-agarose in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors) for 4 h at 4 °C. The binding complexes were washed with the same buffer. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous EWS, CBP, and HNF4, nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-EWS, anti-HNF4, or anti-CBP-(5614) in Co-immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). The GST fusion protein of each EWS mutant was expressed in Escherichia coli strain TopXF′ (Invitrogen) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). Protein extracts of HEK293T cells were incubated with each GST fusion protein bound to resin in 1 ml of buffer A for 8 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with buffer A, bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed Western blotting. HEK293T or HEK293 cells were plated onto glass coverslips. HEK293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagents. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 6% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells then were incubated with the primary antibody, mouse anti-FLAG (1:500 dilution), rabbit anti-EWS (1:250 dilution), mouse anti-Pol IIa (1:200 dilution), or mouse anti-Pol IIo (1:100 dilution) antibody followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG, or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG second antibody (1:2000 dilution each; Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence was analyzed under a confocal microscope (TCS 4D, Leica). To isolate CBP-interacting proteins, we used a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to CBP as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay (13Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in which we identified EWS as a CBP-binding protein. To biochemically characterize the interaction of EWS with CBP, we constructed a series of EWS deletion mutants fused to GST and bacterially expressed products of them for the following assays (Fig. 1 A). GST pull-down assays were performed on this series of EWS deletions with HEK293T lysates expressing HA-tagged CBP. Western blotting of the bound proteins using anti-HA antibody showed that CBP was specifically retained on beads coupled with GST-EWS-(1–656), GST-EWS-(1–333), and GST-EWS-(83–227) (Fig. 1 B). These results show that EWS can specifically interact with CBP through its amino acids 83–227 located on the NTD of EWS. Two isoforms of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) exist in vivo, the hypophosphorylated (Pol IIa) and the hyperphosphorylated (Pol IIo) forms required for transcriptional initiation and elongation, respectively. Pol IIa is shown to possess the hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain of the largest subunit and interacts with a range of general transcription factors at the promoter (17Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19621-19629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We investigated the relationship of EWS with different forms of Pol II using three anti-Pol II antibodies: N-20, which recognizes the common NTD of both Pol IIa and Pol IIo large subunits; H14, which only recognizes Pol IIo; and 8WG16, which only recognizes Pol IIa in immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. To test the possible interaction of EWS with distinct forms of Pol II, we first examined their cellular localization. The staining patterns of Pol IIa and Pol IIo were compared with nucleoplasmic EWS distribution in double-labeling experiments followed by a confocal microscopy. The overlay images showed that the nucleoplasmic structures of EWS, and both Pol II forms partially overlapped (Fig. 2 A). To further confirm the biochemical interaction of EWS with both Pol IIa and Pol IIo, we performed GST pull-down assays using HEK293 nuclear extracts. GST-EWS combined with both Pol IIa and Pol IIo in vitro, whereas GST alone did not (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 C, both EWS and CBP associated with the preinitiation form of Pol II (pol IIa), whereas EWS but not CBP co-immunoprecipitated with Pol IIoin vivo. These results suggest that EWS is spatially and physically included in a part of both of the preinitiation and elongation Pol II complexes. To examine the potential role of EWS in nuclear receptors-mediated transactivation, we evaluated the effects of EWS on the activation of three nuclear receptors including HNF4, retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and PPARα by transfection experiments. A role for EWS as a co-activator in HNF4-mediated transactivation was first tested using HNF4-specific reporter, pHNF4x8-tk-Luc (13Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, transfection of HEK293 cells with the reporter alone or with HNF4 resulted in activation (Fig. 3 A1), which was stimulated 5-fold by co-transfection of EWS (Fig. 3 A, 1 and 2). We also examined the effect of EWS on RAR-mediated transactivation using RAR-specific reporter, pβREx2-tk-Luc (14Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells express the endogenous RAR as the reporter activity was sufficiently activated by its cognate ligand, even without co-transfection of RAR expression plasmids (Fig. 3 B1). Co-transfection of EWS repressed this activity by an RAR-specific ligand (Fig. 3 B, 1 and2). Similar experiments were carried out using PPARα with pPPREx3-sv-Luc. As shown Fig. 3 C, no effect of EWS was found on the activity of this receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that EWS is a selective co-activator for HNF4-mediated transactivation. HNF4, which belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily, is a liver-enriched DNA-binding transcription factor. Binding sites for HNF4 have often been found in the regulatory regions of a large number of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (19Mietus-Snyder M. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kuo C.F. Ladias J.A.

To test for transcriptional co-activations by EWS on the endogenous promoter sequences, we carried out transfection experiments using luciferase reporter plasmids containing each HNF4-targeted gene promoter. EWS enhanced ApoCIII (Fig. 4 A), G6P (Fig. 4 B), or angiotensinogen (Fig. 4 C) reporters, which were activated by HNF4 in a dose-dependent manner. To confirm the interaction of HNF4, CBP, and EWS under more physiological conditions, endogenous EWS, HNF4, and CBP in HepG2 nuclear extracts were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-EWS, anti-HNF4, and anti-CBP antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 D, endogenous EWS, HNF4, and CBP could be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous CBP/HNF4, CBP/EWS, and EWS/HNF4, respectively. To assess the regulatory effects of EWS and CBP on HNF4-mediated transactivation, we performed the reporter assay. Transfected HNF4 activity evaluated by co-transfection with an HNF4-tk-Luc reporter was further increased 3–4-fold by overexpression of EWS or CBP. When co-transfected together, both vectors induced reporter activity 13-fold in HNF4-transfected but not in non-transfected cells, suggesting that these transcription factors function cooperatively in HNF4-dependent transactivation (Fig. 4 E). To determine whether the interaction with CBP is required for EWS-mediated activation, we constructed EWSΔCBP, which lacks the CBP-binding region (amino acids 83–227) (Fig. 5 A). We first compared expression patterns of FLAG-tagged EWS or EWSΔCBP in transfected HEK293 cells by immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown Fig. 5, B andC, FLAG-tagged EWSΔCBP as well as EWS was localized in the nucleus, and these expression levels were nearly equal. We next tested the binding activity of EWSΔCBP with CBP or HNF4 by GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 5 D, EWSΔCBP lost the interaction with transfected HA-tagged CBP (upper panel) but still bound to HA-tagged HNF4α (lower panel). We then assessed the effect of EWSΔCBP on HNF4-mediated transactivation by transient transfection assay. In HEK293 cells, an HNF4-tk-Luc reporter was inactive because of little expression of endogenous HNF4 protein (Fig. 5 E, lanes 1–3). The luciferase reporter was activated up to 3-fold by co-transfection with HNF4 (Fig. 5 E, lane 4). The addition of EWS resulted in additional 2.5-fold activation (Fig. 5 E, lane 5). However, in the presence of HNF4, co-transfection with EWSΔCBP did not activate the HNF4-dependent transactivation (Fig. 5 E, lane 6). These results suggest that interaction with CBP is required for the activity of EWS on HNF4-dependent transactivation through the CBP-binding region. EWS was originally identified as a fusion protein with Fli-1 in Ewing's sarcoma and was later found in several malignancies in which the NTD of EWS was fused to the DNA-binding domain of the ETS family such as ATF-1, WT-1, CHN, and C/EBP homologous protein (2Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5747-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For all of the above malignancies, the EWS fusion proteins are thought to act as potent transcriptional activators in a manner that is dependent on the transcriptional activation domain in the NTD of EWS (22Kim J. Pelletier J. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional function of native EWS is not very well understood. It has been shown that transcriptional events are closely coupled with processing events in vivo (17Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19621-19629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of Pol II plays a central role in this coupling by reversible phosphorylation during the transcription cycle. Once initiation of transcription begins, the hypophosphorylated form of C-terminal domain (Pol IIa) becomes hyperphosphorylated (Pol IIo) during the transition from the preinitiation complex to the elongation-processing complex, and this form of pol II is able to recruit mRNA processing factors (23Corden J.L. Patturajan M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 413-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). EWS was previously reported to interact with only Pol IIo as an adaptor molecule to recruit splicing factors in elongation stages (2Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5747-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the interaction of EWS with CBP and with both of the preinitiation (Pol IIa) and the elongation (Pol IIo) forms of Pol II. CBP associates only with Pol IIa (24von Mikecz A. Zhang S. Montminy M. Tan E.M. Hemmerich P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and activates transcriptional initiation as a bridging/co-activating/chromatin-remodeling factor. These findings suggest that EWS may activate transcriptions in collaboration with CBP and basal transcription machinery including the preinitiation form (Pol IIa) of Pol II complex. A previous study (25Rossow K.L. Janknecht R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2690-2695PubMed Google Scholar) showed the interaction of EWS with CBP/p300 and the activation of c-fos, Xvent-2, and Erb2promoters by EWS. Because EWS does not have any obvious DNA-binding domain, it has been described that EWS may be recruited to target promoters by protein-protein interaction with DNA-binding transcription factors and act as a co-activator. However, a target DNA-binding transcription factor has not yet been identified. We demonstrated that EWS selectively potentiates the DNA-binding HNF4 transcription factor-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3). As transient transfection analyses using the ApoCIII, G6P, andangiotensinogenpromoters illustrated that these were activated by HNF4 in conjunction with EWS but not in the absence of HNF4, HNF4 is a high affinity site for the entry of EWS to the target promoters. On the other hand, EWS repressed RAR-mediated transcription (Fig. 3 B) and did not associate with RAR under the conditions used in this assay (data not shown). This finding suggested that RAR is not a direct target molecule of EWS and that the repression by EWS artificially arises from squelching CBP, RNA polymerase II, TFIID, or other factors in the transcriptional complex for RAR. We found that EWS interacted with CBP and HNF4 and played cooperatively with CBP to further reinforce the transactivation of HNF4 (Fig. 4). In addition, the co-activational activity of EWS was abolished by the deletion of the CBP-binding region of EWS (amino acids 83–227) (Fig. 5). In previous studies, Ohno et al. (26Rao V.N. Ohno T. Prasad D.D. Bhattacharya G. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2167-2173PubMed Google Scholar) and Lessnicket al. (27Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of EWS is included in amino acids 83–265 when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 or Fli-1. These findings reveal that the co-activator function of CBP mediates the transactivation ability of EWS or EWS fusion proteins through the NTD. Although we demonstrated that EWS interacts with CBP and the preinitiation form of Pol II and enhances HNF4-mediated transcription in a manner dependent on the co-activator function of CBP, additional EWS functions were suggested by other studies. For example, EWS contains motifs like RNA-binding proteins and actually binds to RNAin vitro (28Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar), the elongation-mRNA processing form of pol II (Pol IIo) (Fig. 2) (9Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it has been shown that EWS-Fli-1 can antagonize the splicing of model mRNA constructs in cells (9Yang L. Chansky H.A. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37612-37618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3586-3590PubMed Google Scholar). In this point, PPARγ co-activator-1, which has also been reported as an HNF4 co-activator (29Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), can function as both transcriptional co-activator and splicing regulator (30Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, our present findings provide the possibility that a variety of HNF4-dependent physiological functions including fatty acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and blood pressure control may be exerted efficiently as results of coupling of between transcription and mRNA processing by EWS and/or PPARγ co-activator-1. Because EWS is a ubiquitously expressed factor (31Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as compared with the limited expression profile of PPARγ co-activator-1 in the brown fat, kidney, heart, and brain under the normal conditions (32Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar), it is likely that EWS participates in various biological events through other nuclear receptors or CBP-directed DNA-binding transcription factors. In contrast, we confirmed that a EWS fusion gene, EWS-Fli-1, lost the activity as a co-activator by a minimal reporter gene system using HNF4 recognition site (data not shown). It is expected that impaired (lost or acquired) biological systems of native EWS caused by a gene fusion event may be related to the tumorigenesis. Therefore, further analysis regarding the native EWS function will be helpful to understand the physiological significance of EWS in addition to the mechanisms of transformation by EWS fusion proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1971382394,"The X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome gene encodes a protein named SAP or SH2D1A that is composed of a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Two models have been proposed for its function in lymphocyte signaling. One postulates that it acts as an inhibitor of interactions between the phosphatase SHP-2 and the immune receptor SLAM. The other suggests that it functions as an adaptor to promote the recruitment of a kinase, FynT, to SLAM. Here, we provide evidence in support of both roles for SAP. Using an array of peptides derived from the SLAM family of receptors, we demonstrate that SAP binds with comparable affinities to the same sites in these receptors as do the SH2 domains of SHP-2 and SHIP, suggesting that these three proteins may compete against one another in binding to a given SLAM family receptor. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo binding studies indicate that SAP is capable of binding directly to FynT, an interaction mediated by the FynT SH3 domain. In cells, FynT was shown to be indispensable for SLAM tyrosine phosphorylation, which, in turn, was drastically enhanced by SAP. Because SAP also blocked the recruitment of SHP-2 to SLAM in these cells, we propose a dual functional role for SAP in SLAM signaling by acting both as an adaptor for FynT and an inhibitor to SHP-2 binding. The physiological relevance of the dual functional role for SAP is underscored by the observation that disease-causing SAP mutants exhibited significantly reduced affinities to both FynT and SLAM.

SAP is a protein of 128 amino acids consisting of an N-terminal SH2 domain and a 26-residue C-terminal tail. Its small size has led to the assumption that it may act as a natural inhibitor of SH2 domain-dependent interactions (3Morra M. Howie D. Grande M.S. Sayos J. Wang N., Wu, C. Engel P. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 657-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Sayos J., Wu, C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Gehat R. Roncarolo M.G.

Evidence in support of such a notion comes from the observation that SAP interacts physically with the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, SLAM, through a Tyr-containing motif that is conserved among members of the SLAM family of lymphocyte surface receptors (3Morra M. Howie D. Grande M.S. Sayos J. Wang N., Wu, C. Engel P. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 657-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and that this interaction serves to block a competing interaction between SLAM and SHP-2, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that plays important roles in various cellular signaling events (11Feng G.S.

The structural basis for the specific recognition of SLAM by SAP has recently been unraveled by both x-ray crystallographic and NMR methods (13Poy F. Yaffe M.B. Sayos J. Saxena K. Morra M. Sumegi J.

These studies also identified a consensus motif recognized by the SAP SH2 domain represented by the sequence (Thr/Ser)-X-Tyr(P)-X-X-(Val/Ile), whereX denotes any amino acid. The “three-prongs” in the motif correspond to residue Thr or Ser at the N terminus, Tyr(P) in the middle, and Val or Ile at the C terminus (14Hwang P.M., Li, C. Morra M. Lillywhite J. Muhandiram D.R.

Significantly, the presence of any two (of the three) prongs in a given ligand was shown to be sufficient for its binding to SAP (14Hwang P.M., Li, C. Morra M. Lillywhite J. Muhandiram D.R.

Protein complexes analogous to the one between SAP and SLAM have also been documented between SAP and other members of the SLAM family of receptors (also called the CD2 receptor family) (3Morra M.

These receptors are expressed in various subsets of immune cells, such as T, B, and NK cells, and share a similar overall structure characterized by two extracellular Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane segment, and, with the exception of CD48 and BCM1-L, a short cytoplasmic tail (3Morra M.

Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, NK cells isolated from XLP patients exhibited defects in 2B4-mediated cytotoxicity due to the absence of an active SAP-2B4 complex (5Tangye S.G. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Nichols K.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2932-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Nakajima H. Cella M. Bouchon A. Grierson H.L. Lewis J. Duckett C.S. Cohen J.I. Colonna M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SAP plays important roles in signaling through the SLAM family of receptors and that disruption of one or more of these signaling pathways underlies the complex phenotypes of XLP (17Sayos J. Martin M. Chen A. Simarro M. Howie D. Morra M. Engel P. Terhorst C. Blood. 2001; 97: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the role of SAP as an inhibitor of SH2 domain-mediated interactions, it was recently shown by Veillette and co-workers (23Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) that SAP promotes a specific association of the T cell-specific tyrosine kinase, FynT, with SLAM in T cells. In addition, SAP-dependent interaction of FynT with SLAM was found to be critical for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SLAM and for the subsequent recruitment of downstream signaling molecules such as SHIP and p62Dok to the receptor. These findings led to the proposal that SAP functions as an adaptor molecule in SLAM signaling rather than as an inhibitor of SH2 domain interaction (23Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of SAP in signaling through the SLAM family of receptors, we systematically mapped the binding sites in these receptors for a series of SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins that include SAP and its homologue EAT-2, SHP-2, SHP-1, SHIP, and FynT, using peptide arrays synthesized on a functionalized cellulose membrane. The notion of SAP as an adaptor in SLAM signaling was explored by examining a direct physical interaction between SAP and FynT in vitro, and the functional significance of SAP-FynT interaction in SLAM phosphorylation and signaling was investigated in HEK293 cells that were made to stably express SLAM. Our results are consistent with a model in which SAP plays a dual functional role, both as an adaptor to bridge an interaction between FynT and SLAM and as an inhibitor to modulate the association of SH2 domain-containing proteins with phosphorylated SLAM. DNA sequences encoding the SH2 domains of SHIP, FynT, SHP-1, and SHP-2 were amplified by PCR, subcloned into the pGEX4T2 vector, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliand affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Bound proteins were eluted using 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Proteins were concentrated, and buffer was changed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, prior to use in binding studies. An array of undecamer peptides modeled after Tyr-containing sites in the cytoplasmic domains of the SLAM family of receptors were assembled on a derivatized cellulose membrane using Auto-Spot Robot ASP 222 (Abimed) and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase peptide chemistry. The peptide membrane was moistened sequentially with ethanol and water prior to screening using purified GST fusion proteins or GST alone. Specifically, the membrane was washed three times with TBS-T buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mmNaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.6, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T for one h at room temperature. Approximately 1.0 μm of a GST fusion protein was added directly into the blocking solution and incubated with the peptide membrane at room temperature for an additional hour. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS-T and once with TBS prior to addition of anti-GST antibodies. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cellulose sheet was washed three times with TBS and developed with the ECF Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocols and documented using a Fluor-S Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad). For reprobing, the peptide sheet was stripped by treating it sequentially with buffer A, containing 8.0 m urea, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and buffer B, containing 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 50% (v/v) ethanol, followed by several washes of deionized water. To avoid possible background artifacts resulting from incomplete stripping, binding studies for each SH2 domain were initially conducted using a fresh strip of peptide array generated under identical conditions. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient protein expression, cells were grown to 70% confluency and transfected with the expression (pMES) vectors for FynT or mutants (5 μg) by means of LipofectAMINE (15 μl) (Invitrogen). Deletion mutants of FynT were generated by two consecutive rounds of PCR, and the Y417F mutant was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. A Myc tag sequence was inserted at the C terminus of the SH2 and SH3 domain deletion mutants by PCR to facilitate their detection. Cells were generally harvested between 60–72 h post transfection and lysed in PLC buffer (50 mmHepes pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mM Na2P2O7, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μmE64, 1 μm bestatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (Sigma). For pull-down studies, aliquots of cleared HEK 293 lysate containing 50–200 μg of total proteins were mixed with 25 μg of biotin-labeled or GST-fused SAP or SAP mutants in the presence or absence of a SLAM or a control peptide. The generation and production of SAP mutants were reported previously (14Hwang P.M., Li, C. Morra M. Lillywhite J. Muhandiram D.R. Gertler F. Terhorst C. Kay L.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Li S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein complexes were pelleted using either 30 μl of streptavidin or glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed five times with PLC buffer, resuspended in 1× SDS loading buffer, and resolved on 10–15% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Western blotting membranes (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated in a blocking solution of 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times in TBS-T and probed with mouse anti-Fyn monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. A goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad) was then applied to the membrane for 40 min at room temperature before it was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) on Kodak film according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA sequence encoding human SLAM was amplified by PCR from an expressed sequence tag clone (Invitrogen), and subcloned into the pRc/CMV2 vector. The pRc/CMV2/SLAM construct was stably transfected in HEK 293 cells by LipofectAMINE followed by G418 restriction. The identity of SLAM was verified by immunoblotting using anti CD150 monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The HEK 293/SLAM cells transfected with constructs for FynT or FynT mutants and/or SAP were biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mm sodium pervanadate, and 10 mm NaF. After precleaning the lysate with preimmune serum absorbed on protein A- or G-Sepharose beads, SLAM was precipitated with anti-SLAM monoclonal antibodies (anti CD150, 4 μg per reaction; lysate containing 800 μg of total protein in 500 μl). The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred under semi-dry conditions to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed sequentially with anti-Tyr(P) mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Tech), rabbit anti-SHP2, mouse anti-SAP (a generous gift from Dr. Cox Terhorst, Harvard) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, anti-Fyn (mouse), or anti-c-Myc (mouse). Biotinylated SLAM was probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The blotted membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The cytoplasmic regions of the SLAM family of receptors contain multiple conserved Tyr phosphorylation sites that completely or partially conform to the (Thr/Ser)-X-Tyr(P)-X-X-(Val/Ile) motif recognized by the SAP SH2 domain (3Morra M.

To date, four of the SLAM family members, namely SLAM, 2B4, Ly-9, and CD84, have been shown to interact with SAP via one or more of these Tyr phosphorylation sites (5Tangye S.G. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Nichols K.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2932-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 17Sayos J. Martin M. Chen A. Simarro M. Howie D. Morra M. Engel P. Terhorst C.

To determine systematically the preferred binding sites for SAP and related proteins in these receptors, an array of undecamer peptides modeled after these sites was generated on a derivatized cellulose membrane using the SPOT method of multiple peptide synthesis (27Frank R. Doring R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar).

Curiously, cellular and lentiviral promoters differ dramatically in the requirements for positive transcriptional elongation factor (P-TEF) b activity. Lentiviral LTRs, but not cellular promoters, need an RNA-associated P-TEFb/Tat/TAR (trans-activation-responsive) RNA ternary complex. Ternary complex defective murine cycT1 is apparently inactive for lentiviral transcription. Why P-TEFb requires Tat/TAR for LTRs but not for cellular promoters remains unknown. To explore this question, we sought to determine whether DNA targeting of murine and human cyclin T1 can reconstitute a Tat/TAR-independent activity to the HIV-1 LTR. In the absence of Tat and TAR, we found that both HuCycT1 and MuCycT1 can robustly activate the HIV-1 LTR. We further showed that Sp1 is necessary and sufficient for this DNA-targeted activity. Thus, like cellular promoters, HIV-1 LTR can use P-TEFb function without a Tat/TAR RNA complex.

Our current understanding is that P-TEFb forms a ternary complex with Tat and TAR to mediate transcriptional elongation from the HIV-1 LTR. Hence, mouse cycT1, which differs from human cycT1 by a cysteine at position 261, cannot form a P-TEFb/Tat/TAR complex; this defect is presumed to explain the long-observed defect in HIV-1 transcription in rodent cells (12Wei P.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 61-70Google Scholar). In these settings, P-TEFb must engage promoter-DNA independently of TAR RNA and must promote processive transcription without Tat. Indeed, it is a mystery why the cellular-promoter operative activity of P-TEFb does not apparently apply to the HIV-1 LTR. Here, we sought to determine whether DNA targeting of murine or human cycT1 to the HIV-1 LTR can bypass a requirement for Tat/TAR. We show that both murine and human cycT1 can interact with the Sp1 “A” domain to reconstitute Tat/TAR independent transcriptional activity and that Sp1 is necessary and sufficient to recruit cycT1 to the HIV-1 LTR. These results support the finding of P-TEFb in HIV-1 preinitiation complexes before the synthesis of TAR RNA (20Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 8063-8073Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that lentiviral LTRs, like cellular promoters, can use P-TEFb despite absence of Tat/TAR. This proposition concurs with recent suggestions that successful promoter recruitment of cycT1 is fully sufficient for HIV-1 LTR transcription (23Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7791-7796Google Scholar). pCMV-HuCycT1 and pCMV-MuCycT1 (1–708) were kindly provided by Drs. David Price and Kathy Jones, respectively (11Peng J. Zhu Y.

SIVsykes and SIVmac LTR-luciferase plasmids were cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). HIV-1 linker scanning mutants were from AIDS reference reagent program donated by Dr. Steven Zeichner (26Zeichner S.L. Kim J.Y. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2436-2444Google Scholar). Cell propagation, transfection, and reporter assays were as described previously (28Kibler K.V. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2161-2173Google Scholar). All transfections were repeated three or more times and were normalized to β-galactosidase activity expressed from a cotransfected pCMV-β (Clontech). Average values ± S.D. are shown. In all experiments, we have assayed both the HuCycT1 and the equivalent MuCycT1 plasmids. Because of space limitations, only one or the other set of results is shown. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Sigma Chemical); mouse monoclonal anti-Gal4BD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1 and anti-HA antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were used as described. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (28Kibler K.V. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2161-2173Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, HeLa cells were cultured on 25-mm coverslips (Thomas Scientific) and transfected with plasmid DNA. One day later, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody followed with anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes) and examined with a Leica laser-scanning microscope. The great preponderance of HIV-related P-TEFb studies have focused on transcriptional elongation in the context of a ternary P-TEFb/Tat/TAR RNA complex (20Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Google Scholar, 24Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Google Scholar, 29Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Google Scholar). Recent findings, however, demonstrate that P-TEFb activates numerous cellular promoters in Tat/TAR independent settings (18Lis J.T. Mason P. Peng J. Price D.H. Werner J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 792-803Google Scholar, 30Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Google Scholar). Moreover, P-TEFb is in HIV-1 preinitiation complexes before the synthesis of TAR RNA (20Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Google Scholar, 31Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Google Scholar), suggesting a role distinct from its Tat/TAR RNA-bound form. Prompted by these observations, we sought to investigate the impact of P-TEFb on lentiviral LTR-expression in the absence of Tat/TAR. Human and subhuman primate lentiviral LTRs conserve biological function (32Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 188: 123-144Google Scholar) without preserving sequence identity. For example, although three or more copies of Sp1 binding motifs are found in all primate lentiviral LTRs, NF-κB-binding sites are sporadically reduced in number or absent altogether in simian immunodeficiency (SIV) viral LTRs (Fig. 1 A). Using three different primate LTRs, HIV-1 LTR (HXB2), and SIV LTRs (SIVmac and SIVsykes), we asked how each responds to trans-expression of either human cyclinT1 (HuCycT1) or murine cyclinT1 (MuCycT1). When the appropriate LTR-luciferase reporters were cotransfected into HeLa cells with either HuCycT1-alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2,5, 8) or MuCycT1-alone (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3, 6, and 9), we observed strong activation of all LTRs. Previously, the salient difference between HuCycT1 and MuCycT1 was that the latter cannot form a functional P-TEFb/Tat/TAR ternary complex (20Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Google Scholar, 24Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Google Scholar, 29Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Google Scholar). Interestingly, the current Tat-independent assays revealed equivalent activities for both cyclin T1s. Dose-dependent titrations further confirmed that MuCycT1 activates expression effectively from NF-κB-containing and NF-κB-absent LTRs (Fig. 1 C). The HIV-1 LTR contains several transcription factor binding sites, including AP-1, NFAT, NF-κB, Sp1, and TAR. Results in Fig.1 A suggest that NF-κB is not needed for cycT1-activation. To address the other motifs in the HIV-1 LTR, we employed several, otherwise isogenic, linker-scanning LTR-mutants (Fig.2 A). In parallel assays, we found that the Sp1 motifs were strictly required for cycT1 activity, whereas AP-1, NFAT, NF-κB, or TAR sequences were dispensable (Fig.2 A). Hence, although Tat-dependent activity of cycT1 requires TAR, the Tat-independent activity does not. To better understand the Sp1 requirement, we explored the possibility that Sp1 and cycT1 directly interact. We transfected HA-tagged HuCycT1 or MuCycT1 into HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated mock- (lanes 1 and 5), HuCycT1- (lanes 1, 2,6, 7), or MuCycT1- (lanes 4 and8) transfected cells with either anti-HA (lanes 1–4) or an irrelevant isotype-matched control serum (lanes 5–8). Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting for corecovery of HeLa cell-endogenous Sp1. Consistent with their similar functional activities (Fig.2 A), both human and murine CycT1 bound Sp1. Sp1 is a 95- to 105-kDa transcription factor that binds DNA through its C-terminal zinc fingers (33Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Google Scholar, 34Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that Sp1 contributes importantly to the expression of the HIV-1 LTR (35Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Google Scholar) and that its serine/threonine- and glutamine-rich “A” activation domain suffices for functional interaction with Tat (27Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2496-2507Google Scholar, 36Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Google Scholar). These observations together with above results (Fig. 2) lead us to ask whether the functional interaction between cycT1 and Sp1 is entirely circumscribed in the A domain. To address this, we transfected HeLa cells with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter (G3(−)43CAT) composed of three Gal4 binding sites positioned upstream of a TATA box with a downstream chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cDNA (Fig. 3 A). To this reporter, we separately added Gal4BD-, Gal4Sp1A-, or Gal4E1a-plasmid expressing respectively the Gal4-DNA-binding-domain, a binding-domain-Sp1A-fusion, or a binding-domain adenovirus E1a fusion. These DNA mixes were cotransfected with or without a MuCycT1 expression vector (Fig. 3 B). We found that neither Gal4BD (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 2) nor Gal4E1a (Fig.2 B, lanes 5 and 6) supported MuCycT1-activated expression over basal. By contrast Gal4Sp1A plus MuCycT1 mediated a >70-fold increase in expression (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4), consistent with the Sp1A segment being wholly sufficient for function. To confirm whether Sp1A-alone was sufficient to bind CycT1 (Fig.2 B), we checked coimmunoprecipitations of Gal4Sp1A and CycT1, cyclin H, or cyclin K (Fig. 3 C). HeLa cells were transfected with Gal4Sp1A and HA-tagged MuCyCT1 (lane 1), MuCycT1 (1–631; lane 2), Hu cyclin H (lane 3), or Hu cyclin K (lane 4). Gal4Sp1A was captured with anti-Gal4BD serum, and coassociated proteins were probed by Western blotting with anti-HA. We found that wild-type MuCycT1 (closely migrating as a doublet with a background band; lane 1), MuCycT1 (1–631; lane 2), and cyclin K (lane 4) bound Sp1A. Cyclin H (lane 3) did not. These results agree with cyclin K providing transcriptional roles partially redundant with cyclin T1 (30Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Google Scholar, 37Lin X. Taube R. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16873-16878Google Scholar) and cyclin H serving functions distinct from cyclin T1 (38Chen D. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2863-2871Google Scholar). Human cyclin T1 is a 726-amino acid protein. Its N-terminal 1–290 amino acids contain a “cyclin homology box.” This “box” binds cdk9 (39Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Nee E. Guo J. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 41-56Google Scholar, 40Fraldi A. Licciardo P. Majello B. Giordano A. Lania L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 247-253Google Scholar, 41Majello B. Napolitano G. Giordano A. Lania L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4598-4605Google Scholar) and mediates physical interaction with HIV-1 Tat. Indeed, a single cysteine at position 261 of HuCycT1 is critical for forming a human P-TEFb/Tat/TAR complex (12Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Google Scholar, 17Bieniasz P.D. Grdina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Google Scholar). Above, our results indicate a cycT1-Sp1 activity distinct from that of P-TEFb/Tat/TAR. We next examined whether the former uses a region of cycT1 different from that of the latter. We generated several HA-tagged HuCycT1 and MuCycT1 deletion mutants (Fig. 4). Each was challenged in expression assays with cotransfected Gal4BD or Gal4Sp1A (Fig. 4). All deletion mutants expressed comparably in HeLa cells (Fig.4 B), but not all supported activated expression. Thus, HuCycT1-wild type, HuCycT1 (1–633), HuCycT1 (240–726), and HuCycT1 (300–726) produced high (≥30-fold increase) activity; HuCycT1 (419–726) and HuCycT1 (500–726) provided moderate (7–10-fold increase) activity; and HuCycT1 (1–444) and HuCycT1 (1–426) were inactive (Fig. 4 A). From the results, we mapped a Sp1A cooperative domain to the C-terminal 300 amino acids of cycT1. This C-terminal region contrasts with its N-terminal cyclin homology box, which serves cdk9-binding and P-TEFb/Tat/TAR function (24Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Google Scholar, 39Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Nee E. Guo J. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 41-56Google Scholar). To verify that the C-terminal region of cycT1 is discretely sufficient for transcription, we fused a sub-portion, amino acids 419 to 726, to Gal4BD. Gal4HuCycT1 (419–726) when targeted to promoter upstream Gal4-binding sites was sufficient for activating promoter expression (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, in parallel assays, Gal4HuCycT1 (1–444) and Gal4HuCycT1 (1–426), previously shown by others to be competent for cdk9-binding and transcriptional elongation when bound to Tat/TAR RNA, were inactive when targeted to DNA via Gal4-binding sites (Fig. 5, left). Because all Gal4HuCycT1 chimeras were expressed comparably (Fig. 5,right), one interpretation of these results is that simple recruitment of cdk9 insufficiently supports transcription from the HIV-1 promoter. Fig. 4defined forms of HuCycT1 that are highly active, moderately active, and inactive for cooperation with Sp1A. Previously, transcriptionally intact full-length HuCycT1 was found in nuclear dots/speckles (42Marcello A. Cinelli R.A. Ferrari A. Signorelli A. Tyagi M. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39220-39225Google Scholar). To check how Sp1A-competent forms of HuCycT1 might behave, we visualized using confocal microscopy to identify the subcellular location of seven HA-tagged mutants. Intriguingly, both highly active, (HuCycT1 (1–726), HuCycT1 (1–633), HuCycT1(240–726, not shown), and HuCycT1 (300–726)) and moderately active (HuCycT1 (419–726) and HuCycT1 (500–726)) cyclin T1s stained identically in nuclear speckles (Fig.6). On the other hand, Sp1A-inactive HuCycT1 (1–444) and HuCycT1 (1–419), shown elsewhere to support P-TEFb/Tat/TAR function (24Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Google Scholar, 39Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Nee E. Guo J. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 41-56Google Scholar), were not in speckles and stained predominantly cytoplasmic. To the extent that nuclear speckling might be a requisite for transcriptional activity, the divergent patterns suggest that Sp1A-active portion of cycT1 dictates such physical localization. HIV-1 expression occurs in two phases. After integration of the provirus into cellular chromosome, basal transcription from the LTR must initially drive the synthesis, however inefficiently, of a small amount of full-length 9.6-kb mRNA that provides for the synthesis of Tat. Tat then activates the LTR through TAR RNA (2Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Google Scholar) to further increase processive transcription. Over the past few years, P-TEFb (reviewed in Ref. 43Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar) has emerged as an important cofactor for Tat/TAR-activated phase of LTR transcription. Thus, we understand the P-TEFb/Tat/TAR ternary complex modulates transcriptional elongation by hyperphosphorylation of RNAP II CTD (12Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Google Scholar, 14Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Google Scholar). Interestingly, although P-TEFb is present in elongation complexes, before the synthesis of TAR RNA, it is also found in HIV-1 LTR-engaged preinitiation complexes (20Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7399-7404Google Scholar). Currently, despite much learned about Tat/TAR interactions with elongation-associated P-TEFb, little is known regarding how P-TEFb enters preinitiation complexes and the role that it might play in such moieties. Here, we present evidence that P-TEFb may be recruited into preinitiation complexes through physical association of its cycT1 subunit with DNA-bound Sp1. Sp1 is a glutamine-rich promoter-proximal activator that interacts with TFIID to stabilize preinitiation complexes (44Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Google Scholar). We found that the 179-amino acid Sp1A domain that contains its glutamine-rich sequence is sufficient for physical (Fig.3 C) and functional (Figs. 3 B and 4 A) interaction with cycT1. Surprisingly, the portion of cycT1 delineated to cooperate with Sp1A mapped to a short, ∼419–633-amino acid C-terminal stretch (Figs. 4 A and 6). This Sp1A-active region resides outside of the cycT1 cyclin homology box (i.e. amino acids 1–290) and associates with neither cdk9 nor Tat. Thus, unlike TAR RNA-bound P-TEFb, DNA-bound cycT1-Sp1A activity apparently does not use cdk9. Although provocative, this unexpected conclusion is consistent, in part, with findings that Sp1-driven transcription can occur through a CTD-kinase independent mechanism (45Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Google Scholar, 46Chun R.F. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27888-27894Google Scholar) and with evidence that productive and processive transcriptional elongation from the HIV-1 LTR can proceed without cdk9 (47West M.J. Karn J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1378-1386Google Scholar). Currently, we do not rule out that in the absence of cdk9, other kinases such as CDK2 (48Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar) may be involved. It has been suggested elsewhere that cycT1 might be recruited to the HIV-1 preinitiation complexes through binding to NF-κB and contact with RNAP II CTD (49Barboric M. Nissen R.M. Kanazawa S. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 327-337Google Scholar, 50Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 321-331Google Scholar). Although we have not directly examined interactions between NF-κB and cycT1, several observations seemingly disfavor this interpretation. First, the natural phylogeny of primate lentiviral LTRs is such that many simian LTRs have either single or no NF-κB binding sites (Fig. 1 A). Thus, recruitment of cycT1 by NF-κB cannot be a generally conserved mechanism for all primate lentiviruses. Second, our linker-scanning analyses (Fig. 2 A) showed that Sp1 is required, whereas NF-κB is not, for DNA-targeted cycT1 activity. Other studies (40Fraldi A. Licciardo P. Majello B. Giordano A. Lania L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 247-253Google Scholar, 51Napolitano G. Majello B. Licciardo P. Giordano A. Lania L. Gene. 2000; 254: 139-145Google Scholar) have also independently suggested this Sp1-requirement. Hence, although we do not exclude that NF-κB might recruit cycT1 to HIV-1 DNA, our current results show that NF-κB is unnecessary, whereas Sp1 is necessary and sufficient. Intriguingly, in the two studies that proposed NF-κB recruitment of cycT1, presence of Sp1-binding sites in the reporter constructs were required for such activity (49Barboric M. Nissen R.M. Kanazawa S. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 327-337Google Scholar, 50Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 321-331Google Scholar). Because NF-κB binds the N-terminal cyclin homology domain of cycT1 (49Barboric M. Nissen R.M. Kanazawa S. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 327-337Google Scholar) and Sp1 binds the C terminus of cycT1, it is possible, however, that in the natural context of the HIV-1 LTR, both factors cooperate in high affinity capture of cycT1. DNA-tethered cycT1 may then subsequently contact RNAP II CTD directly (50Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 321-331Google Scholar). In addition to binding Sp1, the C terminus of cycT1 has another important activity. It is well known that transcription factors and actively transcribing RNAP II physically localize into nuclear foci with speckled patterns (52Wansink D.G. Schul W. van I.D.K. van Steensel B. van Driel R. de Jong L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 283-293Google Scholar, 53Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1143-1150Google Scholar). Accordingly, a prerequisite for P-TEFb-activity is its entry into nuclear speckles (42Marcello A. Cinelli R.A. Ferrari A. Signorelli A. Tyagi M. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39220-39225Google Scholar, 54Herrmann C.H. Mancini M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1491-1503Google Scholar). A priori, one might suppose that P-TEFb is directed to such a locale through the N-terminal Tat/TAR associative domain of its cycT1 component. Surprisingly, our data show that the Sp1A-interactive C terminus (500–726 amino acids) of cycT1 dictates its localization into nuclear dots (Fig. 6). The N terminus (e.g. 1–444 amino acids) of cycT1, which binds cdk9, has no such function (Fig. 6). Hence, the first step of P-TEFb function, its constitutive (or Sp1-associated) migration to nuclear speckles, seems to be determined through its C terminus. DNA recruitment of cycT1 by Sp1 serves also to address the long-standing observation that Tat function and HIV-1 transcription are apparently defective in rodent cells (29Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Google Scholar, 55Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two recent studies have unexpectedly shown that HIV-1 is both transcriptionally intact and replication competent in rat cells (21Reid W. Sadowska M. Denaro F. Rao S. Foulke Jr., J. Hayes N. Jones O.

How then can HIV-1 transcription occur successfully in rat cells? Although we have not examined rat cycT1 directly, we find in human cells that MuCycT1 and HuCycT1 are equally active in their Sp1-dependent activity. Thus, DNA-targeted cycT1 does not need cysteine 261 for LTR expression. Intriguingly in rat cells, we have observed that Tat-independent activity of MuCycT1 is actually considerably higher than that of HuCycT1. 2V. S. R. K. Yedavalli, unpublished observations. Conceivably, a rat-specific cell factor may enhance DNA-based Sp1-cycT1 interaction to sufficiently bypass the need for RNA-tethered P-TEFb/Tat/TAR. Indeed active P-TEFb at cellular promoters functions effectively without Tat or TAR (43Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar).

The structural properties of DNA and specific DNA/protein interactions are crucial for the regulation of fundamental cellular processes such as recombination, replication, and chromosome organization. In prokaryotes, several small DNA binding proteins regulate these processes by local changes in DNA conformation, through the formation of specific nucleoprotein complexes. In Escherichia coli, these small DNA binding proteins include the CRP, IHF, Fis, H-NS, Dps, Lrp, and HU proteins (1Azam T.A. Ishihama A. J. Biol.

Moreover, HU binding to promoter regions modulates the binding of other transcriptional regulators like CRP (5Flashner Y. Gralla J.D.

Change of DNA conformation by protein/DNA interaction, however, is not limited to prokaryotic species.

It encodes a neutral 16.4-kDa protein, LrpC, that forms tetramers in solution. Based on amino acid sequence identity, it has been assigned to the Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulators, which in B. subtilisincludes seven Lrp/AsnC-like proteins (12Belitsky B.R.

The N-terminal region of LrpC is predicted to form a typical helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain, characteristic of numerous transcriptional regulators (15Brennan R.G. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1903-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that the lrpC gene is autoregulated (16Beloin C. Exley R. Mahe A.L. Zouine M. Cubasch S. Le Hégarat F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4414-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, phenotypic analysis of alrpC mutant in B. subtilis has revealed a possible role of LrpC in branched chain amino-acid metabolism, sporulation, and long-term adaptation to stress (16Beloin C. Exley R. Mahe A.L. Zouine M. Cubasch S. Le Hégarat F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4414-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).To analyze in detail the interactions of LrpC with DNA, the experiments presented here combine electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EM, electron microscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EM, electron microscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy electron microscopy (EM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), using the lrpCpromoter DNA, and curved DNA fragments. These studies show that LrpC possesses unusual DNA architectural properties not previously assigned to Lrp-like proteins or other general DNA-structuring proteins and that DNA curvature and DNA topology (i.e. supra-architecture) control the order of events in protein/DNA complex formation.DISCUSSIONWe previously identified LrpC as the seventh member of the Lrp/AsnC family of proteins in B. subtilis, and we have shown that LrpC positively autoregulates its own gene. In this study, we have analyzed in detail the interactions of LrpC with DNA, with respect to DNA conformation, curvature, and topology, using EMSA, EM, and AFM. We showed that LrpC progresses unspecifically along DNA, preferentially recognizes a specific type of DNA curvature, and wraps DNA in a right-handed superhelix to form looped structures. In addition, we propose that its oligomerization on DNA is not random but is orientated by DNA conformation, mainly its bendability and its topological state. Moreover, LrpC is an unusual bacterial DNA architectural protein because of its capacity to constrain positive supercoiling. We propose a model for dynamic interactions between LrpC and DNA.An Octameric Model for LrpC/DNA InteractionsWe have provided evidence that LrpC wraps DNA and forms stable complexes resembling nucleosomes with various DNA fragments, including thelrpC promoter region, where its binding coincides with theP1 promoter. Formation of stable complexes between LrpC and DNA results from protein-protein assembly. DNA flexibility or intrinsic curvature favors protein-protein interactions within one DNA fragment to form a stable protein core. This results in a progressive bending of the DNA that leads to loop formation through a complete wrapping of the DNA around the protein (Fig. 8 B). LrpC could interact with DNA through its N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and oligomerize through its C-terminal domain (Fig. 8 A). The radius of curvature measured in the LrpC/DNA complexes correlates perfectly with the sizes of the octameric model presented for the recently crystallized LrpA protein of Pyrococcus furiosus, in which the four dimerized N-terminal DNA binding domains are diametrically opposed (25Leonard P.M. Smits S.H. Sedelnikova S.E. Brinkman A.B. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, as with LrpA, LrpC has been shown to form dimers and multimers of dimers, mainly tetramers in solution (Ref. 19Tapias A. Lopez G. Ayora S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; data not shown).DNA Conformation and Formation of Stable LrpC/DNA ComplexesDNA bendability determines the path of the double helix axis and contributes to the thermodynamic stabilization of the DNA/protein complexes. DNA bendability results from an increased local flexibility (26Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and/or from a static intrinsic curvature, such as kinks or smooth continuous curvature, with either planar or torsional bending (27Trifonov E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 467-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Travers A. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 327: 280-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that among different types of curvature, LrpC forms stable complexes with curved regions containing phased A tracts in pBR322 (C7 and C8; Fig. 5); in the lrpCpromoter region (between the −35 box of P1 and the ATG, Fig. 2 B); and in synthetic curved DNA molecules (data not shown). These A tract motifs are related to the junction model, in which the deflection of the helix axis is localized at junctions between B′ form structure of A tracts and B form (29Nadeau J.G. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2622-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all regions stably bound by LrpC contained phased A tracts preceded by a C (i.e. C(A)n motifs). In contrast, LrpC does not form any complexes with the pBR322 curved C4–C6 region (Fig. 5) or with the highly curved region located upstream of the −35 box of theP1 lrpC promoter (Fig. 2 B; Ref. 16Beloin C. Exley R. Mahe A.L. Zouine M. Cubasch S. Le Hégarat F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4414-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In these fragments, curvature is more related to the wedge model, which attributes small deflections of the helix axis at every base-pair step, with a predominant contribution of the AA dinucleotide (30Bolshoy A. McNamara P. Harrington R.E. Trifonov E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Although junction and wedge models are comparable in their general predictions of DNA curvature for fragments, including phased A tracts, they differ for curved fragments without A tract motifs. Moreover, the wedge model does not take into account cooperativity effects in the stacking of AT base pairs within A tracts (31Haran T.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results clearly show that LrpC discriminates between different types of curvature to form stable complexes within C(A)nphased motifs.DNA Topology and LrpC/DNA InteractionsWe have shown that LrpC/DNA complex formation is influenced by DNA topology and, moreover, that LrpC constrains positive supercoiling. We propose that the formation of a first complex in supercoiled molecules is promoted by one curved region localized at one of the apices, as observed previously for the transcription activator NR1 (32Révet B. Brahms S. Brahms G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7535-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the Tth 111 glutamine synthetase (33Mary J. Révet B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 and 8 D,1). Because LrpC induces the formation of a positively supercoiled loop, a new negatively supercoiled loop is then created in the vicinity of the first complex to maintain a constant linking number. The formation of a second complex is favored by cooperative effects, which promote LrpC recruitment to the flanking DNA regions (Fig. 8 D, 2). This will induce the formation of a new positive supercoil and subsequently of a compensatory negative supercoil that will be again targeted by an LrpC oligomer (Fig. 8 D, 3). This model explains the formation of successive wrappings in a very close proximity by an invasive mechanism, which induces partition of topological domains between LrpC-restrained positive supercoils and free negative ones (Fig. 8 D, 4). To our knowledge, we present the first visualization of such a partition in negative and positive supercoiled domains within a single DNA molecule and therefore demonstrate that positive supercoiling mediated by LrpC is caused by a right-handed DNA wrapping (Fig. 7, b and c). The presence of a right-handed DNA superhelix wrapped around a protein core in a negatively supercoiled environment represents a new topological paradox that could be explained by the following considerations.The affinity of LrpC for DNA increases with supercoiling, either positive or negative, because supercoiling favors loop formation. Whatever their chirality, these loops promote protein/protein assembly, and the stabilization of the complexes leads to the formation of a right-handed DNA helix. Such DNA transition triggered by LrpC should require minimal energy, as shown for interaction of (H3-H4)2 tetramer with supercoiled DNA (34Hamiche A. Carot V. Alilat M. De Lucia F. O'Donohue M.F. Révet B. Prunell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7588-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Such a topological partition in the plasmid induces an accumulation of negative topological constraints in the free DNA, which reduces its flexibility. Consequently, right-handed DNA wrapping around the LrpC protein core is no longer favored, and an alternative mode of protein-protein interaction is adopted; any additional LrpC protein polymerizes along the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA (Figs. 7 and8).This bimodal assembly of LrpC within nucleoprotein complexes is related to two types of DNA condensation, determined by the topological state of DNA. The first one results from successive DNA wrappings mainly observed with linear fragments and in regions of negatively supercoiled DNA (Figs. 1, 2, and 7). The second one results from polymerization of LrpC along DNA and bridging of DNA segments within a circular plasmid to finally induce its folding. This could be observed with open circular plasmids (data not shown) or with slightly positive supercoiled plasmids, where right-handed DNA wrapping by LrpC led to a relaxation of the free DNA (Fig. 7), followed by additional polymerization of the protein along DNA. The same type of interactions (i.e. polymerization and bridging) is observed with “straight” uncurved DNA (data not shown; Fig. 8 C).LrpC, an Unusual DNA Architecture ProteinThe capacities of LrpC to drastically modify DNA structure by DNA bending and wrapping, and the fact that it probably uses these properties to modulate the geometry of promoters, confirms that LrpC belongs to the DNA architectural protein family. However, it seems that LrpC possesses unusual properties among eubacterial DNA structuring proteins, including the Lrp-like family. Whereas E. coli Lrp has been proposed to wrap DNA (35Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), LrpC, along with the Smj12 protein fromSulfolobus solfataricus (which also overwinds DNA) and the PutR protein from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, are the only members of the Lrp-like family for which DNA wrapping has been firmly demonstrated (36Jafri S.

A. 1991; 88: 10397-10401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Looped structures formed by LrpC where 80 bp of DNA is wrapped resemble eukaryotic dimers of (H3-H4) and archaeal HMf or HTz tetrasomes (Fig. 2; 38, 39). Eukaryotic dimers of (H3-H4) (35Wang Q. Calvo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and HMf tetramers (40Musgrave D. Forterre P. Slesarev A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) are able, under certain conditions, to constrain positive supercoils, as observed for LrpC. Other proteins that activate transcription, such as the eukaryotic transcription factors UBF or SWI/SNF or the B. subtilis PurR regulator, are known to bind upstream of the promoters they regulate and to introduce one positive supercoil (41Putnam C.D. Copenhaver G.P. Denton M.L. Pikaard C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6476-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 42Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L.

Trifonov E.N. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1999; 16: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the capacity of LrpC to induce right-handed supercoiling is involved in its regulatory activity. In addition, like the HMf proteins, eukaryotic histones and the high mobility group proteins, LrpC highly compacts DNA. Such ability has not been described thus far for other members of the Lrp-like family. This work shows that the B. subtilisLrpC protein displays a mosaic of properties present in archaeal and eukaryotic histones, Lrp-like proteins, transcription factors, and eubacterial DNA-structuring proteins. Consequently, LrpC is a unique member of the DNA architectural family of proteins.A fascinating hypothesis is that micro-organisms have developed a DNA overwinding activity to compensate for the DNA underwinding activity displayed by more common nucleoid-associated proteins such as H-NS, HU, IHF, or Fis. The LrpC protein could be a prototypical member of a new family of proteins that overwinds DNA and, together with topoisomerases, modulates the global supercoiling density or, more likely, the local DNA topology during certain DNA transactions. Indeed, at 10 to 80 tetramers per cell, LrpC is not particularly abundant in the cell under normal growth conditions (16Beloin C. Exley R. Mahe A.L. Zouine M. Cubasch S. Le Hégarat F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4414-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); this could limit its role as global chromosome organizer and suggests a role in sensing locally DNA architecture. In light of what we have learned concerning LrpC, it would be interesting to evaluate the DNA binding and DNA structuring properties of the six other B. subtilis Lrp/AsnC proteins to gain a fuller appreciation of the role for this family in bacterial physiology. The structural properties of DNA and specific DNA/protein interactions are crucial for the regulation of fundamental cellular processes such as recombination, replication, and chromosome organization. In prokaryotes, several small DNA binding proteins regulate these processes by local changes in DNA conformation, through the formation of specific nucleoprotein complexes.

We propose a model for dynamic interactions between LrpC and DNA.An Octameric Model for LrpC/DNA InteractionsWe have provided evidence that LrpC wraps DNA and forms stable complexes resembling nucleosomes with various DNA fragments, including thelrpC promoter region, where its binding coincides with theP1 promoter. Formation of stable complexes between LrpC and DNA results from protein-protein assembly. DNA flexibility or intrinsic curvature favors protein-protein interactions within one DNA fragment to form a stable protein core. This results in a progressive bending of the DNA that leads to loop formation through a complete wrapping of the DNA around the protein (Fig. 8 B). LrpC could interact with DNA through its N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and oligomerize through its C-terminal domain (Fig. 8 A). The radius of curvature measured in the LrpC/DNA complexes correlates perfectly with the sizes of the octameric model presented for the recently crystallized LrpA protein of Pyrococcus furiosus, in which the four dimerized N-terminal DNA binding domains are diametrically opposed (25Leonard P.M. Smits S.H. Sedelnikova S.E. Brinkman A.B. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, as with LrpA, LrpC has been shown to form dimers and multimers of dimers, mainly tetramers in solution (Ref. 19Tapias A. Lopez G. Ayora S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; data not shown).DNA Conformation and Formation of Stable LrpC/DNA ComplexesDNA bendability determines the path of the double helix axis and contributes to the thermodynamic stabilization of the DNA/protein complexes. DNA bendability results from an increased local flexibility (26Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and/or from a static intrinsic curvature, such as kinks or smooth continuous curvature, with either planar or torsional bending (27Trifonov E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 467-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Travers A. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 327: 280-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that among different types of curvature, LrpC forms stable complexes with curved regions containing phased A tracts in pBR322 (C7 and C8; Fig. 5); in the lrpCpromoter region (between the −35 box of P1 and the ATG, Fig. 2 B); and in synthetic curved DNA molecules (data not shown). These A tract motifs are related to the junction model, in which the deflection of the helix axis is localized at junctions between B′ form structure of A tracts and B form (29Nadeau J.G. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2622-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all regions stably bound by LrpC contained phased A tracts preceded by a C (i.e. C(A)n motifs). In contrast, LrpC does not form any complexes with the pBR322 curved C4–C6 region (Fig. 5) or with the highly curved region located upstream of the −35 box of theP1 lrpC promoter (Fig. 2 B; Ref. 16Beloin C. Exley R. Mahe A.L. Zouine M. Cubasch S. Le Hégarat F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4414-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In these fragments, curvature is more related to the wedge model, which attributes small deflections of the helix axis at every base-pair step, with a predominant contribution of the AA dinucleotide (30Bolshoy A. McNamara P. Harrington R.E. Trifonov E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Although junction and wedge models are comparable in their general predictions of DNA curvature for fragments, including phased A tracts, they differ for curved fragments without A tract motifs. Moreover, the wedge model does not take into account cooperativity effects in the stacking of AT base pairs within A tracts (31Haran T.E. Kahn J.D. Crothers D.M."

In the present study, the effects of DNA uracilation on (−) strand DNA synthesis, RNase H activity, and (+) strand DNA synthesis were investigated in a cell-free system. This system uses the activities of purified human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase to convert single-stranded RNA to double-stranded DNA in a single reaction mixture. Substitution of dUTP for dTTP had no effect on (−) strand synthesis but significantly decreased yields of (+) strand DNA. Mapping of nascent (+) strand 5′ ends revealed that this was due to decreased initiation from polypurine tracts with a concomitant increase in initiation at non-polypurine tract sites. Aberrant initiation correlated with a change in RNase H cleavage specificity when assayed on preformed RNA-DNA duplexes containing uracilated DNA, suggesting that appropriate “selection” of the (+) strand primer is affected.

Viral reverse transcriptase (RT), a DNA polymerase that uses RNA and DNA templates, converts the viral RNA to double-stranded DNA after host cell infection (Fig.1). This DNA is then integrated into a host cell chromosome, where it serves as a template for synthesis of new viral RNA. Full-length viral RNA and some viral gene products are subsequently packaged into progeny virions (reviewed in Refs. 1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar and2Coffin J. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Strauss S.E. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, New York1996: 1767-1847Google Scholar) In HIV-1, both minus (−) and plus (+) strand DNA synthesis initiate from RNA primers (Fig. 1). The former requires a cellular tRNA annealed near the 5′ end of the genomic RNA (Fig. 1, step 1), whereas primers for the latter are generated by specific RNase H-mediated cleavage of viral RNA (indicated in Fig. 1 with scissors). Following (−) strand DNA synthesis, selective degradation of viral RNA primers leaves short (+) strand RNA fragments annealed to the (−) strand DNA (3Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar). One of these fragments, a highly conserved, purine-rich sequence referred to as the 3′ polypurine tract (3′-PPT), is located near the 3′ end of the genome and is used as an obligatory primer for (+) strand synthesis in all retroviruses (Fig. 1, step 4). Precise cleavage at (Fig. 1, black scissors) and initiation from the 3′-PPT is required to define the 5′ end of the “left” long terminal repeat and maintain the viral integrase (IN) attachment site (att; (2Coffin J.

Lippincott-Raven Publishers, New York1996: 1767-1847Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1, gray oval). A second copy of the PPT is located near the center of the genome (cPPT) and is also used to prime (+) strand DNA synthesis in HIV-1 and other lentiviruses (4Hungnes O. Tjotta E. Grinde B. Virology. 1992; 190: 440-442Google Scholar, 5Harris J.D. Scott J.V. Traynor B. Brahic M. Stowring L. Ventura P. Haase A.T. Peluso R. Virology. 1981; 113: 573-583Google Scholar, 6Charneau P. Clavel F.

However, in some non-primate lentiviruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), the pol gene also encodes a dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) (8Elder J.H. Lerner D.L. Hasselkus-Light C.S. Fontenot D.J. Hunter E. Luciw P.A. Montelaro R.C. Phillips T.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1791-1794Google Scholar). This enzyme hydrolyzes dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate and thus provides dUMP as a precursor for de novo synthesis of dTTP in host cells (9Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Second Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). dUTPase also ensures that the dUTP/dTTP ratio is low to minimize uracil incorporation into DNA (9Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Second Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that retroviruses encoding defective dUTPase exhibit delayed replication kinetics in macrophages (10Steagall W.K. Robek M.D. Perry S.T. Fuller F.J. Payne S.L. Virology. 1995; 210: 302-313Google Scholar, 11Threadgill D.S. Steagall W.K. Flaherty M.T. Fuller F.J. Perry S.T. Rushlow K.E. Le Grice S.F. Payne S.L. J.

A. 1995; 92: 7480-7484Google Scholar). Delayed replication in macrophages resulted from a block in the replication cycle at one or more steps after viral DNA synthesis (10Steagall W.K. Robek M.D. Perry S.T. Fuller F.J. Payne S.L. Virology. 1995; 210: 302-313Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that dUTPase functions primarily to increase replication efficiency and fidelity. It was further speculated the absence of dUTPase in some retroviruses may contribute to genetic diversity (15Lerner D.L. Wagaman P.C. Phillips T.R. Prospero-Garcia O. Henriksen S.J. Fox H.S. Bloom F.E. Elder J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7480-7484Google Scholar). Interestingly, although primate lentiviruses lack dUTPase, they recruit and package cellular uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) in the virion through a Vpr- or IN-dependent mechanism (16Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Google Scholar, 17Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Google Scholar). UDG removes uracil bases from DNA as part of the base excision repair pathway (9Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Second Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Although UDG and dUTPase are mechanistically different enzymes, they both function to exclude uracil from DNA strands. This further suggests that uracil accumulation in retroviral DNA is detrimental to some critical step or steps in the viral life cycle. In this work, the effects of uracilated DNA on (−) strand DNA synthesis, RNase H activity, and (+) strand DNA synthesis initiation were evaluated in a cell-free system. This system uses purified RT and its associated RNase H to convert regions of single-strand RNA to double-strand DNA in a single incubation (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar). In dUTP-containing reactions, DNA synthesis catalyzed by HIV-1 RT proceeded normally, but the creation and extension of PPT primers were significantly compromised. Failure to correctly “select” and extend the PPT primers was largely explained by additional experiments in which the effects of uracil on RNase H cleavage specificity were evaluated. The results showed that cleavage specificity is altered by the presence of uracil in the DNA strand of a PPT-containing RNA-DNA hybrid. A model is proposed to explain why retroviruses have mechanisms to avoid uracil incorporation into viral DNA. The following reagents were from AmershamBiosciences: Hybond N+ nylon membrane, Sephadex G-50, RNaseT1, RNaseU2, Ultrapure dNTPs, [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol), Redivue sequencing terminator mix [α-33P]ddNTPs (1500 Ci/mmol), and thermosequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit. T7 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription kits, rNTPs, RNasin, and pGEM-3Zf(+) were from Promega. T4 polynucleotide kinase and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Quick Spin Sephadex G-25 columns were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Plasmids pHIV-pol and pHIV-nef and oligonucleotide 9091 were described previously (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X.

Oligonucleotide FIV 9133 is complementary to nucleotides (nt) 9133–9152 of the FIV molecular clone 34TF10 (20Talbott R.L. Sparger E.E. Lovelace K.M. Fitch W.M. Pedersen N.C. Luciw P.A. Elder J.H.

Recombinant wild-type and RNase H-minus (D443N) HIV-1 RTs were prepared according to published procedures (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar, 19Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar) and were >95% homogeneous as determined from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The wild-type RT had a specific activity of 2.8 units/μg on poly(rC)·oligo(dG) (units defined in Ref. 19Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar) and was ∼33% active as determined by titration with a synthetic U5 long terminal repeat DNA·DNA primer·template (21Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Google Scholar,22Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 132-143Google Scholar). FIV RT (1 unit/μl) was purified from the Petaluma virus strain using the procedure and unit definition of North et al.(23North T.W. Cronn R.C. Remington K.M. Tandberg R.T. Judd R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5121-5128Google Scholar). All RT preparations were stored in multiple aliquots at −70 °C. Shortly before conducting experiments, their activities were reassessed in dilution and time course assays on each of the substrates described below. RT concentrations and incubation times were chosen that spanned the linear range of product formation in each experiment. Thus, all experiments were conducted under “steady-state” conditions of synthesis in which the products assayed arose in direct proportion to RT concentration and time. pFIV-PPT was created by subcloning a NheI/SpeI fragment of p34TF10 (nt 8287–9229) into the XbaI site of pGEM-3Zf(+). FIV 3′-PPT RNA (1 kb) was generated by in vitro transcription ofHindIII-linearized pFIV-PPT as recommended by Promega. HIV-1nef RNA (1.5 kb), containing the 3′-PPT, was described previously (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar). The 73-nt HIV-1 3′-PPT and 61-nt cPPT RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription of PCR products. The 5′ and 3′ primers for the cPPT PCR product were complementary to nt 4772–4789 and 4807–4826, respectively (based on NL4–3 HIV-1 sequence). The 5′ and 3′ primers for the 3′-PPT PCR product were complementary to nt 9042–9059 and 9091–9110, respectively. PCR conditions and product purification were as described (24Klarmann G.J. Smith R.A. Schinazi R.F. North T.W. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 359-366Google Scholar), except the annealing temperature was 55 °C. The PCR primers added a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGA-3′) to the 5′ end of each product amplified from pHIV-pol or pHIV-nef. In some cases, the 73-nt 3′-PPT and 61-nt cPPT RNAs were precipitated with ethanol and 10 mmMgCl2 (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described (26Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Google Scholar), and free nt were removed by G-25 spin columns. In all cases, RNAs were purified by 7 m urea/8% PAGE and eluted by the crush and soak method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Annealing and extension steps for processivity reactions were performed as described (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar, 19Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar). See the figure legends for details. The assay for (+) strand synthesis initiation is described in detail elsewhere (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar). Reaction products were treated with 0.3 n NaOH, neutralized and passed through Sephadex G-50 spin columns (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar), or treated with 45 mm EDTA followed by G-50 spin columns. Products were resolved by 7 m urea/8% PAGE and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes. Nascent (+) strand DNAs are visualized by PhosphorImager analysis after hybridization to a radioactively labeled (+) strand specific probe. The probe was the same oligonucleotide used as primer for initial (−) strand synthesis. Thus, the probe will only detect (+) strand DNAs that have been extended by RT to the 5′ end of the (−) strand DNA initiated from the same primer-probe sequence. Plus strand DNA 5′ ends are identified by their electrophoretic mobility relative to a sequencing ladder created with the same primer. See the figure legends for specific conditions. 5′-end-labeled (+) strand RNA (40 nm) was hybridized to a 35-mer (−) strand DNA oligonucleotide (400 nm) in 100 mmKCl and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 65 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 15 min, 25 °C for 15 min, and 4 °C for 15 min. RNA-DNA duplexes were diluted 5-fold and incubated at 37 °C with 0.7 units of HIV-1 RT/ml in 10-μl reactions containing 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0 or 100 μm each of dNTP, RNasin (1 unit/μl), and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were halted by the addition of an equal volume of 90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. Samples were loaded on prerun 7 m urea/8% polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized by PhosphorImager. RNA sequencing ladders were generated with RNaseT1 and RNaseU2 or alkaline hydrolysis according to a protocol kindly provided by AmershamBiosciences. To determine how dUMP incorporation affects reverse transcription, (−) strand DNA synthesis reactions were examined in a cell-free system (Fig.2, step 1). A 1.5-kb RNA derived from the 3′ end of the HIV-1 genome was hybridized to a [5′-32P]-labeled 20-mer DNA primer and incubated for varying lengths of time with a fixed amount of purified, recombinant HIV-1 RT (Fig. 3). Two different reaction sets were performed: one containing all four normal dNTPs (Fig. 3, labeled dTTP) and a second set in which dUTP was substituted for dTTP (Fig. 3, labeled dUTP). Synthesis of (−) stand DNA was performed with an excess of primer-template relative to HIV-1 RT to ensure steady-state synthesis and facilitate comparison with previous work (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar, 19Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar).Figure 3Effect of dUTP on (−) strand DNA synthesis. Single-strand RNA transcribed from pHIV-nefwas hybridized to [5′-32P]-labeled 20-mer primer 9091 as described (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar). This primer-template (11 nm) was incubated with HIV-1 RT (1.6 units/ml) for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, or 60 min (lanes 1–8, respectively) at 37 °C. Reaction products were then separated by urea-PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager. The reaction set labeled dTTP contained 100 μmeach of dCTP, dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. The reaction set labeleddUTP contained 100 μm each of dCTP, dATP, dGTP, and dUTP. The number of nucleotides incorporated and the location of the HIV-1 3′-PPT are indicated in the margins. Thefilled circle between the two reaction sets marks a synthesis pause site that decreased in intensity in the dUTP reaction set.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Resolution of primer extension products by sequencing gels revealed that primer extension terminated at distinct sites called “pause sites,” where RT frequently dissociates from the primer-template (19Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar). The pausing pattern in each reaction set remained essentially unchanged as the incubation time increased, and total extension products increased linearly with time up to about 15 min (Fig. 3). Thus, RT and unextended primer-template are in the steady state for ∼15 min, and the products result from multiple turnovers initiated at the excess of primer-template. The HIV-1 RT pause pattern was largely unaffected by dUMP incorporation with the exception of a single site where pausing was significantly reduced ∼90 nt from the primer terminus (indicated by the filled circle). In addition, the steady-state rates of primer extension (1–3 nt/sec) were comparable in the dTTP and dUTP reaction sets. Similar results were obtained with FIV RT (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that dUMP is incorporated efficiently in place of dTMP by HIV-1 and FIV RTs. The sequence of the central and 3′-PPTs in HIV-1 (+) strand RNA is 5′-AAAAGAAAAGGGGGG-3′ (27Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Google Scholar). This A-rich sequence is a good template for dUMP incorporation by RT (Fig. 3), and the uracil in the complementary (−) strand DNA may alter the utilization of the PPT for (+) strand DNA synthesis. This was tested using a cell-free assay that converts regions of single-strand RNA to double-strand DNA in a single incubation (Fig. 2, steps 1–3). This RT-dependent system recapitulates several of the required intermediate steps of retroviral DNA synthesis: RNA-templated (−) strand DNA synthesis, RNase H cleavage and preferential (+) strand initiation at PPTs, and subsequent DNA-templated (+) strand DNA synthesis (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar). Briefly, HIV-1 or FIV RNAs containing PPTs are hybridized to oligonucleotide primers and incubated with RT in the presence of either a dTTP- or a dUTP-containing dNTP set. More RT is required in these reactions to increase yields of (−) strand DNA intermediates and in turn achieve steady-state accumulation of nascent (+) strand DNAs. Half of the products of each reaction are subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to degrade the RNA, and all reaction products are resolved by denaturing PAGE and transferred to a nylon membrane. Nascent (+) strand DNA products are detected by probing with32P-labeled strand-specific oligonucleotides. The 5′ ends of nascent DNA or RNA-DNA chimeras (nascent DNAs still attached to RNA primers) are identified by mapping against sequence ladders. Formation of (+) strand DNA requires (−) strand DNA synthesis and yields three groups of reaction products (Fig. 2, step 3products, and Fig. 4, P1,P2, and P3). P1 bands are nascent (+) strand DNAs liberated from the PPT primer by RNase H. P2 bands are (+) strand DNAs covalently linked to the PPT RNA primer. The bands labeledP3 reflect various (+) strand DNAs initiated from non-PPT primers upstream (5′) of the PPT. The P2 bands and several of the P3 bands disappeared and/or showed an increased gel mobility after NaOH treatment (Fig. 4 A, +NaOH lanes), demonstrating that RNA primers were still linked to the nascent (+) strand DNAs and not yet removed by RT/RNase H. Specific (+) strand DNA initiation products were not detected in reactions where an RNase H-minus HIV-1 RT mutant was used (D443N; (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar)) or in reactions lacking the (−) strand DNA primer (data not shown). Initiation of (+) strand DNA synthesis from the HIV-1 3′-PPT required RT and dNTPs (Fig. 4 A, (−) lanes and data not shown). In reactions containing dTTP in the absence of dUTP, two PPT initiation products of similar intensity were detected with 5′ ends mapping to the last G residue and the adjacent A residue at the 3′ end of the PPT (Fig. 4 A, −NaOH lanes, bands labeledP1). NaOH treatment yielded two additional P1 bands (Fig.4 A, +NaOH lanes, dTTP-containing reactions), revealing the four-band pattern observed previously (18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar). Substitution of dUTP for dTTP in these reactions significantly decreased the amount of P1 and caused a slight increase in the mobility of the P1 bands, presumably due to the absence of the C5 methyl group in uracil (Fig.4 A, −NaOH lanes, dUTP reactions). Reactions containing dUTP yielded shorter P2 products (Fig.4 A). In addition, the intensity of non-PPT initiation products (P3) increased in reactions containing dUTP relative to the dTTP-containing reactions (Fig. 4 A, right inset). Using an FIV RNA-DNA substrate, HIV-1 and FIV RTs recognized and initiated (+) strand DNA synthesis from the FIV PPT (Fig.4 B). The amount of PPT initiation decreased in dUTP-containing reactions, and a decrease in heterogeneity at the PPT 5′ end was observed with HIV-1 RT (Fig. 4 B, bands labeledP1 and P2, respectively). These data demonstrate that the PPT itself, not the specific RT or flanking sequences (HIV-1versus FIV), directs (+) strand synthesis initiation in these experiments (see also Refs. 18Klarmann G.J. Yu H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Google Scholar and 28Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Google Scholar, 29Pullen K.A. Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6221-6227Google Scholar, 30Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of dUMP on primer formation and recognition by RT is directed predominately by the double-strand PPT region. PPT-initiated (+) strand DNAs (P1) were detected as early as 10 min (Figs. 4 A and 5 A) and accumulated linearly with time for up to 60 min, whereas the amount of P2 was essentially constant over the 90-min incubation (Fig.5 A and data not shown). Presumably P2 never accumulated due to rapid removal of the PPT by RNase H (31Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Google Scholar). The rate of P1 accumulation decreased ∼3-fold in the dUTP reaction set (Fig. 5 A). This decrease must result from an effect on either RNase H cleavage and/or subsequent PPT primer selection and extension because (−) strand synthesis is unaffected by uracil (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the quantity of non-PPT initiated products increased significantly when dUTP was included in the reactions, and their rate of formation increased 3-fold (Fig.5 B). Taken together, the data in Fig. 4 show that uracilated DNA diminished specific PPT initiation and concomitantly increased the rate of non-PPT initiation. The change in (+) strand DNA initiation specificity imparted by dUMP incorporation may be the result of altered RNase H activity. An RT/RNase H activity assay was used to directly investigate the influence of dUMP on RNase H cleavage of the HIV-1 PPTs (Fig.6). [5′-32P]-HIV-1 RNAs (61-mer containing the cPPT or 73-mer containing the 3′-PPT) were hybridized to 35-mer (−) strand DNAs containing either dTMP or dUMP (Fig. 6 A). These substrates position the polymerase active site at the 3′ end of the (−) strand DNA and the RNase H active site 18 nt behind (i.e. toward the 5′ end of the (−) strand) to allow precise RNA cleavage between the last G residue of the PPT and the adjacent A residue. The substrate design suppresses cleavage directed by the 5′ end of RNA (26Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Google Scholar). RNA-DNA hybrids are incubated with RT and dNTPs for various time points, and the resultant RNase H cleavage products are resolved by urea-PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager. Unlike the concerted assay (Fig. 4), HIV-1 RT is present in limiting quantities for this experiment to study RNase H activity under steady-state conditions. Thus, the observed cleavage products result primarily from hydrolysis of the initial substrate. The RNA-DNA duplex containing dTMP was cleaved by RT/RNase H between the A and G residue precisely at the 3′ end of both the 3′ and cPPTs, similar to the positive control lane (+) (Fig. 6, B andC, reaction set labeled DNA/T and indicated with an arrow). Note that RNA fragments generated by RNase H activity have a 3′-hydroxyl, causing them to migrate ∼1 nt slower than the corresponding fragments of the RNA sequence marker that have 3′-phosphates left by RNases U2 and T1 (32Tapper D.P. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6787-6794Google Scholar). Cleavage also occurred 1 nt inside the 3′ end of each PPT. These two RNA fragments are consistent with the two major (+) strand synthesis initiation sites observed in Fig. 4. The remainder of the PPT sequence was resistant to RNase H in these reaction conditions. RT extended the (−) strand DNA oligonucleotide, resulting in significant RNA cleavage 14–18 nt from the 5′ end of each RNA substrate (Fig. 6, B andC, bottom left). The amount of each of these cleavage products increased with time on the 3′ and cPPT substrates. No cleavage products were detected in the absence of RT (Fig. 6, (−)lanes) nor in control reactions incubated with HIV-1 D443N RT lacking RNase H activity (data not shown). The amount of precise PPT cleavage product decreased on duplexes containing dUMP in place of dTMP (Fig. 6, reaction sets labeledDNA/U). Analysis of the data indicates that the precise PPT cut represents only 17 ± 6% of the total cleavage products observed at and within the 3′ and cPPTs. In contrast, on the DNA/T substrate, the precise cut accounted for 44 ± 8% of the cleavage products at the PPT (10-min time points). The cleavage pattern 14–18 nt from the 5′ end of the RNA was unaffected by uracil in the (−) strand DNA. Interestingly, the total amount of RNA-DNA/U duplex that was cleaved by RNase H was equal to or slightly increased relative to the RNA-DNA/T duplex. Thus, RNase H activity is specifically decreased only at the 3′ end of the PPT in the presence of dUMP and not at other sites on the RNA/DNA duplex. Additional imprecise RNA cleavage occurred within the PPT (Fig. 6, B and C) as observed in Fig. 4 A (−NaOH reaction set). However, these shorter PPT RNA fragments were incapable of serving as (+) strand primers based on the absence of (+) strand DNA with 5′ ends mapping to this sequence (Fig. 4 A, +NaOH reactions). In the absence of DNA synthesis, the total RNase H activity on all PPT substrat"

Cell surface glycans are altered during cell differentiation and activation in conjunction with changing glycoprotein expression pattern (2Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B.

The precise chemistry of glycan modification requires that the vertebrate genome encodes a variety of enzymes that modify various classes of glycans. For example, more than a dozen sialyltransferases with unique substrate specificities and expression patterns operate at the level of the Golgi apparatus (3Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation has particular relevance in the immune system where cell surface proteins and lipids involved in immune recognition and regulation are typically modified by various glycan structures during cell differentiation and activation (4Lowe J.B. Cell. 2001; 104: 809-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 5Rudd P.M. Elliott T. Cresswell P. Wilson I.A. Dwek R.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). One particular example is the T-cell surface glycoprotein, CD8. The CD8 cell surface molecule is critical for the development and activation of T-cells whose T-cell receptors (TCR)1 recognize peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules (6Reinherz E.L. Schlossman S.F. Cell. 1980; 19: 821-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar,7Crooks M.E. Littman D.R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 277-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This co-receptor is encoded by two distinct genes, αand β, whose polypeptide products are expressed in one of two forms, CD8αα homodimers or CD8αβ heterodimers (8DiSanto J.P. Knowles R.W. Flomenberg N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Norment A.M. Littman D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3433-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Most T-cells mature within the thymus and express cell surface CD8αβ receptors. Previously, we and others (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Daniels M.A. Devine L. Miller J.D. Moser J.M. Lukacher A.E. Altman J.D. Kavathas P. Hogquist K.A.

The binding difference is the result of a developmentally regulated glycosylation modification involving sialic acid residues. Evidence of this is the increased CD8αβ-MHCI avidity of mature thymocytes following treatment with neuraminidase, an enzyme that removes sialic acid residues from cell surface molecules. Moreover, the sialyltransferase ST3Gal-1, which specifically sialylates core 1-O-glycans, is involved in controlling the differential binding as evidenced by decreased CD8αβ-MHCI avidity after induction of ST3Gal-1 (10Moody A.M.

Given that CD8β glycans change during thymic development (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Casabo L.G. Mamalaki C. Kioussis D. Zamoyska R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the physical nature of CD8β O-glycosylation. Through the application of recent advances in mass spectrometry (12Dell A. Morris H.R. Science. 2001; 291: 2351-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), we have been able to identify a developmental change in CD8β stalk glycosylation, which functions as a molecular switch to critically affect ligand binding. Unfractionated thymocytes from C57BL/6 mice (∼2–4 × 109/experiment) were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Resulting lysates were processed as described previously (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) using anti-CD8β mAb YTS 156.77 for immunoprecipitation. After separation on two-dimensional non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE, the proteins were stained with Gel-Code Blue reagent and the double positive (DP) and single positive (SP) CD8β bands were excised. The gel slices were digested with either trypsin or N-glycanase (PNGase) followed by trypsin using conditions described previously (13van der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. North S.J. Dell A. Thomson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33952-33963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptide extracts were cleaned by reverse-phase (C18) trapping and eluted by 1:1 MeOH:HOH with 1% acetic acid or acetonitrile:0.01% trifluoroacetic acid or acetonitrile:0.01% formic acid in various experiments. The eluted volume (2–3 μl) was loaded in a nanospray tip and analyzed by ES mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS/MS analysis on either ABI QStar Pulsar or Micromass Q-TOF quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometers. In some experiments, the same procedure was applied to gel pieces with the addition of PNGase prior to tryptic digestion. Nano-LCMS and MS/MS experiments on SP and DP in-gel digest extracts were carried out on a Q-TOF instrument using a 75-μm C18 reverse-phase column eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.01% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Data-dependent acquisition of MS/MS spectra was controlled by setting threshold ionization values for doubly, triply, and quadruply charged ions, and collision energies were programmed in relation to the values seen to produce good fragmentation in the earlier nanospray experiments. Within the thymus, T-cell precursors move through a series of developmental stages distinguishable by different CD4 and CD8 cell surface expression patterns (14Reinherz E.L. Kung P.C. Goldstein G. Levey R.H. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). CD4−CD8− double negative (DN) cells progress to the CD4+CD8+ DP stage in the thymic cortex, and upon successful selection, mature into either CD4+ or CD8+ SP T-cells in the thymic medulla (Fig. 1 a). The DP to SP transition is dependent on TCR ligation by pMHC molecules containing self-peptides (15Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Bevan M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Varied T-cell surface glycosylation patterns detected by the plant lectin, PNA, also mark thymic developmental progression. PNA binds to core 1-O-glycans bearing terminal galactose residues (Galβ1–3GalNAcαSer-Thr), staining immature cortical thymocytes strongly (PNAhigh) and mature medullary thymocytes weakly (PNAlow) (Fig. 1 b) (16Pereira M.E. Kabat E.A. Lotan R. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 51: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Reisner Y. Linker-Israeli M. Sharon N. Cell. Immunol. 1976; 25: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The change in PNA reactivity is attributable to the induction of the ST3Gal-1 sialyltransferase within the hematopoietic compartment that catalyzes the addition of sialic acid (Sia) residues in a α2–3 linkage to terminal galactose (Siaα2–3Galβ1–3GalNAcαSer-Thr), capping the PNA binding site in medullary thymocytes (Fig. 1,b and c) (18Gillespie W. Paulson J.C. Kelm S. Pang M. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3801-3804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic disruption of ST3Gal-1 causes PNAhigh reactivity to persist into the medullary thymocyte compartment (Fig. 1 b) (2Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M. Fukuda M. Varki N.M. Marth J.D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 273-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Five likely possibilities for O-glycan structures that could bind PNA in the cortex are presented in Fig. 1 c. Among the small group of thymocyte cell surface molecules identified as being PNA-reactive are CD45, CD43, and CD8 (19Wu W. Harley P.H. Punt J.A. Sharrow S.O. Kearse K.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In particular, the CD8β chain is a major component of the differential PNA binding observed on immature thymocytes (Fig. 1 d). To identifyN-and O-linked glycan sites on CD8β and define glycosylation changes associated with the DP to CD8 SP thymocyte transition, mass spectrometry was used to analyze tryptic peptides of CD8β prepared from immunoprecipitates. CD8αβ proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of cell surface-labeled DP and CD8 SP thymocytes sorted by MoFlo, using Sepharose-coupled anti-CD8β mAb and separated on two-dimensional non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE gels as described previously (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Whereas three distinct pairs of CD8αβ heterodimers (α38Kd β30Kd, α38Kd β29Kd, and α′33Kd β29Kd) are evident on DP thymocytes, CD8β heterogeneity is reduced upon DP to SP maturation (Fig. 2 a). By the CD8 SP stage, a single 38-kDa CD8α subunit is paired with a major 30-kDa CD8β glycoform. Note that aside from the 33-kDa CD8α′ cytoplasmic RNA splice variant found in DP thymocytes, CD8α is not detectably altered during thymic maturation as assessed by the two-dimensional gel analysis. A composite pattern is obtained from silver staining of proteins immunoprecipitated from unfractionated thymocytes and run in the two-dimensional gel system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since DP thymocytes comprise 80% of thymocytes while the CD8 SP fraction accounts for merely 3–5%, the total thymocyte CD8αβ immunoprecipitation pattern is most similar to that of the isolated DP thymocytes. The two-dimensional gel pattern of CD8β proteins precipitated from sorted DP and CD8 SP thymocytes provided a ready basis to obtain “DP” and “CD8 SP” thymocyte-derived gel slices as indicated in the Fig. 2 b(inset). The excised gel slices were then digested with either trypsin or PNGase followed by trypsin using the conditions described previously (13van der Wel H. Morris H.R. Panico M. Paxton T. North S.J. Dell A. Thomson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33952-33963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following the in-gel digestion and extraction, the purified peptide mixture was analyzed using ES on Q-TOF geometry tandem hybrid instrumentation (20Morris H.R. Paxton T. Dell A. Langhorne J. Berg M. Bordoli R.S. Hoyes J. Bateman R.H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) in both MS and MS/MS modes (see “Experimental Procedures”). An early comparative study of CD8β SP and DP preparations run by nanospray ES-MS from a formic acid/acetonitrile solution showed a clear quadruply charged signal at m/z 823.88 (corresponding to M = 3,291.49) in the SP sample, which was virtually absent in the corresponding DP analysis. Fig.3 shows the MS/MS spectrum of this ion at moderate collision energies of 30–50 eV. The spectrum is the sum of data obtained at 30, 40, and 50 eV. The spectrum shows definitive evidence of glycosylation via major signals atm/z 204 (HexNAc), 366 (HexHexNAc), 290 (NeuGc minus H2O), 308 (NeuGc), and 673 (NeuGcHexHexNAc). Hex denotes any six-carbon neutral sugar, including glucose, galactose, and mannose, whereas HexNAc is a six-carbon sugar with anN-acetylated amino group at position 2. NeuGc is formed by an enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of the N-acetyl group attached to C5 of the nine-carbon sialic acid backbone. The mouse CD8β sialic acids identified were of the glycolyl variety as expected rather than the N-acetyl (NeuAc)-type that predominates in mammalian brain tissue (1Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J.D. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The collision energies were chosen to provide both carbohydrate and peptide backbone fragmentation (21Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in an effort to identify the CD8 peptide sequence carrying the glycosylation. Signals observed atm/z 215, 314, 413, 528, 627, and 740 were interpreted as N-terminal peptide fragments, b ions (20Morris H.R. Paxton T. Dell A. Langhorne J. Berg M. Bordoli R.S. Hoyes J.

The threonines at positions 113, 120, 121, and 124 represented possible sugar attachment sites viaO-glycosylation. A free (non-glycosylated) peptide of this sequence would be expected to show intense C-terminal ammonium ion (y“) fragmentation (20Morris H.R. Paxton T. Dell A. Langhorne J. Berg M. Bordoli R.S.

Neither of these signals is present in Fig. 3. However, with increasing collision energy, which causes preferential cleavage of sugar residues, prominent signals at m/z 843 and 473 begin to appear, which are 128 Da higher in mass. These signals were assigned to C-terminal proline cleavage fragments PTTAPTKK and PTKK, respectively, thus proving that the peptide backbone for the 823.884+-peptide is in fact the CD8β-(112–126) sequence LTVVDVLPTTAPTKK. The fact that the 473 ion was only created at higher collision energies showed that at least threonine 124 is glycosylated.Figure 4CD8β glycosylation sites. a, CD8αβ heterodimer schematic.

The b ion peptide fragment series (m/z 215, 314, 413, 528, 627, and 740) is visible at relatively low collision energies, which in our experience would not cause total carbohydrate elimination from the fragments. This strongly suggests that threonine 113 is not glycosylated (Fig. 4). In additional variable collision energy experiments, the proline y“ ion fragments at m/z843 and 473 were seen to carry glycosyl substituents via signals atm/z 1046 (843 + HexNAc), 1208 (843 + HexHexNAc), 1249 (843 + HexNAc2), 676 (473 + HexNAc), and 838 (473 + HexHexNAc). A consideration of these data together with the sugar fragment ions observed (both at low mass and as neutral losses from the quasimolecular ion) suggested that threonines 120, 121, and 124 are each O-linked to core 1 (HexHexNAc) structures, two of which are capped with N-glycolylneuraminic acid. The virtual absence of the m/z 823.88 signal from the corresponding DP preparation provided the first molecular evidence of differential sialylation of the CD8β SP/DP glycoproteins. Because of the complexity of the nanospray MS spectra of the total CD8β digests, a further preparation of SP and DP CD8β was then examined by nanoLC-MS and nanoLC -MS/MS (see “Experimental Procedures”). These data were important in allowing the unambiguous confirmation of the glycosylation state of the remainder of the CD8β stalk region. This was achieved by locatingN-glycolylneuraminic acid-containing signals atm/z 10404+, 11174+, and 11944+. These glycopeptides were found eluting at 24.8 min, 26.7/27.4 min (doublet), and 28.1 min respectively, compared with the CD8β-(112–126) disialyl glycopeptide described earlier in the nanospray experiment, which eluted at 30.2/31.1 min as evidenced by signals at 8234+ and 10983+. A consideration of the mass differences among the 1040, 1117, and 1194 signals together with the MS/MS data, which showed that the peptide portion of the differing molecules began with the same LTVVDV … sequence, allowed the assignment of the glycopeptide structures of these ions as CD8β-(112–130)-LTVVDVLPTTAPTKKTTLK carrying NeuGc1Hex5HexNAc5, NeuGc2Hex5HexNAc5, and NeuGc3Hex5HexNAc5 glycosylation, respectively. The equivalent non-sialyl species was also observed at m/z9634+/12843+ eluting at 23.7 min. The carbohydrate-related signals in the MS/MS spectra of this extended glycopeptide suggest two additional core 1-type HexHexNAc glycans at threonines 127 and 128, leading to five substitutions in all (Fig. 4). Interestingly, comparing the signal strengths of the short (112–126)- and long (112–130)-peptides with the degrees of sialylation observed suggests that there is minimal additional sialylation on the Thr-127 and Thr-128 glycans relative to that observed on the peptide containing Thr-120, Thr-121, and Thr-124. Also, comparing the degree of sialylation between the SP and DP preparations in this nanoLC-MS and -MS/MS experiment indicates heavier sialylation of the SP-derived structures, although in both sets of data, the mono-sialyl structure is predominant. Relatively higher levels of non-sialylated structures were observed in the DP preparation. The predicted N-linked glycopeptide CD8β-(1–17), also seen in the earlier nanospray experiment, is seen principally as standard core-fucosylated biantennary structures carrying two sialylated antennae (m/z 14113+), one sialylated antenna together with one α-galactose-capped antenna (m/z 13633+) or two α-galactose-capped antennae (m/z13153+). Since the comparison of the nanoLC-MS and nanospray experiments then showed little or no suppression in the nanospray data and because the “residence time” for MS/MS analysis is much longer in nanospray leading to better quality data in complex studies such as these, subsequent comparative analyses were conducted using nanospray ESMS. Fig. 5 gives the comparative data for a CD8β SP/DP preparation. The data show an almost complete absence of non-sialylated HexHexNAc structures in the SP sample compared with the DP via signals atm/z 893, 963, and 1284, whereas the principal sialylation state in both SP and DP is mono-sialyl (m/z 995 and 1040) as seen in the other studies. Fig. 6 is an expansion of them/z 893 region of Fig. 5 showing the comparative relative abundance of the key signal at m/z 893 for SP and DP and its absence in the SP sample. Note that the absence of non-sialylated signals in SP is not attributable to the low relative abundance of this sample, because the signals atm/z 995 and 1040 in the same approximate mass range of Fig. 5 are clearly visible. Significantly, the relative degree of sialylation of the N-linked structures attached to peptide-(1–17) is the same for both SP and DP preparations as exemplified by the signals at m/z 1022 and 1059 or by m/z 1363 and 1411.Figure 6Expansion of them/z 893 region of Fig. 5showing the abundance between SP and DP and the relative absence of the key signal relating to non-sialylated HexHexNAc structures in SP compared with its presence in DP thymocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A comparison of CD8 SP and DP glycopeptides revealed a key difference in the O- but not the N-linked glycopeptides. This difference is the almost complete absence of non-sialylated Hex3HexNAc3 structures in CD8 SPs (Figs. 5 and 6). Conversely, double and triple Sia-capped Hex3HexNAc3 CD8β-(112–126)-peptides occur in greater abundance in SP rather than DP, although these differences are smaller by comparison. Unexpectedly, our structural studies have revealed that both SP and DP are mainly mono-sialylated in the stalk region despite the presence of five core-type 1 O-glycan substitutions (Thr-120, Thr-121, Thr-124, Thr-127, and Thr-128) (Fig.4). Sialylation occurs principally within the 120–124 sequence, and there appears to be little or no additional sialylation of residues 127 and 128. Since SP thymocytes are PNAlow, this finding suggests that the majority of CD8β stalk O-glycans are inaccessible to this lectin. Thus, the key change between DP and SP is core-type 1 sialylation at a single site in the 121–124 stalk segment. This site is presumably that recognized by the peanut lectin. CD8αβ rather than CD8αα was previously shown to be the critical co-receptor on thymocytes for MHCI binding (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L.

In CD8β knock-out mice, for example, CD8αα homodimers are expressed on the surface of thymocytes but fail to support significant MHCI binding activity as assessed by pMHCI tetramers using flow cytometry. Moreover, the varied glycosylation pattern of CD8β at different thymic developmental stages correlates with the noted change in the CD8αβ ligand binding activity whereby DP thymocytes interact with MHCI more avidly than CD8 SP thymocytes. Several hypotheses have been offered to account for this developmentally programmed alteration in CD8αβ co-receptor MHCI ligand-binding function (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J.

Biol. 2002; 12: R99-R101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). First, the sialylation of the CD8β stalk may affect the orientation of the co-receptor globular head domains relative to the T-cell membrane and/or CD8αβ domain-domain association strength, modulating the ability of the distal binding surface of the CD8αβ Ig-like domain to clamp MHCI (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, sialic acid residues might reduce the clustering of CD8αβ molecules on thymocyte surfaces because of repulsion of the negatively charged sugars, preventing MHCI binding as detected by pMHCI tetramers. Third, multivalent mammalian lectins such as galectins (26Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), known to control clustering of certain T-cell surface glycoproteins (27Nguyen J.T. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D. Bui T.N. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5697-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), might “pre-cluster” non-sialylated CD8 co-receptors in DP thymocytes but not sialylated glycan-bearing counterparts on CD8 SP thymocytes. Fourth, the effects might be attributed to sialylation of molecules other than CD8αβ given the previous lack of direct evidence for developmentally controlled sialic acid addition to the CD8 co-receptor itself. The current biochemical analysis favors reorientation of the globular head domains of CD8. We find that on the noted stalk threonines, CD8β harbors a sialic acid linked to a core 1 disaccharide that lacks aN-acetyllactosamine, indicating an absence of both core 2O-glycans and elongated core 1 glycans, which might alter lateral mobility of CD8αβ in the plasma membrane by virtue of larger hydrodynamic radii. Consistent with this view, we observed no differences in the distribution of CD8αβ co-receptors on the surface of DP and CD8 SP thymocytes (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD8β remains constitutively concentrated in cholesterol-sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane microdomains due, at least in part, to CD8β cytoplasmic tail palmitoylation (28Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Bakker T.R. Baldi L. Jordan M. Goffin L. Boucheron N. Wurm F. van der Merwe P.A. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1485-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The structure of O-glycan adducts revealed herein also limits the likelihood that galectins are operating to cross-link galactose residues on neighboring CD8β stalk adducts. Galectin-1 has been implicated in thymocyte apoptosis through the recognition of core 2 O-glycans on CD43 and CD45 (27Nguyen J.T. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D. Bui T.N. Baum L.G. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16730-16737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 binding to β1–6-branched lactosamine chains produced by the Mgat5gene on TCR N-glycans is reported to inhibit T-cell activation, perhaps by altering TCR clustering (30Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Most mammalian galectins bind preferentially to galactose on polylactosamine, although some may bind to other galactose linkages (31Leffler H. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2001; 33: 57-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Rabinovich G.A. Baum L.G. Tinari N. Paganelli R. Natoli C. Liu F.T. Iacobelli S. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Detailed site-specific assignment of Sia adducts on the CD8β stalk confirms that the addition of sialic acid per se modulates CD8αβ co-receptor function. Our findings show that the genetically programmed alteration of CD8β glycosylation during thymocyte differentiation from immature DP to mature SP stages is restricted to the O-glycans without concurrent changes in the N-linked structures. TheseO-linked sites (Thr-120, Thr-121, Thr-124, Thr-127, and Thr-128) localize to a segment of the CD8 stalk immediately abutting the CD8β Ig-like domain. O-Linked glycans are attached to none of the 14 other serine or threonine residues in the examined tryptic fragments. Three of the five threonines (Thr-120, Thr-124, and Thr-128) are conserved in all of the CD8β homologues sequenced to date, residing within or adjacent to the lysine-rich segment that is unique to the CD8β stalk (10Moody A.M.

In view of both the weak association between CD8α and CD8β head regions (10Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), an uncharacteristic feature for Ig-like domain heterodimers and the almost certain requirement for participation of CD8α and CD8β CDR-like loops in the binding to the MHCI α3 domain (by extension from crystallographic analysis of two CD8αα·pMHCI complexes) (33Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 34Kern P.S. Teng M.K. Smolyar A.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 519-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), sialylation in this specific region may impact significantly on CD8αβ binding to MHCI. The addition of sialic acid to the CD8β stalk could facilitate neutralization of positive charges on the adjacent stalk lysine residues (Lys-125, Lys-126, Lys-130, and Lys-132 to Lys-135), probably permitting the stalk to assume a retracted rather than fully extended configuration or resulting in other conformational changes. By altering CD8αβ domain-domain association and/or disposition of the CD8 globular headpiece relative to the cell surface, CD8β stalk O-glycans create a molecular switch regulating MHCI binding. That sialic acid addition to core 1 O-glycans during thymic ontogeny is a conserved feature of vertebrate development (2Priatel J.J. Chui D. Hiraoka N. Simmons C.J. Richardson K.B. Page D.M.

Additional chemical details regarding the dynamic glycobiology of CD8 will be important, not only for understanding the co-receptor function of thymocytes but that of naive, memory and effector CD8 peripheral T-cells."

The affinity for biotin binding of the mutant decreased from K d ∼10−15m of the wild-type tetramer to K d∼10−7m, which was studied by an optical biosensor IAsys and by a fluorescence spectroscopical method in solution. The binding was completely reversible. Conversion of the tetramer to a monomer results in increased sensitivity to proteinase K digestion. The antigenic properties of the mutated protein were changed, such that monoavidin was only partially recognized by a polyclonal antibody whereas two different monoclonal antibodies entirely failed to recognize the avidin monomer. This new monomeric avidin, which binds biotin reversibly, may be useful for applications both in vitro and in vivo.

It may also shed light on the effect of intersubunit interactions on the binding of ligands. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Chicken avidin and bacterial streptavidin are structurally analogous proteins, which are well known for the uniquely tenacious affinity they exhibit toward their ligand biotin. This affinity is the firmest protein-ligand interaction known in nature (K d ∼10−15m), and, under physiological conditions, the binding can essentially be considered irreversible (1Green M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). This tight interaction has been utilized during the past three decades for various applications in the life sciences to purify, probe, and target various materials both in vitroand in vivo (2Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Biomol. Eng. 1999; 16: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The scientific merit of mutation studies of avidin and streptavidin has been 2-fold. On the one hand, mutations of designated residues have provided important structural and functional information regarding the native protein. On the other, the mutant proteins themselves can be of applicative value for use in avidin-biotin technology, since they frequently exhibit special and sometimes surprising binding properties or physicochemical characteristics. In this context, the affinity of the native biotin-binding protein may be too high for some applications. In some cases, for example, a reversible binding might be desired, e.g. for affinity chromatography where the facile release of biotinylated material from an avidin column is required. Several reports have demonstrated clearly that in most cases the strong affinity of avidin or streptavidin for biotin is dependent upon the tetrameric architecture of the protein. Indeed, long before the structures of avidin (3Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Toms E.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of avidin and streptavidin have revealed that the major reason for this common property of the two biotin-binding proteins is the cross-subunit insertion of a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp-110 in avidin and Trp-120 in streptavidin) from one monomer into the binding site of its neighbor. Mutation of this tryptophan in either protein has resulted in both a reduction of binding affinity toward biotin and a reduction in the stability of the tetramer (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J.

The quaternary structure of avidin and streptavidin has long been viewed as a dimer of dimers (11Kurzban G.P. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14470-14477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the transition from tetramer to dimer to monomer has always been intriguing. To study the tetrameric architecture further, we have previously probed the interface interactions in avidin by site-directed mutagenesis. In one study, we mutated the critical 1 → 2 interface residue, Trp-110 of avidin and the conserved Trp-120 of streptavidin, to lysine, which led to the production of dimeric avidin and streptavidin mutants that bound biotin reversibly (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In another study, we mutated the critical 1 → 4 interface residue, asparagine 54, to alanine, which also led to destabilization of tetramer (12Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T.

One of the surprising outcomes of that study was the production of avidin mutants that, in the absence of biotin, appeared as monomers in solution, whereas upon binding the vitamin the monomers formed stable tetramers. It was thus of interest to investigate whether the combination of these two types of mutation might lead to a stable avidin monomer. In the present communication, we describe a monomeric avidin mutant (monoavidin), in which Trp-110 was converted to lysine and Asn-54 was mutated to alanine. The resultant mutant binds biotin specifically in a reversible manner and remains in the monomeric state even upon binding to biotin. The resultant monomeric avidin may have applicative advantages over previously described native and mutated forms of the tetrameric and dimeric avidins and streptavidins for affinity-based separations of biotinylated biomolecules.

Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Subcloning of the PCR-amplified insert was performed as earlier reported by Laitinen et al. (12Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T.

A recombinant baculovirus capable of producing the N54A+W110K double mutant in avidin was constructed according to the instructions of the BacToBac™ Baculovirus expression system kit. Mutant avidin was produced in Baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (14Airenne K.J. Oker-Blom C. Marjomäki V.S. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purification on a biotin-agarose column was performed from cell extracts grown in biotin-free medium according to Laitinenet al. (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reversibility of biotin binding was determined by competitive binding to biotinylated biosensor surfaces, and the determination of binding constants for the mutant avidin to biotin were performed using an IAsys optical biosensor as reported earlier (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer LS55 luminescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used, and the emission spectra was obtained from 320 to 420 nm using 2.5 nm excitation and 17 nm emission slitwidths. An average of four scans with scan at speed 240 nm/min was used to calculate the final result. The protein concentration in this analysis was 20 nm, and the biotin was added in small volumes to final concentrations from 0.02 nm to 13 mm. The protein sample was thoroughly mixed in a cuvette with a micropipette and incubated for 5 min covered from UV light before scanning. The measurements were performed at 23 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl. The measured spectra were integrated, and the intensities were plotted against biotin concentration. Binding curve (quenching (%) =a[Btn]/(K d + [Btn]) + c), where a and c are scaling factors, was fitted to this data using the least square method. The molecular mass of the mutant was calculated from the known amino acid composition using the GCG package program Peptidesort (Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI). SDS-PAGE, immunoblot analyses, and assays for protease sensitivity were performed according to Laitinen et al. (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For stability analysis, protein samples were combined with sample buffer and incubated at selected temperatures for 20 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE (15Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The quaternary status of avidin and the mutant was determined by fast-protein liquid chromatography, performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) using a Shimadzu SCL-10A VP system controller with RF-10A xl fluorescence detector and SPD-M 10A VP diode array detector. Samples (sodium phosphate buffer, 0.65 mNaCl, pH 7.2) were applied, and chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The immunological properties of the mutant were compared with avidin by an indirect ELISA analysis as previously described in Laitinen et al. (16Laitinen O.H. Hytönen V.P. Ahlroth M.K.

ELISAs were performed using two monoclonal avidin antibodies (produced at the Institute of Medical Technology, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland) and a polyclonal rabbit avidin antibody (produced at the Laboratory Animal Center, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland) as primary antibodies. The W110K+N54A avidin mutant was produced in biotin-free insect cell medium as described previously (14Airenne K.J. Oker-Blom C. Marjomäki V.S. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mutant was purified efficiently on biotin agarose and eluted with mild acid treatment (8Laitinen O.H.

The location of residues W110K and N54A in the avidin tetramer is shown in Fig. 1. Reversibility of biotin binding was studied using an IAsys apparatus. The binding of the vitamin by the W110K+N54A mutant was found to be completely reversible (Fig. 2 A). The dissociation constant of mutant for the immobilized biotin was determined at ∼1–3 × 10−7m in IAsys analyses (Fig. 2 B, Table I). The binding and dissociation curves were consistent with simple first-order kinetics. The resultant kinetics data were in accord with self-consistency tests described by Schuck and Minton (17Schuck P. Minton A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 458-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) whereby dissociation constants calculated from equilibrium response data were similar to those obtained directly from the binding curves (Table I). The binding was also examined under soluble conditions by fluorescence spectroscopy monitoring the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence due to biotin binding to avidin. Total decrease of about 45% in protein intrinsic fluorescence intensity was observed when monoavidin sample was titrated with biotin (Fig. 2 C). The fitted binding curve (r 2 = 0.98) gave dissociation constant of ∼7.6 × 10−8m.Table IIAsys biosensor data for binding of biotin to monoavidinAffinity parameterValueK d1-aThe dissociation constants were calculated from the equilibrium response data.(m)1.4 × 10−7K d1-bDissociation constant calculated from k aand k diss values, derived from association analysis using a plot of k on against protein concentration.(m)2.9 × 10−7K d1-cThe dissociation constant was calculated directly from the binding curves.

Open table in a new tab The tendency of the W110K+N54A double mutant to form higher order quaternary structures (dimers, tetramers, oligomers) was studied by SDS-PAGE based assay (15Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mutant migrated as a monomer even at room temperature, both in the absence and presence of biotin (not shown). The quaternary structure status of the mutant was also determined in solution by fast-protein liquid chromatography assay. The calculated value for the monomeric peptide sequence is 14.2 kDa (∼15.7 kDa including the oligosaccharide side chain). This value fits well with the estimated molecular weights both in the absence or presence of biotin (15.2 and 17.5 kDa, respectively), indicating a monomer in solution in both cases. Biotin-free and biotin-bound forms of the native protein were tetrameric (Fig. 3). Henceforth, the W110K+N54A mutant was termed monoavidin. The resistance of monoavidin to proteolytic cleavage was studied by proteinase K treatment and compared with the wild-type avidin. In the absence of biotin, monoavidin was degraded within minutes, whereas the presence of the ligand had a short-lived protective effect on the mutant against the proteolytic action of proteinase K. Complete proteolysis took place within an hour, whereupon the protein was digested into small peptides. Native avidin was clearly more stable, both in the absence and especially in the presence of biotin (Fig. 4). As reported previously (18Ellison D. Hinton J. Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the native protein was cleaved into two long peptides. Monoavidin was compared immunologically to native avidin by ELISA using a polyclonal and two monoclonal anti-avidin preparations. The polyclonal rabbit sera recognized monoavidin clearly weaker than native avidin and the monoclonal antibodies failed to recognize the mutant (TableII).Table IIELISA analysis of avidin and monoavidin using anti-avidin polyclonal (rabbit) and two different monoclonal antibody preparationsAntibodyAvidin/A405Monoavidin/A405+ Biotin− Biotin+ Biotin− BiotinPolyclonal1.001.010.250.21Monoclonal 10.690.7100Monoclonal 20.570.5500Samples were analyzed after 60-min color reaction by reading the absorbances (direct reading values shown in table) at 405 nm.

The linkage of the tetrameric architecture to the strong affinity of the avidin/streptavidin-biotin complex was first evident from biochemical studies and then confirmed by the determination of the crystal structures (3Livnah O.

In this context, it has been one of our expressed goals to prepare an active, reversible biotin-binding monomer of one or both proteins. Indeed, in recent work (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we succeeded in producing a dimeric form of avidin and streptavidin that bound biotin reversibly. In another work, we developed monomeric forms of avidin that fortuitously assembled into tetramers upon binding biotin (12Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8219-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The question outstanding was whether a combination of the two types of mutant would lead to a stable, reversible biotin-binding monomer. The dimeric mutants of avidin and streptavidin were produced by rational design (8Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which involved a radical point mutation of a single biotin-binding residue (i.e. Trp-110 in avidin or the conserved Trp-120 in streptavidin) to a lysine in both cases. The rationale for this particular “irrational” mutation was inspired by comparing the sequences of avidin and streptavidin to those of the sea urchin fibropellins (24Bisgrove B.W. Andrews M.E. Raff R.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One of the domains of the latter proteins is remarkably similar to avidin and streptavidin, including most, but not all, of the biotin-binding residues. In this case, the designated binding site tryptophan in the avidins is replaced by a lysine in the fibropellins, hence our decision to effect the Trp → Lys mutations of avidin and streptavidin. Since the same tryptophan also plays a crucial role in the 1 → 2 monomer-monomer interface, this radical type of point mutation also generates dimeric forms of the two proteins. The monomeric avidin mutants were also produced by rational design upon categorizing the molecular forces involved in maintaining the other two interfaces of the avidin tetramer. 2O. Livnah and E. A. Bayer, unpublished results. Using this approach, all three residues involved in the 1 → 3 interface were converted to alanines (12Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8219-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The resultant 1 → 3 mutant still formed a tetramer, but its stability properties were compromised. In contrast to the relatively weak 1 → 3 intermonomer interaction, the 1 → 4 interface exhibits an extensive hydrogen bonding network. Nevertheless, one of the residues involved in this interface (Asn-54) contributes numerous hydrogen bonding interactions with several residues of the neighboring monomer. The combination of the single Asn-54 → Ala mutation with those of the 1 → 3 interface was sufficient to disrupt the stable avidin tetramer into monomer (12Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8219-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such monomers, however, re-assembled into stable tetramers upon biotin binding. In the present work, combined single point mutations of two critical 1 → 2 and 1 → 4 interface residues generated a stable avidin monomer. These data infer that once these two interfaces are disrupted, the relatively weak 1 → 3 interface is insufficient to maintain a viable avidin dimer. Disruption of the 1 → 2 and 1 → 4 intermonomer interactions apparently causes changes in the tertiary structure of the avidin monomer, since the monomer is more labile than the tetramer to protease K treatment. In the conditions where proteinase K cleaves wild-type avidin at only one position (18Ellison D. Hinton J. Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), monoavidin was completely digested into small peptides. Moreover, immuochemical analysis using polyclonal anti-avidin antibodies revealed a reduction of cross-reactivity with monoavidin, and monoclonal antibodies (elicited against the native avidin tetramer) failed to react with the avidin monomer. Monomeric avidin columns have been described in the past for isolation of biotinylated materials. The immobilized monomers were produced by treating native egg-white avidin columns with strong chemical denaturants (7Green N.M. Toms E.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Kohanski R.A. Lane M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Henrikson K.P. Allen S.H.G. Maloy W.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the avidin monomers tend to form tetramers spontaneously, despite the fact that the immobilized monomers are covalently bound to the resin (7Green N.M. Toms E.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Once formed, the tetramers again bind biotin irreversibly. To preserve the reversibility of such columns, they are commonly stored in the presence of denaturant, but the long term utility of the column is thus compromised. The stable monoavidin described in the present communication provides a more effective and advantageous component for such columns. In addition, strategies for producing avidin-based fusion proteins would benefit from the use of monomeric avidin as a fusion partner, compared with using avidin tetramers. If a fusion partner (like avidin or streptavidin) has an intrinsic propensity toward oligomerization, the mature fusion protein would likely form higher order aggregates with undesirable physicochemical properties that would interfere with their intended function. It is not surprising that, to date, the most successful (strept)avidin-containing fusion proteins have included relatively small proteins as fusion partners, such as hevein fused to avidin (27Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Alenius H. Mikkola J. Kalkkinen N. Arif S.A. Yeang H.Y. Palosuo T. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Karisola P.

Mallett R. Wilbert S. Axworthy D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6663-6669PubMed Google Scholar). The reversible biotin-binding characteristics of monoavidin are also advantageous for isolation of monoavidin-containing fusion proteins. To date, the most popular affinity purification protocols for avidin have utilized 2-iminobiotin as an affinity matrix. The relevant protocols include a binding step under conditions of high pH (>10), whereas the elution step is accomplished by lowering the pH to 4 or even lower values (30Fudem-Goldin B. Orr G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many proteins, however, are labile at high or low pH values, and purification procedures that include such conditions may lead to inactive fusion products. Consequently, the reversible biotin- binding properties of monoavidin are amenable to protocols that require physiological binding conditions and mild elution with biotin. Pérez-Luna et al. (31Pérez-Luna V.H. O'Brien M.J. Opperman K.A. Hampton P.D. López G.P. Klumb L.A. Stayton P.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6469-6478Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have recently studied the wild-type and two tetrameric streptavidin mutants by surface plasmon resonance optical biosensor. They observed that dissociation rates for these streptavidins did not follow the simple first-order kinetics in their experimentation. The reasons for this behavior were proposed to be nonspecific interactions of the bound proteins for non-evenly organized surface, cooperativity of binding to a dense biotin surface caused by multiple binding sites in tetrameric proteins, and/or interactions between adsorbed proteins and tethering effects of the ligand. In contrast, first-order association and dissociation kinetics were obtained for monoavidin using IAsys in the present study. Together with the complete reversibility of biotin binding, the data suggest that the latter phenomena did not significantly affect the observed interactions. Indeed, the lack of cooperativity would not be surprising due to the monovalency of the studied molecule. The character of the surface used for these experiments can also have a strong impact on the kinetic parameters. Edwards et al. (32Edwards P.R. Gill A. Pollard-Knight D.V. Hoare M. Buckle P.E. Lowe P.A. Leatherbarrow R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have compared the binding kinetics of human serum albumin to an antibody immobilized either to a dextran matrix or to an aminosilane surface. They found that when the dextran matrix was used the binding phenomena followed second-order kinetics due to steric hindrance between the binding matrix and the analyte, whereas kinetics obtained by using the aminosilane surface followed first-order kinetics. In this context, the binding analyses were performed on a planar aminosilane surface in the present study. Kohanski and Lane (25Kohanski R.A. Lane M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have previously described association and dissociation values for column-immobilized monomeric avidins (generated from egg white avidin by incubation with chaotropic agents) using radiolabeled biotin. The resultant on and off rates as well as the derived dissociation constant were remarkably similar to those obtained in the present work for monoavidin. In addition comparable affinity constant was determined for monoavidin under soluble conditions using fluorescence spectrophotometry. Finally, similar association and dissociation rates have recently been reported for monomeric streptavidin mutants (23Qureshi M.H. Yeung J.C., Wu, S.C. Wong S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46422-46428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the current study demonstrates how the use of the rational mutagenesis can be used to disrupt the extraordinary stability of the avidin tetramer in producing functional monomers by changing only two structurally important amino acids. The resultant monoavidin is appropriate as a reversible biotin-binding component of affinity columns and fusion proteins for use in developing novel applications of the (strept) avidin-biotin system.

Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). This results in a series of phosphorylation events that occur through the activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/Stat) pathway (1Nelms K. Keegan A.D.

IL-4 engagement of the receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-1 and Jak-3, which leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-4Rα chain itself. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues act as docking sites for signaling molecules such as Stat6. Stat6 is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor necessary for the induction of expression of IL-4-responsive genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu.

Although it is recognized that the down-modulation of activated Stats is important, few studies have focused on this aspect of the Jak/Stat pathway. Tyrosine dephosphorylation of signaling proteins has been recognized as one mechanism underlying the regulation of signal transduction by many receptors. Recently, there has been progress in delineating the role of phosphatases that bind to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) sequences in the cytoplasmic domains of signaling receptors. ITIMs have been found in the cytoplasmic domains of the FcγRIIb1 immunoglobulin receptor, killer inhibitory receptors, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 molecules and function in the generation of negative regulatory signals by these receptors (7Scharenberg A.M.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 599-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the SH2-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), but not SHP-1, directly dephosphorylates cytoplasmic Stat5 in an in vitro tyrosine phosphatase assay with purified proteins. There have been several studies analyzing the role of SHP-1 in Stat6 activation; however, the reports contradict one another. One report (13Haque S.J. Harbor P. Tabrizi M., Yi, T. Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33893-33896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) states that Stat6 activation by IL-4 is significantly enhanced in pre-B-cells derived from motheaten (SHP-1 mutant) mice compared with normal pre-B-cells derived from control animals. Alternatively, another report (14White E.D. Andrews R.P. Hershey G.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 825-830PubMed Google Scholar) states that SHP-1 is not a negative regulator of IL-4 signaling in bone marrow-derived mast cells. Although these overall results differ, they suggest that there may be a role for protein-tyrosine phosphatases in regulating Jak/Stat pathways. Several recent studies (15Losman J.A. Chen X.P.

Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar,18Naka T. Narazaki M.

SOCS family members modulate signaling by several mechanisms that include blocking access of the Stats to receptor-binding sites and ubiquitination of the Janus kinases and their subsequent targeting to the proteasome (19Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. Stem Cells. 2002; 19: 378-387Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the de-ubiquitinating enzyme DUB-2 can prolong Stat5 phosphorylation induced by IL-2 (20Migone T.S. Humbert M. Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The SOCS family is also believed to regulate the Jak/Stat pathway by interfering with the function of the Jak kinases (17Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar, 18Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A.

Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-2-induced SOCS-2 has been shown to inhibit IL-2 responses in a classical negative feedback loop (22Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SOCS-1 in a murine B-cell line resulted in decreased Jak1 phosphorylation, decreased Stat6 phosphorylation, and decreased CD23 expression (15Losman J.A. Chen X.P. Hilton D. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3770-3774PubMed Google Scholar). SOCS proteins may be acting in a classic negative feedback loop to suppress the Jak-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6. Although there is considerable understanding of the IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6, little is known about the regulation of its inactivation. Therefore, to characterize the regulation of Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation, we analyzed the rate of dephosphorylation after IL-4 removal and Jak kinase inhibition in a variety of cell types. The results presented herein indicate that the loss of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 is regulated by the rapid action of a tyrosine phosphatase and the action of proteasome-mediated protein degradation.

Sodium orthovanadate was obtained from ICN (Aurora, OH) and was dissolved in PBS prior to use. Anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody, 11B11, was a gift from C. Watson and Dr. W. E. Paul (Laboratory of Immunology, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Human blood was diluted in PBS, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque. Cells were activated with plate-bound OKT3 (gift from Dr. Yufang Shi) for 72 h at 37 °C to obtain primary activated T-lymphocytes. Human B-cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the B-cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Briefly, cells were stimulated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C and subjected to a pulse-washout experiment. The cells were washed three times in complete 37 °C media, resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and then cultured in the absence of cytokine. Subcellular fractionation was performed using NE-PER nuclear and Cytoplasmic extraction reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Briefly, cells were stimulated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C and subjected to a pulse-washout experiment. The cells were washed three times in complete 37 °C media, resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and then treated with sodium orthovanadate, MG132, lactacystin, actinomycin D, or cycloheximide at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by dilution in ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors). The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The precipitates were washed in lysis buffer and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels before transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were then probed with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, RC20-HRPO (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The bound antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Where indicated, the blots were stripped and probed with control antibodies. Band intensities were analyzed using the public domain software NIH Image. Data were graphed, and slopes were analyzed using CA-Cricket Graph III. Total RNA was isolated from M12.4.1 cells using RNA-Bee Isolation of RNA (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Equivalent amounts of RNA (10 μg per lane) were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde. The RNA was then transferred onto Nytran membranes and cross-linked by exposure to UV light. The membranes were then hybridized and washed according to standard procedures. The SOCS-1 probe was a 724-bpXbaI fragment of a full-length murine SOCS-1 cDNA (16Dickensheets H.L. Venkataraman C. Schindler U. Donnely R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10800-10805Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Gel-purified insert DNA was radiolabeled by the random-primer method. Even though Stat6 is one of the major signaling molecules activated by IL-4, there has been little research into the kinetics and regulation of Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been shown that B-cells must be in contact with IL-4 for an extended period to become activated, and the minimum time for half-maximal activation of biological responses is 12 h (27Rabin E.M. Mond J.J. Ohara J. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that transient Stat6 activation after exposure to IL-4 is not sufficient to induce CD23 expression (28Andrews R.P. Ericksen M.B. Cunningham C.M. Daines M.O. Hershey G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36563-36569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, B-cells produce little IgE unless IL-4 is present for at least 2 days of culture (29Snapper C.M. Finkelman F.D. Paul W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These responses require the activity of Stat6. It has been reported that Stat6 DNA binding activity is rapidly activated in B-cells by IL-4 and remains that way for up to 24 h (6Schindler C. Kashleva H. Pernis A. Pine R. Rothman P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To analyze the kinetics and longevity of Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation, we analyzed several different B-lymphocyte lines. M12.4.1 cells (a murine B-lymphoma), Ramos cells (a human B-cell line), and normal human B-cells purified from peripheral blood were treated with IL-4 for various times, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. In the continuous presence of IL-4, Stat6 was rapidly phosphorylated and remained phosphorylated for extended periods (up to 16 h in this experiment) (Fig. 1 A). These results are consistent with previous studies showing Stat6 activation in murine B-cells for 24–48 h after IL-4 treatment (6Schindler C. Kashleva H. Pernis A. Pine R. Rothman P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and suggest that if IL-4 is continuously present, the overall pool of Stat6 remains tyrosine-phosphorylated. As long as IL-4 is present, a constant level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 is maintained. This implies the presence of an equilibrium between the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 and the dephosphorylation of phospho-Stat6. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 will be referred to as the forward reaction, and the dephosphorylation of Stat6 will be referred to as the reverse reaction of this cycle. Although it is known that the Jaks drive the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6, it is not known what mechanisms are involved in the dephosphorylation of Stat6. To determine whether Stat6 could remain phosphorylated in the absence of IL-4 signaling the forward reaction, we first determined the concentration of AG490, an inhibitor of the Jak kinases, capable of blocking the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 (Fig. 1 B). We found that 25 μm AG490 blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 by 83%, and 100 μm AG490 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 by 100%. To determine whether Stat6 could remain phosphorylated in the absence of IL-4 signaling, M12.4.1 cells were treated with IL-4 for either 15 min or 2 h; the cytokine was washed away, and the cells were then cultured in the absence of cytokine but in the presence or absence of 50 μm AG490. The level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 in the cytoplasmic fraction was assessed at various time points following cytokine removal and addition of AG490 (Fig. 2 A). After removal of IL-4, the levels of detectable Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation declined over time in a similar fashion in the presence or absence of AG490 indicating that the removal of IL-4 was sufficient to stop significant forward phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained when an anti-IL-4 antibody, 11B11, was used to terminate IL-4 signaling. 3E. M. Hanson, unpublished observations. The Western blots were scanned; densitometry was performed using NIH-Image, and the ratio of phosphorylated Stat6 to total Stat6 protein was calculated. This ratio was plotted against time, and a t 12 for dephosphorylation was calculated (Fig. 2 B). In M12.4.1 cells, the half-life of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 after a 15-min stimulation with IL-4 was 1.8 h (media slope = −0.37, AG490 slope = −0.40), compared with a half-life of 1.2 h after a 2-h IL-4 stimulation (media slope = −0.38, AG490 slope = −0.36). In order to determine whether the above results are observed in more than one cell type, several different IL-4-responsive cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origins were analyzed in the same manner as the M12.4.1 cells. A more rapid loss of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 after a long stimulation than after a short stimulation was also observed in U937, THP-1, and primary T-cells (Table I). The length of IL-4 treatment did not affect the length of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 in A1.1, A549, or Calu-3 cell lines (Table I). The relative levels of tyrosine phosphorylation at the zero time point for both the 15-min and 2-h simulation periods were similar. These results suggest that as long as IL-4 is present, Stat6 remains tyrosine-phosphorylated, and after IL-4 removal, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 declines over time. The results also suggest that the half-life of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 can be dependent upon the length of IL-4 treatment in several cell types.Table IDecay of Stat6 phosphorylation in various cell typesCell line nameCell type or tissue sourceHalf-life IL-4 for 15 minHalf-life IL-4 for 2 hminM12.4.1Murine B-cells9565U937Human monocytic10065THP-1Human monocytic7060Primary T cellsHuman blood150100A1.1Murine T hybridoma6060A549Human epithelial, lung carcinoma135135Calu-3Human epithelial, lung carcinoma100100Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml murine or human IL-4 for either 15 min or 2 h; the cytokine was washed away, and the cells were cultured in the absence of cytokine.

Densitometry was performed using NIH Image 1.62 in order to calculate the ratio of phosphorylated Stat6 protein to total Stat6 protein. CA-Cricket Graph III was used to generate the best-fit lines. Results are representative of three experiments. It is possible that the regulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 differs between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Therefore, M12.4.1 cells were stimulated with IL-4, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared by subcellular fractionation. In the absence of IL-4 signaling, Stat6 does not become tyrosine-phosphorylated, and there is noticeably more total Stat6 protein in the cytoplasmic compartment compared with the nuclear compartment (Fig. 3 A, 1st and2nd lanes). Upon IL-4 signaling, Stat6 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated which is evident in both compartments (Fig. 3 A, 3rd and 4th lanes), but there was much more tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 in the cytoplasmic compartment than the nuclear compartment. There was also an increase of total nuclear Stat6 protein after IL-4 treatment over the amount observed in the unstimulated nuclear fraction, which indicates some movement of Stat6 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus upon IL-4 signaling. To analyze the decay of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 in the nuclear compartment, M12.4.1 cells were treated with IL-4 for either 15 min or 2 h; the cytokine was washed away; the cells were then cultured in the absence of cytokine, and subcellular fractionation was performed to obtain the nuclear fraction of the cells. The level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 was assessed at various time points following cytokine removal and subcellular fractionation (Fig. 3 B). As explained previously, the scans of the Western blots were used to determine the ratio of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 to total Stat6 protein. The nuclear lysate was probed with Sp1, a nuclear protein, to confirm proper subcellular fractionation. After removal of IL-4, the level of detectable Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation declined over time in the nuclear compartment in a similar fashion to the cytoplasmic compartment (compare Figs. 2 and 3). However, the half-life of nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 after a 15-min or 2-h stimulation with IL-4 was similar (t 12 = 1.2). These results suggest that the difference in the half-lives of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 between the 15-min (t 12 = 1.8) and 2-h (t 12 = 1.2) stimulation observed in Fig. 2 corresponds to a mechanism specific to the cytoplasmic compartment. The majority of investigations on cytokines has focused on the mechanisms by which they activate signaling pathways. However, it is clear that the actions of cytokines are limited in both magnitude and duration, making it important to understand the mechanisms by which their actions are negatively controlled (30Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). There are several different mechanisms that could cause the decay of IL-4-induced activated Stat6. The fact that a longer stimulation by IL-4 resulted in a rapid loss of cytoplasmic tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 raised the possibility of a regulatory feedback loop. IL-4 stimulation could cause the expression of new genes that may act negatively upon IL-4 signaling, such as a SOCS family member. Previously, it has been shown that the IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 is not dependent on new protein synthesis (6Schindler C. Kashleva H. Pernis A. Pine R. Rothman P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether new protein synthesis is required for thedecay of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6, we stimulated cells with IL-4 for 15 min or 2 h in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. Subsequently, IL-4 was removed, and the cells were cultured in the absence of cytokine but in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 4, we found that the decay of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 was similar in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. These results indicate that induction of new protein synthesis is not required to regulate the decay of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6. Furthermore, cycloheximide did not alter the changes in the half-life of cytoplasmic tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 induced by longer IL-4 treatment. We also found that SOCS-1 mRNA was induced by IL-4 stimulation in M12.4.1 cells and that this induction was blocked by actinomycin D (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained for U937 cells where the primary IL-4-induced gene was cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein. 4H. Dickensheets and R. P. Donnelly, unpublished observations.

Hb is a tetrameric protein consisting of α- and β-globin subunits that show a characteristic affinity for oxygen with allosteric effects on various metabolites (1Kelman G.R. Nunn J.F. J. Appl.

In the literature, more than 1,000 variants of Hb have been reported (3Chui D.H. Hardison R. Riemer C. Miller W. Carver M.F. Molchanova T.P. Efremov G.D. Huisman T.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2643-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some exhibited an altered oxygen affinity, either higher or lower, while maintaining the stability of Hb. Hb Titusville (HbTitu) is a low affinity variant of the α-globin chain and is well characterized clinically (4Schneider R.G. Atkins R.J. Hosty T.S. Tomlin G. Casey R. Lehmann H. Lorkin P.A. Nagai K.

In the present study, we generated mutant mice carrying an homologous mutation with Titusville (Aspα94 → Asn) at the α1 locus or with Presbyterian (Asnβ108 → Lys) at the β-major locus of the mouse genome by a targeted knock-in strategy to generate a murine model of the Titusville and Presbyterian hemoglobinopathies. With the targeted knock-in strategy, the autologous locus control region, as well as the erythropoietin enhancer element, can be kept intact without altering the regulation of endogenous gene expression. Therefore, the knock-in α-globin or β-globin allele physiologically reacts to stimuli such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and erythropoietin. Thus, the model is physiologically relevant and can be used for in vivophysiological analysis of variant Hb. In fact, Titusville heterozygous mice and Presbyterian heterozygous mice both mimic the clinical and laboratory findings of humans with Titusville Hb and Presbyterian Hb, respectively. We surprisingly found in the present study that Titusville mice, as well as Presbyterian mice, showed enhanced tissue oxygenation, increased O2 consumption and CO2 production in tissue metabolism, and an increased running capacity and propensity that resulted in altered behavior with greater physical activity despite mild anemia. Taken together with the human data, the results in the mutant mice implied that Hb determined basic biological parameters such as erythropoiesis, metabolism, physical competence, and behavior. Hb α1 globin gene knock-in mice with the Titusville mutation were obtained by replacing Asp-94 of the α1 globin gene with Asn as described below. The 129-mouse genomic library in λFIXII (Stratagene, CA) was screened with the 372-bp 5′ flanking sequence of the murine α1 globin gene (nucleotides 1–372; GenBankTM accession number V00714) as a probe. Two overlapping clones covered all exons of the gene. The 1.0-kb fragment containing all α1 globin exons was amplified with a SpeI/AflII-anchored primer (5′-GGA CTA GTC TTA AGA GAC TCA GGA AGA AAC C-3′) andXhoI/AflII-anchored primer (5′-CCT CTA GAC TCG AGC TTA AGG TAG GCA TCC AAT TAT GCT T-3′). TheSpeI/XhoI-restricted α1 globin fragment was mutagenized with a 21-bp mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-GCT GCG TGT GAA TCC CGT CAA-3′) using the pALTER system (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). The introduced mutation, D94N, was confirmed by sequencing. The 2.2-kb short homologous fragment was PCR-amplified with aXhoI-anchored primer (5′-CCG CTC GAG TCC TTG AGC CAA AGA AGC CA-3′) and ApaI/SalI-anchored primer (5′-TTG GGC CCG TCG ACT CTG CCC GCT GGC TGA GCT C-3′). TheSpeI/XhoI-restricted α1 globin fragment andXhoI/ApaI-restricted short 3′ homologous fragment were sequentially inserted into aSpeI/ApaI-restricted pBSII SK vector. The long 6.8-kb homologous fragment was amplified with aNotI-anchored primer (5′-ATT TGC GGC CGC TGG CAT TCA CAG AGC TCA CCA-3′) and SpeI-anchored primer (5′-GGA CTA GTG TCA GAA TCA GAA GTG TCT TGG-3′). The NotI/SpeI-restricted 5′ long homologous fragment was inserted into the targeting construct. The 1.3-kb MC1neo cassette flanked by loxp sequences was PCR-amplified from pMC1neo-loxp vector (14Taniguchi M. Sanbo M. Watanabe S. Naruse I. Mishina M. Yagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with aSalI-anchored primer (5′-CGC GTC GAC ATA ACT TCG TAT AAT G-3′) and SalI/EcoRI-anchored primer (5′-CGC GTC GAC GAA TTC ATC GAT ACC GGC GAC ATA-3′). The SalI-restricted MC1neo-loxp cassette was inserted into theXhoI-restricted targeting construct. The resulting construct containing the short and long homologous fragments, the mutagenized α1 globin gene, and the neomycin gene was restricted withNotI/SalI and recloned into the targeting vector, pMC1DT-A (B) (Oriental Koubo). The vector was then linearized with NotI and used for the electroporation of embryonic stem cells. Genomic DNA from each of 240 G418-resistant embryonic stem clones was digested with EcoRI and screened for the homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis using an 800-bp 3′ probe. One embryonic stem clone with the expected homologous recombination was used for generating chimeric mice by the aggregation method as described (15Nagy Z.P. Joris H. Liu J. Staessen C. Devroey P. Van Steirteghem A.C. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 8: 2180-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The chimeric mice were cross-bred with C57BL/6CrSlc (Nihon SLC), and the germline transmission was confirmed by PCR amplification with the primers p1 (5′-TTC CTT GCC TCT GTG AGC-3′) and p2 (5′-TGG GAC CGA GCC ATC TTC-3′) in agouti offspring. Hb β-globin gene knock-in mice with the Presbyterian mutation were obtained by replacing Asn-108 of the β-globin gene with Lys as described previously (16Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Sakai H. Tamaki M. Koizumi K. Kuriyama T. Tsuchida E. Koseki H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The chimeric mice were cross-bred with C57BL/6CrSlc, and the germline transmission was confirmed by PCR amplification with the primers p3 (5′-ACC CAG CGG TAC TTT GAT AGC-3′) and p4 (5′-GCT ACT GAA GCT GTC TAA GGC AAC AGG-3′) in agouti offspring. Blood samples from mice and humans were collected into EDTA-treated tubes. Erythrocytes were washed in cold 0.85% NaCl, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in 4 volumes of distilled water. The hemolysate was then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The hemoglobin concentration was determined with a Wako hemoglobin test (Wako Chemicals). The hemolysate was then separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Develosil ODS 300C4-HG-5 column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nomura Chemicals). Globin peaks were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a liner gradient of 36–52% acetonitrile (0.4%/min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as described previously (16Suzuki Y. Shimizu T. Sakai H.

Nunomura K. Ohta S. Shimonishi Y. Ikegami S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12071-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Oxygen equilibrium studies of washed erythrocytes and Hb solution were carried out using a Hemox analyzer (TCS Products, Southampton, PA) at 37 °C. For examination of the Bohr effect, hemolysates were concentrated with Ultrafree 30,000 (Millipore) and dialyzed in the same 50 mmHEPES buffer, containing 100 mm NaCl, at pH 7.0, 7.4, and 7.8. For examination of the chloride effect, concentrated hemolysates prepared as described above were dialyzed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing a chloride ion concentration of 0, 50, 150, and 500 mm NaCl. Male wild-type (n = 8), and Presbyterian (n= 9) mice (12 weeks old) were anesthetized with ether for setting in a double-chamber plethysmograph and inserting an O2 electrode with a thermocouple (Clark-type electrode; Unique Medical) to measure PtiO2. The O2 electrode was inserted through a guide tube into the left gastrocnemius muscle. The output from the electrode was adjusted to the muscle temperature and continuously displayed on a digital monitor (POG-203; Unique Medical, Japan), being recorded on an analogue tape recorder. The electrode was calibrated with room air before and after each experiment. Respiratory variables were also measured with a double-chamber plethysmograph as described previously (18Izumizaki M. Iwase M. Kimura H. Kuriyama T. Homma I. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Respiratory frequency (f; breaths/min) was determined as 60/total breath duration. Tidal volume (Vt) was calculated using the equation Vt = (273 + Tb)/(273 + Tam) × (760 − PamH2O)/(760 − PbH2O) × 0.5/Vcal × VtATPS, where Tb is rectal temperature (°C); Tam is ambient temperature (°C); PamH2O and PbH2O are the water vapor pressures (mmHg) in the ambient air and the alveoli, respectively; and VtATPS is Vt at ambient temperature, pressure, saturated (ATPS) without calibration (ml). The volume injected into the head chamber was 0.5 (ml ATPS) for calibration, recorded as Vcal (ml ATPS) on the personal computer. Minute lung ventilation (V˙e; ml body temperature, pressure, saturated) was determined as f×.VT and normalized with respect to body weight per 10 g. Each mouse was allowed to acclimate to the chambers (fraction of inspired O2; FIO2 = 0.21) for at least 60 min before the hypoxic gas challenge, and a constant level of baseline PtiO2 was achieved. Subsequently mice were exposed to a hypoxic gas (FIO2 = 0.15) for 5 min. A gas mixture was delivered from a respiratory gas circuit consisting of flow meters for O2 and N2 and a reservoir bottle (2 liters) connected to the head chamber. FIO2 was altered by mixing O2 and N2, being continuously monitored by withdrawing a small fraction of the gas mixture (20 ml/min) with an O2 and CO2 analyzer (Respina 1H26; NEC San-ei). V˙e and PtiO2 were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. ΔPtiO2 (mmHg) was calculated as the difference between baseline PtiO2 and PtiO2 at each time point. Male wild-type (n = 5), Titusville (n = 5), and Presbyterian (n= 5) mice (12 weeks old) were used. An arterial catheter (BC-1P; Access Technology) was implanted in the left carotid artery under anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital; 25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for blood gas analysis. Mice were placed in the plethysmograph for 2 h to recover from the anesthesia and subjected to a hypoxic challenge comparable with that used to obtain V˙e and PtiO2. Arterial blood (120 μl) was sampled with a heparinized sampling glass tube (MC0020; AVL Scientific Corporation) and immediately analyzed by a blood gas analyzer (OPTI CCA; AVL Scientific Corporation) for pH, partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2), and partial pressure of arterial O2 (PaO2). Arterial blood was sampled before and at the end of hypoxic gas inhalation. O2 consumption (ml standard temperature, pressure, dry), CO2 production (ml standard temperature, pressure, dry), and respiratory exchange rate were measured during normoxia and hypoxia with an open circuit system (ARCO-1000; ARCO Systems) in male wild-type (n = 4), Titusville (n = 5), and Presbyterian (n = 5) mice. Each mouse was set in a chamber where a steady flow of air was delivered continuously by a vacuum pump for the assessment. The system measured the fractions of O2, CO2, and N2 in the in-flow and out-flow of the chamber with a mass spectrometer and the flow rate with a pneumotachograph. The mouse was placed in the chamber for 60 min to acclimatize to the surroundings before the experiments. The metabolic factors were measured under normoxic conditions and then the hypoxic gas (FIO2 = 0.15) was delivered from the respiratory gas circuit to the metabolic chamber. Measurements were made during a 5-min steady state period 20 min after the onset of hypoxic gas exposure. O2 consumption and CO2 production were normalized with respect to body weight per kg. The right tibialis anterior muscle was removed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally). The muscle was placed on cork, stretched to itsin vivo length, and quickly frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Serial transverse sections, 10 μm thick, of the mid-belly of the muscle, were cut in a cryostat set at −20 °C. The sections were brought to room temperature and air-dried for 30 min. The sections were stained for ATPase activity following acid (pH 4.5) preincubation for fiber typing. The muscle fibers were classified as type IIA and type IIB (19Hirofuji C. Nakatani T. Ishihara A. Tanaka M. Itoh K. Itoh M. Katsuta S. Ibata Y. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 33: 295-303Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SDH activities were used for comparisons among fibers of different types (19Hirofuji C. Nakatani T. Ishihara A. Tanaka M. Itoh K. Itoh M. Katsuta S. Ibata Y. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 33: 295-303Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cross-sectional areas and SDH activities of ∼50 fibers from each of a deep (close to the bone), middle (between the deep and superficial), and superficial (near the surface of the muscle) regions of the muscle were determined using a computer-assisted image processing system. These regions were selected for analysis, because the tibialis anterior muscle shows an increasing gradient of fibers having high oxidative enzymatic activity proceeding from the superficial to the deep aspect of the muscle. The sections were digitized as gray scale images and quantified as one of 256 gray levels (20Ishihara A. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A gray level value of 0 was equivalent to a 100% transmission of light whereas that of 255 was equivalent to 0% transmission. The mean optical density value within a fiber was determined using a calibration tablet that has 21 steps of gradient density ranges and corresponding diffused density values. Wild-type (n= 5), Titusville (n = 5), and Presbyterian (n = 5) male mice (15 weeks old) were voluntarily exercised for 28 days using a running wheel apparatus in which distance can be monitored electronically (21Ishihara A. Roy R.R. Ohira Y. Ibata Y. Edgerton V.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 2183-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This apparatus includes a standard plastic cage (20.0 × 30.0 × 12.0 cm) and a running wheel (width 5.0 cm, diameter 25.5 cm) attached vertically to a freely rotating shaft inserted into a metal controller box that is supported on a metal base. The running wheel rotates on the shaft whenever the mouse walks or runs in either direction, and the number of revolutions of the running wheel is recorded continuously. Two females, 31 and 29 years old, who were non-smokers and healthy, were analyzed in this study. Genomic DNA analysis was approved by the ethical committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, and written informed consent was obtained. Genomic DNAs were prepared from whole blood by GenTLE (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) for PCR. 1,118-bp fragments were amplified using a sense primer (5′-ACC CAG AGG TTC TTT GAG TC-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TCT GAT AGG CAG CCT GCA CT-3′). The PCR products were isolated and sequenced with a nested sense primer (5′-CTG GGT TAA GGC AAT AGC-3′) by the dye terminator method. Arterial blood gas analysis was carried out with a pH-blood gas analyzer (Bayer medical 860). To generate mutant mice with a greater capacity to deliver O2, we first searched for mutant Hbs with altered oxygen affinity in the medical literature. We found that individuals with a variant Hb of higher affinity such as Yakima Hb and Malmo Hb usually manifested polycythemia (10Fairbanks V.F. Maldonado J.E. Charache S. Boyer S.H. Mayo Clin.

These medical profiles prompted us to explore the possibility that the variant Hbs with lower affinity improve O2 delivery to the peripheral tissues in the physiological state. To test this hypothesis, we generated two distinct models, Titusville Hb mice and Presbyterian Hb mice. Titusville Hb is composed of a variant α chain with Asn-94, an amino acid substitution in the α/β interfaces, whereas Presbyterian Hb is composed of a variant β chain with Lys-108 protruding into the central cavity of the Hb molecule. These two hemoglobinopathies thus have distinct mechanisms for altering the affinity of Hb for oxygen but a common clinical phenotype such as anemia, suggesting that the lowered affinity of Hb generally enhances, whereas the raised affinity generally suppresses, O2 delivery in the peripheral tissues. In addition, Presbyterian Hb confers a novel allosteric effect with the variant Lys residue interacting with the Cl− ion in the central cavity, but Titusville Hb showed no allosteric effect. Therefore, by means of these two models, we can devise multiple strategies to enhance O2 delivery either by manipulating α-globin and β-globin or by using a novel allosteric effect. As schematized in Fig. 1, the homologous recombination in the mouse α-globin or β-globin genome with target vectors replaced the α1 exon or β major exon with a modified α1 carrying Asn-94 (Fig. 1 A) or β major carrying Lys-108 (Fig. 1 B), respectively. The intercrossing of heterozygous mice successfully generated fertile homozygous mice. Southern blot analyses (data not shown) and PCR amplification of α-globin or β-globin genomes (Fig. 1, E and F) confirmed the expected homologous recombination. The homozygous and heterozygous mice were born viable, grew normally, and were fertile. Sequence analyses of PCR products from homozygous mice further confirmed the expected αD94N mutation in Titusville mice (Fig. 1 C) and βN108K mutation in Presbyterian mice (Fig. 1 D). To confirm whether the knock-in allele productively expressed the mutated α- or β-chain, we biochemically characterized the hemoglobin prepared from mutant mice. To separate α- and β-globin chains, purified hemoglobins were applied to an RP-HPLC column under acidic conditions. HPLC profiles of Hb prepared from Titusville mice or Presbyterian mice showed double peaks for the α chain or β chain (Fig. 1 G,middle and lower). Based on the profiles, we estimated that ∼15% of the Hb in the peripheral blood of Titusville mice consists of HbTitu whereas ∼30% of that in Presbyterian mice consists of HbPres. The medical literature on individuals with mutant hemoglobinopathies revealed the expression level of HbTitu to be 34.7% (4Schneider R.G. Atkins R.J. Hosty T.S. Tomlin G. Casey R. Lehmann H. Lorkin P.A. Nagai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 400: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and HbPres to be 29.9–41.7% (6Moo-Penn W.F. Wolff J.A. Simon G. Vacek M. Jue D.L. Johnson M.H. FEBS Lett. 1978; 92: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Kohne E. Behnken L.J. Leupold D. Rogge H. Martin H. Kleihauer E.

We therefore characterized heterozygous Titusville mice and heterozygous Presbyterian mice in this study as animal models for variant hemoglobinopathies with lower oxygen affinity. In the peripheral blood, red blood cells of Titusville mice showed normal hemograms whereas Presbyterian mice showed mild anemia (Hb 14.8 ± 0.8 versus12.9 ± 1.1 g/dl, p < 0.05; see Table I) without signs of hemolysis (reticulocytes 1.7 ± 0.2%versus 1.6 ± 0.7%; see Table I), suggesting that these model mice mimic the human cases well (4Schneider R.G.

To characterize the physiochemical properties of HbTitu, HbPres, and double mutant HbTitu, Pres, we assessed the oxygen dissociation of red blood cells prepared from Titusville mice, Presbyterian mice, and Titusville/Presbyterian double mutant mice. In oxygen dissociation plots, HbPres showed a rightward shift in comparison with wild-type Hb (Fig. 2 A, P 50= 43.5 versus 47.0 mmHg) whereas HbTitu and HbTitu, Pres exhibited even more extensive rightward shifts as shown in Fig. 2 (P 50 = 66.0 or 72.0, respectively). Analyses of Hill's plot and the Bohr effect, however, indicated that HbPres retained all physiochemical properties (Fig. 2, B and C) whereas HbTitu or HbTitu, Pres showed a reduced Hill's coefficient, suggesting that the Titusville, but not Presbyterian, mutation conferred the reduced incorporation of Hb as reported previously in human cases (4Schneider R.G.

As for de novo allosteric effects, we investigated the influence of Cl−. Interestingly, Cl− stabilized the deoxy state of HbPres in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the introduced Lys residue protrudes into the central cavity to bind to Cl− ion as suggested in the previous model (Fig. 2 D). Presbyterian mice were exposed to 15% O2 for 5 min to investigate the physiological effects of HbPres on tissue hypoxia in vivo. ΔPtiO2 and Ve values during hypoxia are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively.

To investigate the mechanism of functional switch to protease, we determined the crystal structure of the NH2-terminal protease domain (PD) of HtrA fromThermotoga maritima, which was shown to retain both proteolytic and chaperone-like activities. Three subunits of HtrA PD compose a trimer, and multimerization architecture is similar to that found in the crystal structures of intact HtrA hexamer fromEscherichia coli and human HtrA2 trimer. HtrA PD shares the same fold with chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, but it contains an additional lid that blocks access the of substrates to the active site. A corresponding lid found in E. coli HtrA is a long loop that also blocks the active site of another subunit. These results suggest that the activation of the proteolytic function of HtrA at elevated temperatures might occur by a conformational change, which includes the opening of the helical lid to expose the active site and subsequent rearrangement of a catalytic triad and an oxyanion hole.

Protein quality control, which is essential for cell viability, is tightly controlled by proteases and molecular chaperones (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Google Scholar). Especially under stress conditions such as high temperature, heat-shock proteins, which are mostly proteases or molecular chaperones, are induced to protect cells from toxic denatured proteins (2Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones bind to the hydrophobic patches on denatured proteins to prevent further aggregation and help them to fold back into their native states (3Büchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Google Scholar). The regulatory subunits of heat-shock proteases (4Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Cell. 1997; 91: 435-438Google Scholar) recognize the hydrophobic surface on unfolded proteins and eliminate them mostly in an ATP-dependent manner (5Goldberg A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 9-23Google Scholar). High temperature requirement A (HtrA, 1The abbreviations used are: HtrA, high temperature requirement A; CS, citrate synthase; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; PD, protease domain; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviations; Tm, Thermotoga maritima. also called DegP or protease Do) is a heat-shock protease localized in the periplasmic space of bacteria (6Pallen M.J.

It shows an ATP-independent proteolytic activity and plays an important role in the degradation of misfolded proteins accumulated by heat shock or other stresses (7Lipinska B. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1574-1584Google Scholar). Therefore, its activity seems to be essential for bacterial thermotolerance and for cell survival at high temperatures (7Lipinska B. Fayet O. Baird L. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1574-1584Google Scholar). HtrA is also involved in pathogenesis of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria by degrading damaged proteins that are produced by reactive oxygen species released from the host defense system (8Jones C.H. Bolken T.C. Jones K.F. Zeller G.O. Hruby D.E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5538-5545Google Scholar). Therefore, HtrA is considered as a target for development of broad-spectrum antibiotics (8Jones C.H. Bolken T.C. Jones K.F. Zeller G.O. Hruby D.E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5538-5545Google Scholar). In addition to proteolytic activity, HtrA is known to have a molecular chaperone activity (9Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Google Scholar, 10Misra R. Castillo-Keller K. Deng M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4882-4888Google Scholar). The chaperone function is dominant at low temperatures, whereas the proteolytic activity is turned on at elevated temperatures (9Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Google Scholar). This temperature-dependent functional switch is necessary for controlling protein stability as well as eliminating denatured proteins to maintain cellular viability (9Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Google Scholar). HtrA is a highly conserved protein found in species ranging from bacteria to humans. Two known human homologues of bacterial HtrA (HtrA1 and HtrA2) are also expected to be involved in mammalian stress response pathways (11Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Karran E. Turconi S. Rowles A. Viglienghi D. Southan C. Barton A. Fantom K.G. West A. Savopoulos J. Hassan N.J. Clinkenbeard H. Hanning C. Amegadzie B. Davis J.B. Dingwall C. Livi G.P. Creasy C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5699-5710Google Scholar, 12Faccio L. Fusco C. Chen A. Martinotti S. Bonventre J.V. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2581-2588Google Scholar). However, because HtrA2 showed proteolytic activity even at room temperature, temperature-dependent activation of proteolytic activity seems to be absent from mammalian HtrAs (13Savopoulos J.W. Carter P.S. Turconi S. Pettman G.R. Karran E.H. Gray C.W. Ward R.V. Jenkins O. Creasy C.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 227-234Google Scholar). HtrA is a serine protease with a catalytic triad in its active site. Recent crystal structure analyses revealed that Escherichia coli HtrA forms a hexameric complex composed of two trimers (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar) and human HtrA2 forms a homotrimer (15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar). Each subunit is composed of one protease domain at the amino terminus and one or two PDZ (named after three proteins, PSD-95, Discs-large, and ZO-1) domains at the carboxyl terminus. The protease domain of E. coli HtrA fully retains the molecular chaperone activity, although the proteolytic activity is absent (9Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Google Scholar). The PDZ domains, also found in the Clp/Hsp100 family of heat-shock proteins, are known to play a role in substrate recognition (16Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of E. coli HtrA and human HtrA2, PDZ domains are proposed to mediate the initial binding of substrates (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar) or to be involved in modulation of protease activity (15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar). However, PDZ domains do not participate in multimerization in both E. coli and human HtrAs (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar, 15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar). Unlike other proteases of the Clp/Hsp100 family, HtrA does not have a regulatory component or an ATP binding domain because it is an ATP-independent heat-shock protease. So far two crystal structures of HtrAs have been reported (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar, 15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar), and they seem to differ in structural architecture, multimerization, and activation mechanism. For a better understanding of the dual role of HtrA and the activation mechanism of the proteolytic function, we have solved the crystal structure of the protease domain (PD, residues 24–262, Fig. 1) of Thermotoga maritima HtrA (Tm HtrA), which displays both molecular chaperone and proteolytic activities. The crystal structure indicates that the rearrangement of the active site of bacterial HtrA is necessary for the proteolytic activity and that oligomerization architecture of HtrA might vary depending on the presence of the lid covering the active site. The protease domain of HtrA from T. maritima (PD, residues 24–262, Fig. 1) was cloned, purified, and crystallized as described elsewhere (18Kim D.Y. Kim K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 170-172Google Scholar). The putative signal sequence (residues 1–23) was deleted in the construct. For the translational start, a methionine residue was added in front of Asp24. Intact HtrA was also prepared in the same way as HtrA PD (18Kim D.Y. Kim K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 170-172Google Scholar). HtrA PD was crystallized in the cubic space group P213, with the unit cell parameters a =b = c = 120.55 Å by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C from a reservoir solution containing 100 mm phosphate-citrate (pH 4.4), 110 mm Li2SO4, and 5% (v/v) PEG 1000 (18Kim D.Y. Kim K.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 170-172Google Scholar). There are two molecules in an asymmetric unit. The chaperone-like activities of HtrA and HtrA PD were measured as described previously (19Büchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Google Scholar) with some modifications using pig heart citrate synthase (CS) as the substrate (Sigma). CS (final 65 μm monomer) was denatured in a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, and 40 mm dithiothreitol for at least 2 h at room temperature. Chemically denatured CS was rapidly diluted 250-fold into a refolding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and HtrA or HtrA PD to reach the indicated molar ratios (Fig. 2). Light scatterings from aggregated proteins were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 320 nm with Spectra MAX Plus (Molecular Device) at 25 °C. Initial velocities of aggregate formation were calculated by measuring the absorbance change for the initial 15 s where the rate of aggregate formation is constant. Thirty micrograms of the reduced form of α-lactalbumin (Sigma) and 28 μg of HtrA PD or 48 μg of HtrA (at 1:2 molar ratio of protease to substrate) were incubated in 60 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 mmTris (pH 7.5) and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol at 25, 45, 65, and 85 °C. The reduced form of α-lactalbumin was prepared by incubating 3 mg/ml protein in 5 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 2 days. HtrA and HtrA PD were preincubated at each indicated temperature prior to the addition of the substrate protein. The reaction was performed in 100-μl tubes to minimize the evaporation effect. After incubation for 30 min at each temperature, 17 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Then, the samples were analyzed by 17% SDS-PAGE. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected from a frozen crystal of HtrA PD at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory beamline 6B with a MacScience 2030b area detector. Data collected at three wavelengths (edge, peak, and remote) were processed and integrated by DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK using the HKL program suite (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Native data of HtrA PD were also collected at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory and processed using the HKL program suite (Table I). Two selenium sites (one methionine in one subunit) of PD were found and used for phase calculation in the program SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar). A relatively low figure of merit (0.25) is explained by the presence of only one selenium atom per 238 residues in the subunit.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsCrystalPDPD-SeMetData collection and phasingWavelength (Å)0.97170.97910.97930.9715Resolution (Å)20.0–2.8 (2.9–2.8)30.0–3.0 (3.11–3.0)30.0–3.0 (3.11–3.30)30.0–3.0 (3.11–3.00)R merge(%)aRmerge = Σ‖I − <I>‖/ΣI.6.6 (27.0)8.0 (32.5)6.3 (28.8)5.8 (29.7)Completeness (%)95.1 (97.2)87.4 (90.6)87.4 (90.3)87.4 (91.1)No. of unique reflections13,843 (1376)10,379 (1047)10,401 (1053)10,423 (1066)Redundancy2.433.203.263.28I/ς15.714.515.415.4Overall figure of meritBefore density modification0.25After density modification0.54RefinementResolution (Å)20.0–2.8R factor/R free(%)bRfactor = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/ΣF obs.22.2/28.4No. reflections (no cutoff)13,621No. solvent atoms58No. protein atoms3,464Mean B factors (Å2)54.8r.m.s.d. in bonds (Å)0.008r.m.s.d. in angles (°)1.53a Rmerge = Σ‖I − <I>‖/ΣI.b Rfactor = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/ΣF obs.

Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Several cycles of rigid body refinement, positional refinement, and simulated annealing were performed at 3.0-Å resolution with CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilgen M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The refinements were continued at 2.8-Å resolution using the data collected from the native HtrA PD. Successive refinement with temperature factors and addition of solvents resulted in anR-value of 22.2% and an R free value of 28.4%, with a bulk solvent correction and overall anisotropic thermal factor refinement. R free was calculated with 10% of the reflections. NCS restraints were enforced during the refinement except flexible regions (LA and L2), in which two subunits in an asymmetric unit showed different conformations. The final model includes residues 24–48 and 51–251 and 58 water molecules (Table I). Structural evaluation of the refined model using PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) reveals that the structure has good geometric parameters (Table I), and no residue falls in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Statistical analysis of B-factor distribution was performed by t test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test.p < 0.001 was considered to be significant. The figures in the article were drawn using the programs MOLSCRIPT (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) and GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar). The final coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; accession number 1L1J). Tm HtrA and Tm HtrA PD were overexpressed in E. coli and purified. The chaperone-like activities of both Tm HtrA and Tm HtrA PD were measured by their abilities to suppress the aggregation of CS, which has been widely used for molecular chaperone assays (19Büchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Google Scholar). The aggregation of CS was monitored by light scattering at 320 nm after chemically denatured CS was diluted in the refolding buffer. Tm HtrA or Tm HtrA PD suppressed CS aggregation, decreasing the initial velocity of aggregate formation (Fig. 2, A andB). By addition of 2- and 4-fold molar excesses of Tm HtrA to CS, the initial velocities of aggregation were decreased to 40.6 and 13.7%, respectively, compared with the initial velocity in the absence of HtrA or HtrA PD. It was decreased to 68.3% when a 4-fold molar excess of Tm HtrA PD was added, whereas 2-fold addition of Tm HtrA PD essentially did not change it (data not shown). An 8-fold excess of either Tm HtrA or Tm HtrA PD was enough to decrease the aggregation rate to about zero. Under the same assay conditions, the initial velocity of the reaction is not decreased when bovine serum albumin was used for the control protein (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that Tm HtrA PD as well as the intact Tm HtrA have the chaperone-like activity to inhibit the aggregation of CS. However, because the enzyme activity of CS was not recovered (data not shown), it seems that Tm HtrA does not assist the refolding of CS, although the aggregation of denaturated CS was completely suppressed by incubation with Tm HtrA. It can be inferred that Tm HtrA exhibited only chaperone-like activity against CS, as is observed for other heat-shock proteins such as α-crystallin (28Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Google Scholar). The molar ratios of chaperones to substrates required for suppression of CS aggregation are different between intact HtrA and HtrA PD (Fig.2), which is also observed for E. coli HtrA and E. coli HtrA PD. In the case of E. coli HtrA, a higher concentration of the protease domain was required for refolding of MalS protein than intact HtrA (9Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Google Scholar). Such a requirement for higher molar ratios of HtrA PD might be explained by the absence of PDZ domains, which are known to be involved in substrate recognition (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar, 15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar, 16Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Google Scholar). α-Lactalbumin, which is commonly used for the assays of heat-shock proteases such as 20 S proteosome (29Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Google Scholar) and E. coli HtrA (30Kim K.I. Park S.C. Kang S.H. Cheong G.W. Chung C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1363-1374Google Scholar), was employed as a substrate to investigate the proteolytic activity of Tm HtrA. Clearly, Tm HtrA displayed the proteolytic activity at elevated temperatures, and maximal activity was observed at 85 °C (Fig. 2 C). As reported for E. coli HtrA (9Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Google Scholar, 31Skorko-Glonek J. Krzewski K. Lipinska B. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11140-11146Google Scholar), the proteolytic activity of Tm HtrA increased with temperature, and Tm HtrA is autodegraded at high temperatures (Fig.2 C). Compared with Tm HtrA, Tm HtrA PD showed a relatively weak proteolytic activity, although its activity also increased with temperature. The degradation products of Tm HtrA PD were long enough to be visible on 17% SDS-PAGE, whereas intact Tm HtrA completely degraded the substrate into short peptides that are not shown in the gel (Fig. 2 C). Such a weak proteolytic activity of Tm HtrA can also be explained by the absence of a PDZ domain. In both E. coli HtrA and human HtrA2, PDZ domains play key roles in substrate binding and formation of the chamber near the active site (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar, 15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar). Tm HtrA PD generates longer degradation products, because substrates are freely released from Tm HtrA PD after cleavage. In contrast, within the chamber of intact Tm HtrA, substrates are cleaved into small peptides simultaneously at adjacent active sites. The crystal structure of Tm HtrA PD (residues 24–262) has been solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at 3.0 Å resolution and refined to 2.8-Å resolution (Table I). The experimental electron density map calculated with multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phases and improved by solvent flattening and NCS averaging was of sufficient quality to locate most main chains and some side chains. Tm HtrA PD is composed of two β-barrel domains connected by a long loop between β6 and β7 (Figs. 3 and4 A). Residues in the catalytic triad, Asp127-His97-Ser206, are located in the cleft of two β-barrels. The structural comparison by DALI server (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) reveals that its topology is similar to proteases in the chymotrypsin family (33Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar). Among the members of the chymotrypsin family, α-lytic protease (PDB accession number 1qq4; Ref. 34Derman A.I. Agard D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 394-397Google Scholar) can be superimposed on Tm HtrA PD with the lowest r.m.s.d. of 2.5 Å for 161 Cα atoms of 198 Cα atoms of α-lytic protease (Figs. 4 Band 5). However, its fold is different from those of proteolytic cores of ATP-dependent proteases such as ClpP (35Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Google Scholar) and HslV (36Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Google Scholar).Figure 4Ribbon diagrams of Tm HtrA PD (A), α-lytic protease (B), E. coli HtrA PD (C), and human HtrA2 PD (D).α-Lytic protease, E. coli HtrA PD, and human HtrA2 PD were positioned in the same orientation with Tm HtrA PD. Two β-barrel domains are green and blue. The regions (LA) connecting β1 and β2 in Tm HtrA PD, E. coli HtrA PD, human HtrA2 PD, and α-lytic protease aremagenta and labeled. In E. coli HtrA PD the loopLA* containing residues 38–79 is pink. LA* is the loop belonging to the subunit in the opposite trimer; E. coli HtrA PD forms a dimer by an interaction at the interface between the loop LA and LA*. Residues 48 and 51 are connected by a dashed line because residues 49 and 50 are not modeled in Tm HtrA PD. The residues in the catalytic triads (Asp, His, and Ser) are drawn as orange stick models. These residues in Tm HtrA PD and E. coli HtrA are blocked by LA or LA*, whereas they are open to the solvent in α-lytic proteases and human HtrA2. Disulfide bonds of α-lytic protease are drawn as yellow lines. These bonds are not found in HtrAs, however. Each secondary structure and loop of Tm HtrA PD is labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Comparison of three HtrA PDs and α-lytic protease. A stereo Cα trace of Tm HtrA PD (green), E. coli HtrA PD (blue), human HtrA2 PD (red), and α-lytic protease (magenta). Three residues of the catalytic triad of Tm HtrA PD are drawn as black stick models. Most structures in the core region containing the central β-barrel and α-helices are well conserved in the four proteins, whereas loop regions display differences. The loop LA of each HtrA, where a large conformational movement is observed, is labeled and emphasized by athicker line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is notable, however, that several structural differences exist between Tm HtrA PD and α-lytic protease. The most significant of them is the length of LA (loop A connecting β1 and β2, according to the nomenclature in Ref. 33Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Google Scholar) in two proteins (Figs. 4 and5). LA of Tm HtrA (residues 47–76), including an amphipathic helical lid (α2, residues 55–66) and α3, is located on top of the catalytic residue Ser206(Figs. 4 A and 6 A). Interestingly, the residues corresponding to the helical lid of Tm HtrA PD are found only in bacterial HtrAs, not in human homologues (Fig. 1), and this lid is expected to have the important functional or structural roles in bacterial HtrAs. There are differences in several other loops connecting β-strands (Fig. 5). Among them, structural changes near the loop containing the putative oxyanion hole and the catalytic residue Ser206 (residues 202–206) seem to be significant for explaining the functional differences of Tm HtrA and α-lytic protease (Figs. 5 and 6). Three conserved disulfide bonds found in almost all members of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases are absent from all known HtrAs (Fig. 4). Overall structure of Tm HtrA PD turns out to be similar with the protease domains of E. coli HtrA and human HtrA2 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.2 Å for 179 Cα atoms of 215 Cα atoms ofE. coli HtrA and 1.9 Å for 181 Cα atoms of 196 Cα atoms of human HtrA2, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5). The large r.m.s.d. among HtrAs are mostly caused by the structural difference near the active site and loop LA (Fig. 5). Interestingly, Tm HtrA shows more structural resemblance with human HtrA than E. coliHtrA. Trimeric interactions found in E. coli HtrA hexamer or human HtrA2 trimer seem to be conserved in Tm HtrA PD (Fig.7), in which three subunits of Tm HtrA PD related by 3-fold crystallographic rotation symmetry are tightly packed by hydrophobic interactions. A hydrophobic patch composed of the residues near α1, β7, β8, and β11 is involved in the hydrophobic packing in a trimer (Figs. 4 A and7 A). Those hydrophobic residues are quite well conserved in most other HtrAs (Fig. 1), implying that hydrophobic packing in a trimer is a general feature of HtrAs. By trimerization, the 6700 Å2 surface area of Tm HtrA PD is buried, which is comparable with the 6044 Å2 in human HtrA2 (15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that the Tm HtrA forms a trimer by hydrophobic interaction mediated by the protease domain, as observed in E. coli HtrA and human HtrA2 (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar, 15Li W. Srinivasula S.M. Chai J. Li P. Wu J.-W. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 436-441Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration experiments also support the existence of Tm HtrA PD as a trimer in solution (data not shown). The main differences among HtrAs might be the size and conformation ofLA (Figs. 1, 4, and 5). E. coli HtrA has a long loop reaching the active site of the opposite subunit (Figs.4 C, 6 C, and 7 B). In addition, β1 and β2 in E. coli HtrA is long enough to make a β-sheet with two other β-strands from the trimer in the other side, leading to a hexamer structure (Fig. 7 B) (14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar). In contrast, LAin Tm HtrA PD is mainly composed of a helix (α2) covering the active site of the same subunit in the current structure (Figs. 4 A,6 A, and 7 A) and is shorter than its counterpart in E. coli HtrA (Figs. 1 and 7). Interestingly, human HtrA2 has a very short LA, which is not involved in the dimerization of trimers or the covering of the active site (Figs.4 D, 6 D, and 7 C). Two molecules of HtrA PD in an asymmetric unit related by 2-fold NCS are associated by the minimal hydrophobic interactions among a few residues (Tyr25, Pro28, Val32, and Ala35; figure not shown) in the NH2-terminal helix (α1). Therefore, the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit seems to have no biological relevance. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit show identical conformations except the regions near LA and L2 (loop 2 connecting β11 and β12), suggesting those regions are relatively flexible. Most molecular chaperones have hydrophobic substrate binding sites on their surfaces to recognize and bind to the exposed hydrophobic patches of substrates (3Büchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Google Scholar). However, in Tm HtrA PD trimer, most of the hydrophobic surface near the active site is buried and no noticeable hydrophobic region is exposed (Fig. 7 D). Therefore, certain conformational changes might occur to expose the hydrophobic substrate binding site when Tm HtrA or Tm HtrA PD shows the chaperone-like activity. Most hydrophobic residues in the helical lid of LA form wide contacts by hydrophobic interactions with Leu80 in β2, Pro163 and Leu164 in LD (loop D connecting β7 and β8), Pro203 and Gly204 in L1 (loop 1 connecting β9 and β10), and Ala223 and Ile224 in L2 (Fig. 6 A). BecauseLA* of E. coli HtrA makes intimate contact withL1 and L2 (the asterisk denotes the loops in the neighboring subunit, see Figs. 4 C,6 C, and 7 B; Ref. 14Krojer T. Garrido-Franco M. Huber R. Ehrmann M. Clausen T. Nature. 2002; 416: 455-459Google Scholar), the hydrophobic interactions between the loops near the active site and lid seem to be common in bacterial HtrAs. However, in other HtrAs residues interacting with LA appear to vary depending on the size of the lid (Fig. 1).

For this to occur, the RF must interact with specific A-site components of the active centers within both the small and large ribosomal subunits. In this work, we have used directed hydroxyl radical footprinting to map the ribosomal binding site of the Escherichia coli class I release factor RF2, during translation termination. In the presence of the cognate UGA stop codon, residues flanking the universally conserved250GGQ252 motif of RF2 were each shown to footprint to the large ribosomal subunit, specifically to conserved elements of the peptidyltransferase and GTPase-associated centers. In contrast, residues that flank the putative “peptide anticodon” of RF2, 205SPF207, were shown to make a footprint in the small ribosomal subunit at positions within well characterized 16 S rRNA motifs in the vicinity of the decoding center. Within the recently solved crystal structure of E. coliRF2, the GGQ and SPF motifs are separated by 23 Å only, a distance that is incompatible with the observed cleavage sites that are up to 100 Å apart.

Buckingham R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 561-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,2Poole E.S. Tate W.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The stop codon is recognized by a protein, the polypeptide chain release factor (RF),1 which triggers the hydrolytic release of the nascent polypeptide chain from the P-site-bound peptidyl-tRNA. Recognition of the stop codon by a protein rather than a tRNA molecule led Moffat and Tate (3Moffat J.G. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18899-18903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to propose the “tRNA analogue model,” which describes the RF as a decoding molecule like tRNA. Class I RFs are the decoding factors (4Pel H.J. Rep M. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In bacteria such asEscherichia coli, there are two decoding RFs, RF1 (decodes UAG and UAA) and RF2 (decodes UGA and UAA). In eukaryotes, a single factor, eRF1, recognizes all three stop codons (5Frolova L. Le Goff X. Rasmussen H.H. Cheperegin S. Drugeon G. Kress M. Arman I. Haenni A.-L. Celis J.E. Philippe M. Justesen J. Kisselev L. Nature. 1994; 372: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). With the exception of a universally conserved GGQ motif, there is no overall sequence homology between the eubacterial class I RFs and their eukaryotic counterparts (6Frolova L.Y. Tsivkovskii R.Y. Sivolobova G.F. Oparina N.Y. Serpinsky O.I. Blinov V.M. Tatkov S.I. Kisselev L.L. RNA. 1999; 5: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The properties of the class I RFs are remarkably similar to those of aminoacyl-tRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 7Kisselev L.L. Mol. Biol. 1999; 33: 932-939Google Scholar). RFs compete with suppressor tRNAs for binding to the A-site of the ribosome in response to specific recognition of the A-site codon (8Ryden S.M. Isaksson L.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Elliott T. Wang X. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4144-4154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This so-called anti-suppressor phenotype implies that tRNAs and RFs are cognate species in direct competition for stop codon binding. Both interact with the peptidyl-tRNA located at the ribosomal P-site, and both interact on the ribosome with translational G proteins (EF-Tu for aminoacyl-tRNA and RF3/eRF3 for the decoding RFs). In the tRNA analogue model (3Moffat J.G. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18899-18903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the decoding RF was proposed to consist of two functionally separate domains that span the two active centers of the ribosome in a manner analogous to that of tRNA. One domain was responsible for codon recognition and interaction with the decoding center in the small ribosomal subunit, and a second domain was thought to function in triggering peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis at the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) of the large ribosomal subunit. This proposal was based on functional studies, which demonstrated that it was possible to separate the decoding and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis activities of the RF (3Moffat J.G. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18899-18903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Donly B.C. Edgar C.D. Williams J.M. Tate W.P. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 437-443PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moffat J.G.

RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is supported by more recent site-directed mutagenesis studies of the domain structure of the eubacterial or organellar class I RFs (13Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two key motifs within the decoding RFs have been identified. A putative peptide “anticodon” (188PAT190 in E. coli RF1 and 205SPF207 in RF2), the site of numerous suppressor mutations, is proposed to confer codon specificity on the class I RFs and to bind at the decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit (16Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A universally conserved GGQ motif (6Frolova L.Y. Tsivkovskii R.Y. Sivolobova G.F. Oparina N.Y. Serpinsky O.I. Blinov V.M. Tatkov S.I. Kisselev L.L. RNA. 1999; 5: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and surrounding residues are thought to interact with the PTC of the large subunit. Substitution of residues within the GGQ motif interferes with the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis activity of the RF (73), 2D.-J. G. Scarlett, C. F. Hart, and W. P. Tate, manuscript in preparation.2D.-J. G. Scarlett, C. F. Hart, and W. P. Tate, manuscript in preparation. whereas a single cleavage six residues upstream of the GGQ site completely abolishes this activity (3Moffat J.G. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18899-18903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation of the glutamine residue of the GGQ motif has also been shown to be important for hydrolysis activity (17Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These studies predict that the SPF and GGQ motifs will occupy the extremities of the two domains of the decoding RF that span the ribosomal decoding and peptidyltransferase centers. The first structure of a eubacterial decoding RF, that of E. coli RF2, provided unexpected surprises (18Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The GGQ peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and SPF anticodon motifs were only 23 Å apart in the structure and not ∼80 Å, as expected. This is unlike the three-dimensional structure of eukaryotic eRF1, in which the GGQ and NIKS (believed to be close to the decoding site) motifs were positioned at the two extremities of the protein (19Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Although the tertiary structures of the eubacterial and eukaryotic factors differ considerably, they do resemble an overall tRNA-like L shape (RF2) or Y shape (eRF1). To resolve the paradox between the positions of the SPF and GGQ motifs in the crystal structure of RF2 and the functional data that would have placed them at the two extremities of the protein, we set out to map the ribosomal environment of RF2 when it is bound at the ribosomal A-site. This approach would not only allow us to test the tRNA analogue hypothesis but would also provide important information as to whether the RF might undergo a large conformational change upon binding to the ribosome. Hydroxyl radical probing from Fe(II) tethered directly to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues on the surface of a protein via the linker 1-(p-bromoacetamido-benzyl)-EDTA (BABE) has been used successfully to map the ribosomal binding sites of S5 (20Culver G.M. Heilek G.M. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), S8 (21Lancaster L. Culver G.M. Yusupova G.Z. Cate J.H. Yusupov M.M. Noller H.F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and translation factors, IF3 (25Dallas A. Noller H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 855-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), EF-G (26Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and RF1 (27Wilson K.S. Ito K. Noller H.F. Nakamura Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This approach uses Fenton chemistry to generate hydroxyl radicals that cleave the RNA backbone in the vicinity of the tethered Fe(II). Whereas it is possible for a released radical to miss neighboring nucleotides and to cleave rRNA at more distant sites, the relative distances between the cleaved rRNA and the site of radical generation can be estimated from the intensities of the cleavage results (28Culver G.M. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 461-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a series of cleavages is obtained from each site, which aids interpretation now that the ribosome structures are available. In the current study, two adjacent tethering sites were selected on the RF2 protein for attachment of BABE as an additional strategy to avoid misinterpretation of the significance of specific cleavages. Using this approach, amino acids neighboring the GGQ motif of RF2 were shown to map to the PTC, whereas residues flanking the SPF motif mapped near the ribosomal decoding center. These results support the tRNA analogue model and suggest that RF2 undergoes a significant conformational change upon binding to the ribosome. Construction of the RF2 expression plasmids pETRF2* and pETRF2*(T246S) has been described previously (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified using a Qiagen miniprep kit and were electroporated into bacteria using an Electro Cell Manipulator® 600 (BTX). MRE600 ribosomes, [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet, and codons used in the in vitro termination assays were kindly prepared by T. Edgar. The BABE reagent (1-(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)-EDTA) was synthesized using the method of DeRiemer et al. (29DeRiemer L.H. Meares C.F. Goodwin D.A. Diamanti C.J. J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 1981; 18: 1517-1534Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ProbeQuantTM G-50 microcolumns and YM-100 spin columns used in the purification of the BABE-conjugated release factors, and termination complexes were from Amersham Biosciences and Millipore Corp., respectively, and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase from Promega. All cloning work was carried out in the JM109 strain of E. coli[endA1, recA1, gyrA96,thi, hsdR17 (rk−, mk+),relA1, supE44, λ−, Δ(lac-proAB), F′, traD36, proA+B+, lacIqZΔ M15] (Promega), whereas expression studies from the pET3a-based vectors utilized the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS [hsdS gal (λ cIts 857 ind1 Sam7nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1) pLysS (camR)]. The latter strain is maintained in 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol due to the presence of the pLysS plasmid. For expression of the RF proteins, individual freshly transformed or streaked colonies were inoculated into LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. An overnight culture was then used to inoculate fresh selective medium (1–5% (v/v)) and grown at 37 °C with shaking to an A600 of 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were grown for a further 2.5–3 h. The harvested cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C in preparation for protein purification. Mutations were introduced into prfB* (in the plasmid pETRF2*) orprfB*(T246S) (in the plasmid pETRF2*(T246S)) using a two-step PCR strategy. All reactions were carried out using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In the first reaction, a 27-mer mutagenic forward primer (C128A, 5′-GACAGCGCCGACgccTACCTCGATATT; C274X, 5′-ATCGTGACCCAG(a/g/t)(c/t)(c/g)CAGAACGACCGT; L201C, 5′-GGCGTTCACCGCtgtGTGCGTAAAAGC; S209C, 5′-AGC CCGTTTGACtgcGGCGGTCGTCGC; V243C, 5′-CTGCGCATTGACtgtTATCGCACGTCC; or T246C, 5′-GACGTTTATCGCtgcTCCGGCGCGGGC) and the pET-T7r reverse primer (5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG) were used to amplify a C-terminal fragment of RF2 (350–550 bp) containing the site-directed mutation (shown in lowercase type). Approximately 180–360 ng of the purified fragments were then denatured (95 °C for 5 min) and added to a second PCR containing the pET-T7f forward primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) to amplify the full-length mutatedprfB* gene. This process was repeated for each of the individual site-directed mutations. All amplification reactions were performed using 1× Expand HF buffer (supplied with the enzyme) containing 200 μm dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 nm primers, 2.6 units of Expand DNA polymerase, ∼1 ng of plasmid DNA (template), and double-distilled H2O in a total volume of 50 μl. Using a PTC-200, Peltier thermal cycler PCR machine (MJ Research, Inc.), the reactions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The following cycle was then repeated 30 times: annealing, 50–60 °C for 1 min; extension, 72 °C for 2 min; denaturation, 95 °C for 30 s. The final cycle ended with a 5-min extension at 72 °C, and the reactions were cooled to 4 °C. Crude preparations of RF proteins were obtained from the frozen bacterial pellets essentially as described previously (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Tate W.P. Caskey C.T. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1990: 81-100Google Scholar). The proteins were purified further on a ResourceQ™ anion exchange column using the BioLogic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The BCA assay (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18510) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the concentration of purified protein samples. The in vitropeptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and codon-dependent ribosome binding assays were performed as described previously (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The DTNB assay measures the formation of a colored chromophore at 412 nm upon reaction of Ellman's reagent or DTNB with the sulfhydryl group of an accessible cysteine residue. Since the RF proteins are stored in 1 mmdithiothreitol to maintain the cysteine residues of the factor in a reduced form they were first purified away from the dithiothreitol using ProbeQuant™ G-50 microcolumns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DTNB (5 μl of 1 mg/ml) was added to the RF sample, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The absorbance of a buffer blank was subtracted from the sample values. The concentration of accessible cysteine residues was calculated from the change in absorbance at 412 nm, using ε412 = 13,600 m−1cm−1 for the chromophore. The BABE reagent was loaded with Fe(II) essentially as described by Culver and Noller (28Culver G.M. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 461-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to Fe(II) derivatization, the RF proteins were washed through ProbeQuant™ G-50 microcolumns (preequilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 50 mm KCl, according to the manufacturer's instructions) to remove excess dithiothreitol. In a typical conjugation reaction, 50 μl of RF (∼1500 pmol) was mixed with 5.4 μl of the Fe(II)-BABE complex (∼76 nmol of Fe(II)-BABE, 50-fold molar excess) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound Fe(II)-BABE was then removed by washing the reactions through the ProbeQuant™ G-50 columns, and the efficiency of conjugation determined was using the DTNB assay as described above. Two different sets of conditions were used in the formation of ribosomal termination complexes (100-μl total volume): (i) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mmMg(OAc)2, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 10% (v/v) ethanol, by incubating 100 pmol of 70 S ribosomes with 1000 pmol of stop signal (normally UGAU) and 400 pmol of Fe(II)-derivatized RF2 at 4 °C for 20 min; (ii) in a buffer containing 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 150 mm NH4Cl, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm spermine, 2 mm spermidine, and 10% (v/v) ethanol by incubating 100 pmol of 70 S ribosomes with 1000 pmol of stop signal (normally GUCAUGUGAU), 200 pmol of P-site tRNA, and 400 pmol of Fe(II)-derivatized RF2 at 37 °C for 30 min. Immediately prior to site-directed hydroxyl radical probing, the ribosomal termination complexes were purified from free Fe(II)-RF2 using Microcon YM-100 spin columns (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The columns contain a cellulose membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 100 kDa. The termination complexes were therefore trapped on the membrane, whereas unbound Fe(II)-RF2 proteins washed through. By simply inverting the column and centrifuging again, the complexes were easily and efficiently recovered. The volumes of the eluted ribosomes were then adjusted to 100 μl with the specific buffer used in the formation of the termination complex. The site-directed hydroxyl radical probing was carried out as described previously (28Culver G.M. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 461-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To initiate hydroxyl radical production, 2 μl of 250 mm ascorbic acid and 2 μl of 1.25% (v/v) H2O2 were added to the purified termination complexes. After incubating the samples for 10 min on ice, the probing reactions were quenched with 20 μl of 20 mmthiourea. The probed rRNA was then recovered using TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probed rRNA samples were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C in preparation for primer extension. The primers used to walk through the 16 and 23 S rRNA (sequences available on request) were end-labeled with33P by incubating 10 pmol of the oligonucleotides with 3 μl of [γ-33P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in 1× T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The volume of the reaction was adjusted to 10 μl with RNase-free double-distilled H2O. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the kinase enzyme. The final concentration of the radiolabeled primers was 1 pmol/μl. Radiolabeled primers (3 pmol) were then annealed to 1 μg of the recovered rRNA in 1× avian myeloblastosis virus primer extension buffer (Promega). The 11-μl reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 5 min to denature the RNA and then at the Tm of the particular primer for 20 min. The samples were cooled on ice while the extension reactions were prepared. A “master” mixture mix (enough for six reactions) was prepared by mixing 30 μl of 2× avian myeloblastosis virus primer extension buffer (Promega), 12 μl of 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 24 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a reaction volume of 54 μl. For the sequencing reactions, individual cocktails were prepared that each contained one of the ddNTPs at a final concentration of 0.67 mm. The cocktails were immediately divided into 9-μl aliquots and added to the 11-μl annealing reactions, and the 20-μl samples were incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. The cDNA extension products were precipitated with 2 μl of 3 m sodium acetate pH 5.5 and 40 μl of prechilled 96% (v/v) ethanol at −20 °C for 2–16 h. The samples were then recovered by centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C). The cDNA pellets were washed with 100 μl of 70% (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, dried at 37 °C for 5 min, and resuspended in a buffer containing 98% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. After heating at 94 °C for 5 min, 2 μl of the cDNA products were loaded onto a 6% (w/v) acrylamide, 8m urea gel and fractionated by electrophoresis as described in Ref. 28Culver G.M. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 461-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. AprfB* mutant devoid of endogenous cysteine residues was required for the construction of site-specific single cysteine derivatives of RF2. The sulfhydryl side chains of the inserted cysteines act as targeted tether sites for the BABE reagent. The cysteineless (CL) variant of RF2 was also used as a control for any unintended derivatization of noncysteine side chains and was included in the mapping experiments to eliminate sites of nonspecific RNA cleavage. The native RF2 protein of E. coli has two cysteine residues at positions 128 and 274 (Fig.1). A cysteine residue is not found frequently at positions equivalent to 128 of E. coli RF2 (seen in only four of the 30 representative RF sequences aligned in Fig. 1A). In contrast, a cysteine residue at position 274 is more highly conserved among the different class I RFs (found in 24 of the 30 sequences; Fig. 1B). The high conservation of Cys274 may reflect its location within the putative peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis domain of the factor.2 The class I RF sequence alignments in Fig. 1 were used to select appropriate amino acids to substitute for the endogenous cysteine residues of E. coli RF2. Alanine was chosen to replace Cys128, because this residue is tolerated at equivalent positions in 12 of the 30 RF sequences aligned in Fig. 1A. Also, the small methyl side chain of alanine was thought to be less likely to cause significant changes in the secondary structure of the RF compared with the possible alternative candidates for this site, isoleucine and valine. Methionine and serine were each chosen along with alanine as the possible replacement amino acid for the potentially more important Cys274, since they were the only other two amino acids found at this position (Fig. 1B). Substitution of Cys128 with alanine and Cys274 with alanine, methionine, or serine did not alter the predicted secondary structure of the RF2 proteins (data not shown). Exogenous expression of E. coli RF2 produces a protein with a severely diminished capacity to stimulate peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (see Fig. 2, top panel). There are at least two possible reasons for this phenomenon: (i) a threonine residue at position 246 facilitates an incorrect conformation when the protein is expressed at high concentrations (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and (ii) Gln252 is not fullyN5-methylated (17Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engstrom A. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis activity is restored to overexpressed RF2 by substituting Thr246 for serine or alanine (Fig. 2, top panel) (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or by including 10% (v/v) ethanol in the assay system (Fig. 2, bottom panel). For this reason, a T246S background for RF2 was used to measure the effect of the selected substitutions at Cys128 and Cys274on the release activities of the RF proteins in vitro in the absence of ethanol (Fig. 2, top panel) as well as in its presence (bottom panel). The C274A and C274M mutations impaired significantly the release activity of the T246S variant of RF2. The deleterious effects of these two substitutions were substantially alleviated in the presence of ethanol (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Interestingly, substitution of Cys128 with alanine and Cys274with serine, both increased the specific release activity of the T246S RF variants, independent of whether ethanol was present. Based on these results, a CL mutant of RF2 containing the substitutions C128A and C274S was constructed and used as a template for the creation of novel single cysteine RF2 variants. Because of the functional enigma of the low peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis activity of overexpressed RF2, and since the T246S variants exhibited increased specific release activity, a representative of the T246S variants was also taken through the mapping experiments for comparison (see below). For probing the ribosomal environment of the putative decoding and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis domains, published data (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P.

Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), together with our recent results from a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study,2guided the selection of tethering sites on E. coli RF2. Three positions were selected within the proposed peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis domain of RF2 (Val243, Thr246, and Cys274), whereas Leu201 and Ser209were chosen to represent the decoding domain of RF2, because they flank the putative tripeptide anticodon 205SPF207 of the factor (16Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All five positions were shown to be accessible to modification by the BABE reagent using the DTNB assay (data not shown). Val243 was selected as a representative of the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis domain of RF2, because it neighbors the most sensitive site on the protein (between Tyr244 and Arg245) to cleavage by chymotrypsin. This cleavage inactivates the hydrolysis function of RF2, while potentiating its ability to bind to the ribosome (3Moffat J.G. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18899-18903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the residue at position 246 of E. coli RF2 (as described above) has been shown to have a dramatic effect on the release activity of the factor (12Wilson D.N. Guevremont D. Tate W.P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y.

It was therefore of interest to examine the rRNA neighborhood of position 246, in the"
https://openalex.org/W2052525443,"The hepatitis C virus nonstructural 5B protein (NS5B) protein has been shown to require either magnesium or manganese for its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. As a first step toward elucidating the nature and the role(s) of the metal ions in the reaction chemistry, we have utilized endogenous tryptophan fluorescence to quantitate the interactions of magnesium and manganese ions with this protein. The association of either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) ions with the enzyme resulted in a decrease in the intensity of the tryptophan emission spectrum. This decrease was used to determine the apparent dissociation constants for both ions. The apparent K(d) values for the binding of Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) ions to the free enzyme were 3.1 and 0.3 mm, respectively. Dual ligand titration experiments demonstrated that both ions bind to a single common site, for which they compete. The kinetics of real time metal ion binding to the NS5B protein were also investigated. Based on the results of our fluorescence and near-UV circular dichroism experiments, we show that NS5B undergoes conformational changes upon the binding of metal ions. However, this process does not significantly stimulate the binding to the RNA or NTP substrates. We envisage that the ion-induced conformational change is a prerequisite for catalytic activity by both correctly positioning the side chains of the residues located in the active site of the enzyme and also contributing to the stabilization of the intermediate transition state."

Moreover, the association between MEKK1 and FAK appears to be physiologically relevant, as it is enhanced by treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Targeting FAK to the membrane also enhanced its association with MEKK1, indicating that MEKK1 is localized to a membrane-related subcellular domain, perhaps focal adhesions.

In addition, MEKK1 senses microtubule integrity, protects cells from committing to apoptosis, and contributes to the migration of fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The phenotype of the MEKK1-null mouse includes an eyelid closure defect that is also seen in mice lacking the EGF receptor and TGF-α (6Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E.

This suggests the possibility that MEKK1 is required for EGF receptor control of cell migration. Consistent with that idea, overexpression of MEKK1 induces the formation of a large lamellipodia-like structure in epithelial cells (6Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E. Zaitsu Y.

Still, the mechanism by which MEKK1 influences cell motility remains unclear.FAK is protein tyrosine kinase found at sites of adhesion (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D102-D113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is activated by integrin-mediated adhesion and serves as a signaling protein within cytoskeleton-associated networks (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D102-D113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Src-family protein tyrosine kinases p130 Cas, Shc, and Grb2 act in concert with FAK to transduce integrin-generated signals to the ERK/JNK MAP kinase cascades (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front.

Experiments using FAK-deficient cells have established that FAK is essential for integrin-stimulated cell migration and important for linking activation of the PDGF and EGF receptors to the cellular machinery that promotes directed cell migration (8Sieg D.J.

The fact that MEKK1 is enriched in membranes and colocalizes with α-actinin along actin stress fibers at focal adhesions (9Christerson L.B. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Cell Motil.

IRS-1 is a major substrate for the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, which rapidly phosphorylate it on multiple tyrosine residues upon ligand binding. Recently, it was reported that targeted disruption of FAK eliminates IRS-1 expression in MEFs and that interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix regulate the transcription of the IRS-1 gene via FAK-mediated JNK activation (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we show the following. 1) MEKK1 interacts with FAK in vivo. 2) Like FAK, MEKK1 is required for IRS-1 expression. 3) Targeted disruption of MEKK1 alters IGF-1-induced ERK activation but not PI3K/Akt activation.DISCUSSIONMEKK1 reportedly binds to a number of signaling proteins including Ras, Raf-1, Rac1, cdc42Hs, Nck-interacting kinase, SEK1, and JNK (1Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,17Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); consequently, MEKK1 has been proposed to function, like yeast Pbs2p, as a scaffold protein (22Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar) . In the present study, we showed that MEKK1 also interacts with FAK in vivo, suggesting that among the subcellular regions to which MEKK1 is localized are focal adhesions. The finding that a membrane-targeted form of FAK (myristoylated FAK) associated with MEKK1 more readily than did wild-type FAK supports that idea. In addition, the finding that EGF enhanced the interaction between endogenous MEKK1 and FAK suggests that the interaction is physiologically relevant. In that regard, FAK is known to associate with the activated EGF receptor signaling complex and to be required for EGF-stimulated cell motility (8Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). MEKK1 has been shown to be activated in the EGF receptor signaling pathway (1Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and EGF indeed stimulated activation of ERK and JNK in MEFs. EGF might recruit MEKK1 to focal adhesion complexes containing FAK and EGF receptor. The function of MEKK1 within focal adhesions is unclear, although it is known to regulate JNK activation and survival in cells challenged with mild hyperosmolarity and microtubule toxins (2Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The fact that these stimuli elicit changes in cell shape suggests that MEKK1 localized in focal adhesions might be involved in sensing cytoskeletal dynamics.Our data also show that the N terminus of MEKK1 (amino acids 145–443) is important for binding FAK. This region has a proline-rich segment containing putative binding sites for proteins having SH3 domains (23Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar). FAK does not contain an SH2 or SH3 domain, but it does contain SH2 domain-interacting phosphotyrosines and SH3 domain-interacting proline-rich regions. It may be that one or more other adaptor proteins (e.g. Grb2) mediates the interaction of MEKK1 with FAK. Additional studies will be necessary to precisely define the nature of the interaction between MEKK1 and FAK as well as the physiological significance of that interaction.Integrins are transmembrane proteins that mediate cell adhesion with an extracellular matrix (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D102-D113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using FAK-deficient cells, Lebrun et al. (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that integrins regulate transcription of theIRS-1 gene, in part via FAK-mediated JNK activation. That report prompted us to examine IRS-1 expression, which led to the finding that levels of IRS-1 protein and mRNA are diminished in MEKK1−/− cells and that the ectopic expression of MEKK1 in MEKK1−/− cells is sufficient to restore expression of the protein. These results demonstrate unequivocally that MEKK1 regulates expression of the IRS-1 message and protein. Interestingly, IRS-1 protein levels were increased as a function of cell density in both MEFs and HEK293T cells. In this case, IRS-1 expression may be up-regulated as the number of cell-to-cell interactions via adhesion molecules increases. Such a situation would be consistent with an earlier report that cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix up-regulates IRS-1 expression (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fact that cell density-dependent IRS-1 expression was also observed in MEKK1−/− MEFs indicates that a MEKK1-independent pathway to IRS-1 expression also exists.In the above mentioned study, Lebrun et al. (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also reported that cell adhesion to fibronectin increases IRS-1 expression and that JNK in not activated in FAK−/− MEFs when integrin engages fibronectin. They therefore concluded that FAK is essential for fibronectin-stimulated JNK activation. In the present study, by contrast, adhesion to fibronectin induced a similar activation of JNK, ERK, and FAK in wild-type and MEKK1−/− MEFs, suggesting that integrin induces IRS-1 expression via an integrin-FAK-JNK pathway that is independent of MEKK1. The signaling molecules involved in the regulation of IRS-1 expression thus remain to be determined. It is possible that, like FAK, MEKK1 is involved in organizing the cortical cytoskeleton and that disorganization due to the loss of MEKK1 participates in the down-regulation of IRS-1 expression.The results of this and our earlier study (6Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E. Zaitsu Y. Clarke P. Tyler K. Oka Y. Fanger G.R. Henson P. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7272-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) show that, like FAK, MEKK1 positively regulates IRS-1 expression and cell motility. On the other hand, the ectopic expression of IRS-1 in prostate cancer cells that do not express IRS-1 endogenously increased cell adhesion and decreased cell motility (24Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G., Tu, X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although this finding is apparently opposite to ours, it is nevertheless consistent with the idea that IRS-1 plays a key role in regulating cell motility. IRS-1 also mediates various metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin and IGF-1. For instance, mice lacking IRS-1 display retardation of somatic growth and enhanced β-cell mass (25Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 26Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H.

Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar); effects on cell migration have not been reported, however.Upon insulin stimulation, IRS-1 interacts with αvβ3 integrins (27Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). FAK binds to both IRS-1 and integrins (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D102-D113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lebrun P. Mothe-Satney I. Delahaye L. Van Obberghen E. Baron V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32244-32253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that IGF-1/insulin and cell adhesion induce the formation of focal adhesion complexes that include IRS-1, FAK, and MEKK1. We found that IGF-1-induced ERK activation was significantly diminished in MEKK1−/− MEFs. The decreased activation of ERK by IGF-1 in MEKK1−/− MEFs was independent of IRS-1 expression. Although MEKK1 contributes significantly to IGF-1-stimulated ERK activation, its effect is only partial. The activation of other MAPK kinase kinases (e.g. Raf-1 and B-Raf) that also activate ERK might partially compensate for the loss of MEKK1. In contrast to ERK activation, IGF-1-induced PI3K/Akt activation was not diminished in MEKK1−/− MEFs. Although IRS-1 is a key mediator of IGF-1/insulin-induced PI3K signaling, in this case other IRS proteins (e.g. IRS-2 which is abundant in MEFs) might have compensated for the diminished levels of IRS-1. In summary, MEKK1 interacts physiologically with FAK and regulates IRS-1 expression, which in turn contributes to the regulation of IGF-1/insulin-induced signaling and cell migration. MEKK11 is a 196-kDa serine-threonine kinase activated in response to a variety of stimuli, including EGF, lysophosphatidic acid, osmotic stress, and microtubule toxins (1Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L.

Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the possibility that MEKK1 is associated with FAK. Insulin and IGF-1 exert diverse biological effects by binding to and activating their cognate tyrosine kinase receptors. IRS-1 is a major substrate for the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, which rapidly phosphorylate it on multiple tyrosine residues upon ligand binding. Recently, it was reported that targeted disruption of FAK eliminates IRS-1 expression in MEFs and that interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix regulate the transcription of the IRS-1 gene via FAK-mediated JNK activation (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here, we show the following. 1) MEKK1 interacts with FAK in vivo. 2) Like FAK, MEKK1 is required for IRS-1 expression. 3) Targeted disruption of MEKK1 alters IGF-1-induced ERK activation but not PI3K/Akt activation. DISCUSSIONMEKK1 reportedly binds to a number of signaling proteins including Ras, Raf-1, Rac1, cdc42Hs, Nck-interacting kinase, SEK1, and JNK (1Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L.

Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); consequently, MEKK1 has been proposed to function, like yeast Pbs2p, as a scaffold protein (22Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar) . In the present study, we showed that MEKK1 also interacts with FAK in vivo, suggesting that among the subcellular regions to which MEKK1 is localized are focal adhesions. The finding that a membrane-targeted form of FAK (myristoylated FAK) associated with MEKK1 more readily than did wild-type FAK supports that idea. In addition, the finding that EGF enhanced the interaction between endogenous MEKK1 and FAK suggests that the interaction is physiologically relevant. In that regard, FAK is known to associate with the activated EGF receptor signaling complex and to be required for EGF-stimulated cell motility (8Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). MEKK1 has been shown to be activated in the EGF receptor signaling pathway (1Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and EGF indeed stimulated activation of ERK and JNK in MEFs. EGF might recruit MEKK1 to focal adhesion complexes containing FAK and EGF receptor. The function of MEKK1 within focal adhesions is unclear, although it is known to regulate JNK activation and survival in cells challenged with mild hyperosmolarity and microtubule toxins (2Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The fact that these stimuli elicit changes in cell shape suggests that MEKK1 localized in focal adhesions might be involved in sensing cytoskeletal dynamics.Our data also show that the N terminus of MEKK1 (amino acids 145–443) is important for binding FAK. This region has a proline-rich segment containing putative binding sites for proteins having SH3 domains (23Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar). FAK does not contain an SH2 or SH3 domain, but it does contain SH2 domain-interacting phosphotyrosines and SH3 domain-interacting proline-rich regions. It may be that one or more other adaptor proteins (e.g. Grb2) mediates the interaction of MEKK1 with FAK. Additional studies will be necessary to precisely define the nature of the interaction between MEKK1 and FAK as well as the physiological significance of that interaction.Integrins are transmembrane proteins that mediate cell adhesion with an extracellular matrix (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D102-D113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using FAK-deficient cells, Lebrun et al. (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that integrins regulate transcription of theIRS-1 gene, in part via FAK-mediated JNK activation. That report prompted us to examine IRS-1 expression, which led to the finding that levels of IRS-1 protein and mRNA are diminished in MEKK1−/− cells and that the ectopic expression of MEKK1 in MEKK1−/− cells is sufficient to restore expression of the protein. These results demonstrate unequivocally that MEKK1 regulates expression of the IRS-1 message and protein. Interestingly, IRS-1 protein levels were increased as a function of cell density in both MEFs and HEK293T cells. In this case, IRS-1 expression may be up-regulated as the number of cell-to-cell interactions via adhesion molecules increases. Such a situation would be consistent with an earlier report that cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix up-regulates IRS-1 expression (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fact that cell density-dependent IRS-1 expression was also observed in MEKK1−/− MEFs indicates that a MEKK1-independent pathway to IRS-1 expression also exists.In the above mentioned study, Lebrun et al. (11Lebrun P. Baron V. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38371-38377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also reported that cell adhesion to fibronectin increases IRS-1 expression and that JNK in not activated in FAK−/− MEFs when integrin engages fibronectin. They therefore concluded that FAK is essential for fibronectin-stimulated JNK activation. In the present study, by contrast, adhesion to fibronectin induced a similar activation of JNK, ERK, and FAK in wild-type and MEKK1−/− MEFs, suggesting that integrin induces IRS-1 expression via an integrin-FAK-JNK pathway that is independent of MEKK1. The signaling molecules involved in the regulation of IRS-1 expression thus remain to be determined. It is possible that, like FAK, MEKK1 is involved in organizing the cortical cytoskeleton and that disorganization due to the loss of MEKK1 participates in the down-regulation of IRS-1 expression.The results of this and our earlier study (6Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E. Zaitsu Y. Clarke P. Tyler K. Oka Y. Fanger G.R. Henson P. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7272-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) show that, like FAK, MEKK1 positively regulates IRS-1 expression and cell motility. On the other hand, the ectopic expression of IRS-1 in prostate cancer cells that do not express IRS-1 endogenously increased cell adhesion and decreased cell motility (24Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G., Tu, X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although this finding is apparently opposite to ours, it is nevertheless consistent with the idea that IRS-1 plays a key role in regulating cell motility. IRS-1 also mediates various metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin and IGF-1. For instance, mice lacking IRS-1 display retardation of somatic growth and enhanced β-cell mass (25Araki E.

Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). FAK binds to both IRS-1 and integrins (7Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Front.

We found that IGF-1-induced ERK activation was significantly diminished in MEKK1−/− MEFs. The decreased activation of ERK by IGF-1 in MEKK1−/− MEFs was independent of IRS-1 expression. Although MEKK1 contributes significantly to IGF-1-stimulated ERK activation, its effect is only partial. The activation of other MAPK kinase kinases (e.g. Raf-1 and B-Raf) that also activate ERK might partially compensate for the loss of MEKK1. In contrast to ERK activation, IGF-1-induced PI3K/Akt activation was not diminished in MEKK1−/− MEFs. Although IRS-1 is a key mediator of IGF-1/insulin-induced PI3K signaling, in this case other IRS proteins (e.g. IRS-2 which is abundant in MEFs) might have compensated for the diminished levels of IRS-1. In summary, MEKK1 interacts physiologically with FAK and regulates IRS-1 expression, which in turn contributes to the regulation of IGF-1/insulin-induced signaling and cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W2091409676,"Proteins synthesized by the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) co-translationally cross the membrane through the pore of a ribosome-bound translocon (RBT) complex. Although this pore is also permeable to small molecules, it is generally thought that barriers to their permeation prevent the cyclical process of protein translation from affecting the permeability of the RER. We tested this hypothesis by culturing Chinese hamster ovary-S cells with inhibitors of protein translation that affect the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins and then permeabilizing the plasma membrane and measuring the permeability of the RER to a small molecule, 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (4-MαG). The premature or normal release of nascent proteins by puromycin or pactamycin, respectively, increased the permeability of the RER to 4-MαG by 20–30%. In contrast, inhibition of elongation and the release of nascent proteins by cycloheximide did not increase the permeability, but it prevented the increase in permeability by pactamycin. We conclude that the permeability of the RER is coupled to protein translation by a simple gating mechanism whereby a nascent protein blocks the pore of a RBT during translation, but after release of the nascent protein the pore is permeable to small molecules as long as an empty ribosome remains bound to the translocon.

In eukaryotes, secretory and most integral membrane proteins are synthesized by a translationally active 80 S ribosome composed of 60 S and 40 S subunits and bound to a translocon complex, a heteromeric assembly of proteins embedded in the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) 1The abbreviations used are: RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCC, protein-conducting channel; RBT, ribosome-bound translocon; 4-MαG, 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside; PUR, puromycin; PAC, pactamycin; CHX, cycloheximide; TG, thapsigargin; CHO-S, Chinese hamster ovary-S cells; S0, initial slope; P , permeability; P basal, puromycin-independent permeability; P PUR, permeability in the presence of puromycin; ΔP PUR, increase ofP PUR above P basal 1The abbreviations used are: RER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCC, protein-conducting channel; RBT, ribosome-bound translocon; 4-MαG, 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside; PUR, puromycin; PAC, pactamycin; CHX, cycloheximide; TG, thapsigargin; CHO-S, Chinese hamster ovary-S cells; S0, initial slope; P , permeability; P basal, puromycin-independent permeability; P PUR, permeability in the presence of puromycin; ΔP PUR, increase ofP PUR above P basal(Fig. 1). Nascent proteins emerging from the exit tunnel of the 60 S subunit co-translationally cross the membrane of the RER by passing through a protein-conducting channel (PCC) in the translocon complex (1Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The exit tunnel of the 60 S subunit and the pore of the PCC must be large enough to be permeated by a nascent protein chain, and this pathway is therefore large enough to be permeated by many other small molecules when a ribosome-bound translocon (RBT) is translationally inactive and empty, i.e. the pore is not occupied by a nascent protein. We previously demonstrated (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the permeability of RBTs to a small, polar molecule (4-methyl-umbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (4-MαG)) was increased after puromycin, a tRNA analog, prematurely terminated translation and released nascent protein chains from the PCC (patha, Fig 1). The increased permeability to 4-MαG was consistent with a previous report that RBTs incorporated into planar bilayers and opened by puromycin are permeable to ions (3Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and our results were also supported by a recent report that puromycin can release calcium from the RER (4Lomax R.B. Camello C. Van Coppenolle F. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The permeation of empty RBTs is especially significant in the context of recent studies by Nicchitta and colleagues (5Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23314-23320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), who reported that approximately two-thirds of the 60 S subunits remain bound to translocons after the normal completion of protein translation, thereby constituting a large pool of persistent, translationally inactive RBT complexes. Although permeation of these empty RBTs could have very important consequences for RER-dependent signaling and the maintenance of essential gradients across the RER membrane, this pathway has received relatively little attention. The permeation of translocons by small molecules has also been investigated by Johnson and colleagues (7Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E.

Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), who concluded that a permeability barrier is maintained at the luminal end of the translocon by the binding of BiP, a luminal chaperone protein, and that the junction between the 60 S subunit and the translocon is tightly sealed. Their conclusions have led to the broadly held view that RBTs are tightly sealed at all times, preventing the process of protein translation from influencing the permeability of the RER to small molecules. We propose, however, that the notion that the permeability of the RER is not affected by permeation of RBTs might be limited to experimental conditions in which translationally inactive, empty ribosomes have been stripped from ER microsomes by a high-salt wash. This experimental detail is important because it limits the detection of permeation to only two states of the translocon, the translationally active 80 S-bound translocon and the ribosome-free translocon (blocked and closed states, respectively, in Fig. 1). A novel feature of our current study is that we have used experimental conditions in which permeation of a third state of the translocon, translationally inactive 60 S-bound RBTs, can also be detected. In this article we examine two models that describe the relationship between the translational activity of RBTs and the permeability of the RER to a small molecule, 4-MαG. The first model is a “static permeability” model in which RBTs are never permeable to small molecules other than nascent proteins, and the permeability of the RER is therefore independent of translational activity. The second model is a “dynamic permeability” model in which the pore of an RBT is “gated” closed when it is occupied by a nascent protein, but the pore of translationally inactive, 60 S-bound translocons is open and permeable to small molecules. This simple physical mechanism for coupling the permeability of the RER to protein translation predicts a dynamic relationship in which increasing the level of protein translation and the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins should decrease the permeability of the RER, whereas inhibiting the initiation of protein translation and decreasing the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins should increase the permeability of the RER. The appropriateness of the static versus dynamic permeability models can be tested by determining the extent to which the permeability of the RER is dependent on the level of protein translation and the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins. The static permeability model predicts complete independence, whereas the dynamic permeability model predicts that the permeability of the RER is inversely related to the level of occupancy by nascent proteins during protein translation. The goal of the current study was to test these predictions by measuring the permeability of the RER to 4-MαG while manipulating protein translation with drugs that inhibit protein translation by different mechanisms of action. Puromycin (PUR) resembles aminoacyl-tRNA, and it is a substrate for the peptidyltransferase of the 60S subunit, accepting a nascent peptide and causing the premature release of incomplete nascent proteins (9Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pactamycin (PAC) inhibits the initiation of protein translation by preventing formation of the 43S initiation complex, but it permits the normal elongation and release of full-length proteins whose synthesis was initiated prior to addition of the drug (10Lodish H.G. Housman D. Jacobsen M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2348-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Stewart-Blair M.L. Yanowitz I.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide blocks elongation and prevents the normal completion and release of nascent proteins from RBTs (12Baliga B.S. Pronczuk A.W. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4480-4489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cycloheximide stabilizes polyribosomes and the association of 80S ribosomes with translocons, whereas PUR and PAC elicit rapid breakdown of polyribosomes, but leave the majority of translationally inactive 60S subunits bound to the RER (5Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We report that the permeability of the RER was sensitive to the manipulation of protein translation and changes in the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins, and we conclude that the permeability of the RER is dynamically coupled to protein translation. 4-MαG, cycloheximide, and puromycin-HCl were from Calbiochem. Pactamycin was a generous gift from The Upjohn Co. All other reagents were from Sigma. CHO-S cells (Invitrogen), a cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells and selected for growth in suspension, was used for most experiments. A cell line derived from HEK-293 cells for growth in suspension (HEK-293-F) was also obtained from Invitrogen. HepG2 and BHK-21 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). CHO-K1 cells were a gift from Ed Levitan (University of Pittsburgh). CHO-S and HEK-293-F cells were grown in serum-free medium (CHO-SFII and 293SFII medium, respectively, from Invitrogen). CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium containing 5% serum, and BHK-21 and HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C, 8% CO2. The 4-MαG assay was performed as described by Heritage and Wonderlin (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-S cells and HEK-293-F cells were typically grown to a density of 0.5–1.0 × 106cells/ml in T-75 flasks or in spinner flasks. For a 32-well assay (eight conditions in quadruplicate), 20 ml of cells was pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of K-G buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.25) and gently permeabilized by N2 cavitation (2 min, 80 p.s.i.). This procedure was modified for adherent cells. BHK-21 and CHO-K1 cells were grown in T-75 flasks, harvested by scraping, and then homogenized in K-G buffer by N2cavitation. HepG2 cells were grown to confluence in 48-well plates, and the medium was replaced with K-G buffer containing 0.08% digitonin (100 μl/well) for 5 min to permeabilize the cells and then diluted 1:5 with K-G buffer. Nunc 48-well plates were loaded with 0.5 ml of sample/well, the plate with solutions was prewarmed to 35 °C, and 4-MαG (20 μm from a 20 mm stock in methanol) was added immediately before placing the plate into a CytoFluor 4000 plate reader. The fluorescence was measured for 30 min at 2-min intervals with 10 s mixing before each measurement. The center wavelengths/bandwidths of the excitation and emission filters were 360/40 and 460/40, respectively. In CHO-S cells, 4-MαG is activated when it enters the lumen of the RER and it is hydrolyzed by α-glucosidase II. The slope of the fluorescence versus time curve,S (t), is proportional to the rate of entry and activation of the dye at time t. The linear and exponential contributions to S (t)were fitted by Equation 1, S(t)=S0·ek·tEquation 1 where S 0 is the initial slope (ΔF min−1) and k is an exponential rate constant (min−1). Best-fit estimates ofS 0 and k for each well were obtained using the Solver nonlinear curve-fitting routine in Excel (Microsoft). All experimental conditions were assayed in parallel ± detergent (0.05% Igepal, Fig. 2 A) so that the permeability to 4-MαG under a specific experimental condition could be expressed as a dimensionless fractional permeability (P), P=S0/S0,maxEquation 2 where S 0,max is the rate of activation after the RER membrane was permeabilized by detergent and the access of 4-MαG to the α-glucosidase II was maximal. Statistical analysis was performed using JMPin (SAS Institute). Averages are plotted ± standard error of the mean. CHO-S cells were loaded with 10 μm Fluo-3-AM (30 min, 23 °C) and then washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was measured with excitation at 485 nm in a CytoFluor 4000 plate reader. Adherent BHK-21 cells grown in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (8% CO2, 37 °C) were released by trypsinization and gentle trituration and then loaded with 10 μm Mag-Fura-2-AM (60 min, 37 °C) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus serum. The cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution and loaded into a stirred cuvette in a SPEX Fluorolog spectrometer. The ratio of fluorescence measured at 510 nm with excitation alternating between 340 and 380 nm was calculated at each time point without further calibration. We have studied the permeation of RBTs in CHO-S cells by 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (4-MαG), a small, membrane-impermeant probe; it's entry into the RER can be detected when it is hydrolyzed to a fluorescent product by luminal α-glucosidase II. We previously reported (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the activation of 4-MαG in intact CHO-S cells was negligible, but the selective rupture of the plasma membrane by N2 cavitation enabled 4-MαG to access the RER, and it revealed a substantial basal permeability of the RER to 4-MαG (P basal). This permeability was further increased to a level termed P PUR when nascent chains were released by the addition of PUR (Fig. 2). The static permeability model predicts thatP basal should be insensitive to changes in the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins produced by concomitant changes in protein translation. This model was tested using a two-step procedure. In the first step, cells were pretreated in culture with PUR, PAC, or CHX to produce changes in the occupancy of RBTs. In the second step, these cells were permeabilized, split into two samples, and P was determined in each sample either without PUR (P basal) or with PUR (P PUR) added to the sample, respectively. The occupancy of translationally active RBTs by nascent proteins after the pretreatment period was estimated by calculating the PUR-dependent increase in P, ΔPPUR=PPUR−PbasalEquation 3 where ΔP PUR is proportional to the number of blocked, translationally active RBTs that could be opened by PUR added during the assay. If pretreatments that decreased the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins (as inferred from a significant decrease in ΔP PUR) also significantly increasedP basal, the static model should be rejected. Given the importance of P basal and ΔP PUR in these tests, we first examined in greater detail three features of P basal and ΔP PUR in this system: (1) the similarity ofP basal and ΔP PURmeasured in CHO-S cells to other cell lines, (2) the specificity of ΔP PUR as a measure of the occupancy of translationally active RBTs by nascent chains, and (3) the contribution of RBT-mediated permeation to P basal. We examined the activation of 4-MαG in the absence and presence of PUR in CHO-S, CHO-K1, HEK-293-F, BHK-21, and HepG2 cells. We observed in all of these cell lines a substantialP basal and a similar 30–40% increase inP when puromycin was added to the assay (Fig. 2 B). The similarity between CHO-S and HepG2 cells is especially notable, because Seiser and Nicchitta (5Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that approximately two-thirds of the ribosomes remain bound to the RER membrane in HepG2 cells following either the premature termination of translation by PUR or the normal completion of translation with pactamycin. We conclude from these similarities that the mechanisms that regulate the permeation of RBTs are probably also similar among these cell lines and that the high P basal and the ΔP PUR are not unusual features of CHO-S cells. These results support our use of CHO-S cells in the present study as a model system for investigating the permeability of the RER. We previously concluded (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that ΔP PUR was produced by the release of nascent chains from translationally active RBTs on the basis of the generally recognized mechanism of action of puromycin as a tRNA analog (9Pestka S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the similar sensitivity to high salt of ΔP PUR and the binding of ribosomes to ER membranes (13Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the absence of ΔP PUR in the presence of detergent, which demonstrated that ΔP PUR required the entry of 4-MαG into a membrane-bound compartment. In the current study we wanted to use the size of ΔP PUR to track changes in the size of the pool of translationally active RBTs (i.e. those RBTs occupied by nascent proteins that could be released by PUR) in response to treatments with inhibitors of protein synthesis. The puromycin reaction catalyzed by the peptidyltransferase is essential for the release of nascent proteins, and we performed the following additional experiments to provide a more rigorous test of the specific dependence of ΔP PUR on the puromycin reaction. Anisomycin is an inhibitor of the peptidyltransferase and the puromycin reaction (14Ioannou M. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Synetos D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1089-1096PubMed Google Scholar). When added simultaneously with PUR, 50 μmanisomycin completely inhibited ΔP PUR, but it did not inhibit ΔP PUR when it was added 10 min after PUR, sufficient time for the irreversible release of nascent chains by PUR (Fig. 3 A). The failure of anisomycin to significantly inhibit ΔP PUR when added after PUR demonstrated that the ability of anisomycin to inhibit ΔP PURwhen applied with PUR did not result from nonspecific effects, such as blocking the pore of empty RBTs. We conclude from the complete inhibition of ΔP PUR when anisomycin was applied with PUR that the production of ΔP PURrequired an anisomycin-sensitive peptidyltransferase reaction. The puromycin reaction is maximum at pH 8.5–9.5, with a pKa of 7.2–7.6 and a steep decrease in rate at neutral pH and below (15Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Maden B.E. Monro R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We observed that ΔP PUR was inhibited when the buffer was acidified from pH 7.2 to pH 6.6 before the addition of PUR, but acidification to pH 6.6 15 min after the addition of PUR had no effect (Fig. 3 B). The temporal dependence of the inhibition by low pH leads us to conclude, again, that the inhibitory effect was on the puromycin reaction and not the permeability pathway. We conclude that the production of ΔP PUR is entirely dependent on the puromycin reaction catalyzed by the peptidyltransferase center, and it is therefore a valid measure of the release of nascent proteins from translationally active RBTs. The measurement of ΔP PUR provides an alternative approach for determining the size of the pool of translationally active RBTs that is much simpler than other methods (e.g.radiolabeling nascent proteins). It is also insensitive to translationally active ribosomes in the cytosol, because only the release of nascent proteins from translationally active ribosomes that are bound to the RER can increase the activation of 4-MαG. Although ΔP PUR provides only a relative measure of the translational activity of RBTs, that was sufficient for our current study in which we wanted to use ΔP PUR to track changes in the size of the pool of translationally active RBTs in response to inhibitors of protein synthesis. We have observed over a 2-year period that P basal can slowly change in CHO-S cells over the course of several weeks or months, with P basal ranging from 0.2 to 0.7. This variability led us to speculate that the entry of 4-MαG via pathways other than RBTs might contribute a labile background component to P basal and cause us to underestimate the importance of changes in P basal mediated specifically by permeation of RBTs. In the absence of drugs that can specifically inhibit the permeation of RBTs, we have estimated the component of P basal contributed by the permeation of RBTs, relative to the background permeability contributed by other, unidentified pathways, by examining the sensitivity ofP basal to high salt, which has been reported to release up to 85% of the translationally inactive ribosomes from the RER membrane in rat hepatocytes (path c, Fig. 1) (13Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although high salt might also inhibit RBT-independent pathways for the entry of 4-MαG, we have demonstrated previously (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that both the concentration of salt producing half-maximal block and the slope of the salt concentration-inhibition curve were identical for ΔP PUR and the salt-sensitive component ofP basal. We surmised from the remarkably similar sensitivities to high salt that both salt-sensitive components were produced by the entry of 4-MαG through a common pathway. Cells were split into two samples, with one sample broken open in high-salt (300 mm K) K-G buffer and the other sample broken open in normal (140 mm K) K-G buffer. A plot ofP basal measured in high-salt versusnormal buffer is shown in Fig. 3 C. The dotted line with unity slope indicates the relationship expected ifP basal was not affected by high salt, and it is clear that P basal measured in high salt was depressed relative to P basal measured in normal salt, consistent with our previous report thatP basal was sensitive to high salt (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Most importantly, a regression line fitted to these data had a slope of 0.94 (±0.10), insignificantly different from a value of 1. We conclude from the parallel downward shift of the relationship thatP basal was decreased on average by ≈0.2 in high-salt relative to normal-salt buffers regardless of the size ofP basal in normal salt. The data in Fig. 3 C also indicate that the apparent lower limit ofP basal is 0.2, from which we can conclude that in some samples of cells 4-MαG enters the RER exclusively through empty RBTs. These data indicate that the size of the salt-sensitive permeability to 4-MαG was surprisingly constant compared with the high variability of the salt-insensitive component. The primary test of the static permeability model was to determine whether pretreating cells with PUR prior to permeabilization could reversibly increaseP basal. CHO-S cells were pretreated with 200 μm PUR for 15 min to terminate translation and release nascent proteins from RBTs, after which half of the cells were permeabilized and assayed. Pretreatment with PUR significantly increased P basal while substantially reducing ΔP PUR (Fig. 4 A), as expected if all of the available nascent proteins were released from translationally active RBTs during the pretreatment period. If the increase inP basal resulted from the release of nascent proteins and the opening of RBTs, it should be reversed by restarting translation and increasing the occupancy of RBTs by nascent proteins. The remaining control and PUR-treated cells were pelleted, washed, and transferred to control medium for 30 min, at which timeP basal was not significantly different from the control level (Fig. 4 A), demonstrating that restarting protein synthesis could reverse the increase inP basal. To ensure that the increase inP basal produced by PUR was not an artifact of the premature release of truncated proteins by PUR, we also examined pactamycin, which should release full-length proteins. A 1-h pretreatment with PAC significantly increasedP basal and eliminated ΔP PUR (Fig. 4 B), as observed with PUR pretreatment. Similar, significant increases inP basal were observed following pretreatments with PAC for 5, 30, 60, or 360 min, indicating that the increase inP basal was both rapid and sustained (data not shown). The increase in P basal was eliminated when control and PAC-treated cells were permeabilized in a buffer in which the potassium glutamate concentration was increased to 300 mm (Fig. 4 B), which supports a role for empty RBTs because translationally inactive ribosomes can be stripped from the RER by a high-salt buffer (13Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Also, unlike PUR, the acute application of PAC to permeabilized control cells did not increaseP basal (data not shown), which is consistent with the ability of PUR to release nascent proteins directlyversus the PAC requirement that synthesis be completed and nascent proteins be released prior to permeabilization. The similar increase in P basal produced by pretreating intact cells with either PAC or PUR can be accounted for by the conversion of blocked RBTs to open RBTs. The increase inP basal was balanced entirely by the loss of ΔP PUR, resulting in no net increase inP PUR (Fig. 4, A and B), which was expected if the increase in P basaldepended solely on the conversion of blocked RBTs to open RBTs along path a in Fig. 1. Also, the increase inP basal produced by both PUR and PAC was about 70% of the ΔP PUR measured in control cells (Fig. 4, A and B, where ΔP PUR reflects the size of the translationally active pool in control cells), which was remarkably consistent with the previous report of a persistent binding of ≈65% of 60 S subunits after the release of nascent proteins (5Seiser R.M. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33820-33827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast to PUR and PAC, a 1-h pretreatment with 200 μm cycloheximide (CHX) did not increase P basal (Fig. 4 C). A similar lack of effect was observed with 5- or 360-min pretreatments (data not shown), indicating that the different effects of PAC and CHX were not limited to a specific point in time. The failure of CHX to increaseP basal demonstrated that the increasedP basal produced by PUR or PAC was not a nonspecific consequence of inhibiting protein translation (e.g. clearing of proteins from the lumen of the RER). The fact that PAC, but not PUR, requires elongation for the release of nascent chains led us to predict that CHX would prevent the increase inP basal by PAC, but CHX should have much less of an effect on the increase in P basal by PUR. Co-treatment with CHX completely prevented PAC from increasingP basal (Fig. 4 C), whereas CHX decreased ΔP PUR by only 20–30% (data not shown). We also examined changes in the permeability of the ER to Ca2+ to determine whether changes in the permeability to 4-MαG could be generalized to Ca2+ and as a control to ensure that changes in the permeability of the ER could be observed in intact cells in which no cytosolic constituents that might regulate the permeability of RBTs could be lost, in contrast to the 4-MαG assay that requires permeabilization of the plasma membrane for the entry of 4-MαG. Intact CHO-S cells were loaded with the Ca2+indicator Fluo-3 and treated in parallel with PUR and thapsigargin (TG), a selective inhibitor of the Ca-ATPase in the ER (17Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the response to TG providing a positive control for a Ca2+signal produced by the release of Ca2+ from the ER. Thapsigargin (100 nm) and PUR produced similar, triphasic changes in [Ca2+] (Fig. 5,A and B), both beginning with a transient increase. The increase in [Ca2+] elicited by PUR was not a nonspecific effect of inhibiting protein synthesis, because it was observed in cells in which protein synthesis was already inhibited by pretreatment with CHX (Fig. 5 A). We also used Mag-Fura-2 to monitor more specifically changes in the permeability to Ca2+. BHK-21 cells were loaded with Mag-Fura-2 under conditions in which the [Ca2+] in the lumen of the ER could be preferentially monitored (18Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect changes in luminal [Ca2+] with the addition of PUR to intact BHK-21 cells (data not shown), PUR significantly increased the rate of release of Ca2+ from the ER in intact cells when re-uptake was inhibited by TG (Fig. 5 C), evidence that the permeability to Ca2+ was increased. Our observation that PUR increased the permeability of the RER to calcium in intact cells is consistent with a recent report that PUR depleted calcium in the RER of dialyzed or permeabilized cells (4Lomax R.B. Camello C. Van Coppenolle F. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and our observations in intact cells demonstrated that the changes in the permeability to 4-MαG produced by PUR did not result from the loss of potential regulatory factors following permeabilization of the plasma membrane. We conclude from the experiments reported above that the permeability of the RER can be dynamically coupled to the level of protein translation by changes in the number of empty (i.e.open) versus blocked RBTs. Dynamic coupling could be produced by a simple mechanism requiring only the following features: (1) the pore of the PCC and the exit tunnel of the 60 S subunit are blocked by a nascent protein when the RBT is translationally active; (2) following the normal completion of translation and the release of a nascent protein, some empty ribosomes remain persistently bound to translocons; (3) the pore of empty RBTs is permeable to small molecules; and (4) the relative distribution of blockedversus empty translocons is influenced by the level of protein translation. The apparent high barrier to the permeation of translocons by small molecules, as described by Johnson and colleagues (Ref. 7Hamman B.D. Hendershot L.M. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar; also reviewed in Ref. 8Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), is probably limited to experimental conditions in which permeable, translationally inactive ribosomes have been stripped from translocons by high salt, leaving only impermeable, translationally active RBTs and closed, ribosome-free translocons. This conclusion is supported by our current and previous observation (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that P basal was significantly lower when measured in a high-salt buffer, presumably a result of the dissociation of ribosomes from translationally inactive RBTs. At a macroscopic level, the functional consequences of the dynamic coupling between P basal and protein translation depend on the dynamic range over which P basalcan vary, and we expect that this range will be affected by the properties of different permeant molecules. For 4-MαG, the release of all of the nascent chains by PUR or PAC increasedP basal by ≈30% (we have not yet examined the level to which P basal can be decreased by increasing translational activity and converting empty RBTs to blocked RBTs). However, the presence of both salt-sensitive and salt-insensitive components of P basal measured with 4-MαG provided evidence that it could enter the RER through one or more channels or carriers in addition to empty RBTs, which was not surprising given the small size and simple structure of 4-MαG. The increased background permeability resulting from the permeation of more than one pathway by 4-MαG reduced the apparent size of the increase in P basal that was produced by the release of nascent proteins. For larger molecules that can enter the RER by permeating empty RBTs but not via smaller channels or carriers, the dynamic range could be significantly larger. The dynamic coupling between P basal and protein translation appears to occur in addition to a substantial contribution of empty RBTs to the steady-state permeability of the RER. We measured the salt-sensitive component of P basal, which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the entry of 4-MαG through empty RBTs. From these measurements we estimated that permeation of salt-sensitive, empty RBTs in the absence of puromycin consistently contributed a fractional permeability to 4-MαG of 0.2 regardless of the size of P basal (Fig. 3 C). Given an average size of ΔP PURof 0.10 (2Heritage D. Wonderlin W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22655-22662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we estimate that the ratio of empty to occupied RBTs might be as high as ≈2:1. This ratio is considerably higher than expected based on ultrastructural studies in which most ribosomes appear to be part of translationally active polysomes (e.g. Fig. 174 in Ref. 20Fawcet D.W. The Cell. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia1981: 321Google Scholar). However, our results are more consistent with a study by Adelman et al. (13Adelman M.R. Sabatini D.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 206-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in which ∼40% of the ribosomes could be released from rat liver microsomes with salt alone, and an additional 40–45% could be released with the combination of high salt and puromycin. These authors concluded that the ribosomes released by high salt in the absence of puromycin were mostly translationally inactive, empty ribosomes, and their results would support a ratio of empty to occupied RBTs of ≈1:1. Our results are also consistent with a high permeability to small solutes observed in rough microsomes prepared from rat liver without treatment with high salt (19Meissner G. Allen R. J. Biol.

A high resting permeability to small molecules mediated by empty RBTs also raises the question as to how the RER might maintain essential gradients across its membrane or different environments (e.g. oxidizing versus reducing) in the lumenversus the cytosol. Although the Ca-ATPase in the ER membrane could maintain a calcium gradient in the presence of a leak pathway, it is less clear which transporters might maintain gradients for other molecules of interest. Of course, any speculation as to the potential effect of empty RBTs on the permeability of the RER to small molecules must be tempered by the fact that thus far we have only demonstrated permeation by 4-MαG and calcium, and further study will be required to determine the repertoire of small molecules that can permeate empty RBTs. The macroscopic changes in P basal described above might be especially important during global changes in protein translation, such as when the initiation of protein synthesis is inhibited in response to cellular stress (21Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this context, the increase in P basal produced by PAC provides a new clue into the mechanism of stress-induced apoptosis. Many cytosolic and ER stressors inhibit the initiation of protein translation by activating the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF-2α (21Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), an effect mimicked by PAC. If inhibiting the initiation of translation increases the permeability of the RER, as we observed with PAC, then RER-dependent homeostatic processes might be disrupted, thereby promoting apoptosis. The ability of cycloheximide to stabilize nascent chains within RBTs and prevent PAC from increasingP basal might explain why CHX can also prevent stress-induced apoptosis under conditions in which protein synthesis is already inhibited, such as during ischemia/reperfusion (22Musat-Marcu S. Gunter H.E. Jugdutt B.I. Docherty J.C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1073-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); and the opposing actions of CHX and PUR on P basal might account for the paradoxical, pro-apoptotic effects of PUR in situations where CHX is protective (23Chow S.C. Peters I. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Kelley L.L. Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From a methodological perspective, experimental manipulations that stress cells and inhibit the initiation of protein synthesis (e.g. removing extracellular calcium) could have large effects on the permeability of the RER. Dynamic fluctuations in P basal might also occur at a microscopic level as protein synthesis within local regions of the RER undergoes its normal cyclical course. For example, the permeation of empty RBTs by calcium or other small molecules following the release of a completed protein could produce a diffusible signal coupled to the end of translation, perhaps playing a role in stimulating the disassembly and reassembly of a translationally active RBT with successive cycles of protein translation. Molecules entering the lumen through an empty RBT might also signal its availability for the retrograde export of misfolded proteins through the pore of the RBT (25Romisch K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4185-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At a microscopic level, the opening of RBTs might produce nearly quantal changes in P basal compared with the macroscopic changes in P basal averaged over larger dimensions. For example, the opening of an RBT could produce a rapid and large change in the local concentrations of molecules within the lumen of the RER, given the very small volume of the lumen and the potentially large flux of molecules through an empty RBT. In conclusion, the permeability of the RER to small molecules should be viewed as a dynamic property influenced by protein translation. We propose that dynamic coupling could occur in any cells in which empty ribosomes remain bound to translocons following the completion of translation. Recognition of the dynamic nature of this relationship provides new insight into the generation of novel signals and the potential loss of homeostatic regulation under pathophysiological conditions.

Previously, we have shown the in vitro formation of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c 552 (Daltrop, O., Allen, J. W. A., Willis, A. C., and Ferguson, S. J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work we report that thioether bonds can form spontaneously in vitro between heme and the apocytochromes c from horse heart and Paracoccus denitrificans via b-type cytochrome intermediates. Both apocytochromes, but not the holo forms, bind 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate, indicating that the apoproteins each have an affinity for a hydrophobic ligand. Furthermore, for both apocytochromes c an intramolecular disulfide can form between the cysteines of the CXXCH motif that is characteristic of c-type cytochromes.

They contain a characteristic CXXCH motif, whereby the conserved cysteine residues are involved in forming a covalent thioether bond between the thiol functionalities and the vinyl groups of the prosthetic heme moiety (3Barker P.D.

Remarkably, three different systems have evolved to facilitate cytochrome c formation in vivo (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

In some eukaryotes, one enzyme, designated heme lyase, catalyzes the attachment of the heme moiety to the apocytochromec (6Steiner H. Kispal G. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol.

Mammalian organisms make use of this system as exemplified by horse (Equus caballus) heart mitochondria.Many Gram-negative bacteria use a system that involves more than ten gene products to ensure correct cytochrome c maturation (ccm) 1The abbreviations used are: ccm, cytochromec maturation; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; CD, circular dichroism; ES-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry 1The abbreviations used are: ccm, cytochromec maturation; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; CD, circular dichroism; ES-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry in the periplasm (5Page M.D. Sambongi Y.

An example of a cytochrome c that is matured in vivo using this biosynthesis apparatus is cytochromec 550 from P. denitrificans (10Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Following our report of the in vitro formation of holocytochrome c 552 from H. thermophilus (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), an important point to be established was whether the spontaneous attachment of heme to apocytochromec is a reaction applicable to other cytochromesc. Because holocytochrome c 552 fromH. thermophilus forms exceptionally in the cytoplasm ofEscherichia coli (12Sinha N. Ferguson S.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its spontaneous in vitroformation might not necessarily be anticipated to apply generally to all c-type cytochromes. The previously reported thioether bond formation in holocytochrome c 552 from ofH. thermophilus involved a b-type cytochrome intermediate (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prompted by the previously reported similar ability of the horse heart apocytochrome to bind heme to yield a species characteristic of a b-type cytochrome (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the reaction of horse heart apocytochrome c with heme has been reinvestigated.The formation of c-type cytochromes is especially interesting in light of the different biosynthetic pathways, which are reviewed extensively elsewhere (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem.

Trans. 2002; 30: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), by which heme is attached to the apoproteins in vivo. Therefore, a second candidate for studying the reaction of heme with apocytochrome was P. denitrificans cytochrome c 550. The two cytochromes used in this study are matured by two different cytochromec maturation systems in vivo. A comparison of the reactions with respect to the attachment mechanism is anticipated to have important implications for the molecular basis of heme attachment in different organisms in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this work we show the data obtained from the production of apocytochromes c from a bacterial and a mammalian organism and characterize the reaction of the cysteine thiols with the vinyl moieties of heme. Both proteins have very similar properties with regard to their apoforms and their reaction with heme. We show that the cysteines of the conserved CXXCH motif can form an internal disulfide. This observation raises the question if this oxidation occurs in vivo for the respective proteins in either organism. For the bacterial system it has been suggested that the disulfide is an important intermediate during cytochrome cmaturation due to the presence of the disulfide bond forming (Dsb) proteins in the periplasm, the location of cytochrome cmaturation (2Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that proteins (CcmG/H and DsbD) required for cytochrome c biogenesis are involved in the reduction of the internal disulfide bond in the apocytochrome (9Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Why this in situ reduction of an apocytochrome has evolved is unclear, but an internal protection mechanism against metallation of the coordination site of the reduced apocytochrome might offer an explanation.Heme attachment to mitochondrial apocytochrome c occurs in the intermembrane space (29Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The in vivo oxidation state of the cysteines in mitochondrial apocytochromes c has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Whether, as we show here for the first time in vitro, a disulfide bond occurs during thein vivo protein maturation process, will depend on both the reduction potential of its locus and kinetic factors. If formation of a disulfide must be avoided, a thioredoxin-like protein could be required in the intermembrane space (30Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A thioredoxin (Trx3) and its reductase (Trr2) are known to be present in yeast mitochondria, but submitochondrial localization to the matrix is suspected rather than to the intermembrane space (31Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These proteins can in any case be deduced to be dispensable for cytochrome c biogenesis in yeast, as mutants carrying specific disruptions in the corresponding genes were able to grow normally under aerobic, respiratory conditions, which require participation of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, in the case of Arabidopsis thaliana, it has been recognized, on the basis of the genome sequence, that there may be a yet to be characterized thioredoxin that is targeted to the intermembrane space (30Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the formation of holocytochrome c may happen sufficiently fast that the two thiols of apocytochrome c cannot form a disulfide during its lifetime in the intermembrane space following delivery from the reducing environment of the cytoplasm. Such a kinetic constraint would suffice if the rate of disulfide bond formation in the intermembrane space were to occur on a similar timescale to thatin vitro (hours as observed in the present work). The presence of the CcmABCEF components of one cytochrome cbiogenesis pathway, but not of the thioredoxin-like CcmG component, in plant mitochondria might support the latter view.The binding of heme to the apoform of mitochondrial cytochromec clearly involves some ordering of the polypeptide chain. This is evident from several biophysical studies (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A non-covalent complex between heme and apoprotein of H. thermophilus cytochrome c 552 generates a protein structure that is very similar to that of the native protein with covalently bound heme (32Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although it appears that the structure of the non-covalent complex between heme and mitochondrial apocytochromec does not fully resemble the native, holo structure (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,28Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), studies with two monoclonal antibodies that scarcely recognize the apoprotein, but bind with comparable affinities to both the non-covalent heme-apoprotein complex and the holoprotein, indicate that the complex must be similar to the holoprotein in respect of quite specific structural features at the epitope regions (28Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such similarities are evidently sufficient to permit the vinyl groups of heme to be oriented appropriately, in at least a fraction of the molecules, for reaction with the thiol groups, which have previously been shown to exhibit nucleophilic reactivity (27Kang X. Carey J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15944-15951Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The effect of covalently bound hydrophobic moieties on the folding of cytochromec has also been discussed (27Kang X. Carey J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15944-15951Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The affinity of the apoproteins for hydrophobic ligands and the ability of both apoproteins to ligate heme in a b-type cytochrome complex has important implications for the catalytic strategy of the enzymes involved during cytochrome c maturation. It is unclear from previous studies how the heme lyase functions in mitochondria, except for the proposal that it binds heme via a conserved CPX motif (6Steiner H. Kispal G. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32605-32611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the bacterial Ccm system, two proteins have been proposed to function as a heme lyase (33Ren Q. Ahuja U. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the heme attachment is more complex due to the presence of a heme chaperone, CcmE (34Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, in view of our data showing that theb-type cytochrome can spontaneously react to give thioether bond formation yielding holocytochrome c, two key conditions have to be achieved by the catalytic systems. Firstly, the heme group has to be kept reduced to give optimal reactivity for cysteine-thiol and heme-vinyl group reaction partners. This is in agreement with previous studies (35Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Tong J. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25695-25702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). And secondly, the orientation of the heme relative to its rotation around the α,γ meso-axis has to be correct to yield the required stereochemistry at the prochiral α-carbon of the vinyl substituents of the heme moiety (3Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). McRee et al.(37McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that a recombinant cytochrome c ofThermus thermophilus could be improperly matured in vivo, but without any catalytic assistance in the cytoplasm ofE. coli, because of both heme inversion and an intermolecular disulfide bond between cysteine residues, which are usually involved in heme binding (37McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The latter behavior was clearly reflected in the visible absorption spectrum, which was different from the reported, properly matured holocytochrome c, and the pyridine hemochrome spectrum, which was not indicative of two thioether bonds to the heme-vinyl groups (37McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For mitochondrial cytochromec, two thioether bonds have formed in the present work. In the case of in vitro reaction of heme with P. denitrificans apocytochrome c 550 it is not evident if the reaction yielded a mixture of only b- andc-type cytochrome complexes or also contained species with only one thioether bond. Due to the presence of DTT during the course of the reaction, no reaction product containing an intermolecular disulfide bond is obtained in vitro.In the in vitro reaction, the oxidation state of the heme can be controlled, but the heme delivery is nonspecific with respect to the stereochemical aspects of the heme orientation. The stereochemistry for the in vitro produced cytochromesc is not determined and will be focus of future work. However, the fact that a fraction of the mitochondrialb-type cytochrome intermediate remained unreactive might hint that incorrect orientation of heme does not lead to thioether bond formation, suggesting the in vitro cytochromec formation to be stereoselective. In the case of thein vitro formation of H. thermophilus c 552 the reaction is stereoselective (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).An interesting point arises from the observation that neither P. denitrificans c 550 (10Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) nor mitochondrial cytochromec, in the absence of a heme lyase (38Pollock W.B. Rosell F.I. Twitchett M.B. Dumont M.E. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 39Patel C.N. Lind M.C. Pielak G.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), can form in the cytoplasm of E. coli, in contrast to H. thermophilus c 552 (12Sinha N. Ferguson S.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations might reflect the stability and the folding state of the apoproteins, but not the intrinsic difference in their reactivity toward heme, which is shown from previous (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and present work to be similar for the three apocytochromes c. The higher stability and partial folding (24Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of H. thermophilus c 552apocytochrome may lead to a slower rate of degradation in the cytoplasm of E. coli and a higher heme affinity compared with the two proteins studied in this work. Therefore, in addition to the aspects mentioned above, another function of the heme lyase may be to increase the heme affinity of the apocytochrome c.In summary, we have shown that two c-type cytochromes, from a mesophilic bacterium and a mammalian mitochondrion, can form in vitro from the reaction of apocytochrome and heme. Remarkably, this reaction of horse heart cytochrome has not been reported despite first having been attempted nearly 30 years ago (15Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction generally seems to proceed from a b-type cytochrome intermediate, provided the potential disulfide between the conserved cysteine residues is avoided and the heme-iron is reduced. Indeed, we suspect that had Dumont et al. (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) extended their duration, and/or modified the reaction condition for instance by exclusion of oxygen, of incubation of heme with apocytochrome c, they too might have seen covalent bond formation to heme. C-type cytochromes are found in almost all organisms, being mainly involved in electron transport (1Scott R.A. Mauk A.G. Cytochrome C: A Multidisciplinary Approach. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1995Google Scholar, 2Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They contain a characteristic CXXCH motif, whereby the conserved cysteine residues are involved in forming a covalent thioether bond between the thiol functionalities and the vinyl groups of the prosthetic heme moiety (3Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Remarkably, three different systems have evolved to facilitate cytochrome c formation in vivo (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

In some eukaryotes, one enzyme, designated heme lyase, catalyzes the attachment of the heme moiety to the apocytochromec (6Steiner H. Kispal G. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), an important point to be established was whether the spontaneous attachment of heme to apocytochromec is a reaction applicable to other cytochromesc. Because holocytochrome c 552 fromH. thermophilus forms exceptionally in the cytoplasm ofEscherichia coli (12Sinha N. Ferguson S.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its spontaneous in vitroformation might not necessarily be anticipated to apply generally to all c-type cytochromes. The previously reported thioether bond formation in holocytochrome c 552 from ofH. thermophilus involved a b-type cytochrome intermediate (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prompted by the previously reported similar ability of the horse heart apocytochrome to bind heme to yield a species characteristic of a b-type cytochrome (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the reaction of horse heart apocytochrome c with heme has been reinvestigated. The formation of c-type cytochromes is especially interesting in light of the different biosynthetic pathways, which are reviewed extensively elsewhere (4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), by which heme is attached to the apoproteins in vivo. Therefore, a second candidate for studying the reaction of heme with apocytochrome was P. denitrificans cytochrome c 550. The two cytochromes used in this study are matured by two different cytochromec maturation systems in vivo. A comparison of the reactions with respect to the attachment mechanism is anticipated to have important implications for the molecular basis of heme attachment in different organisms in vivo. DISCUSSIONIn this work we show the data obtained from the production of apocytochromes c from a bacterial and a mammalian organism and characterize the reaction of the cysteine thiols with the vinyl moieties of heme. Both proteins have very similar properties with regard to their apoforms and their reaction with heme. We show that the cysteines of the conserved CXXCH motif can form an internal disulfide. This observation raises the question if this oxidation occurs in vivo for the respective proteins in either organism. For the bacterial system it has been suggested that the disulfide is an important intermediate during cytochrome cmaturation due to the presence of the disulfide bond forming (Dsb) proteins in the periplasm, the location of cytochrome cmaturation (2Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that proteins (CcmG/H and DsbD) required for cytochrome c biogenesis are involved in the reduction of the internal disulfide bond in the apocytochrome (9Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Why this in situ reduction of an apocytochrome has evolved is unclear, but an internal protection mechanism against metallation of the coordination site of the reduced apocytochrome might offer an explanation.Heme attachment to mitochondrial apocytochrome c occurs in the intermembrane space (29Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The in vivo oxidation state of the cysteines in mitochondrial apocytochromes c has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Whether, as we show here for the first time in vitro, a disulfide bond occurs during thein vivo protein maturation process, will depend on both the reduction potential of its locus and kinetic factors. If formation of a disulfide must be avoided, a thioredoxin-like protein could be required in the intermembrane space (30Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A thioredoxin (Trx3) and its reductase (Trr2) are known to be present in yeast mitochondria, but submitochondrial localization to the matrix is suspected rather than to the intermembrane space (31Pedrajas J.R. Kosmidou E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6366-6373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These proteins can in any case be deduced to be dispensable for cytochrome c biogenesis in yeast, as mutants carrying specific disruptions in the corresponding genes were able to grow normally under aerobic, respiratory conditions, which require participation of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, in the case of Arabidopsis thaliana, it has been recognized, on the basis of the genome sequence, that there may be a yet to be characterized thioredoxin that is targeted to the intermembrane space (30Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.M. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the formation of holocytochrome c may happen sufficiently fast that the two thiols of apocytochrome c cannot form a disulfide during its lifetime in the intermembrane space following delivery from the reducing environment of the cytoplasm. Such a kinetic constraint would suffice if the rate of disulfide bond formation in the intermembrane space were to occur on a similar timescale to thatin vitro (hours as observed in the present work). The presence of the CcmABCEF components of one cytochrome cbiogenesis pathway, but not of the thioredoxin-like CcmG component, in plant mitochondria might support the latter view.The binding of heme to the apoform of mitochondrial cytochromec clearly involves some ordering of the polypeptide chain. This is evident from several biophysical studies (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A non-covalent complex between heme and apoprotein of H. thermophilus cytochrome c 552 generates a protein structure that is very similar to that of the native protein with covalently bound heme (32Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although it appears that the structure of the non-covalent complex between heme and mitochondrial apocytochromec does not fully resemble the native, holo structure (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,28Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), studies with two monoclonal antibodies that scarcely recognize the apoprotein, but bind with comparable affinities to both the non-covalent heme-apoprotein complex and the holoprotein, indicate that the complex must be similar to the holoprotein in respect of quite specific structural features at the epitope regions (28Goldberg M.E. Schaeffer F. Guillou Y. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16052-16061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such similarities are evidently sufficient to permit the vinyl groups of heme to be oriented appropriately, in at least a fraction of the molecules, for reaction with the thiol groups, which have previously been shown to exhibit nucleophilic reactivity (27Kang X. Carey J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15944-15951Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The effect of covalently bound hydrophobic moieties on the folding of cytochromec has also been discussed (27Kang X. Carey J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15944-15951Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The affinity of the apoproteins for hydrophobic ligands and the ability of both apoproteins to ligate heme in a b-type cytochrome complex has important implications for the catalytic strategy of the enzymes involved during cytochrome c maturation. It is unclear from previous studies how the heme lyase functions in mitochondria, except for the proposal that it binds heme via a conserved CPX motif (6Steiner H. Kispal G. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32605-32611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the bacterial Ccm system, two proteins have been proposed to function as a heme lyase (33Ren Q. Ahuja U. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7657-7663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but the heme attachment is more complex due to the presence of a heme chaperone, CcmE (34Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, in view of our data showing that theb-type cytochrome can spontaneously react to give thioether bond formation yielding holocytochrome c, two key conditions have to be achieved by the catalytic systems. Firstly, the heme group has to be kept reduced to give optimal reactivity for cysteine-thiol and heme-vinyl group reaction partners. This is in agreement with previous studies (35Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4340-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Tong J. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25695-25702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). And secondly, the orientation of the heme relative to its rotation around the α,γ meso-axis has to be correct to yield the required stereochemistry at the prochiral α-carbon of the vinyl substituents of the heme moiety (3Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R281-R290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). McRee et al.(37McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that a recombinant cytochrome c ofThermus thermophilus could be improperly matured in vivo, but without any catalytic assistance in the cytoplasm ofE. coli, because of both heme inversion and an intermolecular disulfide bond between cysteine residues, which are usually involved in heme binding (37McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The latter behavior was clearly reflected in the visible absorption spectrum, which was different from the reported, properly matured holocytochrome c, and the pyridine hemochrome spectrum, which was not indicative of two thioether bonds to the heme-vinyl groups (37McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For mitochondrial cytochromec, two thioether bonds have formed in the present work. In the case of in vitro reaction of heme with P. denitrificans apocytochrome c 550 it is not evident if the reaction yielded a mixture of only b- andc-type cytochrome complexes or also contained species with only one thioether bond. Due to the presence of DTT during the course of the reaction, no reaction product containing an intermolecular disulfide bond is obtained in vitro.In the in vitro reaction, the oxidation state of the heme can be controlled, but the heme delivery is nonspecific with respect to the stereochemical aspects of the heme orientation. The stereochemistry for the in vitro produced cytochromesc is not determined and will be focus of future work. However, the fact that a fraction of the mitochondrialb-type cytochrome intermediate remained unreactive might hint that incorrect orientation of heme does not lead to thioether bond formation, suggesting the in vitro cytochromec formation to be stereoselective. In the case of thein vitro formation of H. thermophilus c 552 the reaction is stereoselective (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).An interesting point arises from the observation that neither P. denitrificans c 550 (10Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) nor mitochondrial cytochromec, in the absence of a heme lyase (38Pollock W.B. Rosell F.I. Twitchett M.B. Dumont M.E. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 39Patel C.N. Lind M.C. Pielak G.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), can form in the cytoplasm of E. coli, in contrast to H. thermophilus c 552 (12Sinha N. Ferguson S.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations might reflect the stability and the folding state of the apoproteins, but not the intrinsic difference in their reactivity toward heme, which is shown from previous (11Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and present work to be similar for the three apocytochromes c. The higher stability and partial folding (24Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of H. thermophilus c 552apocytochrome may lead to a slower rate of degradation in the cytoplasm of E. coli and a higher heme affinity compared with the two proteins studied in this work. Therefore, in addition to the aspects mentioned above, another function of the heme lyase may be to increase the heme affinity of the apocytochrome c.In summary, we have shown that two c-type cytochromes, from a mesophilic bacterium and a mammalian mitochondrion, can form in vitro from the reaction of apocytochrome and heme. Remarkably, this reaction of horse heart cytochrome has not been reported despite first having been attempted nearly 30 years ago (15Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction generally seems to proceed from a b-type cytochrome intermediate, provided the potential disulfide between the conserved cysteine residues is avoided and the heme-iron is reduced. Indeed, we suspect that had Dumont et al. (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) extended their duration, and/or modified the reaction condition for instance by exclusion of oxygen, of incubation of heme with apocytochrome c, they too might have seen covalent bond formation to heme. In this work we show the data obtained from the production of apocytochromes c from a bacterial and a mammalian organism and characterize the reaction of the cysteine thiols with the vinyl moieties of heme. Both proteins have very similar properties with regard to their apoforms and their reaction with heme. We show that the cysteines of the conserved CXXCH motif can form an internal disulfide.

Remarkably, this reaction of horse heart cytochrome has not been reported despite first having been attempted nearly 30 years ago (15Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction generally seems to proceed from a b-type cytochrome intermediate, provided the potential disulfide between the conserved cysteine residues is avoided and the heme-iron is reduced. Indeed, we suspect that had Dumont et al. (13Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) extended their duration, and/or modified the reaction condition for instance by exclusion of oxygen, of incubation of heme with apocytochrome c, they too might have seen covalent bond formation to heme.

https://openalex.org/W2022206193,"DNA polymerase (pol) β is a two-domain DNA repair enzyme that undergoes structural transitions upon binding substrates. Crystallographic structures indicate that these transitions include movement of the amino-terminal 8-kDa lyase domain relative to the 31-kDa polymerase domain. Additionally, a polymerase subdomain moves toward the nucleotide-binding pocket after nucleotide binding, resulting in critical contacts between α-helix N and the nascent base pair. Kinetic and structural characterization of pol β has suggested that these conformational changes participate in stabilizing the ternary enzyme-substrate complex facilitating chemistry. To probe the microenvironment and dynamics of both the lyase domain and α-helix N in the polymerase domain, the single native tryptophan (Trp-325) of wild-type enzyme was replaced with alanine, and tryptophan was strategically substituted for residues in the lyase domain (F25W/W325A) or near the end of α-helix N (L287W/W325A). Influences of substrate on the fluorescence anisotropy decay of these single tryptophan forms of pol β were determined. The results revealed that the segmental motion of α-helix N was rapid (∼1 ns) and far more rapid than the step that limits chemistry. Binding of Mg2+ and/or gapped DNA did not cause a noticeable change in the rotational correlation time or angular amplitude of tryptophan in α-helix N. More important, binding of a correct nucleotide significantly limited the angular range of the nanosecond motion within α-helix N. In contrast, the segmental motion of the 8-kDa domain was “frozen” upon DNA binding alone, and this restriction did not increase further upon nucleotide binding. The dynamics of α-helix N are discussed from the perspective of the “open” to “closed” conformational change of pol β deduced from crystallography, and the results are more generally discussed in the context of reaction cycle-regulated flexibility for proteins acting as molecular motors.

DNA polymerase (pol) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymeraseβ is a 39-kDa enzyme composed of two distinct domains of 8- and 31-kDa connected by a protease-hypersensitive hinge region. The amino-terminal 8-kDa domain possesses the 5′–deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity required to process the 5′-terminus in a DNA gap during base excision repair. The polymerase active site is part of the carboxyl-terminal 31-kDa domain (for a review see Ref. 1Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The domain and subdomain organization of pol β is illustrated in Fig. 1,A and B. Although pol β appears to have evolved separately from other families of polymerases of known structure (2Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it shares many general structural and mechanistic features with other polymerases. The polymerase domain is composed of three functionally distinguishable subdomains. The polymerase catalytic subdomain coordinates two divalent metal cations that assist the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. Two additional subdomains that have primary roles in duplex DNA binding and nascent base pair (nucleoside 5′-triphosphate and templating nucleotide) binding border the catalytic subdomain. These subdomains will be referred to as C (catalytic)-,d (duplex DNA binding)-, and N (nascent base pair binding)-subdomains to discern their intrinsic function. These would correspond to the palm, thumb, and fingers subdomains, respectively, according to the nomenclature that utilizes the architectural analogy to a right hand (3Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). 2The subdomain nomenclature as originally proposed for pol β utilized the right-hand analogy (4,48); however, it is functionally opposite to that employed for other DNA polymerases. To eliminate possible confusion, a functionally based nomenclature is employed as outlined in the text. 2The subdomain nomenclature as originally proposed for pol β utilized the right-hand analogy (4,48); however, it is functionally opposite to that employed for other DNA polymerases. To eliminate possible confusion, a functionally based nomenclature is employed as outlined in the text. Because of its small size, lack of accessory proteins, and excellent expression properties, pol β serves as an excellent model for study of the nucleotidyl transferase reaction, DNA synthesis fidelity, and protein-DNA interactions.

Comparison of the structure of pol β in different liganded states indicates that there are numerous structural transitions that occur upon substrate binding. These transitions include repositioning of the amino-terminal lyase domain toward the carboxyl polymerase domain upon binding DNA. Additionally, a large, ∼30°, rotation of α-helix M repositions α-helix N adjacent to the nascent base pair upon binding a dNTP to form a ternary complex (9Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repositioning of α-helix N upon binding a nucleotide results in an “open” (−dNTP) to “closed” (+dNTP) conformational transition and forms an effective active site that coordinates two Mg2+ ions (see Fig. 1 C). When bound to single-nucleotide gapped DNA, the overall architecture of pol β resembles a doughnut, which suggests that nucleotide access may be restricted (9Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Upon binding a correct dNTP and forming a closed complex, extensive contacts are observed between the polymerase and nascent base pair (6Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 7Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The structure of pol β bound to single-nucleotide gapped DNA indicates that the template strand is bent ∼90° as it enters the polymerase active site, permitting polymerase stacking interactions with one face of the nascent base pair and the DNA minor groove. This allows for a survey of the geometry of the nascent base pair to probe whether it conforms to Watson-Crick geometry. The structure of a “catalytic intermediate” ternary complex of pol β indicates that closure of the N-subdomain can be induced by metal-dNTP binding in the absence of the catalytic metal (8Arndt J.W. Gong W. Zhong X. Showalter A.K. Liu J. Dunlap C.A. Lin Z. Paxson C. Tsai M.-D. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5368-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Kinetic approaches to study nucleotide insertion and fidelity have indicated that rate-limiting conformational changes occur before and after chemistry, suggesting an induced-fit mechanism for nucleotide insertion and fidelity (see Ref.11Yang L. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Broyde S. Schlick T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 679-699Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The identity of the proposed conformational changes are unknown, but recent kinetic (8Arndt J.W. Gong W. Zhong X. Showalter A.K. Liu J. Dunlap C.A. Lin Z. Paxson C. Tsai M.-D. Chan M.K.

Biol. 2002; 317: 679-699Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) studies with pol β indicate that it is not the large subdomain movements inferred from structural studies. However, the rate and function of this large structural transition remains unknown. DNA polymerases are more than nucleotidyl transferase catalytic centers. Some DNA polymerases are processive and remain bound to the DNA substrate as they move along the template strand synthesizing DNA. DNA polymerase β is known to be processive on short gapped DNA but distributive on non-gapped DNA (13Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the isolated polymerase domain (31-kDa domain) of pol β exhibits only distributive DNA synthesis (14Kumar A. Abbotts J. Karawya E.M. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7156-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the 8-kDa lyase domain confers processive DNA synthesis to the intact enzyme. The dynamic description of processive DNA polymerases should include their catalytic properties (e.g.DNA and dNTP binding, conformational changes, and chemistry), as well as their movement (i.e. translocation). The force and velocity of RNA polymerase has been studied as a function of load (15Wang M.D. Schnitzer M.J. Yin H. Landick R. Gelles J. Block S.M. Science. 1998; 282: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), and it appears to function as a molecular motor. Recently, the vectorial nature of these motors has been modeled in terms of a “Brownian Ratchet” (16Yin H. Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Gelles J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13124-13129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Brokaw C.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1333-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The requirements for rectification of Brownian motion seem to be as follows: 1) a cycle of flexibility and/or hinging motion followed by one or more rigid states in the biopolymer, 2) the coupling of nearly irreversible chemical events to selected portions of the cycle, and 3) a change in conformation or binding affinity associated with those events. The myosin-actin and dynein-tubulin systems are prototypes for this model (17Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Brokaw C.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1333-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Regulation of flexibility also plays a role in recognition; in particular, some protein-protein associations are mediated by “target-induced folding” of disordered domains (19Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 20Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Hensley P. Porter D. Knutson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4827-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). In those systems, target-dependent structure seems to be a compromise to achieve relatively tight binding without the stringent, and selective, needs of a “lock and key” interface. We remain cognizant that we are using dynamics measured in hundreds of picoseconds to a few nanoseconds to study cycles requiring at least hundreds of milliseconds; nevertheless, nanosecond flexibility is clearly relevant to an understanding of the conformational events in that cycle. Gangal et al. (22Gangal M. Cox S. Lew J. Clifford T. Garrod S.M. Aschbaher M. Taylor S.S. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13728-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown that the 1–3-ns rotational correlation times of fluorescein conjugated to engineered surface cysteines correlate strongly with the long-term structural disorder reported by crystallographic B-factors for the adjacent backbone elements. The measurement of segmental flexibility has a long history (see Ref. 23Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1967: 432-456Google Scholar); in particular, emission anisotropy has a long history of revealing local motions (24Wahl P. Paoletti J. Le Pecq J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Weber G. Anderson S.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, time-resolved methods have the advantage of quantifying both the angular extent and the rate of these motions (24Wahl P. Paoletti J. Le Pecq J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26Munro I. Pecht I. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 27Yguerabide J. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 498-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In favorable cases, the fast motion of a segment on a loose “hinge” can be interpreted both in terms of the size of the independent segment and the angular range of facile hinging. Even in flexible coiled polymers, the fast term presents a measure of granularity and offers insight into the persistence of rigid segments (28Tcherkasskaya O. Ptitsyn O.B. Knutson J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1879-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In all, nanosecond flexibility appears to be an important predictor of functional flexibility. Wild-type pol β is comprised of 335 amino acids and includes a single tryptophan near the carboxyl terminus (Trp-325; see Fig. 1,A and B). The effects of metal binding on the tryptophan fluorescence and the hydrodynamic shape of wild-type rat pol β were characterized previously (29Kim S.J. Lewis M.S. Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by time-resolved fluorescence and analytical ultracentrifugation. In this study, we have strategically positioned tryptophan residues in the lyase domain (F25W/W325A) or N-subdomain (L287W/W325A) by site-directed mutagenesis to monitor changes in flexibility of these structural elements upon binding substrates. We interpret changes in flexibility in the context of pol β function. Wild-type and mutant derivatives of human recombinant pol β were overexpressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described (30Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis and activity measurements were performed as described previously (31Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Yang X.-P. DeLauder S.F. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8235-8242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzyme concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21,200 cm−1m−1 (32Casas-Finet J.R. Karpel R.L. Maki A.H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 693-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Acrylamide and melatonin were obtained from Sigma. A 24-mer DNA substrate was prepared by annealing three high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) to create a single-nucleotide gap at position 13. Each oligonucleotide was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA, and the concentration was determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. The annealing reactions were carried out by incubating a solution of 10 μm primer with 11 μm of both the downstream and template oligonucleotides at 90 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The sequence of the gapped DNA substrate was as follows: upstream 12-mer primer, 5′-CCGCTGATGCGC-3′; downstream 11-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-GTCGGTGGGCC-3′; 24-mer template, 5′-GGCCCACCGACAGCGCATCAGCGG-3′. The 3′-end of the upstream primer was synthesized without a 3′-hydroxyl so it would not be extended with the addition of pol β and dNTP. The downstream primer was synthesized with a 5′-phosphate. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8453 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA), and fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on an SLM AB-2 (Thermo Spectronics, Rochester, NY) or SLM8000 (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) spectrofluorometer. The protein concentration was between 2.5 and 8 μm, and the sample absorbance at 295 nm was <0.1 with 3-mm path length. Excitation and emission monochromators were set at 4-nm band pass. Emission spectra were collected with excitation polarizer at 54.7° and emission polarizer at 0° to the vertical, and background fluorescence from a solvent blank was subtracted. Steady-state anisotropies were measured using the L-format method with Glan-Thomson calcite prism polarizers. Anisotropy (A) was calculated from the intensity of the vertical (I v) and horizontal (I h) measurements with a grating correction factor (G):A = (I v -GI h)/(I v + 2GI h). G was calculated from the ratio of intensities (I v/I h) when the excitation light was polarized horizontally. Stern-Volmer quenching experiments were carried out as described previously (29Kim S.J. Lewis M.S. Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Temperature was controlled at 20 °C with a circulating water bath. Circular dichroism spectra were measured using an Applied Photophysics PiStar-180 spectrometer using a 0.1-cm cell thermostated at 20 °C. All measurements were corrected for background signal. Measurements were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mKCl at 20 °C with a protein concentration of 4.7 to 9.4 μm. To avoid tyrosine absorbance, samples were excited at 295 nm, and the absorbance at 280 nm was 0.1–0.2. The fluorescence intensity profiles were measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting technique as described (28Tcherkasskaya O. Ptitsyn O.B. Knutson J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1879-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Time per channel was 85 ps, and 512 channels were recorded. Samples were excited at 295 nm using a synchronously pumped, cavity-dumped, frequency-doubled dye laser as excitation source, with a repetition rate of 4 MHz, a pulse width of 5 ps, and an average UV power under 200 microwatts. The Hamamatsu R2809 MCP photomultiplier operated with a time spread (half-width) of about 90 ps, allowing one to resolve fluorescence lifetimes and/or correlation times as short as 30 ps. Intensity decays were analyzed by sum of two or more exponential functions, as shown in Equation 1. I(t)=∑1iaie−t/τiEquation 1 The relative amplitudes (α i) and decay constants (τ i) were extracted from the fit. The decay-associated spectra were obtained as described previously (29Kim S.J. Lewis M.S. Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,33Knutson J.R. Walbridge D.G. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4671-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements, protein fluorescence at 340 nm was monitored through a film polarizer oriented parallelI VV(t) and/or perpendicularI VH(t) to the vertical excitation polarization and alternatively recorded. Data were collected up to 20,000 counts in the maximum channel at 20 °C. For each sample, sixteen fluorescence intensity decays were obtained contemporaneously and summed to generate the anisotropy decay,r(t), as follows in Equation 2. r(t)=IVV(t)−GIVH(t)IVV(t)+2GIVH(t)Equation 2 The factor G was reduced to unity with a wedge depolarizer (Optics for Research, Caldwell, NJ) by placing the depolarizer at the entrance slit of the monochromator. The reference lamp profile and color shift used for convolution analysis was tested with a monoexponential standard (aqueous solution of melatonin with a fluorescence lifetime of 5.27 ns). The convolution was compared with the experimental fluorescence intensity decay by a nonlinear least-squares (reduced chi-squared; χ2) minimization. The weighted residuals and autocorrelation function of the weighted residuals were calculated to estimate the reliability of each fit. The fluorescence data were analyzed by the “sum and difference” method described previously (34Brand L. Knutson J.R. Davenport L. Beecham J.M. Dale R.E. Walbridge D.G. Kowalczyk A.A. Dale R.E. Spectroscopy and the Dynamics of Molecular Biological Systems. Academic Press, London1985Google Scholar). The general procedure was to fit the experimental anisotropy decays to the sum of two exponential functions, shown in Equation 3, whereβ fast, β slowφfast, and φslow were the variable parameters. r(t)=βfaste−t/φfast+βslowe−t/φslowEquation 3 The pre-exponential β terms directly relate to the amplitude of rotational motion, i.e. are measures of the extent to which the emission is depolarized by each rotational component, thereby measuring the restriction upon diffusion of the residue reporter (35Chuang T.J. Eisenthal K.B. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 5094-5097Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In wild-type pol β, the carboxyl-terminal Trp-325 is located on the surface of the enzyme just after the last helix (αO) (Fig. 1 B). X-ray structures of rat and human pol β indicate that one side of the indole ring is exposed to solvent, and the opposite face makes van der Waals contact with His-285 and Ile-323 (6Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 7Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Those observations were in excellent agreement with our earlier characterization (29Kim S.J. Lewis M.S. Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of the fluorescence properties of Trp-325 in rat pol β. To probe dynamic aspects of other regions of pol β, Trp-325 was replaced with alanine, and tryptophan residues were substituted at other strategic positions. In the L287W/W325A double mutant (from this point on, referred to simply as L287W), the tryptophan was introduced near the end of α−helix N in the N-subdomain (Fig. 1). Residue 287 was selected for tryptophan substitution because of its solvent-exposed environment and minimal contact with substrates as deduced from crystal structures with and without substrates (6Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Crystallographic characterization of pol β in various liganded states indicates that numerous structural transitions occur upon binding substrates. The most prominent conformational event occurs upon binding of the correct nucleotide resulting in an open to closed transition where α-helix N tilts toward the active site intimately contacting the nascent base pair. The characteristics of L287W thus enabled us to use it as a probe for the effects of substrate binding on the dynamics of α-helix N. For study of the 8-kDa lyase domain, we substituted tryptophan for Phe-25 (i.e. F25W/W325A; from this point on, referred to simply as F25W). The amino-terminal lyase domain possesses lyase, single-stranded DNA binding, and 5′-phosphate binding activities (1Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat.

Trp-25 is located on the first helix of the protein (αA; see Fig. 1, A and B) and is predicted to be partially solvent-exposed. The crystallographic structure of the pol β ternary complex indicates that there are no direct substrate contacts with this residue, and residue 25 is located about 10 Å from the lyase active site (i.e.Lys-72) (6Sawaya M.R.

The purity of the recombinant proteins was accessed by SDS-PAGE and found to be greater than 99% (Fig. 2, inset). To access the effect of the mutations on the protein conformation, we measured circular dichroism spectra for wild-type, F25W, and L287W proteins (Fig. 2). The spectra indicate that the mutations had no effect on overall protein folding. The catalytic activity of wild-type enzyme and the mutant derivatives were assessed on a single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate utilizing Mg2+ as the divalent cation. The single (W325A) or double mutants (F25W/W325A and L287W/W325A) exhibited minimal effects on catalytic activity; k cat for wild-type enzyme was 0.22 ± 0.05 compared with 0.20 ± 0.06, 0.24 ± 0.06, and 0.13 ± 0.02 for W325A, F25W, and L287W, respectively. The DNA binding affinity of the mutant proteins for gapped DNA substrates was also not affected by the mutation as assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation (data not shown).

As other non-dividing cells, they are characterized by low and imbalanced intracellular dNTP pool levels and an excess of dUTP. The replication of HIV-1 in this cellular context favors misincorporation of uracil residues into viral DNA because of the use of dUTP in place of dCTP. We have previously reported that the host uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme UNG2 is packaged into HIV-1 viral particles via a specific association with the integrase domain of the Gag-Pol precursor. In this study, we investigated whether virion-associated UNG2 plays a role similar to that of its cellular counterpart. We show that the L172A mutation of integrase impaired the packaging of UNG2 into viral particles. Using a primer-template DNA substrate containing G:U mispairs, we demonstrate that wild-type viral lysate has the ability to repair G:U mismatched pairs to G:C matched pairs, in contrast to UNG2-deficient viral lysate. Moreover, no correction of G:T mispairs by wild-type HIV-1 viral lysate was observed, which argues for the specificity of the repair process. We also show that UNG2 physically associates with the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. Altogether our data indicate for the first time that a uracil repair pathway is specifically associated with HIV-1 viral particles.

Uracil in DNA may result from misincorporation of dUTP instead of dTTP or from spontaneous deamination of cytosine. Incorporation into DNA of uracil opposite to adenine is not directly mutagenic. In contrast, incorporation of uracil opposite to guanine is promutagenic and will result, if not corrected, in a G-to-A mutation in the next round of DNA replication.The uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme recognizes and excises the uracil base from DNA, thus initiating the BER pathway by creating an abasic site. The sugar-phosphate backbone 5′ of the abasic site is then cleaved by an AP-endonuclease, leaving a 3′-OH end. The removal of the baseless sugar residue and insertion of the correct nucleotide are performed by the polymerase β via its lyase and polymerase activities, respectively.

This redundancy of enzymatic activities required to process uracil residues from DNA argues for the importance of this process in the survival of the cell. In addition to UNGs, all free-living organisms also express the deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase) enzyme that prevents misincorporation of uracil residues into DNA but through a mechanistically different pathway by acting on the pool of intracellular nucleotides to maintain a low ratio of dUTP to dTTP.In the viral kingdom, genomes of some DNA viruses, namely pox and herpes viruses, encode both UNG and dUTPase enzymatic activities (8McGeoch D.J.

Genomes of β-retroviruses such as Mazon Pfizer monkey virus and murine mammary tumor virus and non-primate lentiviruses such as Visna-maedi virus, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and equine infectious anemia virus encode only dUTPase (13Elder J.H.

The presence of these virally encoded enzymes in viral particles suggests that they might play an important role in the viral life cycle. Indeed, dUTPase-deficient non-primate lentiviruses replicate well in dividing cells but are impaired in replication in non-dividing macrophages or resting T-cells and display a high level of G-to-A mutations and a loss of invasiveness and pathogenicity in vivo (14Lerner D.L.

These data strongly argue for the necessity to control the incorporation of uracil residues into proviral DNA in the course of infection of non-dividing cells.Interestingly, genomes of primate lentiviruses such as human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency viruses encode neither UNG nor dUTPase. Because primate lentiviruses infect non-dividing macrophage cells that are characterized by low intracellular dNTP pool levels with a low dCTP/dTTP ratio and a high level of dUTP pool (19Terai C. Carson D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), they have a non-negligible probability to misincorporate uracil residues into their genome during viral DNA synthesis. Therefore, it is likely that they have evolved to control uracil misincorporation into viral DNA. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that HIV-1 viral particles have the ability to package one of the members of the cellular uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme family, the UNG2 enzyme (20Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This packaging occurred via a specific association with the integrase (IN) domain of the Gag-Pol precursor. We have proposed that host UNG2 localized inside HIV-1 viral particles might have a role similar to that played by viral dUTPase encoded by non-primate lentiviruses (i.e. to prevent the fixation of uracil residues in DNA), avoiding the accumulation of G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. The presence of UNG2 in HIV-1 viral particles highly suggests that HIV-1 might have the ability to control the level of uracil residues misincorporated during viral DNA synthesis.In this study, we investigated the functional role of virion-associated UNG2 by examining the ability of wild-type or UNG2-deficient HIV-1 viral lysate to process uracil residues from a primer-template DNA substrate containing G:U mismatched pairs. For this purpose, we first demonstrated that leucine residue 172 of IN was critical for UNG2 binding and that recombinant HIV-1 viruses carrying the L172A mutation were impaired for UNG2 packaging into viral particles. We then demonstrated that (i) HIV-1 wild-type viral lysate is competent to correct G:U mispairs to G:C pairs from a uracil-containing primer-template DNA substrate, (ii) virion-associated UNG2 is a critical component for this process, and (iii) UNG2 and RT can be physically associated. Our data support the notion that HIV-1 virion-associated UNG2 initiates the processing of uracil residues from DNA and that HIV-1 viruses are able to counteract the mutagenic threat of uracil misincorporation into DNA during viral DNA synthesis.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that HIV-1 viral particles have the unique property of packaging the host uracil DNA glycosylase DNA repair enzyme UNG2 into viral particles (20Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the functional role of virion-associated UNG2 in uracil processing by studying the ability of HIV-1 viral lysate to correct G:U mismatched pairs incorporated into a primer-template DNA substrate. The repair of G:U mispairs to G:C pairs was revealed by the restoration of the cytidine residue instead of the uridine residue in the nucleotidic sequence recognized and cleaved by the SalI restriction enzyme. We showed that HIV-1 wild-type viral lysate, but not UNG2-deficient viral lysate, can process uracil residues when they are present at the free 3′-OH end of the primer in the primer-template DNA substrate. In our early study (20Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that HIV-1 viral lysate failed to process uracil residues present in a G:U mispair located in the middle of a blunt double-stranded DNA substrate, probably because of the absence of a free 3′-OH end to anchor RT on its primer. In contrast, recombinant UNG2 alone efficiently processed uracil residues in this case. These findings suggested that UNG2, in the context of HIV-1 viral particles, might act in a manner distinct from that of recombinant UNG2. Indeed, we demonstrated that (i) UNG2 is associated and packaged with IN, (ii) UNG2 can associate with RT, and (iii) RT and IN are associated. This latter association has been previously reported to be critical for the initiation of the retrotranscription of viral genome (29.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). We hypothesized that RT, IN, and UNG2 are physically associated and are part of the viral retrotranscription complex. As a consequence of such a multienzymatic complex, UNG2 would probably not be free in the viral particle and could act only on uracil residues in close proximity of a free 3′-OH anchor for the retrotranscription complex. On the basis of this hypothesis, we proposed that DNA polymerization by RT and DNA repair initiated by virion-associated UNG2 are coupled events.The viral retrotranscription process is a two-step process consisting of the synthesis of the minus-strand DNA using viral RNA as a template followed by the synthesis of the plus-strand DNA using the minus-strand DNA as a template to obtain the proviral double-stranded DNA. One mispairing mutation occurring in the minus-strand DNA of the heteroduplex is mutagenic and is fixed in the plus-strand DNA of the DNA/DNA homoduplex constituting the proviral genome. For example, dUMP residues in the minus-strand DNA will be paired with dAMP residues during the synthesis of the plus-strand DNA, contributing to the accumulation of G-to-A substitutions. We demonstrated that virion-associated UNG2 has the function of preventing accumulation of uracil and, therefore, G-to-A transition in the context of a DNA/DNA duplex. We have not looked at the repair process for RNA/DNA heteroduplexes, which are intermediate products formed during the retrotranscription process, but a previous study (30Kamath-Loeb A.S. Hizi A. Tabone J. Solomon M.S. Loeb L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that the repair process of a RNA/DNA duplex was effective, albeit with a reduced efficiency, compared with that on a DNA/DNA duplex. Moreover, it has been reported that HIV-1 viruses with an excess of UNG2 packaged by Vpr displayed a more accurate reverse transcription during a unique cycle of infection (31Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that UNG2 has the function of lowering the mutation rate. Taken together, these data support the notion that HIV-1 is able to control the amount of uracil incorporated into its genome during reverse transcription and to prevent the catastrophic G-to-A hypermutations, which have been reported when the dNTP concentration is biased (32Martinez M.A. Vartanian J.P. Wain-Hobson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11787-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Meyerhans A. Vartanian J.P. Hultgren C. Plikat U. Karlsson A. Wang L. Eriksson S. Wain-Hobson S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 535-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The question arises whether the viral BER process occurred through a pathway similar to that of cellular BER and thus required an AP-endonuclease activity to cleave 5′ to the abasic site resulting from the action of the DNA glycosylase 2. Western blot analysis of HIV-1 viral lysate revealed no packaging of host AP-endonuclease 1 (34Masuda Y. Bennett R.A. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Masuda Y. Bennett R.A. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30352-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in experimental conditions where host UNG2 was clearly detected in virions (data not shown). Similar negative results (data not shown) were obtained by analyzing viral lysate of virions produced from cells overexpressing either hemagglutinin-tagged AP-endonuclease 1 or hemagglutinin-tagged AP-endonuclease 2, a newly described member of the human AP-endonuclease family (36Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that HIV-1 viruses did not contain known AP-endonucleases, suggesting that the processing of uracil residues by HIV-1 viral lysate occurred independently of the presence of a AP-endonuclease activity. An alternative hypothesis would be that the creation of an abasic site by the virally associated UNG2 is followed by the elimination of the baseless nucleotide by the pyrophosphorolytic activity of RT, leaving a free 3′-OH end to be used by the polymerase activity of RT. Further studies are in progress to understand the molecular mechanism(s) involved in viral BER.The fact that the HIV-1 reverse transcription process is mainly accomplished in the cytoplasm of infected cells and the fact that cellular enzymes participating in the DNA repair process are nuclear proteins might explain why HIV-1 particles have to be equipped with their own enzymatic DNA repair activities. In conclusion, we propose that HIV-1 viruses in the manner of non-primate lentiviruses, pox viruses, or herpes viruses which replicate in non-dividing cells, have developed an original strategy to bypass the deleterious consequence of uracil in viral DNA by using IN as a carrier to package host UNG2 into viral particles and by using RT to target UNG2 at the site of nascent DNA synthesis.

These data strongly argue for the necessity to control the incorporation of uracil residues into proviral DNA in the course of infection of non-dividing cells. Interestingly, genomes of primate lentiviruses such as human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency viruses encode neither UNG nor dUTPase. Because primate lentiviruses infect non-dividing macrophage cells that are characterized by low intracellular dNTP pool levels with a low dCTP/dTTP ratio and a high level of dUTP pool (19Terai C. Carson D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), they have a non-negligible probability to misincorporate uracil residues into their genome during viral DNA synthesis. Therefore, it is likely that they have evolved to control uracil misincorporation into viral DNA. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that HIV-1 viral particles have the ability to package one of the members of the cellular uracil DNA glycosylase enzyme family, the UNG2 enzyme (20Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This packaging occurred via a specific association with the integrase (IN) domain of the Gag-Pol precursor. We have proposed that host UNG2 localized inside HIV-1 viral particles might have a role similar to that played by viral dUTPase encoded by non-primate lentiviruses (i.e. to prevent the fixation of uracil residues in DNA), avoiding the accumulation of G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. The presence of UNG2 in HIV-1 viral particles highly suggests that HIV-1 might have the ability to control the level of uracil residues misincorporated during viral DNA synthesis. In this study, we investigated the functional role of virion-associated UNG2 by examining the ability of wild-type or UNG2-deficient HIV-1 viral lysate to process uracil residues from a primer-template DNA substrate containing G:U mismatched pairs. For this purpose, we first demonstrated that leucine residue 172 of IN was critical for UNG2 binding and that recombinant HIV-1 viruses carrying the L172A mutation were impaired for UNG2 packaging into viral particles. We then demonstrated that (i) HIV-1 wild-type viral lysate is competent to correct G:U mispairs to G:C pairs from a uracil-containing primer-template DNA substrate, (ii) virion-associated UNG2 is a critical component for this process, and (iii) UNG2 and RT can be physically associated. Our data support the notion that HIV-1 virion-associated UNG2 initiates the processing of uracil residues from DNA and that HIV-1 viruses are able to counteract the mutagenic threat of uracil misincorporation into DNA during viral DNA synthesis. DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that HIV-1 viral particles have the unique property of packaging the host uracil DNA glycosylase DNA repair enzyme UNG2 into viral particles (20Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the functional role of virion-associated UNG2 in uracil processing by studying the ability of HIV-1 viral lysate to correct G:U mismatched pairs incorporated into a primer-template DNA substrate. The repair of G:U mispairs to G:C pairs was revealed by the restoration of the cytidine residue instead of the uridine residue in the nucleotidic sequence recognized and cleaved by the SalI restriction enzyme. We showed that HIV-1 wild-type viral lysate, but not UNG2-deficient viral lysate, can process uracil residues when they are present at the free 3′-OH end of the primer in the primer-template DNA substrate. In our early study (20Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that HIV-1 viral lysate failed to process uracil residues present in a G:U mispair located in the middle of a blunt double-stranded DNA substrate, probably because of the absence of a free 3′-OH end to anchor RT on its primer. In contrast, recombinant UNG2 alone efficiently processed uracil residues in this case. These findings suggested that UNG2, in the context of HIV-1 viral particles, might act in a manner distinct from that of recombinant UNG2. Indeed, we demonstrated that (i) UNG2 is associated and packaged with IN, (ii) UNG2 can associate with RT, and (iii) RT and IN are associated. This latter association has been previously reported to be critical for the initiation of the retrotranscription of viral genome (29.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). We hypothesized that RT, IN, and UNG2 are physically associated and are part of the viral retrotranscription complex. As a consequence of such a multienzymatic complex, UNG2 would probably not be free in the viral particle and could act only on uracil residues in close proximity of a free 3′-OH anchor for the retrotranscription complex. On the basis of this hypothesis, we proposed that DNA polymerization by RT and DNA repair initiated by virion-associated UNG2 are coupled events.The viral retrotranscription process is a two-step process consisting of the synthesis of the minus-strand DNA using viral RNA as a template followed by the synthesis of the plus-strand DNA using the minus-strand DNA as a template to obtain the proviral double-stranded DNA. One mispairing mutation occurring in the minus-strand DNA of the heteroduplex is mutagenic and is fixed in the plus-strand DNA of the DNA/DNA homoduplex constituting the proviral genome. For example, dUMP residues in the minus-strand DNA will be paired with dAMP residues during the synthesis of the plus-strand DNA, contributing to the accumulation of G-to-A substitutions. We demonstrated that virion-associated UNG2 has the function of preventing accumulation of uracil and, therefore, G-to-A transition in the context of a DNA/DNA duplex. We have not looked at the repair process for RNA/DNA heteroduplexes, which are intermediate products formed during the retrotranscription process, but a previous study (30Kamath-Loeb A.S. Hizi A. Tabone J. Solomon M.S. Loeb L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that the repair process of a RNA/DNA duplex was effective, albeit with a reduced efficiency, compared with that on a DNA/DNA duplex. Moreover, it has been reported that HIV-1 viruses with an excess of UNG2 packaged by Vpr displayed a more accurate reverse transcription during a unique cycle of infection (31Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that UNG2 has the function of lowering the mutation rate. Taken together, these data support the notion that HIV-1 is able to control the amount of uracil incorporated into its genome during reverse transcription and to prevent the catastrophic G-to-A hypermutations, which have been reported when the dNTP concentration is biased (32Martinez M.A. Vartanian J.P. Wain-Hobson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11787-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Meyerhans A. Vartanian J.P. Hultgren C. Plikat U. Karlsson A. Wang L. Eriksson S.

Western blot analysis of HIV-1 viral lysate revealed no packaging of host AP-endonuclease 1 (34Masuda Y. Bennett R.A. Demple B. J. Biol.

Similar negative results (data not shown) were obtained by analyzing viral lysate of virions produced from cells overexpressing either hemagglutinin-tagged AP-endonuclease 1 or hemagglutinin-tagged AP-endonuclease 2, a newly described member of the human AP-endonuclease family (36Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that HIV-1 viruses did not contain known AP-endonucleases, suggesting that the processing of uracil residues by HIV-1 viral lysate occurred independently of the presence of a AP-endonuclease activity. An alternative hypothesis would be that the creation of an abasic site by the virally associated UNG2 is followed by the elimination of the baseless nucleotide by the pyrophosphorolytic activity of RT, leaving a free 3′-OH end to be used by the polymerase activity of RT. Further studies are in progress to understand the molecular mechanism(s) involved in viral BER.The fact that the HIV-1 reverse transcription process is mainly accomplished in the cytoplasm of infected cells and the fact that cellular enzymes participating in the DNA repair process are nuclear proteins might explain why HIV-1 particles have to be equipped with their own enzymatic DNA repair activities. In conclusion, we propose that HIV-1 viruses in the manner of non-primate lentiviruses, pox viruses, or herpes viruses which replicate in non-dividing cells, have developed an original strategy to bypass the deleterious consequence of uracil in viral DNA by using IN as a carrier to package host UNG2 into viral particles and by using RT to target UNG2 at the site of nascent DNA synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2145194877,"Site-directed mutagenesis of Thr66 in porcine liver NADH-cytochromeb 5 reductase demonstrated that this residue modulates the semiquinone form of FAD and the rate-limiting step in the catalytic sequence of electron transfer. The absorption spectrum of the T66V mutant showed a typical neutral blue semiquinone intermediate during turnover in the electron transfer from NADH to ferricyanide but showed an anionic red semiquinone form during anaerobic photoreduction. The apparent k cat values of this mutant were ∼10% of that of the wild type enzyme (WT). These data suggest that the T66V mutation stabilizes the neutral blue semiquinone and that the conversion of the neutral blue to the anionic red semiquinone form is the rate-limiting step. In the WT, the value of the rate constant of FAD reduction (k red) was consistent with thek cat values, and the oxidized enzyme-NADH complex was observed during the turnover with ferricyanide. This indicates that the reduction of FAD by NADH in the WT-NADH complex is the rate-limiting step. In the T66A mutant, thek red value was larger than thek cat values, but thek red value in the presence of NAD+was consistent with the k cat values. The spectral shape of this mutant observed during turnover was similar to that during the reduction with NADH in the presence of NAD+. These data suggest that the oxidized T66A-NADH-NAD+ ternary complex is a major intermediate in the turnover and that the release of NAD+ from this complex is the rate-limiting step. These results substantiate the important role of Thr66 in the one-electron transfer reaction catalyzed by this enzyme.

The former domain has a highly conserved flavin-binding amino acid sequence motif, RXY(T/S). In the Pb5R, Arg63, Tyr65, and Thr66comprise this sequence motif (19Nishida H. Inaka K. Miki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the positive charge of Arg63 is critical for the affinities of Pb5R for both NADH and NAD+, and the specific arrangement between the side chain of Tyr65 and FAD contributes to protein stability and electron transfer (28Kimura S. Nishida H. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Marohnic and Barber (29Marohnic C.C. Barber M.J. Arch. Biochem.

The Thr66 residue in Pb5R is positioned near both the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the potential binding site of the nicotinamide ring of NADH (20Nishida H. Miki K.

Bruns C.M. Pandini V.E. Karplus P.A. Vanoni M.A. Curti B. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and Ser90 in the C-terminal Tyr208 mutant of pea leaf FNR forms a hydrogen bond with the amide moiety on the nicotinamide ring of the pyridine nucleotide in both the enzyme-NADP+ and enzyme-NADPH complexes (31Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarell E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, b5R and cytochrome b reductase domain of nitrate reductase do not have an aromatic ring corresponding to that of the C-terminal Tyr208 in pea leaf FNR, which contacts with there-side of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and moves away accompanied with the binding of nicotinamide (31Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarell E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, the main physiological role of leaf FNR is the reduction of the oxidized pyridine nucleotide, and the direction of the electron transfer between FAD and pyridine nucleotide is different from that of b5R. Therefore, it is considered that Thr66 in Pb5R contributes to the reduction of FAD and/or the stabilization of the reduced FAD. Shirabeet al. (32Shirabe K. Yubisui T. Takeshita M. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1994: 405-408Google Scholar) reported that mutations of the corresponding Thr94 in human b5R affect oxidation of FAD, but the effects of the mutations on the properties of reduced FAD in the catalytic cycle have not been clarified. To analyze the role of Thr66 in catalysis in Pb5R, we replaced Thr66 in Pb5R with serine (T66S), alanine (T66A), and valine (T66V) and analyzed the redox properties of FAD in the catalytic cycle using a stopped flow spectrophotometer. We present here that the conversion of the neutral blue to the red semiquinone intermediate and the release of NAD+ from the enzyme in the catalytic cycle were modulated by the mutations of Thr66 in Pb5R. In addition, we present a new model of the reaction sequence of Pb5R containing the blue neutral semiquinone and the oxidized enzyme-NAD+-NADH ternary complex. Enzymes for recombinant DNA technology were from Takara and Toyobo. NADH and NAD+ were from Oriental Yeast. Wild type recombinant Pb5R (WT) was prepared as previously described (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Alteration of the gene encoding Pb5R was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR by the methods described by Higuchi (34Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Shinsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Briefly, for the preparation of the mutant genes encoding the mutant proteins, two primary PCR products that overlap in sequence were first obtained from a DNA template, pU8Pb5R, which contains the gene encoding the WT (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One product was generated with the forward primer 5′-TAGGAGGTCATATGTCCACCCCGGCC-3′ containing a NdeI site (underlined) and the mutagenic common reverse primer, 5′-GGGCCGAATGACCAG-3′, and the other was obtained with the forward mutagenic primer and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCCAAGCTTCTAGAAGGCGAAGCAGC-3′ containing aHindIII site (underlined). As the mutagenic forward primers, 5′-CTGGTCATTCGGCCCTACNNNCCCGTCTC-3′, which have a complementary nucleotide sequence to the 5′-end of the mutagenic forward primers, were used. In these primers, NNN are the bases corresponding to the 66th amino acid residue, and GCT, TCG, and GTG were used for the mutations to alanine, serine, and valine, respectively. The resultant two PCR products were mixed and reamplified with the forward and reverse primers. The resultant secondary PCR product was inserted into the plasmid pCWori+ (35Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), a derivative of pHSe5 (36Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Oppenheimer N.J. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1989: 44-73Google Scholar, 37Gegner J.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), using the NdeI and HindIII sites to construct the expression plasmid for generating mutant proteins. The entire nucleotide sequences of the mutant genes were confirmed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. All of the mutant proteins were expressed in the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified using the same method as the WT (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The purity of the mutant proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels. The flavin bound to the mutant proteins was analyzed by TLC on a Kieselgel 60 F245 plate (Merck) (38Fazecas A.G. Kokai K. McCormick D.B. Wright L.D. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1971: 385-398Google Scholar). Purified mutant proteins were stored in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mm EDTA at −20 °C until use. The recombinant solubilized domain of porcine liver cytochrome b 5 (Pb5) was prepared as follows. The cDNA encoding the full-length porcine liver cytochrome b 5 was amplified from the previously described first strand cDNA, which was prepared from a total RNA preparation from porcine liver (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The forward primer was 5′-GTTAAGAAATGGCCGAGGAGTCC-3′, which has an initiator methionine codon followed by the nucleotide sequence encoding the N-terminal tetrapeptide of natural bovine liver b5 (39Cristiano R.J. Steggles A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 799Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reverse primer was 5′-CTTCGGTTACCTTCTTTTCTGACG-3′. This nucleotide sequence was complementary to the nucleotide sequence located 12–35 bases downstream after the stop codon in the cDNA of bovine liver b5 (39Cristiano R.J. Steggles A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 799Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragment was blunt-ended and inserted into theHincII site of plasmid pUC118, and plasmid pU8Pb5 was selected. Plasmid pU8Pb5 contained the nucleotide sequence encoding 133 amino acid residues from the N-terminal Ala1 to the C-terminal Asn133 of porcine liver b5. The deduced amino acid sequence was identical to that previously reported except for the difference at position 3 (40Ozols J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 41Abe K. Kimura S. Kizawa R. Anan F.K. Sugita Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Van Der Mark P.K. Steggles A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid residue at position 3 was not glutamine but glutamic acid. The polypeptide containing 87 amino acid residues from Ala7 to Lys93 was prepared as recombinant Pb5. The cDNA encoding recombinant Pb5 was amplified from pU8Pb5 with the forward primer 5′-AGGAGGTCATATGGCCGTGAAGTATTACACC-3′, which has anNdeI site (underlined) containing an additional initiator methionine codon, followed by the nucleotide sequence encoding the N-terminal hexapeptide of recombinant Pb5, and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCCAAGCTTCTACTTGGCAATCTTGATC-3′, which corresponds to the C-terminal peptide, a stop codon, and aHindIII site (underlined). The resultant fragment was inserted into pCWori+ using NdeI and HindIII sites to construct pCPb5. E. coli TG1 cells containing pCPb5 were cultivated in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm was ∼0.3, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cultivation was continued for 14 h. The cells were lysed by sonication in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was separated on a Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0) (buffer A). Red colored fractions containing recombinant Pb5 were applied to an anion exchange resin (DE52) column equilibrated with buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of potassium chloride from 0 to 0.4m in buffer A. Fractions containing recombinant Pb5 were concentrated and desalted with a Sephadex G-25 (fine) (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The purified recombinant Pb5 showed a single band of ∼10 kDa on a 15% polyacrylamide gel after SDS-PAGE. The yield of the purified protein from 1 liter of culture fluid was 5.9 mg. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analyzed with a Shimadzu PSQ-1 protein sequencer was Ala-Val-Lys-Tyr-Tyr, and most of the additional N-terminal methionine residues were cleaved. The oxidized and reduced absorption spectra at 300–700 nm and the ability to accept electrons from the Pb5R were almost identical to those of the natural Pb5 (43Omura T. Takesue S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficients of the mutant proteins at 460 nm (ε460) were determined by a method similar to that described by Aliverti and Zanetti (44Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14771-14777Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), as previously described (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of the WT was determined from the absorbance at 460 nm using the molar extinction coefficient, 1.02 × 104 m−1cm−1 (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of recombinant Pb5 was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of natural Pb5, 1.13 × 105m−1cm−1 at 413 nm (45Strittmatter P. Boyer E.D. Lardy H.A. Mybäck K. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1963: 113-145Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-2010 spectrophotometer. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter. Fluorescent emission spectra were measured in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 25 °C on a Hitachi F-3010 Fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 460 nm, and emission spectra at 470–650 nm were observed. Steady-state enzymatic activities were measured as previously described (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The apparentK m values for NADH (K mNADH), ferricyanide (K mFe), and recombinant Pb5 (K mPb5) and the catalytic constants (k catNADH,k catFe, andk catPb5) were evaluated by direct curve fitting of the data according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The k catNADH,k catFe, andk catPb5 values were determined from the experiments to evaluate theK mNADH,K mFe, andK mPb5 values, respectively. The kinetic data were measured in 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. For the measurement of theK mNADH values, 100 μm potassium ferricyanide was used as an electron acceptor. For the measurements of theK mFe andK mPb5 values, 300 μm NADH was used as an electron donor. The reduction rate of ferricyanide was measured at 420 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.02 × 103m−1 cm−1. The reduction rate of recombinant Pb5 was measured at 556 nm using a difference in molar extinction coefficient of natural Pb5 between the oxidized and reduced states, 1.9 × 104m−1cm−1 (43Omura T. Takesue S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The concentration of NADH was determined using a molar extinction coefficient, 6.3 × 103m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm. Rapid reaction was analyzed with a Photal RA-401 stopped flow spectrophotometer (Otsuka Electronics) equipped with a Lauda RMS thermostatically regulated circulating water bath in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. The spectral changes of enzymes during and after the electron transfer from NADH to ferricyanide were analyzed as follows. Equal volumes of the enzyme solution containing potassium ferricyanide and the NADH solution were rapidly mixed, and the rapid scan spectra at 460–800 nm and the time courses of the absorbance changes at 460, 530, and 620 nm were measured. The initial concentrations of NADH, oxidized enzyme, and potassium ferricyanide in the reaction mixtures were 1 mm, 10 μm, and 150 μm, respectively. Under these experimental conditions, a turnover phase and a subsequent reduction phase after the consumption of ferricyanide were observed. The rate constant for the absorbance change after the turnover (k) was determined by single exponential curve fitting of the data as previously described (33Kimura S. Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Spectral changes of the enzymes during the reduction with NADH were analyzed with rapid scan spectra and time courses of the absorbance changes at 460 nm in the presence and absence of 1 mmNAD+. The enzyme solution, which contains or does not contain NAD+, was rapidly mixed with the NADH solution. The rapid scan spectra in the region at 420–560 and at 560–730 nm were measured separately and were joined at 560 nm. In the measurement of the rapid scan spectra, the gate time was 4 ms. The rate constants of reduction (k red) in the presence (k red+NAD) and absence of 1 mm NAD+(k red−NAD) were determined by single exponential curve fitting of the data at 460 nm. The flavin cofactor in the enzymes was photoreduced in an anaerobic cuvette containing 40 μmprotein, 1 μm 5-deazariboflavin, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μm NAD+, ∼0.5 μmindigodisulfonate, and 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The solutions were made anaerobic by successive flushing with oxygen-free argon gas with gentle agitation for more than 50 min. The absorption spectra were observed before and after illumination at 25 °C with a 300 W halogen lamp at room temperature. The dissociation constant of the oxidized enzyme for NAD+(K dNAD+) was determined by measuring the perturbation of the flavin spectrum as previously described (28Kimura S. Nishida H. Iyanagi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Approximately 40 μm of oxidized mutant proteins were titrated with NAD+ in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. After the successive addition of NAD+ into both the sample and reference cells, the absorption spectra were measured. TheK dNAD+ values were determined by direct curve fitting of the difference in the absorbance at the wavelength, where the absorbance change caused by the addition of NAD+ was largest in the 400–550-nm region, with the theoretical equation for a 1:1 binding mechanism taking into account the dilution. All of the purified mutant Pb5Rs showed a single band on an SDS-PAGE gel that was located at the same position as the WT. The yields of the purified T66S, T66A, and T66V mutants from 1 liter of culture fluid were 15.7, 20.3, and 14.5 mg, respectively. In all mutant proteins, the only bound flavin detected on the TLC plate was FAD. The molar extinction coefficients of the T66S, T66A, and T66V mutants at 460 nm were similar to that of the WT and were 1.05 × 104, 1.01 × 104, and 1.06 × 104m−1 cm−1, respectively. The absorption spectrum of the T66S mutant was almost identical to that of the WT (Fig. 2 A, panel a). The absorption spectra of the T66A and T66V mutants were also similar to that of the WT, but slight spectral changes were observed (Fig. 2 A, panels b and c). The absorption spectrum of the T66V mutant was blue-shifted by ∼3 nm in comparison with that of the WT. The intensities of the peaks at 390 nm were slightly decreased in the spectra of the T66A and T66V mutants. The CD spectra of the T66A, T66S, and T66V mutants were also similar to that of the WT (Fig. 2 B). All of the mutant proteins showed a significant decrease in the intensity of the fluorescence emission of FAD. The intensities of the fluorescence emission spectra of free FAD, the WT, and the T66S, T66A, and T66V mutants at 524 nm were 38.9, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, and 1.3, respectively (spectra are not shown). These data show that the mutations did not change the overall structure of the oxidized form of the enzyme. The apparent steady-state kinetic parameters and the K dNAD+ values are shown in Table I. TheK mNADH values of the T66S, T66A, and T66V mutants were similar to that of the WT, indicating that the mutations in these proteins did not affect the apparent affinity for NADH. Thek catNADH values of the T66S and T66A mutants were almost identical to that of the WT, but that of the T66V mutant was ∼10% of that of the WT. TheK mFe values of the three mutants were similar to that of the WT. The changes in thek catFe values of the three mutants were similar to those in thek catNADH values. Only the mutation of Thr66 to valine significantly affected the electron transfer from NADH to ferricyanide.Table IApparent kinetic parameters evaluated by steady-state analysis and dissociation constants for NAD +EnzymeNADH1-a100 μmferricyanide was used as an electron receptor.Ferricyanide1-b300 μm NADH was used as an electron acceptor.Pb51-b300 μm NADH was used as an electron acceptor.K dNAD+K mNADHk catNADHK mFek catFeK mPb5k catPb5μms −1μms −1μms −1μmWT3.1 ± 0.3"
https://openalex.org/W2034891969,"Apoptosis is a highly regulated multistep process for programmed cellular destruction. It is centered on the activation of a group of intracellular cysteine proteases known as caspases. The baculoviral p35 protein effectively blocks apoptosis through its broad spectrum caspase inhibition. It harbors a caspase recognition sequence within a highly protruding reactive site loop (RSL), which gets cleaved by a target caspase before the formation of a tight complex. The crystal structure of the post-cleavage complex between p35 and caspase-8 shows that p35 forms a thioester bond with the active site cysteine of the caspase. The covalent bond is prevented from hydrolysis by the N terminus of p35, which repositions into the active site of the caspase to eliminate solvent accessibility of the catalytic residues. Here, we report mutational analyses of the pre-cleavage and post-cleavage p35/caspase interactions using surface plasmon resonance biosensor measurements, pull-down assays and kinetic inhibition experiments. The experiments identify important structural elements for caspase inhibition by p35, including the strict requirement for a Cys at the N terminus of p35 and the rigidity of the RSL. A bowstring kinetic model for p35 function is derived in which the tension generated in the bowstring system during the pre-cleavage interaction is crucial for the fast post-cleavage conformational changes required for inhibition.

The development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms depend on a delicate balance of cell proliferation and programmed cell death or apoptosis. Failure to control either of these processes can lead to serious diseases that threaten the existence of the organism (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (6170) Google Scholar, 2Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W.

For example, the down-regulation of apoptosis is often associated with cancer, autoimmune disorders, and persistent viral infections. The up-regulation of apoptosis is observed in many forms of degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic injury from stroke, and post-menopausal osteoporosis.The central effectors of apoptotic cell death are caspases, a group of cysteine proteases specific for aspartate residues (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Caspases are highly regulated at several different levels. First, they are synthesized as inactive single-chain zymogens. Second, caspase activation is achieved through controlled proteolytic cascades, with upstream caspases (Group III, such as caspase-8 and caspase-9) activated by signal-mediated oligomerization and autoprocessing and downstream caspases (Group II, such as caspase-3 and casapse-7) activated by upstream caspases. While caspases have a dominant requirement for Asp at the P1 position, neighboring sequences at P5-P1′ (in particular P4-P2) influence the substrate specificity of each group of caspases (4Stennicke H.R. Renatus M. Meldal M. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).Active caspases are in addition subject to inhibition by specific viral and cellular caspase inhibitors (5Ekert P.G. Silke J.

Previous biochemical and structural studies showed that caspase inhibition by p35 requires the cleavage of a caspase recognition sequence (DQMD87) within a solvent exposed and highly protruding reactive site loop (RSL) 1The abbreviations used are: RSL, reactive site loop; Ac-DEVD-AFC, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: RSL, reactive site loop; Ac-DEVD-AFC, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (21Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), followed by the formation of a tight post-cleavage complex with the caspase.Previously, we reported the crystal structure of the post-cleavage complex between p35 and caspase-8, a group III initiator caspase involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The structure revealed that the caspase is inhibited via a covalent thioester linkage between the active site Cys360 of caspase-8 (Cys285of caspase-1 numbering) and the cleavage residue Asp87 of p35. During normal substrate cleavage, the thioester intermediate is quickly hydrolyzed by an enzyme bound water molecule. In the p35-caspase-8 complex, the thioester bond is preserved by the N terminus of p35, which interacts with the caspase active site and excludes solvent from the catalytic His317 of caspase-8 (His237 of caspase-1 numbering). The interaction between the p35 N terminus and the caspase is realized through a series of dramatic post-cleavage conformational changes (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).In the structure of the p35-caspase-8 post-cleavage complex, three regions of p35 directly contact the caspase, the N terminus, the KL region (including the KL loop and the K and L strands) and the substrate sequence of p35 (Fig. 1). To further understand the structural determinant of caspase inhibition by p35, we performed structure-based mutagenesis at these three regions of p35. The mutants were extensively analyzed for their effects on the pre-cleavage association, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance biosensor measurements, and on the post-cleavage inhibition, as determined by both qualitative pull-down assays and quantitative kinetic inhibition experiments. These experiments not only identified functionally important structural elements of p35 in caspase inhibition, but also led to a novel bowstring kinetic model of caspase inhibition by p35. In this model, the p35 may be considered as a bowstring system with the RSL being the string. The tension produced in the string during the pre-cleavage association with a target caspase appears to control the efficiency of caspase inhibition by facilitating fast post-cleavage conformational changes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCaspase inhibition by p35 presumably proceeds through two distinct steps: a pre-cleavage association, which is the reversible mutual recognition between p35 and the caspase, followed by the cleavage, and the formation of an irreversible post-cleavage complex (Fig. 1 A). To obtain a thorough understanding on the mechanism of caspase inhibition by p35, we mutated a series of p35 residues in contact with caspase-8 in the post-cleavage complex, including the p35 N terminus, the KL region and the RSL (Fig. 1 B). These mutants were characterized to derive an integral understanding of the inhibitory process.Kinetic Characterization of the Pre-cleavage AssociationTo trap the pre-cleavage interaction, we used an active site mutant of caspase-3 (C163A) that was processed to its active conformation through trans-activation by its upstream caspase, caspase-8. Measurement by surface plasmon resonance for the interaction between p35 and caspase-3 (C163A) gave rise to an association rate of 6.7 × 105m−1 s−1, similar to many diffusion-controlled rigid body macromolecular associations (25Park Y.C. Ye H. Hsia C. Segal D. Rich R.L. Liou H.-L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2000; 101: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and a dissociation rate of 0.091s−1 (Table I). This fast rate of association suggests that the interaction between p35 and a caspase does not involve complex conformational changes, which would otherwise slow down the interaction. The calculated equilibrium dissociation constant is 0.13 μm, which is ∼200-fold stronger than theK m between caspase-3 and a peptide substrate (9Zhou Q. Krebs J.F. Snipas S.J. Price A. Alnemri E.S. Tomaselli K.J. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because the direct contact between p35 and a caspase during pre-cleavage interaction is likely not much more extensive than substrate recognition by a caspase (since the KL loop does not appear to be energetically indispensable, see below), the stronger interaction between p35 and a caspase is likely due to the decrease in entropic loss often associated with the recognition of flexible peptide substrates. These kinetic and thermodynamic observations are consistent with the apparent rigidity of the highly solvent accessible RSL in the free p35 structure (21Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D.

Open table in a new tab Strict Requirement of the Cys2 Residue and Importance of the Structural Integrity of the N-terminal Segment in Free p35In the crystal structure of the p35/caspase-8 complex, the N terminus of p35 repositions into the active site of caspase-8 to block thioester bond hydrolysis (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Two p35 N-terminal residues, Cys2 and Val3, directly contact the caspase and both the C2G and V3G mutations have been shown to render p35 defective in caspase inhibition (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To further understand the structural requirement of these two contacting residues, we performed both alanine mutations and conservative substitutions on these residues (Table I, Fig. 2, A andB).Figure 2Biochemical characterization of caspase inhibition by p35.

C, selected examples of progress curve analyses showing substrate hydrolysis (represented by relative fluorescence units (RFU)) with time for caspase-8 inhibition by different concentrations of the p35 mutant Y260A (left) and for an overlay of caspase-8 inhibition by wild-type and several p35 mutants at 0.1 μm concentration (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Similar to the phenotype of the C2G mutation, both C2A and the isosteric C2S mutants failed to pull-down with either caspase-3 or caspase-8, although both were cleaved efficiently by the caspases. As these mutants exhibited identical solution behavior with wild-type p35, as shown by gel-filtration profiles, the mutational effects are likely due to the direct deletion of interactions with the caspases. The drastic phenotype of the C2S mutant suggests that the interaction between residue Cys2 of p35 and a target caspase exhibits a strict specificity. This specificity may be explained by the structural observation that the side chain thiol of Cys2 may form a hydrogen bond with the imidazole ring of His317 in caspase-8 (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). None of these mutations affected the pre-cleavage association.Conservative substitution V3I did not significantly change its inhibitory activity against caspases. In contrast, the V3A mutant failed to form a stable complex with either caspase-3 or caspase-8, although it could be readily cleaved by these caspases. Since Val3 is buried in the free p35 structure, this mutant phenotype may be explained by either a direct effect on a p35-caspase complex or an indirect effect through perturbation of the free p35 structure. Although it is not possible to distinguish these effects, the fact that the V3A mutant tends to aggregate in solution supports that structural perturbation may be at play in this mutant.To determine whether residues at the N-terminal segment that do not directly contact the caspase (residues 4–13) can influence the ability of p35 to inhibit caspases through structural perturbation, we selectively mutated a few residues at the N terminus. Most N-terminal residues such as Ile4, Phe5, and Pro6 are buried in the free p35 structure, with the exception of Asp10 and Gln13. Interestingly, the I4A, F5A, and P6A mutations in p35 were detrimental to the inhibition, while the D10A and Q13G mutants behaved similarly as the wild-type p35 in their ability to inhibit either caspase-3 or caspase-8. The I4A, F5A, and P6A mutants showed aggregation in their gel-filtration profiles and therefore may have possible local structural perturbations. Accordingly, biosensor measurements showed that the pre-cleavage association of these p35 mutants to caspase-3 (C163A) exhibited complex behavior, indicating the presence of a mixture of stoichiometries in the interactions. In contrast, both the D10A and Q13A mutants behaved as the wild-type p35 in solution. These results support that structural perturbation of the buried N-terminal arm in the free p35 structure can abrogate the inhibitory activity of p35.The KL Region Makes Modest and Variable Energetic Contribution to Caspase Interaction but Supports a Crucial Contact with the RSLIn the structure of the p35-caspase-8 complex, residues in the KL region make direct contact with residues 414–427 in the small subunit of caspase-8 at the L4 loop and the α4 helix. However, these residues in caspase-8 only show limited sequence conservation among different caspases. Since there are significant conformational changes in the KL loop region between the bound and the free p35, we had earlier proposed that this flexibility of the KL loop might be important for its ability to interact with different caspases (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).We created a series of point mutations and deletions to determine the functional role of the KL region (Table I and Fig. 2, B andC). We generated single-site mutations on residues in direct contact with caspase-8, S253A, W254A, K256A, and Y260A. We also created triple alanine mutations on S253, W254, and Y260, the three residues that show most extensive surface area burial in the complex. In addition, we created deletion mutations that remove one (ΔTrp254), five (Δ253–257) and seven (Δ252–258) residues from the KL loop and the adjoining β strands.Surprisingly, the mutational data suggest that the KL loop does not seem to play an indispensable role as would have been predicted from the structure. The W254A, Y260A, ΔTrp254, and Δ253–257 mutants exhibited only modest, but significant, effects against caspase-8 and behaved essentially as wild-type against caspase-3, an effector caspase. In addition, the pre-cleavage interactions between the p35 mutants and caspase-3 (C163A) are also very similar to the wild-type interaction. These results show that the KL region is not crucial for caspase inhibition and suggest that there may be significant differences in the role of the KL region against different caspases. Interestingly, a low resolution structure of the complex between p35 and an insect effector caspase showed that there is an orientational difference between the p35 in complex with an initiator caspase, caspase-8, and with the effector caspase (27Eddins M.J. Lemongello D. Friesen P.D. Fisher A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the KL region appears to contact the target caspase in both complexes, their energetic roles may be different.The relative unimportance of the KL region also explains the ability of p35 to inhibit gingipain-K, a caspase-like bacterial cysteine protease that cleaves a different site on the RSL of p35 (28Snipas S.J. Stennicke H.R. Riedl S. Potempa J. Travis J. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Because gingipain-K cleaves further downstream (91DSIK94) from the caspase recognition site (84DQMD87), it is unlikely that gingipain-K would be close enough to the KL loop for a direct interaction.Interestingly, the KL loop deletion mutant Δ252–258 completely abolished the inhibitory activity of p35 against both caspase-3 and caspase-8, without drastically affecting the formation of the pre-cleavage complex. We have previously shown that residue Tyr82 near the beginning of the RSL is essential for the ability of p35 to inhibit caspases (22Xu G. Cirilli M. Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Nature. 2001; 410: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We had postulated that Tyr82 helps to glue the RSL with the neighboring KL strands, in addition to its role in direct caspase contact. Because mutant Δ253–257 does not exhibit a drastic decrease in caspase inhibition, and the two additional residues deleted in Δ252–258 do not directly contact the caspase, the defective phenotype of the Δ252–258 mutant may be best explained by the perturbation of the local conformation of the K and L strands. Among other interactions, the K and L strands harbor two large aromatic residues Phe248 and Trp262 that interact with Tyr82 of the RSL. As the Cα distance between residues 251 and 259 is 5.2 Å, longer than a typical Cα distance between two adjacent residues, the deletion mutant Δ252–258 has to undergo conformational changes to join these two residues, leading to structural perturbations. Therefore, a crucial role of the KL region appears to provide a proper “glue” patch for the RSL.Substrate Region Residues; Pre-cleavage Association Directly Affects Inhibition, but May Not Be Rate-limitingThe non-covalent interaction between p35 and caspase-8 centers around the tetrapeptide caspase recognition sequence (P4-D84QMD87-P1) in the reactive site loop of p35. It has been shown previously that the P1 Asp residue is essential for p35 function (21Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the absolute specificity of caspases to cleave after Asp residues. To elucidate the specific role of these residues in the function of p35, we generated a series of point mutations at the P2-P4 positions of the caspase recognition sequence.None of the mutations on the P2-P4 positions completely abolished the caspase inhibitory activity of p35, but produced a range of different effects against caspase-3 and caspase-8 (Table I and Fig. 2) that are largely consistent with the substrate specificity of these caspases (30Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). For example, mutations on the P2 residue are relatively mild against both caspases, consistent with P2 being the most tolerable. In contrast, P4 mutations are more drastic, especially for caspase-3, which is consistent with the known preference of Asp in this position for the group II apoptotic effector caspases such as caspase-3. The most surprising is the mutational phenotype on the P3 residue, which generated drastic effects on caspase-8, but did not seem to harm its inhibition on caspase-3, even though both caspases appear to prefer Glu at this position based on combinatorial substrate analyses (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 30Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar).How does the strength of pre-cleavage association affect the post-cleavage caspase inhibition? It appears that an efficient pre-cleavage interaction is required for inhibition because most of the p35 mutants that have a decreased pre-cleavage interaction are also less effective in caspase inhibition. However, substrate recognition or pre-cleavage interaction seems not to be the rate-limiting step in caspase inhibition by wild-type p35, as exemplified by the M86V mutant, which exhibits significantly stronger pre-cleavage association, but is wild-type in inhibition.Bowstring Kinetic Model of p35 InhibitionThe molecular event following p35 cleavage suggests the existence of two opposing forces in caspase inhibition by p35. As the post-cleavage strand of p35 departs the active site of the caspase, a series of cooperative conformational changes occur in p35 that allows the release of its N terminus from the core of p35 for interacting with the caspase active site. This has to occur before the caspase is able to hydrolyze the thioester intermediate formed between the caspase and p35. The existence of such a race between the catalytic power of the caspase and the rate of post-cleavage conformational changes may be exemplified by the observed leakage in caspase inhibition by p35, which often requires higher than stoichiometric quantity of p35 to completely inhibit a target caspase (9Zhou Q. Krebs J.F. Snipas S.J. Price A. Alnemri E.S. Tomaselli K.J. Salvesen G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, since stronger pre-cleavage association does not necessarily translate into stronger inhibition, the rate-limiting step of the inhibition could rest on the rate of these post-cleavage conformational changes.So what controls the rate of conformational changes and therefore the efficiency of caspase inhibition? A most conspicuous feature of the free p35 structure is the conformational rigidity of the entirely solvent exposed RSL, as shown by the visibility of the loop in the electron density map (21Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, our measurements on the association rate and the strength of the pre-cleavage association also suggest a nearly rigid-body interaction between p35 and the caspase.During the pre-cleavage association in which the caspase recognition sequence in RSL interacts with the active site of the caspase, this rigidity is likely to transform into tension in the RSL, because RSL residues after the cleavage site would have to be stretched by 4 Å due to the pinching of the caspase recognition sequence (Fig. 3 A). The Cα distance between the cleavage residue Asp87 and Lys97 is 26.7 Å in the free p35 structure. Assuming that residue Lys97 does not move significantly in the pre-cleavage complex, this distance may be increased to 30.6 Å, which would very likely create tension in this already rigid RSL.Figure 3Bowstring kinetic model of caspase inhibition by p35.

The BCR is a multimeric complex containing a signaling module composed of Igα and Igβ. Signaling pathways implicated in antigen presentation through the BCR are ill defined. Here we demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors preclude antigen presentation induced by BCR or Igβ but not Igα. Unraveling the mechanisms responsible for this inhibition, we show that PI3K inhibitors block neither antigen internalization nor degradation. Rather PI3K inhibitors block de novo formation of a multivesicular antigen processing compartment, which is induced by triggering of the BCR or Igβ. Strikingly, we found using fluorescent probes binding specifically to PI3K products that BCR and Igβ but not Igα induce PI3K activation in endocytic compartments wherein antigen is transported. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that Igβ couples the BCR to PI3K activation that is instrumental for de novo formation of the antigen processing compartment and efficient antigen presentation."

These models remain a subject of investigation and debate, however (24Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Google Scholar, 25Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Google Scholar).The striking conservation of TFIID structure predicts that TAFII functions are likely to be conserved between yeast and humans. It is an open question, however, how TAFIIs contribute to regulation of developmental and other metazoan-specific genes. Investigation of metazoan TAFII functions in vivo is difficult not only because of cell lethality, but also because TAFIIs are generally expressed maternally in the embryo, making their mutant phenotypes complex (26Zhou J. Zwicker J. Szymanski P. Levine M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13483-13488Google Scholar, 27Wassarman D.A. Aoyagi N. Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1154-1159Google Scholar). To circumvent these issues, we have used RNA interference (RNAi) (28Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Google Scholar) to inhibit both maternal and zygotic expression of TAFIIs in theCaenorhabditis elegans embryo. In the early embryo, maternally produced mRNAs maintain viability until the 100-cell stage in the absence of transcription, making it feasible to manipulate expression of even essential transcription factors (29Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Google Scholar, 30Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201Google Scholar). We have previously studied three histone fold TAFIIs: TAF-4, TAF-9, and TAF-10 (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar). Surprisingly, TAF-4 appears to be required for essentially all early embryonic transcription. In contrast, TAF-9 and TAF-10 are required for a significant fraction of transcription, but not for expression of many metazoan-specific genes, implying the existence of a functional TAFII subgroup that is not essential at many metazoan promoters.Given the difference between these two classes of C. elegansTAFII phenotypes, it is of interest to study TAF-5 (human TAFII100), which may mediate critical interactions within the TFIID and SAGA complexes. TAF-5 contains WD-40 repeats, which generally form a protein-protein interaction module, and it binds to TAF-9 and multiple other TAFIIs (32Dynlacht B.D. Weinzierl R.O. Admon A. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 363: 176-179Google Scholar, 33Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3702-3712Google Scholar, 34Tao Y. Guermah M. Martinez E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1952-1958Google Scholar). Expression shutoff experiments and analysis of certain conditionaltaf5 mutations suggest that, in yeast, Taf5 is necessary for a small fraction of pol II transcription, but that othertaf5 mutations have more severe effects (6Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Google Scholar, 36Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R.

A particular taf5 mutation that broadly inhibits transcription destabilizes most TFIID components and impairs SAGA function, consistent with Taf5 having important functions in these complexes (37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). Metazoan TAF-5 orthologs have not been studied in vivo, but a Drosophila TAF-5-related protein (Cannonball) is expressed specifically in primary spermatocytes and is required for expression of spermatid differentiation genes (38Hiller M.A. Lin T.Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Google Scholar). The importance of Cannonball for this particular developmental transcription program raises the question of whether TAF-5 similarly may be critical for developmental gene regulation.In this study, we have investigated requirements for taf-5in the early C. elegans embryo. We found that TAF-5 is broadly required for transcription, but is remarkably similar functionally to TAF-9 and TAF-10. In contrast to TAF-4, TAF-5 does not appear to be required for the expression of multiple metazoan-specific promoters or for a significant fraction of early transcription. In addition, RNAi co-inhibition experiments suggest that simultaneous lack of taf-5 and taf-10 does not cause a broader transcription defect. We conclude that TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 form part of a functional module of TFIID- and TFTC/SAGA-related complexes that is not required at many developmental and other metazoan-specific genes.DISCUSSIONMuch remains to be learned about how general transcription machinery components participate in regulating different types of genes in metazoans. In this study, we have obtained evidence that, in the early C. elegans embryo, TAF-5 (human TAFII100) is required for a significant fraction of pol II transcription, but does not appear to be essential for expression of many metazoan-specific genes. Overall levels of pol II CTD Ser-5 and Ser-2 phosphorylation were substantially reduced (but not eliminated) throughout development of taf-5(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 4,A and B), implying a significant but incomplete defect in pol II transcription. Accordingly, in these RNAi embryos, a set of conserved genes was not expressed detectably, but various developmental and other metazoan-specific genes were transcribed at significant levels (Fig. 5 and Table I).Multiple lines of evidence argue against the notion that this limited requirement for TAF-5 might have derived from incomplete RNAi penetrance, although we cannot eliminate the possibility that trace levels of the TAF-5 protein may remain in these RNAi embryos. These RNAi effects were accompanied by loss of anti-TAF-5 antibody staining and were highly reproducible, and they appeared with consistent timing after injection (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In addition, expression of the conserved genes let-858, rps-5, andhsp-16.2 was not detected in taf-5(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 5 A). Finally, the taf-5(RNAi) phenotype did not appear to be enhanced by simultaneous RNAi inhibition oftaf-10 (Figs. 4 A and 5 B), suggesting that these respective RNAi phenotypes involve overlapping processes and are unlikely to be partial effects.In S. cerevisiae, expression shutoff analyses and various conditional alleles suggest that Taf5 has a limited role in transcription, but other taf5 alleles are associated with more severe defects that correlate with functional or structural impairment of TFIID and SAGA (36Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Google Scholar, 37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). A particular yeasttaf5 mutation that causes a very broad transcription defect is also associated with destabilization of most other TFIID subunits (37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). We cannot currently address whether the TFIID complex is intact in our experiments. In taf-5(RNAi) embryos, approximately normal levels of TAF-10 and the broadly essential TAF-4 appeared to be present, however (Fig. 2), suggesting that the taf-5(RNAi) phenotype does not involve a general loss of TFIID or TFTC/SAGA subunits.A particularly interesting aspect of our findings is the remarkable similarity between the taf-5(RNAi) phenotype and the previously described effects of inhibiting expression oftaf-9 or taf-10, either alone or simultaneously (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar). The evidence that taf-5(RNAi) andtaf-5,taf-10(RNAi) embryos are phenotypically similar (Figs.4 (A and B) and 5B) further supports the model that TAF-5 and TAF-10 are functionally linked. Our evidence that many early embryonic genes are expressed independently of TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 appears to be consistent with genetic and promoter occupancy studies suggesting that a significant proportion of S. cerevisiae genes are transcribed independently of all TAFIIs (13Li X. Bhaumik S. Zhu X. Li L. Shen W. Dixit B. Green M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1240-1244Google Scholar, 22Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Google Scholar, 23Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Google Scholar). We have previously observed, however, that essentially all early embryonic transcription appears to require taf-4 (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar), indicating that this yeast model may not be fully applicable to C. elegans.It is striking that TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 do not seem to be required to express nearly all of the developmental and other metazoan-specific genes that we have analyzed (Fig. 5 B and Table I) (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar). We conclude that these three TAFIIs are part of a functional subgroup that can be bypassed during transcription of many metazoan-specific genes. Although many of the genes involved in basic cellular functions have been highly conserved between yeast and metazoans, genes that control processes that are specific to multicellular animals, such as development and differentiation, are much more distantly related (7Chervitz S.A. Aravind L. Sherlock G. Ball C.A. Koonin E.V. Dwight S.S. Harris M.A. Dolinski K. Mohr S. Smith T. Weng S. Cherry J.M. Botstein D. Science. 1998; 282: 2022-2028Google Scholar, 8Rubin G.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 820-821Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that, although many conserved genes such as rps-5 may have retained regulatory strategies that require these TAFIIs (Fig. 5 A), many metazoan-specific genes have evolved alternative activation mechanisms, perhaps involving different core promoter contexts and activator or coactivator interactions. Because TAF-5 does not appear to be generally required in embryonic developmental gene expression programs, the importance ofDrosophila Cannonball for spermatid differentiation gene transcription is particularly intriguing (38Hiller M.A. Lin T.Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Google Scholar). Perhaps a specialized form of TFIID or TFTC/SAGA that contains Cannonball has evolved to perform a highly specialized developmental regulatory function. Future elucidation of the differences and parallels between TAF-5 and Cannonball functions may therefore reveal novel mechanistic insights into how TAFIIs contribute to transcription.The apparent parallels between TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 functions suggest that these TAFIIs may be located along a shared surface for protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions within TFIID and TFTC/SAGA complexes. It is consistent with this model that TAF-5 interacts with TAF-9 and with multiple other TAFIIs (32Dynlacht B.D. Weinzierl R.O. Admon A. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 363: 176-179Google Scholar,34Tao Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1952-1958Google Scholar). The differences between the apparently general requirement for TAF-4 and the more limited functions of TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 raise the interesting question of what accounts for these differences at the molecular level. In vivo analyses of additional TAFIIs, coupled with a more detailed understanding of TFIID and TFTC complex structure, should reveal mechanisms through which individual TAFIIs and different domains of TFIID and TFTC complexes are utilized or bypassed during transcription of metazoan genes. Eukaryotic mRNA transcription requires the coordinate activity of gene-specific activators, coactivator proteins, general transcription factors (TFIIA, 1The abbreviations used are: TF, transcription factor; pol II, RNA polymerase II; TAF, TATA-binding protein-associated factor; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CTD, C-terminal domain; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1The abbreviations used are: TF, transcription factor; pol II, RNA polymerase II; TAF, TATA-binding protein-associated factor; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CTD, C-terminal domain; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH), Mediator complexes, and RNA polymerase II (pol II) (1Hampsey M.

These models remain a subject of investigation and debate, however (24Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Google Scholar, 25Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Google Scholar). The striking conservation of TFIID structure predicts that TAFII functions are likely to be conserved between yeast and humans. It is an open question, however, how TAFIIs contribute to regulation of developmental and other metazoan-specific genes. Investigation of metazoan TAFII functions in vivo is difficult not only because of cell lethality, but also because TAFIIs are generally expressed maternally in the embryo, making their mutant phenotypes complex (26Zhou J. Zwicker J. Szymanski P. Levine M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13483-13488Google Scholar, 27Wassarman D.A. Aoyagi N. Pile L.A. Schlag E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1154-1159Google Scholar). To circumvent these issues, we have used RNA interference (RNAi) (28Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Google Scholar) to inhibit both maternal and zygotic expression of TAFIIs in theCaenorhabditis elegans embryo. In the early embryo, maternally produced mRNAs maintain viability until the 100-cell stage in the absence of transcription, making it feasible to manipulate expression of even essential transcription factors (29Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Google Scholar, 30Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201Google Scholar). We have previously studied three histone fold TAFIIs: TAF-4, TAF-9, and TAF-10 (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar). Surprisingly, TAF-4 appears to be required for essentially all early embryonic transcription. In contrast, TAF-9 and TAF-10 are required for a significant fraction of transcription, but not for expression of many metazoan-specific genes, implying the existence of a functional TAFII subgroup that is not essential at many metazoan promoters. Given the difference between these two classes of C. elegansTAFII phenotypes, it is of interest to study TAF-5 (human TAFII100), which may mediate critical interactions within the TFIID and SAGA complexes. TAF-5 contains WD-40 repeats, which generally form a protein-protein interaction module, and it binds to TAF-9 and multiple other TAFIIs (32Dynlacht B.D. Weinzierl R.O. Admon A. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 363: 176-179Google Scholar, 33Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3702-3712Google Scholar, 34Tao Y. Guermah M. Martinez E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1952-1958Google Scholar). Expression shutoff experiments and analysis of certain conditionaltaf5 mutations suggest that, in yeast, Taf5 is necessary for a small fraction of pol II transcription, but that othertaf5 mutations have more severe effects (6Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Google Scholar, 36Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Google Scholar, 37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). A particular taf5 mutation that broadly inhibits transcription destabilizes most TFIID components and impairs SAGA function, consistent with Taf5 having important functions in these complexes (37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). Metazoan TAF-5 orthologs have not been studied in vivo, but a Drosophila TAF-5-related protein (Cannonball) is expressed specifically in primary spermatocytes and is required for expression of spermatid differentiation genes (38Hiller M.A. Lin T.Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Google Scholar). The importance of Cannonball for this particular developmental transcription program raises the question of whether TAF-5 similarly may be critical for developmental gene regulation. In this study, we have investigated requirements for taf-5in the early C. elegans embryo. We found that TAF-5 is broadly required for transcription, but is remarkably similar functionally to TAF-9 and TAF-10. In contrast to TAF-4, TAF-5 does not appear to be required for the expression of multiple metazoan-specific promoters or for a significant fraction of early transcription. In addition, RNAi co-inhibition experiments suggest that simultaneous lack of taf-5 and taf-10 does not cause a broader transcription defect. We conclude that TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 form part of a functional module of TFIID- and TFTC/SAGA-related complexes that is not required at many developmental and other metazoan-specific genes. DISCUSSIONMuch remains to be learned about how general transcription machinery components participate in regulating different types of genes in metazoans. In this study, we have obtained evidence that, in the early C. elegans embryo, TAF-5 (human TAFII100) is required for a significant fraction of pol II transcription, but does not appear to be essential for expression of many metazoan-specific genes. Overall levels of pol II CTD Ser-5 and Ser-2 phosphorylation were substantially reduced (but not eliminated) throughout development of taf-5(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 4,A and B), implying a significant but incomplete defect in pol II transcription. Accordingly, in these RNAi embryos, a set of conserved genes was not expressed detectably, but various developmental and other metazoan-specific genes were transcribed at significant levels (Fig. 5 and Table I).Multiple lines of evidence argue against the notion that this limited requirement for TAF-5 might have derived from incomplete RNAi penetrance, although we cannot eliminate the possibility that trace levels of the TAF-5 protein may remain in these RNAi embryos. These RNAi effects were accompanied by loss of anti-TAF-5 antibody staining and were highly reproducible, and they appeared with consistent timing after injection (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In addition, expression of the conserved genes let-858, rps-5, andhsp-16.2 was not detected in taf-5(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 5 A). Finally, the taf-5(RNAi) phenotype did not appear to be enhanced by simultaneous RNAi inhibition oftaf-10 (Figs. 4 A and 5 B), suggesting that these respective RNAi phenotypes involve overlapping processes and are unlikely to be partial effects.In S. cerevisiae, expression shutoff analyses and various conditional alleles suggest that Taf5 has a limited role in transcription, but other taf5 alleles are associated with more severe defects that correlate with functional or structural impairment of TFIID and SAGA (36Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Google Scholar, 37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). A particular yeasttaf5 mutation that causes a very broad transcription defect is also associated with destabilization of most other TFIID subunits (37Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). We cannot currently address whether the TFIID complex is intact in our experiments. In taf-5(RNAi) embryos, approximately normal levels of TAF-10 and the broadly essential TAF-4 appeared to be present, however (Fig. 2), suggesting that the taf-5(RNAi) phenotype does not involve a general loss of TFIID or TFTC/SAGA subunits.A particularly interesting aspect of our findings is the remarkable similarity between the taf-5(RNAi) phenotype and the previously described effects of inhibiting expression oftaf-9 or taf-10, either alone or simultaneously (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar). The evidence that taf-5(RNAi) andtaf-5,taf-10(RNAi) embryos are phenotypically similar (Figs.4 (A and B) and 5B) further supports the model that TAF-5 and TAF-10 are functionally linked. Our evidence that many early embryonic genes are expressed independently of TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 appears to be consistent with genetic and promoter occupancy studies suggesting that a significant proportion of S. cerevisiae genes are transcribed independently of all TAFIIs (13Li X. Bhaumik S. Zhu X. Li L. Shen W. Dixit B. Green M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1240-1244Google Scholar, 22Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Google Scholar, 23Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Google Scholar). We have previously observed, however, that essentially all early embryonic transcription appears to require taf-4 (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar), indicating that this yeast model may not be fully applicable to C. elegans.It is striking that TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 do not seem to be required to express nearly all of the developmental and other metazoan-specific genes that we have analyzed (Fig. 5 B and Table I) (31Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Google Scholar). We conclude that these three TAFIIs are part of a functional subgroup that can be bypassed during transcription of many metazoan-specific genes. Although many of the genes involved in basic cellular functions have been highly conserved between yeast and metazoans, genes that control processes that are specific to multicellular animals, such as development and differentiation, are much more distantly related (7Chervitz S.A. Aravind L. Sherlock G. Ball C.A. Koonin E.V. Dwight S.S. Harris M.A. Dolinski K. Mohr S. Smith T. Weng S. Cherry J.M. Botstein D. Science. 1998; 282: 2022-2028Google Scholar, 8Rubin G.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 820-821Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that, although many conserved genes such as rps-5 may have retained regulatory strategies that require these TAFIIs (Fig. 5 A), many metazoan-specific genes have evolved alternative activation mechanisms, perhaps involving different core promoter contexts and activator or coactivator interactions. Because TAF-5 does not appear to be generally required in embryonic developmental gene expression programs, the importance ofDrosophila Cannonball for spermatid differentiation gene transcription is particularly intriguing (38Hiller M.A. Lin T.Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Google Scholar). Perhaps a specialized form of TFIID or TFTC/SAGA that contains Cannonball has evolved to perform a highly specialized developmental regulatory function. Future elucidation of the differences and parallels between TAF-5 and Cannonball functions may therefore reveal novel mechanistic insights into how TAFIIs contribute to transcription.The apparent parallels between TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 functions suggest that these TAFIIs may be located along a shared surface for protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions within TFIID and TFTC/SAGA complexes. It is consistent with this model that TAF-5 interacts with TAF-9 and with multiple other TAFIIs (32Dynlacht B.D. Weinzierl R.O. Admon A. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 363: 176-179Google Scholar,34Tao Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1952-1958Google Scholar). The differences between the apparently general requirement for TAF-4 and the more limited functions of TAF-5, TAF-9, and TAF-10 raise the interesting question of what accounts for these differences at the molecular level. In vivo analyses of additional TAFIIs, coupled with a more detailed understanding of TFIID and TFTC complex structure, should reveal mechanisms through which individual TAFIIs and different domains of TFIID and TFTC complexes are utilized or bypassed during transcription of metazoan genes.
