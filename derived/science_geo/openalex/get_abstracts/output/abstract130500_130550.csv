In this Policy Forum, the authors call for a publicly supported effort to discover a large number of SNPs and to place the information in public databases. Participation in this public effort by the private sector would be particularly desirable."

https://openalex.org/W1982295124,"Ikaros proteins are required for normal T, B, and NK cell development and are postulated to activate lymphocyte-specific gene expression. Here we examined Ikaros distribution in the nucleus of B lymphocytes using confocal microscopy and a novel immunofluorescence in situ hybridization (immuno-FISH) approach. Unexpectedly, Ikaros localized to discrete heterochromatin-containing foci in interphase nuclei, which comprise clusters of centromeric DNA as defined by γ-satellite sequences and the abundance of heterochromatin protein-1 (HP-1). Using locus-specific probes for CD2, CD4, CD8α, CD19, CD45, and λ5 genes, we show that transcriptionally inactive but not transcriptionally active genes associate with Ikaros-heterochromatin foci. These findings support a model of organization of the nucleus in which repressed genes are selectively recruited into centromeric domains."

https://openalex.org/W2084772782,"The circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei is composed of multiple, single-cell circadian oscillators (clock cells). We now test the hypothesis that the circadian period in behavior is determined by the mean period that arises from the coupling of clock cells with diverse circadian periods. For these studies, we monitored firing rate rhythms of individual suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons on fixed multielectrode plates and exploited the altered circadian periods expressed by heterozygous and homozygous tau mutant hamsters. The results show that circadian period in the whole animal is determined by averaging widely dispersed periods of individual clock cells. The data also demonstrate that the tau mutation affects circadian function in a cell-autonomous manner."

https://openalex.org/W1964488668,"The effects of pituitary-derived melanocortin peptides are primarily attributed to ACTH-mediated adrenocortical glucocorticoid production. Identification of a widely distributed receptor for ACTH/MSH peptides, the melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5-R), suggested non-steroidally mediated systemic effects of these peptides. Targeted disruption of the MC5-R produced mice with a severe defect in water repulsion and thermoregulation due to decreased production of sebaceous lipids. High levels of MC5-R was found in multiple exocrine tissues, including Harderian, preputial, lacrimal, and sebaceous glands, and was also shown to be required for production and stress-regulated synthesis of porphyrins by the Harderian gland and ACTH/MSH-regulated protein secretion by the lacrimal gland. These data show a requirement for the MC5-R in multiple exocrine glands for the production of numerous products, indicative of a coordinated system for regulation of exocrine gland function by melanocortin peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2017688904,"Gap junction channels formed by alpha3 (Cx46) and alpha8 (Cx50) connexin provide pathways for communication between the fiber cells in the normal transparent lens. To determine the specific role of alpha3 connexin in vivo, the alpha3 connexin gene was disrupted in mice. Although the absence of alpha3 connexin had no obvious influence on the early stages of lens formation and the differentiation of lens fibers, mice homozygous for the disrupted alpha3 gene developed nuclear cataracts that were associated with the proteolysis of crystallins. This study establishes the importance of gap junctions in maintaining normal lens transparency by providing a cell-cell signaling pathway or structural component for the proper organization of lens membrane and cytoplasmic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1992229324,"An attenuated strain of S. typhimurium has been used as a vehicle for oral genetic immunization. Eukaryotic expression vectors containing truncated genes of ActA and listeriolysin--two virulence factors of Listeria monocytogenes--have been used to transform S. typhimurium aroA. Multiple or even single oral immunizations with such transformants induced excellent cellular and humoral responses. In addition, protective immunity was induced with listeriolysin transformants. The quality of the responses suggested a transfer of plasmid DNA from the bacterial carrier to the host. Such transfer was unequivocally shown in vitro with primary peritoneal macrophages. We describe a highly versatile system for antigen delivery, identification of protective antigens for vaccination, and efficient generation of antibodies against the product of open reading frames present on virtually any DNA segment."
https://openalex.org/W2001299005,"The mutations responsible for several human neurodegenerative disorders are expansions of translated CAG repeats beyond a normal size range. To address the role of repeat context, we have introduced a 146-unit CAG repeat into the mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (Hprt). Mutant mice express a form of the HPRT protein that contains a long polyglutamine repeat. These mice develop a phenotype similar to the human translated CAG repeat disorders. Repeat containing mice show a late onset neurological phenotype that progresses to premature death. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions are present in affected mice. Our results show that CAG repeats do not need to be located within one of the classic repeat disorder genes to have a neurotoxic effect."

We have identified and molecularly mapped two classes of EcR mutations: those specific to EcR-B1 that uncouple metamorphosis, and embryonic-lethal mutations that map to common sequences encoding the DNA- and ligand-binding domains. In the larval salivary gland, loss of EcR-B1 results in loss of activation of ecdysone-induced genes. Comparable transgenic expression of EcR-B1, EcR-B2, and EcR-A in these mutant glands results, respectively, in full, partial, and no repair of that loss."

This study was undertaken to examine whether caveolin subtypes interact with various protein kinase C isoenzymes using the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide. When protein kinase C-α, -ε, and -ζ were overexpressed in COS cells followed by subcellular fractionation using the sucrose gradient method, all the isoenzymes (α, ε, and ζ) were detected in the same fraction as caveolin. The scaffolding domain peptide of caveolin-1 and -3, but not -2, inhibited the kinase activity and autophosphorylation of protein kinase C-α and -ζ, but not of protein kinase C-ε, overexpressed in insect cells. Truncation mutation studies of the caveolin-1 and -3 peptides demonstrated that a minimum of 16 or 14 amino acid residues of the peptide were required for the inhibition or direct binding of protein kinase C. Thus, the caveolin peptide physically interacted with protein kinase C and regulated its function. Further, this regulation occurred in a protein kinase C isoenzyme-dependent manner.

Complete sets of substitution analogs of the five peptides revealed key interacting residues, information that led to the construction of binding supertopes derived from each peptide.

Both the initiator element and the upstream element are associated with DNase I protected domains suggesting that nuclear factors occupy these sites (24Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J.

However, the primary activator domain in the proximal APP promoter is APBβ, which binds a nuclear factor to the recognition sequence GCCGCTAGGGGT (position −93 to −82), and elimination of this site reduces total transcriptional activity from the proximal APP promoter by 70–90% (27Quitschke W.W.

The final concentration of protein in extracts varied from 10 to 15 mg/ml in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol (buffer D). Binding reactions and mobility shift electrophoresis were performed as described elsewhere (27Quitschke W.W. J. Biol.

Partially purified nuclear factor for the optimization of APBβ binding conditions and UV cross-linking was obtained by a single step cation exchange chromatography procedure. Two milliliters of crude nuclear extract was loaded on a 1-ml Econo-Pac CM cation exchange cartridge (Bio-Rad) that had been preequilibrated with buffer D. The cartridge was washed with 5 ml of buffer D. Proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear KCl gradient (100–500 mm) in buffer D, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The APBβ binding factor eluted around 450 mm KCl concentration. The APBβ binding factor was purified for microsequencing in a multi-step procedure (Fig. 4 A). Eight milliliters of crude nuclear extract were obtained from 16 liters of HeLa cell suspension culture (5 × 106 cells/ml). This amount was loaded on a 1.5 × 6.0-cm DEAE-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) preequilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer D containing 160 mm KCl. The binding factor was eluted with a 140-ml linear gradient of buffer D with the KCl concentration increasing from 160 to 300 mm, and fractions of 2 ml were collected. Fractions containing the binding activity (220 mm KCl) were combined and loaded on a 1-ml Pharmacia HiTrap SP anion exchange column preequilibrated with buffer D containing 220 mm KCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer and then with 2 ml of buffer D containing 400 mm KCl and 2.5% CHAPS. Bound protein was eluted with a 30-ml linear KCl concentration gradient (400–700 mm) in buffer D supplemented with 2.5% CHAPS. The binding factor eluted at a KCl concentration of approximately 500 mm. A 20-μl column of Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite, type I (Bio-Rad), was prepared in an Eppendorf-type 10-μl Ultra-micropipette tip and equilibrated with buffer D containing 500 mm KCl and 2.5% CHAPS. Fractions from the SP chromatography containing APBβ binding activity (500 mm KCl) were pooled and loaded on the column. Elution was performed with 40-μl steps of buffer D supplemented with 2.5% CHAPS and containing successively: 20 mm sodium phosphate and 480 mm KCl; 40 mm sodium phosphate and 460 mm KCl; 60 mm sodium phosphate and 440 mm KCl; 80 mm sodium phosphate and 420 mm KCl; 100 mm sodium phosphate and 400 mm KCl. The molarity of the sodium phosphate stock solution was calculated for the phosphate anion, and the pH was adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH. The hydroxyapatite chromatography fraction eluting at 60 mmsodium phosphate and containing the maximum of the binding activity was subjected to preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 6% separating gel. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 the characteristic 140-kDa protein band (see “Results”) was excised, washed twice with 50% acetonitrile, and frozen in dry ice. Tryptic hydrolysis, peptide separation, and peptide sequence determination were performed by Harvard Microchem (Cambridge, MA). An alternative scheme of APBβ binding factor purification employed the same initial DEAE-Sepharose chromatography step as described above. Fractions containing the binding activity were combined and loaded on a 1-ml Pharmacia HiTrap heparin column preequilibrated with buffer D containing 220 mm KCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of starting buffer followed by 2 ml of buffer D containing 400 mm KCl and 2.5% CHAPS. Elution was performed with a 30-ml linear KCl concentration gradient (400–700 mm) in buffer D supplemented with 2.5% CHAPS. The APBβ binding activity eluted at a 500 mm KCl concentration, which was the same concentration used to elute the binding activity from the SP-Sepharose column. Therefore, the same final concentration and purification step with a hydroxyapatite micro-column was adopted without modifications. UV cross-linking efficiency is significantly improved when the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine is introduced into the binding site (40Wu C. Wilson S. Walker B. Dawid I. Paisley T. Zimarino V. Ueda H. Science. 1987; 238: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To increase the number of available thymidine residues, the transverse block mutation Mβ1 (Table I) was used for cross-linking studies. This mutation introduces four more thymidine residues in the vicinity of the binding domain and has no negative effect on binding activity (27Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21229-21233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-[32P]Deoxycytidine and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate were introduced in the coding strand of oligonucleotide Mβ1 (Table I) by primer extension with modified T7 DNA polymerase (SequenaseTM). The binding reaction was performed in 96-well plates either with crude nuclear extract from HeLa cells or with CM-purified binding factor as described above. Samples were covered with plastic wrap and UV-irradiated in a Stratalinker 2400 apparatus (Stratagene) for 10 min, supplemented with 5 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2, and treated with 5–20 units of DNase I for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 20 mm EDTA and 1% SDS, and the products were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone at −20 °C for at least 6 h. Alternatively, samples were subjected to mobility shift agarose gel electrophoresis after cross-linking. In these instances the DNase I digest was omitted prior to electrophoresis. In some cases UV cross-linking was accomplished without incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine in the DNA probe, although with lower efficiency. Peptides denoting N-terminal amino acids 2–15 (EGDAVEAIVEESETC) and C-terminal amino acids 708–721 (CATDAONGDLTPEMI) of human CTCF (35Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y.

These peptides were conjugated through their terminal cysteines to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for antibody production in rabbits. Peptide synthesis and antibody production was performed by Coast Scientific (San Diego, CA). Western transfer to PVDF (Bio-Rad) membrane and antigen-specific protein detection was performed with the Amersham ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:400. APBβ binding factor that had been partially purified by CM cation exchange chromatography was concentrated 10-fold using a Microcon-30 device (Amicon). Four microliters of concentrated factor were incubated with 500,000 cpm (10 ng) of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide APBβ-80WT without prior 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine substitution. The complex was UV cross-linked as described above and analyzed by mobility shift gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, 100 ng of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used in the binding reaction without subsequent UV cross-linking. Mobility shift electrophoresis was performed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA. The gel content was transferred to PVDF membrane (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and probed with antiserum as described above. The transcription reaction was carried out with HeLa cell nuclear extract and followed by primer extension as described elsewhere (24Quitschke W.W. Matthews J.P. Kraus R.J. Vostrov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22231-22239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) except in reactions where binding competition was performed. In such experiments 2 μg of plasmid was premixed with 2 μg of 80-mer oligonucleotides (APBβ-80WT, APBβ-Mβ2, or MYC-80) prior to incubation with nuclear extract. This amount represents an approximately 100-fold molar excess of binding sequence. Preliminary efforts to purify the APBβ binding protein revealed that it bound to a variety of chromatographic supports such as DEAE-Sepharose, CM-agarose, and hydroxyapatite. However, when crude nuclear extract was loaded on a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac CM cation exchange cartridge and eluted with a 100–500 mmlinear concentration gradient of KCl, for example, no mobility shift activity was observed in either the flow-through or in any of the elution fractions under standard assay conditions. Conversely, if the elution fractions were combined with flow-through material, a peak of binding activity was detected that eluted around 450 mm KCl concentration (not shown). We found that the flow-through fraction could be omitted if the binding reaction was supplemented with a final concentration of 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.5% of the detergent CHAPS (Fig. 2). The same effect could be achieved at a lower total protein concentration when BSA was replaced with fetal calf serum. Chromatographic separations of the serum showed that this activity was not associated with any specific protein fractions (not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the necessity for BSA or serum in mobility shift assays was the result of a nonspecific effect due to general protein interactions. To standardize binding conditions, we routinely used 3% fetal calf serum in our mobility shift assays. To identify the APBβ binding protein and to estimate its molecular mass, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and α-[32P]deoxycytidine were introduced into the coding strand of a 45-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the APBβ recognition sequence (APBβ-WT, Table I). The labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with whole nuclear extract from HeLa cells, UV-cross-linked, and digested with DNase I. In addition to several minor bands, a major species of UV cross-linked protein with a molecular mass of about 140 kDa was observed on the autoradiograph (Fig. 3, lane 1). When instead of the whole nuclear extract an Econo-Pac CM-purified fraction was used in the binding reaction, the same band was present without other minor bands (Fig. 3, lane 2). To demonstrate further that the UV cross-linked protein is indeed the specific APBβ binding protein, we first performed mobility shift agarose gel electrophoresis with the cross-linked products of the binding reaction. Thereafter, the binding complex was excised from the gel, electroeluted, treated with DNase I, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this instance the same major 140-kDa band was observed on the autoradiograph (Fig. 3, lane 3). The nuclear factor that binds to the APBβ element was partially purified by several steps of chromatography (Fig.4 A). APBβ binding activity in the fractions was monitored by mobility shift electrophoresis. In the initial purification step, crude nuclear extract was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column. The APBβ binding activity eluted at an approximate concentration of 220 mm KCl. The electrophoretic protein distribution pattern after this initial column shows the presence of numerous bands with little evidence for specific enrichment (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). After this initial step, two alternative schemes of purification were adopted. The first scheme takes advantage of the ability of the APBβ binding factor to bind with relatively high affinity to both anion and cation exchange resins. Fractions from the DEAE-Sepharose chromatography that contained APBβ binding activity were pooled and loaded on an SP anion exchange column. The APBβ binding activity eluted at a 500 mm KCl concentration. After SP-Sepharose chromatography only a few isolated protein bands were detected in the purified material (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Specifically, only one protein band with the apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa was detected in the molecular mass range defined by UV cross-linking. To concentrate and to enrich further the APBβ binding factor, we loaded the SP-Sepharose purified material on a column packed with ceramic hydroxyapatite. The peak APBβ binding activity eluted at about 60 mm potassium phosphate concentration. The same protein band with the molecular mass of 140 kDa was observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). The concentration of binding protein that was achieved by the hydroxyapatite chromatography step provided an amount of protein in the band that was sufficient for microsequencing. In an alternative scheme, the fractions with APBβ binding activity from DEAE-Sepharose chromatography were pooled and first loaded on a heparin column. Also in this instance the APBβ binding factor eluted approximately at a 500 mm KCl concentration. After final purification and concentration by hydroxyapatite chromatography, eluted material from the heparin column contained more protein bands than material eluted from the SP anion exchange column (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). However, in both cases a major protein band with the same molecular mass of 140 kDa was observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Additional column combinations were also used in the attempt to purify the binding factor. For example, nuclear extract was subjected to SP anion exchange followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Also in this instance multiple protein bands are observed, but a comparison of mobility shift activity and protein composition of each elution fraction shows that the binding activity largely coincides with the presence of the 140-kDa protein (Fig. 4, C and D). Although the protein composition varied between different purification schemes, all elution fractions with APBβ binding activity contained the 140-kDa protein. We therefore designated this protein as the putative APBβ binding factor. Preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used as the final step to purify this protein for sequence analysis. After hydrolysis with trypsin, two of the resulting peptides were microsequenced. A search in the GenBank sequence data base revealed that both peptide sequences, YCDAVFHER and IQHQK, corresponded completely to the sequence of transcription factor CTCF, which was originally described as a regulator of the chicken c-mycgene (33Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The binding site of CTCF in the chicken c-mycpromoter has been extensively characterized (33Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol.

As a DNA fragment containing a well characterized CTCF-binding site we used the 80-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide here referred to as MYC-80, which reproduces the CTCF-binding DNA fragment designated as FPV by Lobanenkov et al. (34Lobanenkov V.V. Nicolas R.H. Adler V.V. Paterson H. Klenova E.M. Polotskaja A.V. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1676740452,"Cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels in outer segments of vertebrate photoreceptors generate electrical signals in response to changes in cyclic GMP concentration during phototransduction1. CNG channels also allow the influx of Ca2+, which is essential for photoreceptor adaptation2. In cone photoreceptors, cGMP triggers an increase in membrane capacitance indicative of exocytosis, suggesting that CNG channels are also involved in synaptic function3. Here we examine whether CNG channels reside in cone terminals and whether they regulate neurotransmitter release, specifically in response to nitric oxide (NO), a retrograde transmitter that increases cGMP synthesis and potentiates synaptic transmission in the brain4,5,6. Using intact retina, we show that endogenous NO modulates synapses between cones and horizontal cells. In experiments on isolated cones, we show directly that CNG channels occur in clusters and are indirectly activated by S-nitrosocysteine (SNC), an NO donor. Furthermore, both SNC and pCPT–cGMP, a membrane-permeant analogue of cGMP, trigger the release of transmitter from the cone terminals. The NO-induced transmitter release is suppressed by guanylate cyclase inhibitors and prevented by direct activation of CNG channels, indicating that their activation is required for NO to elicit release. These results expand our view of CNG channel function to include the regulation of synaptic transmission and mediation of the presynaptic effects of NO."

Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PPAR family appears to play a prominent role in modulating signal transduction pathways involving fatty acids, or derivatives thereof, as signaling molecules.The molecular mechanism(s) of transcriptional activation mediated by nuclear receptors, including PPAR·RXR complexes, has not been fully elucidated. However, evidence has accumulated indicating that ligand may promote a receptor conformation that favors interaction with transcriptional coactivators while promoting dissociation from receptor-associated corepressors, yielding a transcriptionally active complex (see Refs. 23Horwitz K.B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar and references therein). The functional significance of receptor interactions with coactivators or corepressors and the resulting transcriptional activation or repression, respectively, may involve chromatin remodeling (reviewed in Ref. 25Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The coactivators CBP and p300 have been shown to interact with the histone acetyltransferase, P/CAF (26Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), in addition to possessing intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (27Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Conversely, receptor-corepressor complexes have been shown to associate with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1 in Refs. 29Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J.

The resulting covalent modification of histones, either acetylation or deacetylation, may result in alterations within chromatin structure thereby facilitating or inhibiting, respectively, access of transcription factors and/or the core transcriptional machinery to DNA templates (reviewed in Ref. 31Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that both receptors (32Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J.

It remains to be determined if additional mechanisms are operant and, if so, the relative importance of these additional pathways.Two main families of transcriptional coactivators that interact with nuclear receptors have been identified as follows: 1) the integrator protein family including CBP and p300 (38Chakravarti D.

Proteins within the SRC-1 family appear to interact exclusively with transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily (48Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). In contrast, CBP and p300, which appear to be functionally homologous proteins, have been shown to interact with a plethora of signaling molecules and, therefore, have been termed “integrator” proteins (Ref. 40Kamei Y.

In fact, several signaling pathways appear to converge at the level of CBP and/or p300 which may represent the molecular basis of reciprocal antagonism between AP-1 and 1) retinoid receptors (40Kamei Y.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the diversity of nuclear receptor coactivators most likely contributes to the complexity of receptor-mediated signaling, the precise role of individual coactivators and possible synergies or antagonistic interactions between coactivators remains to be elucidated.We have previously demonstrated that peroxisome proliferating agents such as WY-14,643 bind directly to and induce conformational change within the PPARα ligand binding domain (LBD, see Ref. 59Dowell P.

Toward the goal of identifying PPARα coactivators, we have used a yeast two-hybrid system to isolate several proteins that interact with ligand-activated mouse PPARα (mPPARα). One of the mPPARα-interacting proteins isolated in this screen was SRC-1, which has been demonstrated previously to interact with PPARγ (63Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K.

Another such protein isolated in our mPPARα screen was p300 which serves as a transcriptional coactivator for many other transcription factors, including nuclear receptors (38Chakravarti D.

In this report, we focus on the interaction of p300 with mPPARα in yeast, in mammalian cells, and in vitro, and we demonstrate that the manner by which p300 interacts with mPPARα appears to be distinct from that of either retinoic acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR).RESULTSUsing a previously described yeast two-hybrid system (58Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), two mPPARα-interacting clones were isolated, sequenced, and determined to encode fragments of the nuclear receptor coactivators, p300 (40Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, Fig. 1, A and B). Both isolated fragments contain at least one copy of the recently identified LXXLL motif that has been shown to mediate interactions between coactivators and nuclear receptors (see Fig. 1 , A and B, Refs. 48Torchia J.

Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar, 64DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.-H. Ricote M. Ingrey S. Horlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, this is the first report of a p300-PPARα interaction, and for this reason, we chose to conduct further experiments with PPARα and p300.p300 Amino Acids 39–221 Interact with PPARα but Not RXRα or RARγInterestingly, the isolated fragment of p300 (encoding amino acids 39–221, Fig. 1 A) that exhibited a strong interaction with the PPARα bait did not interact with either RXRα or RARγ baits in the absence or presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) in yeast (Fig.2 A). However, the isolated fragment of SRC-1 (encoding amino acids 579–932, Fig. 1 B), which interacted with PPARα in a ligand-enhanced manner, did exhibit a strong ligand-dependent interaction with both RXRα and RARγ demonstrating that all three baits are expressed in a functional form in this yeast strain (Fig. 2 A). Compared with the strong 9-cis-RA-dependent interaction observed between both the RXRα and RARγ baits and the SRC-1 fragment, stimulation of the interaction between the PPARα bait and both coactivator fragments by the PPAR ligand, WY-14,643, was modest yet significant (p < 0.05, Fig. 2 A). A strong interaction between PPARα and both SRC-1 and p300 was observed in the absence of WY-14,643 (Fig. 2 A) consistent with observations previously reported for the interaction of PPARγ and SRC-1 (63Zhu Y. Qi C. Calandra C. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 185-195PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due, at least in part, to the presence of high levels of endogenous PPAR activators in yeast, such as fatty acids and/or derivatives of fatty acids.Figure 2Interactions between coactivator fragments and PPARα, RARγ, and RXRα. A, interactions between coactivator fragments and nuclear receptors in yeast. LexA DBD/receptor baits (PPARα, RARγ, and RXRα) were coexpressed with VP16AAD/coactivator fragment fusions (SRC-1 and p300) and examined for the ability to activate an integrated LexA-responsive lacZreporter in the yeast strain L40. Ligand-dependent interactions were examined in the presence or absence of 100 μm WY-14,643 (PPARα bait), 1 μm9-cis-RA (RARγ and RXRα baits), or vehicle where indicated. At least three independent transformants were assayed for each experiment, and the results shown represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance at the 95% (p < 0.05) and 99% (p < 0.01) confidence levels are indicated by * and ** symbols, respectively. No reporter activity was detected when VP16AAD/coactivator fragment fusions were coexpressed with either LexA alone or LexA fused to an unrelated protein (data not shown). B, in vitroprotein-protein interactions between coactivator fragments and nuclear receptors. A GST/p300 fusion protein corresponding to the isolated p300 fragment (GST/p300-(39–221)) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose and used as an affinity matrix to examine interactions with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled PPARα, RARγ, and RXRα in the absence and presence of ligand (10 μm WY-14,643 for PPARα or 1 μm9-cis-RA for RARγ and RXRα as indicated). All receptors preparations expressed in yeast or translated in vitro were truncated in the amino-terminal (ΔAB) region (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the observed interactions in vitro, p300-(39–221) was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The immobilized protein was then used as an affinity matrix to examine interactions with in vitro translated PPARα, RXRα, and RARγ. As observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, PPARα exhibited a strong specific interaction with the GST/p300-(39–221) fusion. However, the in vitro interaction was strictly dependent on the presence of WY-14,643 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3). This ligand-dependent interaction was in contrast to that of the ligand-independent interaction observed between GST/RXRα and PPARα (see below, Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 5). RARγ and RXRα did not interact with the GST/p300-(39–221) fusion protein in the absence or presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5,6, 8, and 9, respectively) in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid data (Fig. 2 A). The integrity of the in vitro translated RXRα and RARγ proteins was confirmed by interaction with GST/RARγ and GST/RXRα fusion proteins, respectively (see below, lanes 4 and 5 of Fig. 4 , B and C, respectively), and DNA binding activity (data not shown). Therefore, amino acids 39–221 of p300, which interacted strongly with PPARα, were not sufficient for interaction with the retinoid receptors, RXRα and RARγ, as detected in our assays in yeast and in vitro.

Activation of JNK/SAPK leads to the phosphorylation of c-JUN protooncogene on serines 63 and 73. This mechanism is required for and cooperates in the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts by Ha-RAS. However, the function of JNK/SAPK in human tumor growth is unknown. We have tested several lung carcinoma cell lines. All exhibited UV-C-inducible JNK/SAPK activity; two exhibited constitutive activity in low serum, and two (M103 and A549) exhibited EGF-inducible JNK/SAPK activity. In A549 cells, EGF induced a rapid and prolonged (up to 24 h) activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway that correlated with a 150–190% growth stimulation. Stably transfected clones of A549 cells expressing c-JUN(S63A,S73A), a transdominant inhibitor of c-JUN, completely blocked the EGF-stimulated proliferation effect but did not alter the basal proliferation rate. Consistent with these results JNK antisense oligonucleotides targeted to JNK1 and JNK2 entirely eliminated the EGF-stimulated JNK/SAPK activity and blocked EGF-stimulated growth but not basal growth. In contrast, specific inhibition of the RAF/ERK pathway by PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor) completely blocked ERK activation by EGF and basal cell growth but not EGF-stimulated growth, thereby dissociating the growth-promoting roles of each pathway. Our observations indicate, for the first time, that JNK/SAPK may be a preferential effector pathway for the growth properties of EGF in A549 cells.

The activation of this pathway leads to the phosphorylation of the c-JUN protooncogene in its N-terminal activation domain at serine residues 63 and 73. JUN N-terminal kinases (JNKs) phosphorylate c-JUN at these sites (2Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

By using a nonphosphorylatable c-JUN, c-JUN(S63A,S73A), where the two serine residues at position 63 and 73 are replaced by two alanine residues, it is possible to inhibit the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts cells by activated RAS (7Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In addition to JNK activation of AP-1, a transcription factor consisting of c-FOS/c-JUN heterodimers or c-JUN/c-JUN homodimers, JNKs also phosphorylate ATF-2 (9Gupta S. Campbel D. Dérijard B.

AP-1 and ATF-2 are important transcription factors regulating numerous genes implicated in cell growth, transformation, differentiation, and DNA repair (4Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C.

The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) form a group of three different kinase cascade pathways that includes the cascade leading to the activation of JNK/SAPK, but also the members of the RAF/ERK kinase pathway and finally a cascade leading to the activation of p38 MAPK pathway. UV-C irradiation is the most effective inducer of the JNK/SAPK pathway (6Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). UV-C and proinflammatory cytokines are also strong inducers of p38 MAPK (17Brunet A. Pouysségur J. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters and several growth factors preferentially activate the RAF/ERK pathway (14Karin M. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, the RAF/ERK pathway mediates ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction leading to the activation of RAS and RAF, two protooncogenes involved in cell proliferation and transformation (19Smith M.R. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Kung H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3828-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Mansour S.J. Wayne T.M. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Activated RAS stimulates RAF, which induces MEK1, which in turn activates p42 and p44 kinases, also called extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2). It was shown that a direct biochemical link exists between growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and the RAF/ERK pathway through growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) (22Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ulrich A. Skolnick E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well known that epidermal growth factor (EGF) activation of RAF/ERK pathway is an important mitogenic mechanism for many cell types (23Williams R. Sanghera J. Wu F.

However, recently, it has been shown that RAS mediates cell proliferation and cell transformation not only through RAF/ERK but through other pathways involving protooncogenes of the Rho family such as CDC42, Rac1, and p120GAP GTPase-activating protein. For example, the activation of Rac1 (27Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 28Qiu R.G. Chen J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1677-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) is required for RAS transformation of Rat-1 fibroblast and NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, the activation of JNK/SAPK by EGF was shown to be mediated by Rac1 and CDC42 following RAS stimulation (31Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Thus, although the RAF/ERK pathway is implicated in EGF-induced proliferation, the role of JNK/SAPK pathway as a mediator of EGF-stimulated growth remains unknown. Autocrine and paracrine growth stimulation by EGF and related molecules have been implicated in the transformation of a variety of human tumors. EGF stimulates the proliferation of several kinds of human tumor cells such as gliomas (33Lund-Johansen M. Bjerkvig R. Humphrey P.A. Bigner S.H. Bigner D.D. Laerum O.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6039-6044PubMed Google Scholar), mammary tumor cells (34Adamson E.D. Wiley L.M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1997; 34: 71-120Crossref Google Scholar), and keratinocytes (35Reiss M.

EGFr and other ERBB protooncogenes are frequently overexpressed in several human cancer cells including glioblastoma (37Libermann T.A. Nusbaum H.R. Razon N. Kris R. Lax I. Soreq H Whittle N.

Moreover, a recent study shows that alteration of the EGFr resulting in a truncated mutant receptor with constitutive activity confers enhanced tumorigenicity and increased cell proliferation in human glioblastomas (43Nagane M. Coufal F. Lin H. Bogler O. Cavenee W.K. Su Huang H.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5077-5086Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that EGF also plays a major role in autocrine growth of human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) (35Reiss M. Stash E.B. Vellucci V.F. Zhou Z.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6254-6262PubMed Google Scholar,44Tateishi M. Ishida T. Mitsudomi T. Kaneko S. Sugimachi K. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7077-7080PubMed Google Scholar, 45Rusch V. Klimstra D. Venkatraman E. Pisters P.W.T. Langenfeld J. Dmitrovski E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, numerous investigations describe an abundant expression of EGFr in NSCLC lines in culture (46Sherwin S.A. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Todaro G.J.

Langenfeld J. Dmitrovski E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar, 50Veale D. Kerr N. Gibson G.J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1313-1317PubMed Google Scholar). For example, recently it has been shown that 82 of 88 NSCLC tumors express EGFr and 45% overexpress the receptor (51Rusch V. Baselga J. Cordon-Cardo C. Orazem J. Zaman M. Hoda S. McIntosh J. Kurie J. Dmitrovski E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2379-2385PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies support an association of EGFr overexpression with cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. However, the components of the signal transduction pathway responsible for proliferation and transformation of human tumor cells by ligand-activated EGFr are poorly understood. Here, we show that EGF is a potent activator of proliferation of A549 NSCLC. Moreover, EGF is a strong and preferential inducer of prolonged (up to 24 h) activation of JNK/SAPK pathway in these cells. Stable expression of a nonphosphorylatable c-JUN, c-JUN(S63A,S73A) (4Potapova O. Haghighi A. Bost F. Liu C. Birrer M.J. Gjerset R. Mercola D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), leads to complete inhibition of growth stimulation induced by EGF but does not alter basal growth. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK/SAPK pathway using specific phospho-orothioate antisense oligonucleotides against JNK1 and JNK2 specifically inhibits EGF activation of JNK/SAPK and blocks EGF-stimulated proliferation. Conversely, inhibition of the RAF/ERK pathway decreases basal growth but does not interfere with EGF stimulation of growth. These results indicate an essential role for JNK/SAPK pathway in growth stimulation by EGF in human A549 lung carcinoma cells. Non-small cell lung cancer cells A549 (gift of N. Dean), NCI-H292 (gift of X-K. Zhang), NCI-H1011, M103 (gift of L. Deftos), and immortalized normal lung fibroblast CCD16Lu (gift of X-K. Zhang) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS (fetal bovine serum) (v/v). For treatment with recombinant human EGF (rhEGF), UV-C, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and insulin, cells were seeded 2 days before treatment and were maintained in 0.5% FBS for 17 h prior to treatment. For ERK inhibition studies, cells were treated with PD98059 (New England Biolabs), a specific inhibitor of RAF/ERK pathway (52Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl.

For kinase assay, cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates 2 days prior the analysis to provide ∼80% confluent preparations. After treatment with different agents, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined by the Bradford dye method (Bio-Rad). Typically all preparations yielded very similar protein concentrations and were adjusted to provide equal amounts of cellular protein in all samples prior to analysis. The kinase assay was performed as described by Hibi et al. (1Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of whole cell extract was mixed with 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-JUN-(1–223) (GST-c-JUN-(1–223) for 3 h at 4 °C. GST-c-JUN fusion proteins were previously expressed and purified from Escherichia coliand bound to agarose beads (Sigma). After four washes, beads were incubated with 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ32P] ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (54Grover-Bardwick A. Adamson E. Mercola D. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated GST-c-JUN protein was eluted by boiling the sample for 5 min and resolved by a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For ERK/MAPK assay 50 μg of whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK2 antibodies which exhibit cross-reactivity with ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times and assayed for kinase activity in kinase buffer using 4 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) as substrate (16Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Dérijard B. Cobb M. Davis R.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylated MBP protein was resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dried, and exposed to film X-Omat 228 (Kodak). The quantification of 32P-phosphorylated GST-c-JUN and MBP was carried out by digitalization using an AmbisTM scanner (Ambis Inc.) for dried SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels or using an Ultroscan XL (LKB Inc.) for autoradiographs. Background values were subtracted in all cases. Cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates in the presence of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. One day later, the desired volume of rhEGF was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10–100 nm, and the media were not changed during the experiment. Cells were then counted at different days using a Coulter counter. For each experiment wells were counted in triplicate. For experiments with PD98059, the compound was added 1 day after the seeding and 90 min prior to the addition of rhEGF and remained in the media throughout the experiment. The dnJUN expression plasmid pLHCc-JUN(S63A,S73A) was constructed as described previously (55Potapova O. Fakrai H. Baird S. Mercola D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2800-2806Google Scholar). A549 cells were transfected for 12 h in 6-well tissue culture plates with 2 μg of pLHCc-JUN(S63A,S73A) or the empty vector, pLHCX. In both cases the cells were cotransfected with 200 ng of pSV2Neo (bearing the Geneticin® resistance gene), using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 20 μl/ml media (56Wu J.X. Carpenter P.M. Gresens C. Keh R. Niman H. Morris J.W.S. Mercola D. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 989-1000PubMed Google Scholar). Clone selection was performed by adding G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to the media at 1 mg/ml final concentration 3 days after the transfection. After 3 weeks several clones were isolated using cloning rings. The expression of c-JUN(S63A,S73A) by the clones was determined by Western analysis using anti-c-JUN antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Selected clones were then maintained in media supplemented with G418 (0.5 mg/ml), and only low passage cells (p ≤ 10) were used for the experiments described here. All oligonucleotides used in this study were phosphorothioate oligonucleotides prepared following the same procedure described by Dean et al. (57Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Dean N.M. McKay R. Miraglia L. Howard R. Cooper S. Giddings J. Nicklin P. Meister L. Zeil R. Geiger T. Muller M. Fabbro D.

Med. 1996; 2: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and were a gift from ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In this method antisense sequences are chosen based on their ability to eliminate steady state target RNA of A549 cells >95% following a 4.5-h lipofection at 0.4 μm (57Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Dean N.M. McKay R. Miraglia L. Howard R. Cooper S. Giddings J. Nicklin P. Meister L. Zeil R.

Med. 1996; 2: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Two antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the two major forms of human JNK (10Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), termed antisense JNK1 and antisense JNK2, were chosen with sequences 5′-CTCTCTGTAGGCCCGCTTGG-3′ and 5′-GTCCGGGCCAGGCCAAAGTC-3′, respectively. In addition control oligonucleotides consisting of the scrambled sequence version of each antisense oligonucleotide were prepared as follows: 5′-CTTTCCGTTGGACCCCTGGG-3′ and 5′-GTGCGCGCGAGCCCGAAATC-3′, respectively. For JNK and growth assays, the oligonucleotides were used as described (57Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Dean N.M. McKay R. Miraglia L. Howard R. Cooper S. Giddings J. Nicklin P. Meister L. Zeil R. Geiger T. Muller M. Fabbro D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3499-3507PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μm JNK1 plus 0.2 μm JNK2 antisense or scrambled sequence oligonucleotides were added to MEM (minimum essential media) containing 10 μl/ml Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 mg/ml. This preparation was added to 80% confluent A549 cells cultured in 100-mm plates. After 4.5 h, the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM with 5% FBS. Cell extracts were prepared 40 h after the transfection. For JNK assays, the cells to be stimulated with rhEGF were maintained overnight in 0.5% FBS and then were treated by addition of rhEGF to 100 nm for 20 min prior to lysis. Proliferation assays were carried out in 24 well-plates as described above (“Proliferation Assay”). After the lipofection, cells were maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS. One day later, cells were washed with DMEM, 0.5% FBS and grown in this medium in the presence or absence of 100 nm rhEGF. For each experiment wells were counted in triplicate 6 days after the addition of rhEGF. Except where noted (Fig.6 B), all proliferation studies presented here were carried at least twice each with triplicate samples. It has been shown previously that the NSCLC cell line, A549, expresses high levels of EGF receptors (48Haeder M. Rotsch M. Bepler G. Hennnig C. Havemann K. Heimann B. Moelling K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1132-1136PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if EGF activates the JNK/SAPK pathway in A549 cells, we treated these cells, maintained in 0.5% FBS, with 10 nm rhEGF or other agents known to activate JNK (20% FBS, TPA, insulin, and UV-C). JNK activity was determined by examination of the phosphorylation of GST-c-JUN 20 min after the treatment. The addition of FBS, TPA, or insulin failed to significantly activate the JNK/SAPK pathway (Fig. 1). Several other agents such as transplatinum and PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor used later in this study) also failed to activate JNK (data not shown). However, addition of rhEGF or treatment with UV-C strongly and rapidly activated JNK in A549 cells (Fig. 1). To determine whether this activation is dose-dependent, we examined JNK activity as a function of rhEGF concentration. The enzyme activity increased markedly upon addition of 10 nm rhEGF with only small increases upon further addition of rhEGF up to 200 nm (Fig. 2). Thus, near maximal values are observed within the physiological concentration range of EGF consistent with a high affinity and saturable receptor-mediated process. The maximum JNK activity observed following stimulation by rhEGF was half that obtained with UV-C, the strongest observed inducer of the pathway (60Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) suggesting that rhEGF is a potent inducer of JNK activity. To investigate the generality of JNK activity in other lung cells, we treated different lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H1011, M103, and NCI-H292) and an immortalized normal lung fibroblast cell line (CCD16Lu) with 10 nm rhEGF. Among the cells tested, rhEGF consistently activated JNK in M103 up to 3-fold (e.g. Fig.3), whereas in the other cell lines, only UV-C induced a response. Moreover, M103 and NCI-H1011 cells exhibited substantial JNK activity in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 3). For example, this activity is readily apparent for cells maintained in 0.5% FBS overnight prior to analysis. Similar observations hold for cells maintained in complete (5% FBS) media (data not shown). These observations suggest that lung carcinoma cells exhibit a variety of states of JNK activity including substantial constitutive activity in low serum. In some cases such as M103, JNK activity can be stimulated further by addition of rhEGF (Fig. 3). A549 cells exhibited the polar phenotype of maximum induction combined with nearly undetectable basal activity. Therefore, these cells were chosen for further study. To examine whether the EGF-stimulated JNK activity is related to a functional effect in A549 cells, we added rhEGF every 2 days to cells, previously seeded in 0.5% FBS, in amounts that elevated the concentration by 10 nm for each addition. We then followed the course of proliferation over the succeeding 5 days by direct cell counting. After 4 days the EGF-treated cells showed a significant increase in proliferation (p ≤ 0.05) and by day 5 reached a density of 150% that obtained by control cells (Fig. 4). This EGF-dependent proliferation experiment has been repeated 3 times each in triplicate, with similar results each time. Plots of the log of growth versus time are linear over the course of the first 4 days and yield a doubling time of 60 h for A549 cells in low seru"
https://openalex.org/W1965834391,"The antiatherogenic property of estrogens is mediated via at least two mechanisms: first by affecting plasma lipoprotein profiles, and second by affecting the components of the vessel wall. Raising plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) in mice protects them against diet-induced atherosclerosis (Shimano, H., Yamada, N., Katsuki, M., Gotoda, T., Harada, K., Murase, T., Fukuzawa, C., Takaku, F., and Yazaka, Y. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 1750–1754). It is possible that estrogen may be antiatherogenic at least in part by increasing plasma apoE levels. Therefore, we studied the regulation of apoE by estrogen. A survey of 15 inbred strains of mice showed that some mouse strains responded to injections or subcutaneously implanted pellets of estradiol by raising their apoB and apoE levels and some did not. We performed detailed studies in two “responder” strains, C57L and C57BL, and two “non-responder” strains, C3H and BALBc. Responders increased their plasma apoE levels 2.5-fold. Non-responders' levels were altered ±10%. In the responders the distribution of apoE among the plasma lipoproteins shifted from high density lipoprotein toward the apoB-containing lipoprotein fractions. In nonresponders the shift was toward high density lipoprotein. Hepatic apoE mRNA levels and relative rates of apoE mRNA transcription were unchanged in all strains, suggesting that apoE regulation occurred at posttranscriptional loci. Therefore, we measured apoE synthesis in fresh liver slices and on isolated hepatic polysomes. Two-fold increases were noted but only in responders accompanied by selective 1.5-fold increases in polysomal apoE mRNA levels. Similar increases in apoE synthesis were also observed in castrated C57BL mice given either physiological or pharmacological replacement doses of estradiol, but not testosterone, suggesting that the effect of estradiol was specific on the distribution of apoE mRNA in the translationally active polysomal pool. Next, we examined whether the effects of estrogen on apoE translation were mediated by estrogen receptors (ER). ER-α knock-out mice and their wild-type littermates were administered estradiol. As expected, apoE levels and hepatic apoE synthesis increased more than 2-fold in the wild-type littermates, but only 20% increases in the plasma apoE and hepatic synthesis were observed in the ER knock-out mice. Hepatic apoE mRNA levels did not change in either the wild-type or the ER knock-out mice. Thus, estradiol up-regulates apoE gene expression by increasing levels of apoE mRNA in the polysomal translating pool. Furthermore, the increased polysomal recruitment of apoE mRNA is largely mediated by estrogen receptors. The antiatherogenic property of estrogens is mediated via at least two mechanisms: first by affecting plasma lipoprotein profiles, and second by affecting the components of the vessel wall. Raising plasma apolipoprotein E (apoE) in mice protects them against diet-induced atherosclerosis (Shimano, H., Yamada, N., Katsuki, M., Gotoda, T., Harada, K., Murase, T., Fukuzawa, C., Takaku, F., and Yazaka, Y.

Thus, estradiol up-regulates apoE gene expression by increasing levels of apoE mRNA in the polysomal translating pool. Furthermore, the increased polysomal recruitment of apoE mRNA is largely mediated by estrogen receptors. Estrogens may exert antiatherogenic effects either by modulating lipoprotein profiles (1Kushwaha R.P. Lewis D.S. Carey K.D. McGill Jr., H.C. Metabolism. 1991; 11: 23-31Google Scholar) or by affecting atherosclerosis-promoting factors in the vessel wall (2Bourassa P.K. Milos P.M. Gaynor B.J. Breslow J.L. Aiello R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10022-10027Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Estradiol produces marked alterations in the lipoprotein profiles of mice, raising the concentrations of apoB 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; ER, estrogen receptor; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; WT, wild type; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein. -containing particles in plasmas of strains susceptible to atherosclerosis (3Srivastava R.A.K.

Atherosclerosis. 1990; 10: 316-323Crossref Google Scholar). In part the rise is due to an increase in the abundance of apoB100 mRNA relative to B48 in liver (5Srivastava R.A.K. Tang J. Bauman D. Schonfeld G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as estrogen down-regulates apobec1 mRNA (6Srivastava R.A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hepatic LDL receptor protein expression is not affected (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that since apoE is an important component of apoB-containing lipoproteins (7Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2518-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of apoE could also be raised by estrogen treatment in susceptible strains of mice. Mouse apoE is composed of 285 amino acids residues as deduced from the cDNA sequence (8Rajavashisth T.B. Kaptein J.S. Reue K.L. Lusis A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8085-8089Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), compared with 289 amino acid residues for human apoE (9Lin-Lee Y.-C. Kai F.-T. Cheung P. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is synthesized by a variety of tissues, thus differing from other apoproteins that are synthesized exclusively in liver and intestine (9Lin-Lee Y.-C. Kai F.-T. Cheung P. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Srivastava R.A.K. Bhasin N. Srivastava N. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE plays central roles in mammalian cholesterol transport by serving as a ligand for the cell surface LDL and LRP receptors that mediate the endocytosis of apoB- and apoE-containing lipoproteins (11Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar, 12Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Hertz J. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1989; 341: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). LDL receptors recognize both apoB-100 and apoE, but not apoB48, whereas LRP recognize apoE but neither apoB-100 nor apoB48 (13Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1440-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Since apoB48 in the chylomicrons lack the LDL receptor binding domain, the uptake of chylomicron remnants by hepatocytes, enterocytes, and peripheral tissues occurs via apoE binding to apoE receptors (15Lund H. Takahashi K. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9318-9322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, apoE plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism. ApoE is also important in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Studies of apoE knock-out (16Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagmann J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and apoE-transgenic mice (17Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Gotoda T. Harada K. Murase T. Fukuzawa C. Takaku F. Yazaka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1750-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that lack of apoE induced atherosclerosis, whereas overexpression of apoE was protective. A recent study showed an inverse correlation in apoE staining in the vessel wall and extent of lesion formation (18Linton M.F. Babaev V.R. Gleaves L.A. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Circ. Suppl. 1996; 94: I-398PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that apoE may be involved in the removal of lipid-rich particles from the vessel wall by enhancing cholesterol efflux (19Zhang W.-Y. Gaynor P.M. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28641-28646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, factors that stimulate apoE production may retard atherosclerotic lesion formation. Several factors modulate apoE synthesis including hormones and dietary cholesterol and fat (20Lin-Lee Y.-C. Tanaka Y. Lin C.-T. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6474-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Strobl W. Gorder N.L. Fienup G.A. Lin-Lee Y.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Patsch W. J. Biol.

Estradiol stimulates VLDL secretion from rat hepatocytes, and the VLDLs contain apoE (23Meinstein I. Turner F.C. Soler-Argilaga C. Heimberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Regulation of apoE gene expression by estradiol occurs both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional loci in rats (24Seishima M. Bisgaier C.L. Davies S.L. Glickman R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Staels B. Auwerx J. Chan L. Tol A.V. Rosseneu M. Verhoeven G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted we expected apoE levels to be affected by estrogens. Accordingly, we administered estradiol to 15 strains of inbred mice and found the apoE levels of some strains to respond and others to be resistant (26Srivastava R.A.K. Krul E.S. Lin R.C. Schonfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 173: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we report on the regulation of the apoE gene in more detail in two responder and two nonresponder strains. Our results demonstrate that the regulation of apoE gene expression by estrogen is primarily translational. Using estrogen receptor knock-out mice, we also show that estrogen-induced increased synthesis of apoE in the responder strains requires estrogen receptor activity. Inbred strains of male mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME. For the initial survey, three male mice of each strain were used for each treatment group. The placebo group was administered vehicle only and the treatment groups 17β-estradiol at 3 μg/g body weight/day for 5 consecutive days by subcutaneous implantation (Innovative Research of America, Toledo, OH). Animals were allowed to eat a standard rodent chow ad libitum (ICN Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). Mice were fasted 4–6 h and sacrificed on the 6th day under ether anesthesia. Apoproteins and lipids were measured in plasma. RNA were prepared from liver and small intestine (27Srivastava R.A.K. Srivastava N. Schonfeld G. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma apoE levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using rabbit anti-rat apoE antibody (28Lin R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasma apoB and apoAI levels in individual mouse sera were quantified by electroimmunoassay (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Srivastava R.A.K. Tang J. Krul E.S. Pfleger B. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Total cholesterol and triglycerides were quantified using a commercial kit (Wako Pure Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Two strains (C57L and C57BL) that increased their plasma apoB levels >2-fold and two strains that showed a maximum change of <20% (BALB and C3H) were administered 17β-estradiol as described above, and regulation of apoE was compared in more detail. Each group contained five mice. In a third experiment 16 C57BL mice were castrated, allowed to recover for 14 days, and divided into four groups of four animals per group: group 1 received estradiol at 0.16 μg/g body weight/day, group 2 at 3.0 μg/g body weight/day, group 3 was administered dihydroxytestosterone at 1 μg/g body weight/day, and group 4 received the vehicle. In the ER knock-out mice exon 2 of the estrogen receptor gene was disrupted by insertion of the Neo gene which also served as a selection marker (30Lubahn D.B. Moyer J.S. Golding T.S. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11162-11166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The ES cell line E14TG2a was derived originally from 129/J mouse strain. The targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6J mice and returned to pseudopregnant C57BL/6J females to complete their development. Thus, the ER knock-out mice had mixed genetic background of 129/J and C57BL/6J. We used wild-type littermates to control for any potential background effects. Estrogen administration and other manipulations were as described above. Equal volumes of plasma from individual mice were pooled and analyzed on the FPLC system as described (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Srivastava R.A.K. Tang J. Krul E.S. Pfleger B. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In each elution fraction, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein E were quantified as described before (28Lin R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from fresh livers (27Srivastava R.A.K. Srivastava N. Schonfeld G. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). In addition RNA was extracted by a one-step method (23Meinstein I. Turner F.C. Soler-Argilaga C. Heimberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) from nuclei, polysomes, and cytoplasmic fractions containing both monosomes and polysomes (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). ApoE mRNA was quantified by an RNase protection assay (31Srivastava R.A.K. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The integrity of RNA samples was determined by Northern blotting analysis using a mouse apoE riboprobe (32Srivastava R.A.K. Schonfeld G. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 584-587PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant pGEM3Zf(+) plasmid containing 298-base pair apoE cDNA fragment was linearized by HindIII for RNA polymerase T7 directed synthesis of antisense apoE RNA and by BamHI for SP6 directed sense apoE RNA synthesis. The details of the in vitro transcription and purification of the transcript have been described in our earlier reports (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Srivastava R.A.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Srivastava R.A.K. Pfleger B. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The purity of the riboprobe was examined in a sequencing gel. For Northern blotting analysis, 10 μg of total RNA were denatured, separated in an 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher and Schuell) by capillary blotting. The membrane was baked at 80 °C for 1 h and hybridized either with apoE riboprobe or cDNA probe as described (32Srivastava R.A.K. Schonfeld G. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 584-587PubMed Google Scholar). As internal control, the mRNA for mouse β-actin was also determined. For preparing β-actin riboprobe, the recombinant plasmid was linearized with XbaI, and in vitro transcription was performed using T7 RNA polymerase. For preparing sense RNA strand the plasmid was linearized with EcoRI followed by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase. Ribosome preparations that contained pre-initiation complex (40 S), initiation complex (80 S), and polyribosomes were isolated by the magnesium precipitation procedure of Palmiter (33Palmiter R.T. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3606-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). All the procedures were carried out at 0–2 °C. One gram of liver was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer A (25 mm Tris, 25 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mg/ml heparin and 2% Triton X-100. The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 27,000 × g, and the supernatants were decanted into another container. Equal volumes of buffer B (4 volumes of buffer A diluted with 1 volume of 1 m MgCl2) were added to the supernatant followed by incubation for 1 h in an ice bath. The contents were centrifuged for 10 min at 27,500 × gin a Sorval swinging bucket rotor. The supernatants were removed by aspiration, and the pellet containing the preinitiation, initiation, and polyribosome complexes were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes. Polysomes devoid of monosomes were prepared from mouse livers as described below (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Polysomes were isolated from pool of 2 individual mouse livers as described (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 g of liver was homogenized in 6 ml of cold buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.7) containing 0.25m sucrose and 500 μg/ml sodium heparin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (S15) treated with 1 volume of solution containing 10% each of Triton X-100 and sodium cholate. This treatment solubilizes the membrane. The supernatant after treatment was subjected to discontinuous sucrose gradient as described (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After the centrifugation, the opalescent band containing polysomes at the interface of 1.0/2.5 m sucrose was withdrawn with the help of a sterile syringe. Polysomes were used for polysome run-off assay using the wheat germ translation system (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Parts of the polysomal preparations were used to prepare RNA to determine polysome-associated apoE mRNA. In vitro translation on the isolated polysomes were performed for 1 h at 30 °C using 2.5A 260 units of polysomes and 5 μl of [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp., 15 mCi/ml) in a wheat germ translation system (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). At the end of the reaction newly synthesized apoE were immunoprecipitated by rat apoE antibody (22Srivastava R.A.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and processed exactly as described (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were dissolved in SDS loading buffer and run in a 5/10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The apoE protein bands were identified by autoradiography. The intensity of the bands were scanned by image analysis system (JAVA, Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Polysomal profiles were determined essentially as described previously (34Chen X. Sparks J.D. Yao Z. Fischer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S15 extracts were prepared as described above. One milliliter of S15 extracts were overlayered onto a linear 15–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged as described (34Chen X. Sparks J.D. Yao Z. Fischer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were collected in 16 equal parts (300 μl each) by puncturing the bottom of the tube. Absorbance at 260 nm was monitored in each fraction after dilution. Total RNA was prepared from each fraction, and apoE mRNA as well as β-actin mRNA were determined as described above. ApoE and β-actin mRNA transcription rates were measured in isolated mouse liver nuclei exactly as described (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ten million nuclei were incubated with 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and the other three nucleotides under optimized assay conditions (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 26 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of RNase-free DNase I followed by the addition of proteinase K. The total RNA was isolated (27Srivastava R.A.K. Srivastava N. Schonfeld G. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar), and one million cpm of isolated RNA were hybridized with membrane-bound apoE cDNA probe. For background counts, labeled RNA were also hybridized with membrane-bound linearized non-recombinant vector under similar conditions. Hybridization and washings were performed as described (3Srivastava R.A.K. Baumann D. Schonfeld G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As an internal control the relative rates of β-actin mRNA transcription were also determined. Wild-type and the ER knock-out mice treated with placebo or estradiol for 5 days were fasted for 4 h on the 6th day, anesthetized, and their livers immediately removed. About 50 mg of liver were sliced into 10–12 pieces using a sterile razor blade, and assays of the synthesis of protein were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (35Tang J. Srivastava R.A.K. Krul E.S. Baumann D. Pfleger B. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1571-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue pieces were homogenized and high speed supernatants prepared, and aliquots of the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-rat apoE antibody (28Lin R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were processed as described (35Tang J. Srivastava R.A.K. Krul E.S. Baumann D. Pfleger B. Kitchens R.T. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1571-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for visualization of the apoE protein band. The intensity of the band was quantified by our image analysis system. Body weights of the four strains were not affected significantly. Liver weights of the C57L and C57BL estradiol groups increased to 136% of the respective placebo groups. Increases in BALB and C3H strains were 114 and 122%, respectively. ApoB and E levels increased in C57L and C57BL, but not in C3H and BALB (TableI). ApoAI levels fell in all four strains. On FPLC, the cholesterol contents of VLDL-, IDL- and LDL-sized particles increased much more in the C57L and C57BL strains (Fig.1, A and B) than in the BALB and C3H (Fig. 2, Aand B). The cholesterol contents of the HDL-sized fractions decreased in all four strains, less so in the C57L and C57BL than in BALB and the C3H. These changes are compatible with alterations in apoB/apoAI ratios (Table I).Table IPlasma apolipoprotein E, B, and AI levels in mice treated with estradiolMouse strainsApoEApoBApoAIPEPEPEmg/dlC57L7 ± 216 ± 31-aSignificantly different compared to placebo group (p < 0.02).

Following estradiol administration in C57L and C57BL, plasma apoE shifted into the IDL- and LDL-size range (fractions >15, Fig. 1,C and D) reflecting the shifts in the major lipoprotein classes. By contrast, in C3H and BALB, apoE levels shifted toward HDL-sized particles (fractions 40–48, Fig. 2, C and D), also reflecting the estradiol induced redistributions of lipoproteins. Castration resulted in the reduction of plasma apoE levels when compared with sham-operated controls (TableII). Estradiol at either the physiologic or the higher dose increased apoE levels in the male castrated mice.

https://openalex.org/W1760998103,"Peroxynitrite, the product of the reaction between nitric oxide and superoxide anion, is able to nitrate protein tyrosines. If this modification occurs on phosphotyrosine kinase substrates, it can down-regulate cell signaling. We investigated the effects of peroxynitrite on band 3-mediated signal transduction of human erythrocytes. Peroxynitrite treatment induced two different responses. At low concentrations (10-100 microM) it stimulated a metabolic response, leading to 1) a reversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, 2) a rise of tyrosine phosphorylation in the 22K cytoplasmic domain of band 3, 3) the release of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the membrane, and 4) the enhancement of lactate production. At high concentrations (200-1000 microM), peroxynitrite induced 1) cross-linking of membrane proteins, 2) inhibition of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation, 3) nitration of tyrosines in the 22K cytoplasmic domain of band 3, 4) binding of hemoglobin to the membrane, 5) irreversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine kinase activity, 6) massive methemoglobin production, and 7) irreversible inhibition of lactate production. Our results demonstrate that at concentrations that could conceivably be achieved in vivo (10-100 microM), peroxynitrite behaves like other oxidants, i.e., it stimulates band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and increases glucose metabolism. Thus, one plausible physiologic effect of peroxynitrite is the up-regulation of signaling through the reversible inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. At high concentrations of peroxynitrite, the tyrosine phosphorylation ceases in parallel with the nitration of band 3 tyrosines, but at these concentrations phosphotyrosine kinase activity and glycolysis are also irreversibly inhibited. Thus, at least in red blood cells, the postulated down-regulation of signaling by peroxynitrite cannot merely be ascribed to the nitration of tyrosine kinase targets."

https://openalex.org/W2051758651,"The regulation of phosphatidylinositol synthesis was examined by cloning and expressing in COS-7 cells the human cDNAs encoding the two enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway. Human CDP-diacylglycerol synthetase (cds1) and phosphatidylinositol synthase (pis1) clones were identified in the human expressed sequence-tagged (EST) data base, and full-length cDNAs were obtained by library screening. The cds1 cDNA did not possess a recognizable mitochondrial import signal, and the activity of the expressed Cds1 protein was stimulated by nucleoside triphosphates in vitro, indicating that cds1 did not encode the mitochondrial-specific isozyme. There were two mRNA species (3.9 and 5.6 kilobases) detected on Northern blots hybridized with the cds1 probe that were expressed at distinctly different levels in various human tissues. Consistent with the presence of the two mRNAs, a cDNA predicted to encode a second human CDP-diacylglycerol synthetase (cds2) was also uncovered in the EST data base. In contrast to the two cds mRNAs, a single, 2.1-kilobase pis1 mRNA was uniformly expressed in all human tissues examined. Expression of the pis1 gene led to the overproduction of both phosphatidylinositol synthase and phosphatidylinositol:inositol exchange reactions, indicating that the Pis1 polypeptide catalyzed both of these activities. Phosphatase treatment of cell extracts abolished the CMP-independent phosphatidylinositol:inositol exchange reaction, and exchange activity was completely restored by the addition of CMP. Overexpression of cds1 or pis1 alone or in combination did not enhance the rate of phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis. Also, overexpression did not result in a significant proportional increase in the cellular levels of CDP-diacylglycerol or phosphatidylinositol. These data illustrate that the levels of Cds1 and Pis1 protein expression are not critical determinants of cellular PtdIns content and argue against a determining role for the activity of either of these enzymes in the regulation of PtdIns biosynthesis.

The biosynthesis and metabolism of PtdIns 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; CDP-DG, CDP-diacylglycerol; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); EST, expressed sequence-tagged; STS, sequence-tagged sites. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; CDP-DG, CDP-diacylglycerol; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); EST, expressed sequence-tagged; STS, sequence-tagged sites. is of considerable interest due to the involvement of PtdIns and its phosphorylated derivatives in intracellular signal transduction. The breakdown products of the phosphoinositides are ubiquitous second messengers downstream of many G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinases involved in mitogenesis, the regulation of calcium mobilization, and protein kinase C activation (1Noh D.-Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Polyphosphoinositides are also involved in vesicular movement within cells (2De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal organization (3Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Much of the recent work on these signal transduction pathways has focused on the regulation of the kinases and phospholipases involved in generating polyphosphoinositide-derived second messengers. However, a rapid agonist-dependent burst of PtdIns biosynthesis was the first feature of the polyphosphoinositide signaling pathway to be discovered, illustrating that synthesis is tightly coupled to degradation (8Hokin L.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this fine control over PtdIns synthesis.There are two enzymes in the PtdIns biosynthetic pathway, CDP-DG synthetase (CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.41) and PtdIns synthase (CDP-diacylglycerol:myo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11). CDP-DG synthetase sits at a branch point in phospholipid metabolism where phosphatidic acid is partitioned between diacylglycerol or CDP-DG, the key intermediate in the formation of anionic phospholipids (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CDP-DG synthetase genes have been cloned, and the proteins have been purified and biochemically characterized in Escherichia coli (10Icho T. Sparrow C.P. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The enzyme is less characterized from mammalian sources but is thought to exist in at least two forms. The CDP-DG synthetase associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of the endoplasmic reticulum (15Ballas L.M. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is thought to operate in the PtdIns biosynthetic pathway, whereas the enzyme located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (16Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appears to be involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Neither form of mammalian CDP-DG synthetase has been purified although the enzymes from the two sources appear to be different in that the microsomal enzyme is stimulated by GTP, whereas the mitochondrial enzyme is not (17Mok A.Y. McDougall G.E. McMurray W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, human (18Heacock A.M. Uhler M.D. Agranoff B.W. J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) although the enzyme has also been detected in plasma membrane preparations (21Imai A. Gershengorn M.C.

Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

PtdIns synthase has also been extensively purified from human placenta (29Antonsson B.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and rat liver (30Monaco M.E. Feldman M. Kleinberg D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), yielding proteins with estimated molecular masses of 24 and 21 kDa, respectively. Recently, a rodent cDNA encoding rat PtdIns synthase was isolated (31Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Imai H. Yamashita Y. Hosaka K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Imai and Gershengorn (22Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6457-6459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that cellular PtdIns content was regulated by feedback inhibition of PtdIns synthase by PtdIns. This conclusion was based on the inhibition of PtdIns synthase activity in cellular membrane preparations. However, this finding is different from Fischl et al. (26Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that PtdIns had a modest stimulatory effect on yeast PtdIns synthase activity. The reason for these differences is not clear but may relate to the assay systems employed. Alternatively, CDP-diacylglycerol synthetase may regulate PtdIns biosynthesis by analogy to CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to clone and express the human cds 2cds indicates the gene, whereas Cds denotes the protein. 2cds indicates the gene, whereas Cds denotes the protein. and pis genes to determine whether cellular PtdIns content was controlled by the expression levels of these two activities or whether regulation of PtdIns synthesis was independent of the cellular amounts of pathway enzymes.DISCUSSIONCytidine intermediates play a key role in the biosynthesis of all classes of glycerol phospholipids, and the enzymes catalyzing their formation are thought to catalyze the rate-controlling steps in their respective pathways (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathways to PtdIns, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine are all 2-component systems composed of a cytidylyltransferase followed by a synthase (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is the most studied enzyme and is the rate-controlling step in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Accordingly, transient overexpression of this cytidylyltransferase in COS cells yielded a 300–500% increase in the incorporation of [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine and a significant elevation in cellular CDP-choline (49Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, Cds has been proposed as a regulatory point in PtdIns biosynthesis (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and this idea predicts that the transient overexpression of Cds would accelerate PtdIns synthesis. However, Cds overexpression did not result in significantly enhanced incorporation of Ins into PtdIns or result in higher cellular levels of cellular PtdIns. The same conclusion arises from our analysis of the PtdIns labeling pattern in cells overexpressing Pis1, or Cds1 plus Pis1.We conclude that the expression levels of Cds1, Pis1, or both are not determining factors in controlling the de novo rate of PtdIns synthesis or in establishing the cellular PtdIns content. One explanation for this result may be that Cds1 and/or Pis1 are subject to very tight regulation. Another possible explanation that we considered was that the PtdIns:Ins exchange activity of Pis1 acts to reduce an excessive cellular PtdIns content. The exchange activity is due to the reverse reaction of PtdIns synthase and is dependent on CMP, which is tightly bound to Pis1 protein. The degree of reduction of PtdIns would not only be governed by the equilibrium constants of the forward and reverse reactions and the concentration of PtdIns but also by the amount of CMP-bound protein. Previous work with cell membranes indicated that PtdIns was an inhibitor of the PtdIns synthase forward reaction (22Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6457-6459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that PtdIns inhibition correlates with heightened exchange activity. However, a mechanism that places Pis1 as a rate-controlling reaction predicts that CDP-DG would accumulate in cells when Cds1 activity is overexpressed. In contrast, we found that the intracellular levels of CDP-DG were the same in control and Cds-overexpressing cell populations. These data illustrate that CDP-DG pools are strictly maintained and strongly argue against a significant role for Pis1 in controlling the cellular PtdIns content.Cds1 activity is inhibited by polyphosphoinositides in vitro(20Saito S. Goto K. Tonosaki A. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9503-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that these end products of the pathway may function as feedback inhibitors of PtdIns biosynthesis in vivo. If this regulatory mechanism is physiologically important, then the levels of polyphosphoinositides would need to increase in Cds-transfected cell populations to effectively regulate the elevated levels of Cds. However, we did not observe an increase in the level of polyphosphoinositides in Cds1-overexpressing cell populations compared with controls, thus arguing against this mechanism for Cds regulation. CDP-DG pools may also be controlled by a CDP-DG hydrolase. Although an E. coli CDP-DG hydrolase (cdh) is known (50Raetz C.R.H. Hirschberg C.B. Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2245-2247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific enzyme that hydrolyzes CDP-DG has not been characterized in metazoan cells.In light of this data, we propose that the supply of phosphatidic acid limits net PtdIns synthesis via the Cds/Pis pathway. Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase lies at a branch point in glycerolipid biosynthesis and is responsible for converting phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, which in turn is used for the biosynthesis of phosphatidycholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol. There are two forms of this enzyme. The Mg2+-independent form (PAP2) is thought to play a role in signal transduction (51Jiang Y. Lu Z. Zang Q. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29529-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 52Dillon D.A. Chen X. Zeimetz G.M. Wu W.-I. Waggoner D.W. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10361-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is therefore unlikely to play a role in controlling de novo biosynthesis. The Mg2+-dependent isoform (PAP1) is thought to control the biosynthetic dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid and is regulated by reversible association with membranes (53Brindley D.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of phosphatidic acid available to Cds may be severely limited by PAP1, shunting the bulk of the phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and the major membrane phospholipid classes. This conclusion is not entirely satisfying in light of the results of Balsinde et al. (54Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) who reported that the inhibition of PAP1 with bromoenol lactone led to a decrease in triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine synthesis and an increase in phosphatidic acid levels. However, there was no change in the rate of incorporation of labeled precursors into PtdIns as would be expected if the supply of phosphatidic acid was limiting.Alternatively, our data are consistent with diacylglycerol kinase as a potential rate controlling enzyme in the production of PtdIns. Diacylglycerol kinase would provide phosphatidic acid for utilization by Cds and downstream incorporation into PtdIns. There are several isoforms of diacylglycerol kinase, each of which contain distinct domains postulated to regulate its activity and mediate protein:protein interactions at specfic cellular locals (34Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 55Goto K. Kondo H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple diacylglycerol kinase isoforms suggests a diversity of functions for this enzyme, one of which may be to divert diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid for utilization by the Cds/Pis pathway. Thus, the diacylglycerol pool is partitioned between the major phospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, by the regulated synthesis of CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine, whereas a diacylglycerol kinase activity may control the partitioning of diacylglycerol for PtdIns synthesis.There are two studies that indicate Cds is important in controlling the activity of the PtdIns cycle in signal transduction systems. Wu et al. (14Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) showed that Drosophila mutants defective in the isoform of Cds expressed in photoreceptors cannot sustain a light-activated current due to rapid depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Furthermore, Cds overexpression increased the amplitude of the light response, indicating that Cds activity regulated the availability of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate to phospholipase C. Weeks et al. (19Weeks R. Dowhan W. Shen H. Balantac N. Meengs B. Nudelman E. Leung D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) constructed stable cell lines that expressed twice the normal levels of human Cds1. Such cells exhibited increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in response to stimulation with interleukin-1β, suggesting that even modest levels of Cds overexpression amplify cellular signaling systems. Our results, together with these observations from other groups, point to a determinant role for Cds enzyme level in regulating the rate of PtdIns turnover rather than controlling the rate of de novo PtdIns biosynthesis. It will be important to determine if the other Cds isoform, Cds2 (Fig. 1), is responsible for regulating the de novo component of PtdIns metabolism. The biosynthesis and metabolism of PtdIns 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; CDP-DG, CDP-diacylglycerol; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); EST, expressed sequence-tagged; STS, sequence-tagged sites. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; CDP-DG, CDP-diacylglycerol; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); EST, expressed sequence-tagged; STS, sequence-tagged sites. is of considerable interest due to the involvement of PtdIns and its phosphorylated derivatives in intracellular signal transduction. The breakdown products of the phosphoinositides are ubiquitous second messengers downstream of many G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinases involved in mitogenesis, the regulation of calcium mobilization, and protein kinase C activation (1Noh D.-Y. Shin S.H. Rhee S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Polyphosphoinositides are also involved in vesicular movement within cells (2De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), cytoskeletal organization (3Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Much of the recent work on these signal transduction pathways has focused on the regulation of the kinases and phospholipases involved in generating polyphosphoinositide-derived second messengers. However, a rapid agonist-dependent burst of PtdIns biosynthesis was the first feature of the polyphosphoinositide signaling pathway to be discovered, illustrating that synthesis is tightly coupled to degradation (8Hokin L.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 205-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Little is known about the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this fine control over PtdIns synthesis. There are two enzymes in the PtdIns biosynthetic pathway, CDP-DG synthetase (CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.41) and PtdIns synthase (CDP-diacylglycerol:myo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, EC 2.7.8.11). CDP-DG synthetase sits at a branch point in phospholipid metabolism where phosphatidic acid is partitioned between diacylglycerol or CDP-DG, the key intermediate in the formation of anionic phospholipids (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CDP-DG synthetase genes have been cloned, and the proteins have been purified and biochemically characterized in Escherichia coli (10Icho T. Sparrow C.P. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12078-12083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sparrow C.P. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The enzyme is less characterized from mammalian sources but is thought to exist in at least two forms. The CDP-DG synthetase associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of the endoplasmic reticulum (15Ballas L.M. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is thought to operate in the PtdIns biosynthetic pathway, whereas the enzyme located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (16Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appears to be involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Neither form of mammalian CDP-DG synthetase has been purified although the enzymes from the two sources appear to be different in that the microsomal enzyme is stimulated by GTP, whereas the mitochondrial enzyme is not (17Mok A.Y. McDougall G.E. McMurray W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, human (18Heacock A.M. Uhler M.D. Agranoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2200-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,19Weeks R. Dowhan W. Shen H. Balantac N. Meengs B. Nudelman E. Leung D.W.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2200-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PtdIns synthase is located primarily on the cytoplasmic aspect of the endoplasmic reticulum (15Ballas L.M. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) although the enzyme has also been detected in plasma membrane preparations (21Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Nature. 1987; 325: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6457-6459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Santiago O.M.

J. 1993; 294: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PtdIns synthase has been purified from S. cerevisiae (25Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its gene has been cloned (27Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Nikawa J. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4876-4881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns synthase has also been extensively purified from human placenta (29Antonsson B.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and rat liver (30Monaco M.E. Feldman M. Kleinberg D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), yielding proteins with estimated molecular masses of 24 and 21 kDa, respectively. Recently, a rodent cDNA encoding rat PtdIns synthase was isolated (31Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Imai H. Yamashita Y. Hosaka K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Imai and Gershengorn (22Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6457-6459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that cellular PtdIns content was regulated by feedback inhibition of PtdIns synthase by PtdIns. This conclusion was based on the inhibition of PtdIns synthase activity in cellular membrane preparations. However, this finding is different from Fischl et al. (26Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that PtdIns had a modest stimulatory effect on yeast PtdIns synthase activity. The reason for these differences is not clear but may relate to the assay systems employed. Alternatively, CDP-diacylglycerol synthetase may regulate PtdIns biosynthesis by analogy to CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to clone and express the human cds 2cds indicates the gene, whereas Cds denotes the protein. 2cds indicates the gene, whereas Cds denotes the protein. and pis genes to determine whether cellular PtdIns content was controlled by the expression levels of these two activities or whether regulation of PtdIns synthesis was independent of the cellular amounts of pathway enzymes. DISCUSSIONCytidine intermediates play a key role in the biosynthesis of all classes of glycerol phospholipids, and the enzymes catalyzing their formation are thought to catalyze the rate-controlling steps in their respective pathways (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathways to PtdIns, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine are all 2-component systems composed of a cytidylyltransferase followed by a synthase (9Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is the most studied enzyme and is the rate-controlling step in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (9Kent C. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1987; 262: 6457-6459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that PtdIns inhibition correlates with heightened exchange activity. However, a mechanism that places Pis1 as a rate-controlling reaction predicts that CDP-DG would accumulate in cells when Cds1 activity is overexpressed. In contrast, we found that the intracellular levels of CDP-DG were the same in control and Cds-overexpressing cell populations. These data illustrate that CDP-DG pools are strictly maintained and strongly argue against a significant role for Pis1 in controlling the cellular PtdIns content. Cds1 activity is inhibited by polyphosphoinositides in vitro(20Saito S. Goto K. Tonosaki A. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9503-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that these end products of the pathway may function as feedback inhibitors of PtdIns biosynthesis in vivo. If this regulatory mechanism is physiologically important, then the levels of polyphosphoinositides would need to increase in Cds-transfected cell populations to effectively regulate the elevated levels of Cds. However, we did not observe an increase in the level of polyphosphoinositides in Cds1-overexpressing cell populations compared with controls, thus arguing against this mechanism for Cds regulation. CDP-DG pools may also be controlled by a CDP-DG hydrolase. Although an E. coli CDP-DG hydrolase (cdh) is known (50Raetz C.R.H. Hirschberg C.B. Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2245-2247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific enzyme that hydrolyzes CDP-DG has not been characterized in metazoan cells. In light of this data, we propose that the supply of phosphatidic acid limits net PtdIns synthesis via the Cds/Pis pathway. Phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase lies at a branch point in glycerolipid biosynthesis and is responsible for converting phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, which in turn is used for the biosynthesis of phosphatidycholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol. There are two forms of this enzyme. The Mg2+-independent form (PAP2) is thought to play a role in signal transduction (51Jiang Y. Lu Z. Zang Q. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29529-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 52Dillon D.A. Chen X. Zeimetz G.M. Wu W.-I. Waggoner D.W. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10361-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is therefore unlikely to play a role in controlling de novo biosynthesis. The Mg2+-dependent isoform (PAP1) is thought to control the biosynthetic dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid and is regulated by reversible association with membranes (53Brindley D.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of phosphatidic acid available to Cds may be severely limited by PAP1, shunting the bulk of the phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and the major membrane phospholipid classes. This conclusion is not entirely satisfying in light of the results of Balsinde et al. (54Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) who reported that the inhibition of PAP1 with bromoenol lactone led to a decrease in triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine synthesis and an increase in phosphatidic acid levels. However, there was no change in the rate of incorporation of labeled precursors into PtdIns as would be expected if the supply of phosphatidic acid was limiting. Alternatively, our data are consistent with diacylglycerol kinase as a potential rate controlling enzyme in the production of PtdIns. Diacylglycerol kinase would provide phosphatidic acid for utilization by Cds and downstream incorporation into PtdIns. There are several isoforms of diacylglycerol kinase, each of which contain distinct domains postulated to regulate its activity and mediate protein:protein interactions at specfic cellular locals (34Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 55Goto K. Kondo H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The existence of multiple diacylglycerol kinase isoforms suggests a diversity of functions for this enzyme, one of which may be to divert diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid for utilization by the Cds/Pis pathway. Thus, the diacylglycerol pool is partitioned between the major phospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, by the regulated synthesis of CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine, whereas a diacylglycerol kinase activity may control the partitioning of diacylglycerol for PtdIns synthesis. There are two studies that indicate Cds is important in controlling the activity of the PtdIns cycle in signal transduction systems. Wu et al. (14Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) showed that Drosophila mutants defective in the isoform of Cds expressed in photoreceptors cannot sustain a light-activated current due to rapid depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Furthermore, Cds overexpression increased the amplitude of the light response, indicating that Cds activity regulated the availability of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate to phospholipase C. Weeks et al. (19Weeks R. Dowhan W. Shen H. Balantac N. Meengs B. Nudelman E. Leung D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) constructed stable cell lines that expressed twice the normal levels of human Cds1. Such cells exhibited increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in response to stimulation with interleukin-1β, suggesting that even modest levels of Cds overexpression amplify cellular signaling systems. Our results, together with these observations from other groups, point to a determinant role for Cds enzyme level in regulating the rate of PtdIns turnover rather than controlling the rate of de novo PtdIns biosynthesis. It will be important to determine if the other Cds isoform, Cds2 (Fig. 1), is responsible for regulating the de novo component of PtdIns metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1913373831,"Reduced glutathione (GSH) is a key component of the cellular defense cascade against injury caused by reactive oxygen species. Because kainic acid (KA) neurotoxicity is probably mediated at least in part by oxidative stress, we examined the influence of KA treatment on GSH content and GSH-related enzyme activities in adult rats. A single injection of KA (10 mg/kg i.p.) time-dependently decreased forebrain GSH (maximal reduction at 48 h). KA also markedly lowered GSH levels in amygdala and hippocampus, but not in the corpus striatum, which is resistant to KA injury. The pineal secretory product melatonin has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects against KA-induced excitotoxicity in rats. Melatonin (2.5 mg/kg i.p., administered four times) partially prevented all decreases in GSH of KA-treated rats. These neuroprotective effects of melatonin may result from a sparing of glutathione reductase, which decreased in KA-treated but not in KA/melatonin-treated animals. Moreover, KA caused a rapid decrease in the GSH content of cultured cerebellar granule neurons but not astrocytes. These cell types both express functional KA receptors, but only the former are sensitive to reactive oxygen species-dependent KA injury. Melatonin counteracted the changes in GSH induced by KA in cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Our results suggest that melatonin prevents the neurotoxic effects of reactive oxygen species linked to KA receptor activation by maintaining cellular GSH homeostasis."

We studied manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and, in part, GSH in cultured human and rabbit MΦ, and in atheromatous arterial tissue of humans and heritable hyperlipidemic (HHL) rabbits. Incubation of human MΦ with oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) resulted in an induction of MnSOD mRNA production as shown by RT-PCR. MnSOD immunoreactivity (IR) was found to be located in the mitochondria of MΦ. In HHL rabbits, MnSOD activity and GSH concentration were significantly increased in atherosclerotic intima compared to the media of the aorta, but significantly decreased (P<0.01) in larger plaques compared with smaller ones, resulting in a significant inverse correlation of MnSOD activity (r=–0.67, P<0.001) and GSH concentration (r=–0.57, P<0.01) with plaque size. Immunohistology of the atherosclerotic intima revealed MnSOD-IR in Mac-1 (CD 11b/CD 18)-immunoreactive (ir) MΦ of human arteries and, similarly, in RAM-11-ir MΦ of rabbit ones. The relation of MnSOD-ir MΦ decreased with plaque advancement, which is consistent with biochemical findings. Most MnSOD-ir MΦ in atherosclerotic plaques revealed TUNEL-positive nuclei, indicating DNA strand breaks, and p53-IR. We conclude that mitochondrial antioxidants such as MnSOD are induced in MΦ in vitro and in atherosclerotic arteries as a reply to increased mitochondrial oxidation. As normal consequences of an increased oxidative stress due to the exposure to ox-LDL nuclear DNA strand breaks occur, which are suggested to be a signal to increase p53 protein levels. Reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial-dependent pathways are suggested as major contributing pathomechanisms to nuclear damage, which eventually may result in apoptosis. A common response to increased oxidative stress due to modified LDL is presumed in rabbit and human atherosclerotic plaques.—Kinscherf, R., Deigner, H.-P., Usinger, C., Pill, J., Wagner, M., Kamencic, H., Hou, D., Chen, M., Schmiedt, W., Schrader, M., Kovacs, G., Kato, K., Metz, J.

We have previously shown that the E6 protein interacts with the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, suggesting a direct role of E6 in the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. We have now mapped the E6 binding sites on paxillin to the LD motif repeats region, which has been implicated in mediating paxillin binding to two other focal adhesion proteins, vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase. The five LD motif repeats identified in paxillin do not contribute equally to its interaction with E6. The first LD repeat is most critical for paxillin binding to E6 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the binding of recombinant wild-type E6 protein to paxillin blocked the interaction of several cellular proteins with paxillin, including vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase. A mutant E6 protein (H105) which does not bind to paxillin had no effect on the binding of these cellular proteins to paxillin.

These data suggest that E6 disruption of the actin stress fibers occurs through blocking the interaction of paxillin with its cellular effectors such as vinculin and the focal adhesion kinase. Cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix involves signals that are essential in many processes including cell morphology, cell division, cell motility, and tumor metastasis (for review, see Refs.1Janmey P.A.

Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are specialized structures where cells adhere to the extracellular matrix through a network of actin cytoskeleton (for review, see Refs. 5Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K. Kroemker M.

Focal adhesions contain integrins, tensin, vinculin, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; BPV, bovine papillomavirus; HPV, human papillomaviruses; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid. and paxillin. Paxillin is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a variety of stimuli including cell adhesion, alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, and treatment with growth factors (7Turner C.E. Bioassays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins is closely associated with changes in the structure of the actin cytoskeleton, although the precise downstream molecular consequences of such phosphorylation are currently unknown. Several lines of evidence have suggested that FAK is, at least in part, responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin observed in vivo (8Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 9Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Paxillin also binds to vinculin (10Wood C.K. Turner C.E. Jackson P. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an abundant cytoskeletal protein that is important in the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, possibly through its interactions with other focal adhesion proteins, α-actinin, and actin (for review, see Ref. 6Burridge K. Chrzanowskawodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The importance of a role for paxillin in cell signaling is suggested by the fact that paxillin is the target of several viral oncoproteins including v-Src (11Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E.

Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The interaction of paxillin with BPV-1 E6 is specific for transformation competent E6 proteins, and the expression of E6 results in the disruption of the actin stress fibers (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of BPV-1 E6 to paxillin may be important to its oncogenic potential. Paxillin may also contribute to the tumorigenesis of human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Paxillin can bind to the E6 proteins of the cancer-associated type HPV16, but not of the nononcogenic types HPV11 and HPV6 (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The protein levels of paxillin and FAK have also been shown to be up-regulated in cervical carcinoma cell lines and in cells immortalized by HPV18 (15McCormack S.J. Brazinski S.E. Moore J.L.J. Werness B.A. Goldstein D.J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary amino acid structure of paxillin reveals several interesting motifs (13Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kanas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of paxillin has three potential SH2 binding domains (YXXP), the first two of which are implicated in paxillin interaction with v-Crk. Paxillin also contains one proline-rich SH3 binding domain, which is implicated in its interaction with Src. The C-terminal half of paxillin contains four LIM domains, which are cysteine-rich motifs found in two other cytoskeleton proteins, zyxin, and cysteine-rich protein, as well as in several proteins involved in development or differentiation (for review, see Ref. 16Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). One of the LIM domains (LIM3) has been shown to localize paxillin to focal adhesions, although the precise mechanism has not been determined (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A structural element called the LD motif (LDXLLXXL) has also recently been defined in the N-terminal half of paxillin. Paxillin contains multiple LD motif repeats, and the binding sites for vinculin and FAK on paxillin have been mapped to the regions containing the LD motifs (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this report we extend our analysis of the interaction of BPV-1 E6 with paxillin and have mapped the E6 binding sites on paxillin to the LD motif repeat regions. Although our data showed that E6 can bind to multiple LD motif repeats on paxillin, the first LD repeat (LD1) appears to be the most critical for binding E6. Furthermore, binding of E6 to paxillin can block paxillin interactions with several cellular proteins including vinculin and FAK. Finally, we propose a model of E6 interfering with paxillin function by blocking its interaction with critical cellular proteins including FAK and vinculin. The GST fusion proteins containing various regions of paxillin have been previously described in Salgia et al. (13Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kanas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E.

Recombinant PCR. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). E6 protein was35S-labeled in an in vitro translation reaction (Promega) and incubated with 2 μg of GST-paxillin fusion proteins as described in Tong and Howley (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Bound E6 proteins were washed in lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The efficiency of binding was quantitated using NIH image 1.5 software. The hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (BAbCO) was fused to the C terminus of full-length paxillin or of paxillin deleted of LD1 by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pRcCMV vector (Invitrogen). Plasmids encoding the HA-tagged paxillin molecules were electroporated into Cos-7 cells together with the FLAG-tagged E6 plasmid (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). At 40 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitations were carried out either for HA-paxillin using the monoclonal antibody HA.11 (BAbCO) or for FLAG-E6 using the monoclonal antibody M2 (IBI). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using HA.11 or M2 antibodies. A baculovirus vector expressing BPV-1 E6 protein was constructed by cloning the EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the FLAG-E6 coding sequence from pSG5FLAG-E6 (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) into pVL1392 (PharMingen). The transfection and amplification of virus stock were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. To produce recombinant E6 proteins, Hi5 cells infected by pVL1392-E6 were harvested at day 5 postinfection and lysed in lysis buffer. The supernatants containing E6 recombinant proteins were analyzed by immunoblot using the M2 antibody. We have previously demonstrated an interaction between paxillin and BPV-1 E6in vitro and in vivo (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To extend our analysis of the paxillin/E6 association, we have mapped the E6 binding site on paxillin. For this purpose, a series of GST-paxillin fusion proteins containing various regions of paxillin were used to bind35S-labeled, in vitro translated BPV-1 E6. As shown in Fig. 1, the N-terminal half of paxillin (aa 1–325) efficiently bound to E6, whereas the C-terminal LIM domain did not. Studies with additional truncation and deletion paxillin constructs, however, suggested the possibility of multiple E6 binding sites within the N-terminal half of paxillin. For example, both aa 100–557 and aa 1–227 could bind to E6, suggesting that the overlapping region of the two constructs (aa 100–227) was responsible for the E6 binding. However, a paxillin construct (Δ100–227) deleted of aa 100–227 still bound to E6, implying that more than one region within the N-terminal half of paxillin could bind to E6. The N-terminal half of paxillin has recently been shown to contain multiple LD motif repeats (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Four LD motif repeats were identified in that initial study, and our analysis has revealed a fifth repeat at aa 216–227. These repeats (LD1–5), renumbered to include the fifth LD repeat, are shown in Fig. 2. To test whether the LD motif repeats were responsible for the multiplicity of E6 binding sites on paxillin, GST fusion proteins containing or deleted of the various LD repeats were next used in the binding experiments (Fig. 3). Deletion of LD1 (aa 11–557) decreased the E6 binding efficiency to about 40% of the full-length paxillin, implicating LD1 as a major component of the E6 binding site on paxillin. A fusion protein containing LD1 (aa 1–100) bound to E6 efficiently, whereas a similar construct with LD1 deleted (aa 11–100) did not bind to E6. These data suggest that LD1 accounts for more than half of the E6 binding activity of paxillin and that the remainder of the E6 binding activity is contributed by sequences in the N-terminal half of paxillin between aa 100 and 325.Figure 3The E6 binding sites on paxillin are mapped to several regions containing the LD motif repeats. The methods are described in Fig. 1. The number of LD motifs and the efficiency of binding in each reaction are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To map which regions of paxillin were responsible for the residual E6 binding activity, fusion proteins containing various numbers of LD repeats were tested for their ability to bind to E6. As shown in Fig.3, the fusion protein construct (aa 100–227) containing both LD2 and LD3 motifs could bind to E6, with an efficiency about 55% of the full-length protein. Both the LD2 and LD3 repeats appeared to be required for the binding, since each of the two fusion proteins (aa 100–227/ΔLD2, and 100–217) containing only a single LD motif bound E6 very poorly (less than 10% of the full-length protein). Surprisingly, unlike the deletion of LD1, deletion of LD2 and LD3 from either full-length paxillin (aa 1–557/Δ(100–227)) or from the N-terminal half of paxillin (aa 1–325/Δ(100–227)) had no effect on the efficiency of E6 binding, suggesting that the regions containing LD2 and LD3 motifs were able to bind to E6, but they were not necessary for paxillin binding to E6 when there were other LD repeats present. We next tested the role of LD4 and LD5 in mediating paxillin binding to E6. A fusion protein containing LD4 and LD5 (aa 227–325) bound to E6 with 70% of the efficiency of the full-length protein. Similar to what has been observed with LD2 and LD3, deletion of LD4 and LD5 from the N-terminal half of paxillin had no effect on the efficiency of E6 binding (compare the binding result of aa 1–325 to that of aa 1–227). Taken together, the data showed that LD2–5 were responsible for part of the E6 binding activity, that LD2–3 and LD4–5 were redundant E6 binding sites, and that in the case of LD2–3, both motifs seemed to be required for E6 binding. Since in vitro experiments suggested that LD1 was the most critical LD repeat in mediating E6 binding to paxillin, we next investigated the role of LD1 mediating E6 binding in mammalian cells. For these experiments, we employed a FLAG-tagged BPV-1 E6 construct which we have previously characterized and shown to be functional in cellular transformation assays (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged BPV-1 E6 was co-transfected into Cos cells with either HA-tagged full-length paxillin (1–557) or HA-tagged paxillin (11–557) deleted of LD1. Comparable levels of HA-tagged full-length paxillin and paxillin deleted of LD1 were expressed in the transfected cells as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using the HA antibody (Fig.4). Similarly, immunoprecipitation using the FLAG antibody (M2) showed that equal amounts of FLAG-tagged E6 were expressed in cells transfected with each of the two paxillin construct. In agreement with our previous report, full-length paxillin coprecipitated with E6 (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a small amount of paxillin (11–557) deleted of LD1 co-precipitated with E6 (Fig. 4). Quantitation of the immunoblot revealed that the amount of paxillin (11–557) in complex with E6 was about 10% of what had been observed with full-length paxillin. These data indicate that LD1 is the principal determinant for efficient binding of paxillin to E6 in vivo. Consistent with the results from the in vitrobinding assays, deletion of LD1 did not completely eliminate E6 binding to paxillin, suggesting that the remaining LD motif repeats may also play a role in E6 interaction with paxillin in vivo. There is evidence to suggest that the LD motifs also mediate paxillin binding to vinculin and FAK. Vinculin binds to a 21 aa stretch of paxillin (aa 143–164) which contains LD2, whereas maximal FAK binding requires aa 143–164 as well as a region containing LD4 and LD5 (aa 265–313). Mutational analysis indicated that the conserved glutamic acid (Asp146) contained in LD2 is required for paxillin binding to both vinculin and FAK (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the potential role of BPV-1 E6 to affect paxillin interaction with LD-binding cellular proteins. Recombinant BPV-1 E6 expressed from baculovirus vector infected Hi5 cells was preincubated with full-length GST-paxillin. The GST-paxillin preincubated with recombinant BPV-1 E6 was then used to precipitate cellular proteins from 35S-labeled Cos cell lysates. As shown in Fig.5 A, GST-paxillin bound to a number of cellular proteins, some of which (p200, p180, p120, p40) were blocked by wild-type recombinant E6. Equal amounts of a mutant recombinant E6 (H105D) which cannot bind to paxillin (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) did not block the binding of these cellular proteins to paxillin, indicating that E6 must physically interact with paxillin to block its binding to certain cellular proteins. The identity of some of these cellular proteins was next examined. p200 is similar in size to a known paxillin binding protein talin (210 kDa) (13Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kanas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), whereas p120 is similar in size to vinculin (116 kDa) (10Wood C.K. Turner C.E. Jackson P. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and FAK (125 kDa) (8Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the identities of p200 and p120 by immunoblot analysis. 35S-labeled cell lysates were mixed with GST-paxillin or GST-paxillin preincubated with baculovirus lysates expressing recombinant E6 protein. The bound proteins were next analyzed by autoradiography and by immunoblot analysis. Antibodies against vinculin and FAK each reacted with a protein migrating at 120 kDa whose binding to GST-paxillin was blocked by recombinant E6 (Fig.5 B). Vinculin and FAK were further shown to comigrate with p120 by matching the autoradiography to the immunoblots. Therefore p120 was identified as a doublet of vinculin and FAK. p200, on the other hand, did not correspond to talin based on immunoblot analysis (data not shown). We are currently investigating the identity of the remaining cellular polypeptides whose binding to paxillin can be blocked by E6. The focal adhesion protein paxillin is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli (7Turner C.E. Bioassays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It interacts with integrin (19Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and several other focal adhesion proteins including vinculin (10Wood C.K. Turner C.E. Jackson P. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), talin (13Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kanas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B.

Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These properties suggest that paxillin may be a molecular adaptor for the recruitment and organization of structural and signaling molecules at focal adhesions. Paxillin is also the target of a number of retroviral oncoproteins including v-Src (11Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), v-Crk (12Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that paxillin interacts with the E6 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type-1 (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In this report we have further characterized the interaction between paxillin and BPV-1 E6. We have mapped the E6 binding sites to the LD motifs located within the N-terminal half of paxillin, and provided evidence that E6 can block the binding of several cellular proteins to paxillin. We have further identified vinculin and FAK as two of the cellular proteins whose binding to paxillin is blocked by E6. Paxillin contains several structural motifs which have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions (13Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kanas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) including the N-terminal SH2 and SH3 binding domains, and the C-terminal LIM domains. Recently the N-terminal half of paxillin has been shown to contain tandem LD motifs (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which may represent a new class of protein-protein interaction motifs. Four such motifs were described in the original study and we have since identified a fifth LD motif. Results from the previous work (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) as well as from our data presented here strongly suggest that the LD motifs mediate paxillin interactions with vinculin, FAK and BPV-1 E6. Several lines of evidence indicate that the individual LD motif repeats are not completely redundant. LD1 is the most critical element in paxillin's interaction with E6, whereas it is dispensable for FAK and vinculin binding (data not shown). In contrast, the binding of FAK and vinculin to paxillin involves different LD motif repeats. LD2 is necessary and sufficient for vinculin binding to paxillin, whereas LD2 and a region containing LD4 and LD5 are required for maximal FAK binding (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The specificity of each repeat can be conferred by the nonconserved residues in the motifs, and may thereby determine the affinity of various interactions and the outcome of signaling events in response to different stimuli. The observation that BPV-1 E6 can block paxillin interactions with several cellular proteins, including vinculin and FAK, whose binding may also involve the LD motifs, suggests an interesting mechanism by which E6 may disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. By binding paxillin through the LD motif repeats, E6 may prevent other LD-binding cellular factors from interacting with paxillin, thereby affecting paxillin's role as a molecular adaptor and interfering with signal transduction from the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton. E6 may directly compete the binding of the cellular factors such as FAK and vinculin to paxillin by physically occupying the LD motif repeats required for their binding. Alternatively, since the major paxillin binding site for E6 appears to be different from that of FAK and vinculin, the effect of E6 on the interaction of FAK and vinculin with paxillin could be indirect such as a conformational change in paxillin caused by E6 binding. The model is consistent with our previous observation that the E6 effect on actin network is dose dependent (14Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is unclear how low levels of E6 is sufficient to cause transformation (20Androphy E.J. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Science. 1985; 230: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. One possibility is that E6, by disrupting the protein complex assembled onto paxillin, provides a signal which is then amplified through a cascade of signal transduction events. Changes in actin cytoskeleton have long been observed in transformed cells (1Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), our studies on the interaction between paxillin and BPV-1 E6 have provided insight on the mechanism of how such alterations may occur.

https://openalex.org/W1889623179,"Peptide hormones and growth factors are involved in the regulation of prostatic cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death, which functions are primarily controlled by androgen. In carcinogenesis, prostatic cancer cells often lose androgen dependence and become largely dependent on local growth factors. The prostatic cancer cells able to respond to factors other than androgen by proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis are possibly able to survive. We demonstrate that prostatic epithelium expresses prolactin mRNA and protein in a characteristic manner. By using in situ hybridization, an overall distribution of prolactin mRNA was demonstrated in the epithelium of rat dorsal and lateral prostate, whereas a very specific localization of prolactin protein to single cells was observed by immunohistochemistry in the same tissues. In these cells, immunoelectron microscopy showed that prolactin was primarily localized to the secretory granules. These data demonstrate a selective regulation of prostatic prolactin at least at the level of transcript processing/translation and/or protein accumulation and secretion. In addition, the expression of prolactin protein in rat dorsal and lateral prostate was found to be androgen dependent in vivo in castrated and in castrated, testosterone-treated rats, as well as in vitro in organ cultures. Our results support the concept of an autocrine/paracrine loop of prolactin action in prostate where it could mediate some of androgen actions. Also, locally synthesized prolactin might belong to the factors that take over androgen regulation of prostatic cancer cells during the development of androgen-independent growth.—Nevalainen, M.

We report here that Eps15 forms dimers and tetramers of distinct shape. The Eps15 dimer is an elongated molecule, 32 nm in length. There is a globular “head” at one end of the molecule and an extended “stalk” of 25 nm which is kinked at about 17 nm away from the head. In the Eps15 dimer, two subunits are arranged parallel to each other, so that the head corresponds to two side by side copies of the N-terminal region I, which contains the three Eps15 homology domains. The proximal part of the stalk is the coiled-coil central region II containing 20 heptad repeats. The kink is at the boundary between region II and the C-terminal region III, which contains the AP-2 binding site, 15 aspartic-proline-phenylalanine repeats, and proline-rich Src homology domain ligand sites. The Eps15 tetramer has a “dumbbell” shape, ∼31 nm in length; it is formed by the anti-parallel association of two Eps15 dimers.

In mammalian cells, formation of clathrin-coated pits leads to specialized vesicular traffic for transport of membrane-bound proteins and their ligands from the plasma membrane or the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal compartment (for a recent review see Ref. 1Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Coat components such as clathrin and its associated adaptor protein (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1 or AP-2, clathrin adaptor protein complexes; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EH, Eps15 homology; Eps15, EGF receptor pathway substrate clone 15; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SH, Src homology domain. complexes have been studied extensively, and it is clear that they have important roles in the assembly of the coat as well as in receptor sorting (for recent review, see Ref. 2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J. Riezmann H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 4: 488-495Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Eps15 is a newly recognized coat component, which was originally discovered because it is phosphorylated in cells activated by EGF (3Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was found to interact in vivo with the α-subunit of the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP-2 complex (4Iannolo G. Salcini A.E. Gaidarov I. Goodman O.B. Baulida J. Carpenter G. Pelicci P.G.

Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The predicted sequence of Eps15 consists of three distinct regions (3Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (see diagram in Fig. 1 A). Region I, at the N terminus, contains three internal 70–90 amino acid conservative repeats that are homologous to each other, denoted Eps15 homology (EH) domains, whose functions and partners are presently unknown. The central portion, referred to as region II, spans 140 amino acids and contains 20 heptad repeats, characteristic of proteins that form α-helical coiled-coil dimers. Indeed, a recombinant fragment corresponding to this region has recently been shown to form dimers (9Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E. Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, in cell extracts of mammalian cells, it has been shown that cytosolic or membrane-bound Eps15 can also form dimers through a homophilic interaction probably mediated by region II, as well as larger oligomers proposed to be tetramers (9Tebar F.

Eps15 is believed to have an important role in vesicular traffic, but its function is still unknown. One reason for believing that Eps15's function is important is the conspicuous presence of Eps15 in most, if not all, plasma membrane-coated pits (7Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 8Van Delft S. Schumacher C. Hage W. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is prominently located at the rim of forming pits (7Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the part of the pit that is thought to be actively engaged in the recruitment of components for coat assembly and for capture of membrane-bound receptors (2Kirchhausen T.

EMBO J. 1997; 9: 2240-2250Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Another reason to suspect that Eps15 is a significant participant in the endocytic pathway comes from genetic evidence suggesting that End3 and Pan-1, two yeast proteins with EH domains, are required for endocytosis in yeast (13Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Wendland B. McCaffery J.M. Xiao Q. Emr S.D. J.

Cai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A recently described EH domain-containing protein also interacts with the γ-subunit of AP-1, the trans-Golgi network-form of the clathrin adaptor complex suggesting that a homolog of Eps15 may function in the trans-Golgi network (17Robinson M.S. Page L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 977Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We report here the conformation of dimers and tetramers of Eps15 and describe the relationship between their structural features and the domain organization of the subunits. We have analyzed electron microscopic images of rotary shadowed molecules of recombinant full-length Eps15. These are images resembling “eighth notes” (quavers) and images resembling “dumbbells.” From inspection of these images and of fragments corresponding to different combinations of the three regions of Eps15, we derive a physical map of Eps15 and assign structural features of the molecule to specific regions of the polypeptide chain, defined with the help of gel filtration chromatography, chemical cross-linking, and mass spectrometry. The eighth notes are Eps15 homodimers containing two parallel subunits. Their total length is ∼32 nm. A globular “head” at one end of the molecule is joined to an extended “stalk,” often with a kink ∼17 nm away from the head. The head contains two copies of the N-terminal region I. The proximal portion of the stalk is a dimeric coiled-coil, formed by region II. The kink joins region II to the C-terminal region III. The dumbbells are Eps15 tetramers, formed by the anti-parallel assembly of two Eps15 homodimers. Each end of the dumbbell is the head of a homodimer. The ends are separated by a 17–18-nm central rod, made of two anti-parallel region II coiled-coils. Thus, each region I head faces region III of the other dimer. We discuss some possible implications of these conformations for the function of Eps15 in clathrin-mediated endocytic traffic. A human cDNA clone for Eps15 (full) inserted in pCEV29 was kindly provided by Dr. P. P. Di Fiore (Milan, Italy). Four DNA fragments (see Fig.1 B) corresponding to (i) the 314 N-terminal residues (region I), (ii) the 538 N-terminal amino acids (regions I + II), (iii) the 566 C-terminal amino acids (region II + III), and (iv) the 412 C-terminal amino acids (region III) were generated by PCR and subcloned downstream of the 6 His-tag into the bacterial pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). The His-tag was added to facilitate the purification of the expressed proteins. All primers sequences are available on request. The construct containing the complete open reading frame of Eps15 (Eps15 (full)) was obtained by insertion of a restriction fragment derived from pET28a/Eps15 (II + III) spanning part of regions II and the complete region III, to the corresponding sites in the vector pET28a/Eps15 (I + II). BL21 cells were transformed with the expression vector constructs to produce Eps15 (full) or its fragments upon induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C (see Fig. 1 C). Cells were lysed and the His-tagged proteins purified by adsorption to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose beads (18Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol.

After sonication, the sample was centrifuged at 85,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLA-100.4 rotor (Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge). 0.2 ml of the supernatant (cytosolic fraction; ∼3 mg/ml) was then applied to a Superose 6 column (H10/30 Pharmacia), equilibrated in column buffer, and eluted at room temperature at a flow of 0.5 ml/min with 0.5-ml fractions collected per min. The eluted fractions were concentrated by precipitation with 15% (final) trichloroacetic acid followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and region III of Eps15. To analyze the recombinant proteins, 0.2 ml of a solution (at ∼1.5 mg/ml) containing purified full-length Eps15 (full) or several of its fragments was loaded on the Superose 6 column, and aliquots from the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The elution profile of the column was calibrated with the sizing standards (Sigma) thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). 25 μg of a given Eps15 recombinant protein (final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml in 150 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) was incubated with increasing concentrations (between 0.005 and 2.5 mg/ml final) of freshly prepared bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. The chemical cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of Tris-HCl (final concentration, 50 mm, pH 7.0), and the cross-linked species were detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. 300 μl (at 1.0 mg/ml) of Eps15 (I + II) free or cross-linked with BS3 (2.5 mg/ml final) for 2 h at room temperature was transferred into water using a NAP-5 column. The molecular masses of the species present in 2 μl of the samples were determined with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystem Voyager) using sinapinic acid as an acid matrix (Protein Facility, Tufts University). To assign the structural features of Eps15 to specific regions, we visualized full-length molecules and fragments corresponding to defined regions of Eps15 by electron microscopy. After glycerol spray and platinum rotary shadowing of the samples (Fig.1), representative results are summarized in the gallery of images shown in Fig. 2. Two classes of views were obtained for recombinant human full-length Eps15 (Eps15 (full), Fig. 2, a–h). Images in the first class (a–d), representing about 60% of the total, have a globular head, 7 ± 1 nm in diameter, joined to a stalk, 25 ± 3 nm in length (n = 15), often with a kink at about 17 nm from the head (n = 5). These images resemble musical eighth notes. The remaining 40% of the views (e--h) are dumbbells, with two heads of 8 ± 1 nm diameter separated from each other by a straight rod of 18 ± 3 nm (n = 7). As discussed below, the eighth notes and the dumbbells correspond to parallel dimers and anti-parallel tetramers of Eps15, respectively. The elongated shape of Eps15, deduced from inspection of electron micrographs, was confirmed by determination of its elution behavior when subjected to gel filtration chromatography. The elution profile of recombinant Eps15 (full) (Fig.3 B) was the same as the profile of native Eps15 from the cytosol of COS cells (Fig.3 A). Eps15 elutes as if it were a molecule larger than the globular ∼700-kDa thyroglobulin used as a size marker. To facilitate assignment of the various regions of Eps15 to the structural features, we examined recombinant fragments corresponding to Eps15 (I), Eps15 (I + II), and Eps15 (II + III). Fig. 2 iillustrates that Eps15 (I), which contains only region I, has a globular appearance with an average diameter of 7 ± 1 nm (n = 20) similar in size to the 52-kDa terminal domain of clathrin (Fig. 2, r–u). In solution, Eps15 (I) appears to be a monomer since it elutes at the position expected for a globular protein of about 40 kDa (Fig. 3 C). Moreover and in agreement with earlier work, chemical cross-linking of Eps15 (I) using BS3 followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.4 B) yields no new species of higher molecular weight, even after extensive exposure to a relatively high amount of the cross-linking reagent (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). Eps15 (I + II) appears as a “head and stalk,” where the globular portion has a diameter of 8 ± 1 nm and is linked to a straight stalk of 18 ± 2 nm in length (n = 20) (Fig. 2,j–m). The elution profile of Eps15 (I + II) is also consistent with an extended structure, since it co-elutes with the ∼700-kDa thyroglobulin, rather than with the ∼60-kDa bovine serum albumin size marker (Fig. 3 D). Chemical cross-linking (Fig.4 C) of Eps15 (I + II) produced a high molecular weight species in SDS-PAGE, and increasing concentrations of BS3chased the monomeric ∼60-kDa species into a form running as a relatively sharp band at ∼180 kDa. The faint band at ∼220 kDa is not present when the protein is purified from a glutathione S-transferase-Eps15 fusion by thrombin digestion (not shown) and may be an abnormal aggregate. To resolve whether the 180-kDa oligomer corresponds to a dimer or to a trimer, we determined the true molecular mass of the cross-linked Eps15 (I + II) species by matrix desorption mass spectrometry. Non-cross-linked Eps15 (I + II), used as a control, showed three peaks that corresponded to a protein of 62 kDa with +1, +2, and +3 charges, which is in excellent agreement with the predicted size of the monomeric fragment (62 kDa) (Fig. 4 F). In contrast, the sample containing mostly cross-linked Eps15 (I + II) (same as in Fig. 4 C, lane 7) displays peaks at 129, 65, 43, and 21 kDa and therefore corresponds to different charged forms of the dimer modified with BS3 (Fig. 4 G). These results indicate that in solution Eps15 (I + II) forms dimers. We note that the dimensions of the head and the proximal portion of the stalk in the eighth note views of intact Eps15 (full) are similar to those of the corresponding features in dimeric Eps15 (I + II) (Fig. 2,a–d). The dimensions of the proximal stalk are consistent with the presence of 20 contiguous heptad repeats in region II forming an extended dimeric α-helical coiled-coil. The length of region II (17–18 nm instead of the expected 21 nm for 20 heptads) might be explained if the head lies to the side of region II rather than at its tip (see diagram in Fig. 5,A and B). Thus we propose that the heads of the eighth note images contain region I and that the proximal portion of the stalk contains the coiled-coil region II, so that in dimeric Eps15 the chains are arranged side by side and in parallel. The images of Eps15 (II + III) (Fig. 2, n–q) show straight stalks (length of 26 ± 4 nm) often interrupted by a kink at about 16 nm from one end resulting in “V”-shaped views (n= 64) (Fig. 2, p and q). The elution profile of Eps15 (II + III) confirms its extended conformation (Fig.3 E), and chemical cross-linking indicates that it is mostly a dimer (Fig. 4 D). Since the longer portion of the stalk (17 nm) has about the same length (17–18 nm) as the proximal stalk seen in the images of Eps15 (full) and of Eps15 (I + II), we suggest that the kink lies at the boundary between regions II and III. At this point it is not possible to ascertain whether the variability in the angle subtended at the kink reflects flexibility in the joint or whether it simply corresponds to different views of a relatively rigid protein. The extended appearance of the smaller branch of the stalk in Eps15 (II + III) or in full-length eighth note views of Eps15 (full) might indicate that region III has a relatively unfolded conformation. This interpretation is consistent with the hydrodynamic behavior of Eps15 (III) alone (Fig. 3 F), which co-eluted with apoferritin (a globular protein of ∼400 kDa) rather than as a compact protein of ∼47 kDa (the true size of Eps15 (III)). Moreover, and as previously shown by a similar in vitro experiment, lack of high molecular weight species following extensive cross-linking of Eps15 (III) with BS3 indicates that by itself Eps15 (III) is monomeric (Fig. 4 E). Attempts to visualize Eps15 (III) by rotary shadowing were not successful, probably because of the limited contrast afforded by a relatively unfolded monomeric polypeptide chain. As a comparison, clathrin light chains, which are polypeptides of ∼25 kDa and also believed to be unfolded in solution, fail to produce enough contrast for visualization using the same platinum-shadowing technique applied here. 2T. Kirchhausen, unpublished observations. Finally, we believe that the dumbbell views of Eps 15 (Fig. 2,e–h) correspond to the anti-parallel association of two Eps15 dimers. In these images, each head would correspond to two copies of regions I from one dimer closely apposed to two copies of region III of the second dimer. The straight rod between the two heads therefore corresponds to the side by side anti-parallel arrangement of two coiled coils from region II. The presence of tetramers is consistent with the data obtained by cross-linking of recombinant Eps15 (full) (Fig. 4 A) and of native Eps15 in the cytosol of NIH 3T3 cells (9Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E. Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There is a broad band above the position of the monomer, which we interpret as dimer, and a weaker band that barely enters the gel, which might correspond to a tetramer. The extensive side by side contact in the dimers and tetramers probably leads to multiple cross-linking over a significant part of the polypeptide chain and hence to extreme heterogeneity in the migration of cross-linked oligomers. In this study we report the shape of Eps15 and establish the relationships between the structural features of Eps15 and its corresponding domains. We have visualized dimeric Eps15, and we have found that it resembles a musical eighth note. The two subunits are arranged parallel to each other. The head contains two copies of region I; the stalk is a parallel, two strand, α-helical coiled-coil; and the portion beyond the kink contains two copies of region III. We have also visualized the tetrameric form of Eps15. It is dumbbell-shaped, made from two anti-parallel eighth note dimers. Larger oligomers were not detected. Recombinant Eps15, like cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of the molecule, tend to form more dimers than tetramers. We have found that the three regions of Eps15, defined previously by sequence analysis (3Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), correspond to the three adjacent structural features visualized by electron microscopy (see schematic diagrams in Fig. 5, A and B). The N-terminal region I maps to the compact head, the central region II corresponds to the adjacent straight stalk, and the C-terminal region III maps to the extended continuation of the stalk. In the tetramer, four regions II contributed by two dimers overlap to form the central bar of the dumbbell. Since the dumbbell images do not show projections that could correspond to region III, we propose that regions I from one dimer interact with regions III from the other dimer. Thus, contacts between region I and region III seem important to stabilize the tetramer. Contacts between dimers of region II, however, do not seem to be sufficient for tetramer formation. There was no evidence from chemical cross-linking for tetramer formation in samples of either Eps15 (I + II) or Eps15 (II + III), and we could not detect dumbbell images by electron microscopy in samples of Eps15 (I + II), even when they were subjected to chemical cross-linking prior to rotary shadowing (not shown). The close apposition of regions I and III in the tetramer raises several questions relevant to the function of Eps15. Eps15 becomes phosphorylated in response to stimulation of cells with EGF (3Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), presumably by the action of the EGF receptor kinase (10Schumacher C. Knudsen B.S. Ohuchi T. Di Fiore P.P. Glassman R.H. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15341-15347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The actual sites of Eps15 phosphorylation are unknown, although a possible tyrosine target in the second EH domain in region I has been suggested (3Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Eps15 phosphorylation could therefore modulate the state of tetramerization by reversibly altering the interaction between regions I and III of two dimers. EH domains are found in many kinds of proteins from yeast to Drosophila to man (22Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that these domains are involved in oligomerization, since the interaction of the EH domains in region I with region III stabilizes the anti-parallel tetramer. There are 15 aspartic-proline-phenylalanine repeats in region III, and it is possible that these form the EH domain binding site. This is reminiscent of the dimerization of STATS, which occurs via SH2 domain dimerization after phosphorylation (23Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). An Eps15 tetramer could interact with up to four AP-2 adaptor complexes, through a contact between the known binding site in region III and the α-ear domain of the AP-2 complex. The dimensions of the tetrameric Eps15 dumbbell put certain constraints on how it could be positioned within a clathrin coat (Fig. 5 C). Assuming that at least two AP-2 binding sites are satisfied, one at each end of the tetramer, and that region III is close to the heads, then the AP-2 complexes would be separated by at least 17–18 nm. The distance between two vertices in the coat is similar (24Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Heuser J. Kirchhausen T. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1985; 92: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), at 15.5 to 16 mm (26Vigers G.P. Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since Eps15 is located preferentially at the rims of coated pits (7Tebar F. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Ericsson M. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28727-28730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it is possible that it facilitates the recruitment of APs to the edges of the growing lattice and even that it influences the type of facet (pentagon or hexagon) that forms, defining the local curvature of the coated pit. Other parts of Eps15 might be simultaneously used to recruit molecules that modulate the local properties of the lipid bilayer. We thank Dr. P. Di Fiore for the generous gift of the cDNA for Eps15. We also thank A. Jadhav and E. Ro for help during the construction of some of the expression vectors."

To investigate the function of calpain in T cells, we sought to determine the role of this protease in calcium-dependent signaling events. Subsequent to elevations in intracellular calcium concentrations induced by ionomycin or adherence to fibronectin, calpain activity translocated to the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction of T cells. In addition, stimulation of T cells with these agents initiated the proteolytic cleavage of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B by calpain. Enzymatic cleavage of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B occurs near the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting sequence and results in the generation of an enzymatically active form of the phosphatase. Furthermore, we show that both the native and the cleaved forms of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B interact with p130Cas in T cells. This interaction may serve to relocate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B to sites of focal contact resulting in potential interactions with substrates previously inaccessible to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated phosphatase.

Calpain (calcium-activated cysteine protease; EC 3.4.22.17) is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, yet its precise physiologic function in T cells remains to be determined.

Thus, calpain is implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization as well as signal transduction pathways in response to elevations in [Ca2+] i. This suggests that calpain has a crucial role in integrin-induced alterations in cellular physiology and function. Interaction of integrins with their ligands activates cellular signaling pathways and reorganization of the cytoskeletal system (20Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 21Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 22Sastry S.K.

An increase in [Ca2+] i represents one second messenger that is quantitatively altered as a consequence of these interactions. This would further suggest the possibility that calpain is activated by the rise in [Ca2+] i occurring as a consequence of integrins binding to their ligands. Indeed, there is evidence for this occurring in platelets (10Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J.

In lymphocytes, β1 integrins mediate important interactions with the ECM, yet the biochemical signals transduced to the intracellular biomolecular systems and pathways that modify T cell function are only now beginning to be elucidated (21Juliano R.L.

T cells express α4β1 and α5β1 integrins, which are the principal receptors for the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) (25Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G.A. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Engagement of these receptors with their appropriate ligand results in increased [Ca2+] i, suggesting a role for integrin-mediated calcium signaling in T cells (26Sjaastad M.D. Nelson W.J.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 1618-1627PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used a calcium ionophore, ionomycin (IONO), to investigate the role of calpain in integrin-mediated signaling pathways in T cells. Our studies indicate that calpain undergoes translocation and activation in response to elevations in [Ca2+] i resulting in proteolytic cleavage of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B). Moreover, we show that translocation and activation of calpain induces proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B in Jurkat T cells binding the ECM protein FN. In addition, PTP-1B associates with p130Cas in T cells. Cas may serve as a targeting protein to relocate the proteolytically modified PTP-1B to sites of cell contact resulting in potential interactions with substrates previously inaccessible to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated form of the PTPase. Thus, we describe a novel signaling pathway in T cells that may be involved in integrin-mediated signaling cascades.

Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.22 μm; Costar, Cambridge, MA), probed with the indicated primary antibody, and followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody of the appropriate specificity. Immunoreactivity was determined using the ECL chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). T cells or Jurkat T cells (4 × 106) in a final volume of 400 μl of RPMI 1640 were stimulated as described under Immunoblotting. After stimulation, cells were pelleted and lysed with 100 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (detergent soluble fraction) was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet (detergent insoluble fraction) was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. These fractions were transferred to a 96-well plate (round bottom, Costar) and 100 μm calpain substrate (N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, Sigma) added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and mean fluorescence measured on a Cytofluor plate reader (excitation: 360 nm, emission: 460 nm). Cells (10–20 × 106 cells/sample) stimulated as indicated were subsequently lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, lysates were precleared with either protein A- or G-agarose by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with 2–4 μg of rabbit anti-PTP-1B, goat anti-PTP-1B, or rabbit anti-p130Cas for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were isolated by addition of protein A- or G-agarose (1–2 h at 4 °C), washed extensively with lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and solubilized by boiling for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation of insoluble fractions was performed as described above after suspension in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and brief sonication. The eluted proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Jurkat T cells (20 × 106) in a final volume of 1 ml RPMI 1640 were unstimulated or stimulated with IONO (1 μm) for 10 min and lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer without sodium orthovanadate as described above. Lysates (soluble fraction) were transferred to fresh tubes and the insoluble fraction was resuspended in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer. PTP-1B immunocomplexes were isolated as described above, washed 4 times in phosphatase assay buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)), and resuspended in 60 μl of phosphatase assay buffer. The resulting samples were subjected to an immune complex phosphatase assay using protein tyrosine phosphatase assay kit #2 (Upstate Biotechnology) per manufacturer's directions. PTP-1B was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T cells with goat anti-PTP-1B, immunocomplexes were washed three times in calpain assay buffer (200 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 10 mm cysteine-HCl) and resuspended in the same buffer. Each 150-μl reaction contained either 1 unit of calpain I or calpain II (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm each EDTA and EGTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were placed at 30 °C, and CaCl2 (1 mm) was added to initiate the reaction. Aliquots (25 μl) were removed at the indicated times, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Culture plates (6-well, Costar) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) per well. Plates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature, and washed three times in diphosphate-buffered saline. Jurkat T cells (5 × 106) in a final volume of 1.5 ml RPMI 1640 were added to each well in the presence of PMA (50 ng/ml), and the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Plates were warmed rapidly in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C for 30 min, cells harvested and counted. Samples were adjusted to equal cell numbers and analyzed for calpain activity or by immunoblot analysis as described. Experiments were done to quantitate calpain activity and translocation in T cells stimulated with various agents. T cells were stimulated with IONO and/or PMA, lysed, separated into soluble (cytosolic) and insoluble (membrane/cytoskeletal) fractions and assayed for calpain activity. In resting T cells, calpain activity was readily detectable in the soluble fraction, but very little activity was associated with the insoluble fraction (Fig.1), suggesting that this protease is predominantly a cytosolic protein under resting conditions. However, T cells or Jurkat T cells (data not shown) stimulated with IONO alone or with PMA had a decrease in calpain activity in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1a), but a corresponding increase in calpain activity was associated with the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1b). Stimulation of T cells with IONO resulted in approximately a 5-fold increase in calpain activity associated with the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction. Conversely, stimulation of T cells with PMA alone did not alter calpain activity associated with either cellular fraction nor did PMA synergize with IONO. The increase in calpain activity induced by IONO stimulation of T cells requires extracellular Ca2+ because chelation of extracellular Ca2+ ions by EGTA inhibited IONO induced increase in calpain activity associated with either fraction (Fig. 1a, b). Furthermore, thapsigargin, which depletes intracellular stores of Ca2+, failed to alter calpain activity in T cells (data not shown). The specificity of the calpain assay was shown by the addition of the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, to isolated cellular fractions (Fig. 1) or by pre-incubation of T cells with calpeptin prior to the addition of stimuli (data not shown). Further experiments were done to determine potential substrates for calpain in stimulated T cells. Jurkat T cells were stimulated with PMA and IONO, IONO alone, or PMA alone, cell lysates prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with appropriate monoclonal antibodies. One protein of interest that underwent proteolytic modification in response to PMA and IONO, IONO alone, but not PMA alone, was PTP-1B (Fig.2 a). In nonstimulated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2, lane 1), PTP-1B migrated as a 50-kDa band corresponding to the full-length form of the phosphatase. However, IONO stimulation of T cells induced the appearance of a modified form of PTP-1B that showed increased electrophoretic mobility and an apparent molecular weight of 42-kDa (Fig. 2 a, lane 3). This modification of PTP-1B was inhibited by calpeptin (Fig.2 b, lane 3) or by EGTA implicating the action of calpain (Fig. 2 b, lane 4). Furthermore, cleavage of PTP-1B was rapid and dose-dependent with the appearance of the cleaved form of PTP-1B within 1 min after IONO stimulation of Jurkat T cells and T cells (Fig. 3,a and b, lane 2) and at concentrations as low as 50 nm (Fig. 3 c, lane 6). These results clearly indicate that conditions that induce calpain activity are also associated with the proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B in IONO-stimulated T cells.Figure 3Calpain cleavage of PTP-1B in IONO-stimulated T cells is rapid and dose-dependent. Jurkat T cells (a) or T cells (b) were unstimulated (lane 1) or stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) and IONO (1 μm) (lanes 2–8) for the indicated times at 37 °C. Calpeptin (100 μm, lane 8) was added 15 min prior to stimulation. Jurkat T cells (c) were stimulated with IONO at the indicated concentration (Conc.) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting. The nitrocellulose membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTP-1B mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The following experiments were done to determine whether calpain I or calpain II is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B. PTP-1B was immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T cells and used as a substrate for either calpain I or calpain II. Initially, PTP-1B migrated as a 50-kDa protein corresponding to the full-length form of the phosphatase (Fig. 4, a and b, lane 1). However, after the addition of calcium to initiate calpain I or calpain II proteolytic activity, PTP-1B migrated as a 42-kDa protein (Fig. 4, a and b, lanes 2–4). These in vitro results are identical to the calpain-catalyzed cleavage of PTP-1B observed after stimulation of T cells with IONO. Cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain was also extremely rapid in that no full-length PTP-1B was detectable within 1 min of calpain activation. These results indicate that PTP-1B is a substrate for both calpain I and calpain II. PTP-1B is a ubiquitously expressed 50-kDa nontransmembrane PTP that localizes to the ER via a 35-amino acid C-terminal hydrophobic-targeting sequence (29Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 30Woodford-Thomas T.A. Rhodes J.D. Dixon J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This orients the N-terminal enzymatic domain of PTP-1B toward the cytosol and would restrict the number of substrates to which PTP-1B has access. Proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain in IONO-stimulated T cells resulted in a 42-kDa form of the phosphatase. To evaluate at which terminus calpain modifies PTP-1B, Jurkat T cells were stimulated with IONO, lysates were prepared, and immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies specific for either the N or C terminus of the phosphatase. The 42-kDa cleaved form of PTP-1B was recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 4–22 mapping at the amino terminus of PTP-1B (Fig. 5 a, lane 2), but not by polyclonal antibodies directed against amino acids 387–405 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of the phosphatase (Fig.5 b, lane 2). These data indicate that the 42-kDa form of PTP-1B was a result of calpain cleaving the phosphatase near the ER-targeting C-terminal sequence. Next experiments were done to determine the cellular location and enzymatic activity of PTP-1B in IONO-stimulated Jurkat T cells. PTP-1B was immunoprecipitated from the soluble and insoluble fractions obtained from stimulated T cells and subjected to an immune complex phosphatase assay. Aliquots from each sample were removed and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The results revealed that most of the 42-kDa PTP-1B was found in the detergent soluble fraction, as well as a small fraction of the 50-kDa intact form of the phosphatase (Fig.6, insert). The presence of the intact phosphatase in the soluble fraction is probably the result of disruption of the ER membrane, although it is possible that a fraction of intact PTP-1B localizes to sites other than the ER in T cells. The enzymatic activity of PTP-1B associated with the soluble fraction increased 2-fold in IONO-stimulated cells and corresponded to the increased PTP-1B protein content associated with this fraction resulting from calpain catalyzed cleavage (Fig. 6). Conversely, PTP-1B activity associated with the insoluble fraction was slightly higher in unstimulated cells as compared with IONO-stimulated cells, corresponding to decreased PTP-1B associated with this fraction as a result of calpain modification (Fig. 6). Total phosphatase activity was increased in IONO-stimulated cells as compared with unstimulated cells suggesting the cleaved form of PTP-1B (42-kDa) exhibited increased enzymatic activity as a result of proteolytic cleavage. These experiments show that calpain cleaves PTP-1B near the C terminus, resulting in a soluble enzymatically active form of the phosphatase. Notably, a small fraction of the 42-kDa form of PTP-1B was found consistently to associate with the insoluble fraction after IONO stimulation of Jurkat T cells or T cells (Fig. 6, insert and data not shown). Association of the 42-kDa form of PTP-1B with the insoluble fraction suggests translocation to the plasma membrane or the cytoskeleton allowing the phosphatase to interact with potential substrates. Thus, proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain in response to increased [Ca2+] i may modify the substrate specificity of the phosphatase by altering intracellular localization. Experiments were done to determine whether intact or cleaved forms of PTP-1B associated with p130Cas. PTP-1B was immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated or IONO-stimulated T cells or Jurkat T cells and precipitates examined for the co-precipitation of p130Cas (Fig.7). Anti-PTP-1B immunoprecipitates contained an approximately 110-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular weight of p130Cas in T cells (31Petruzzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and it is recognized by anti-p130Cas antibodies. This band was not observed in control precipitates (Fig. 7, lane 1) and migrates in a manner similar to p130Cas present in T cell lysates (Fig. 7, lane 6). Furthermore, p130Cas was co-precipitated with anti-PTP-1B from unstimulated (Fig. 7,lanes 2 and 4) and IONO-stimulated (Fig. 7,lanes 3 and 5) cells, but anti-PTP-1B precipitates from IONO-stimulated cells co-precipitated less p130Cas than that observed in resting cells. These data suggest that PTP-1B and p130Cas interact in T cells. However, these experiments do not address whether this association is maintained after the proteolytic modification of PTP-1B by calpain. To determine whether the cleaved 42-kDa form of PTP-1B can interact with p130Cas, reverse co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Anti-p130Cas immunoprecipitates from unstimulated (Fig. 8, lane 2) or IONO-stimulated (Fig. 8, lane 3) Jurkat T cells contain a predominant band of 50-kDa. However, immunoprecipitates obtained using irrelevant antibody (Fig. 8, lane 1) of the same isotype also contain a band of the same molecular weight. We believe that the reagents used in protein visualization were detecting the immunoglobulin heavy chain used in immunoprecipitating p130Cas, thus, masking any 50-kDa form of PTP-1B that co-precipitates with p130Cas. Importantly, anti-p130Cas immunoprecipitates from IONO-stimulated cells contained an additional protein of 42-kDa that was recognized by anti-PTP-1B antibodies (Fig. 8, lane 3). This band was not present in isotype-matched irrelevant antibody immunoprecipitates of IONO-stimulated T cells (Fig. 8, lane 1) or in anti-p130Cas immunoprecipitates of unstimulated T cells. Thus, PTP-1B interacts with p130Cas in resting T cells, and this interaction can be maintained in response to cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain. Because integrin-mediated signaling events are associated with increased [Ca2+] i (26Sjaastad M.D. Nelson W.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Weismann M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), we determined if adhesion of T cells to the ECM protein FN would induce calpain translocation and proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B. Jurkat T cells were stimulated with PMA and adhered to poly-l-lysine or FN coated plates. Cells plated on poly-l-lysine displayed very little calpain activity associated with the insoluble fraction (Fig. 9). However, Jurkat T cells adhering to FN displayed a marked increase in calpain activity associated with this fraction. Immunoblot analysis of Jurkat T cell lysates plated on poly-l-lysine contained predominantly the full-length 50-kDa form of PTP-1B (Fig.10, lane 1). PMA-activated Jurkat T cells adhering to FN triggered the cleavage of PTP-1B (Fig.10, lane 2), and pretreatment with calpeptin (Fig. 10,lane 3) inhibited the FN-induced proteolytic modification of PTP-1B. These results indicate that T cell interaction with FN is sufficient to induce the translocation of calpain and the proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain.Figure 10Adherence of PMA-stimulated Jurkat T cells to fibronectin induces proteolytic modification of PTP-1B. Jurkat T cells (5 × 106) were incubated on poly-l-lysine- (lane 1) or FN-coated (lanes 2 and 3) culture plates in the presence of PMA (50 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Calpeptin (100 μm) was added to appropriate samples prior to plating on fibronectin (lane 3). Cells were harvested from each well and cell numbers were equalized prior to analysis by immunoblotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTP-1B mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results show that integrin-mediated increases in [Ca2+] i in T cells activate calpain and translocate it to the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction. This observation supports the findings that a sustained increase in [Ca2+] i in Jurkat T cells and T-lymphoblasts occurs after adherence to the ECM protein FN (27Weismann M. Guse A.H. Sorokin L. Broker B. Frieser M. Hallmann R. Mayr G.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1618-1627PubMed Google Scholar). Our results further show that the binding of Jurkat T cells to FN induces calpain translocation and cleavage of PTP-1B. Collectively these data suggest a novel calcium signaling pathway in T cells that is contingent upon calpain activation and the cleavage of PTP-1B and its interaction with p130Cas. In T cells, calcium acts as an important second messenger regulating cell shape, motility, and function (32Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 584-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Negulescu P.A. Drasieva T.B. Kahn A. Kerschbaum H.H.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Although calcium-linked signaling is involved in integrin-mediated signal transduction, the mechanism(s) is obscure (20Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 26Sjaastad M.D. Nelson W.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results begin to define this mechanism by linking increases in T cell [Ca2+] i occurring after IONO stimulation or adherence to FN with the activation of calpain and its subsequent translocation to the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction. Furthermore, stimulation of T cells with these substances causes calpain-induced proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B, resulting in a 42-kDa enzymatically active form of the phosphatase as a result of C-terminal truncation. Interestingly, PTP-1B can be cleaved by calpain I and calpain II, both of which are present in T cells (37Deshpande R.V. Goust J.-M. Banik N.L. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PTP-1B normally associates with the ER membrane via a C terminus-targeting sequence, whereas the catalytic domain is located near the N terminus (29Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 30Woodford-Thomas T.A. Rhodes J.D. Dixon J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain results in the loss of the ER-targeting sequence and potential relocalization of the 42-kDa phosphatase to sites of focal contact. Our observations support this by showing that activated T cells bound to immobilized FN activate calpain resulting in the proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B. This is consistent with the fact that calpain can associate with membranes, cytoskeleton, as well as sites of focal contact after appropriate stimulation of cells (5Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y. Ohno S.

In support of this is the finding that calpain cleaves PTP-1B in response to platelet aggregation that is dependent on the αIIbβ3 integrin (38Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of proteolytic modification of PTP-1B by calpain in nucleated cells and further suggests the presence of a novel integrin-mediated calcium signaling pathway in T cells. Although PTP-1B can regulate cell cycle progression (39Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F.G.B. Franza Jr., B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), as well as insulin receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathways (40Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 95: 1680-1685Crossref Scopus (686) Google Scholar), the function and potential substrates of this protein tyrosine phosphatase remain elusive. PTP-1B does not contain either Src homology 2 or Src homology 3 domains that often mediate protein-protein interactions involved in multiple signaling pathways. However, PTP-1B does contain two polyproline-rich segments at amino acids 301–315 and 386–397 that have the consensus sequences (PXXPX(R/K)) for class II Src homology 3-binding proteins (42Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Liu et al. (42Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) recently reported that the class II Src homology 3 binding domain of p130Cas binds the more N-terminal polyproline-rich region of PTP-1B in vitroand in the v-crk transformed fibroblast cell line 3Y1. Our results show not only an association between PTP-1B and p130Cas in resting T cells and Jurkat T cells, but that p130Cas associates with both the 50-kDa native form and the 42-kDa calpain-cleaved form of PTP-1B. However, IONO stimulation of T cells markedly decreases the amount of p130Cas that co-precipitates with PTP-1B. These data indicate that the PTP-1B·p130Cas complex dissociates after cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain. This may occur subsequent to relocalization of the complex to sites of focal contact, resulting in potential interactions of PTP-1B with substrates previously inaccessible to the ER bound phosphatase. The p130Cas protein contains several consensus sequences known to mediate protein-protein interactions, including a Src homology 3 domain, a polyproline-rich region, and multiple potential Src homology 2 binding domains. The unique structure of this docking protein suggests it participates in integrin-mediated signal transduction by acting as a platform for the assembly of multimeric protein complexes (43Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In support of this, p130Cas undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to β1 integrin stimulation and also localizes to sites of focal contact between cells and the ECM (44Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the PTP-1B·p130Cas complex is involved is unclear; however, the association of PTP-1B and p130Cas suggests a potential regulatory role in the formation of multimeric complexes by regulating the phosphorylation levels of p130Cas. Integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to ECM proteins is temporally regulated (25Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G.A. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Integrins expressed on resting T cells exist in a low avidity state; after activation of the cells a high avidity state is induced by “inside-out” signaling (47Shimizu Y. Shaw S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2292-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 48Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, integrins are targets for functional regulation, permitting cellular adhesiveness to be modulated in response to extracellular signals. Phosphorylation of proteins is involved in transmembrane-signaling events and cytoskeletal reorganization. In this respect, protein tyrosine phosphatases have been implicated in modulating the integrity of focal contacts (49Turner C.E. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11938-11944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Retta S.F. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Defilippi P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 2295-2299PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin-mediated calcium mobilization is involved in β1 integrin activation and regulation (52Hartfield P.J. Greaves M.W. Camp R.D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1993; 196: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 53Sjaastad M.D. Angres B. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The activation of calpain in these cells is dependent on the increase in [Ca2+] i. The translocation of calpain activity and the proteolytic cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain occurs after T cell adherence to the ECM protein FN as well as stimulation of these cells with IONO. Cleavage of PTP-1B by calpain causes the relocalization of the 42-kDa form of the phosphatase from the ER to sites of focal contact via its association with p130Cas. This would allow PTP-1B to interact with potential substrates previously inaccessible to the ER-localized phosphatase, and mediate “inside-out” signaling events involved in the regulation of β1 integrin function, cytoskeletal assembly, and ultimately cell behavior. Not only may p130Cas be an in vivo substrate for PTP-1B, but it also may serve as a targeting protein to relocate the calpain cleaved form of PTP-1B.

https://openalex.org/W2144907562,"The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) promote cell cycle transitions in mammalian cells by phosphorylation of key substrates. To characterize substrates of the G1and S phase cyclin-CDK complexes, including cyclin D1-CDK4, cyclin D3-CDK4, cyclin D3-CDK6, cyclin E-CDK2, and cyclin A-CDK2, which are largely undefined, we phosphorylated T-47D breast cancer cell nuclear lysates partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography with purified baculovirus expressed cyclin-CDK complexes. A comparison of the substrates that were phosphorylated by the different cyclin D-CDKs revealed some common as well as specific substrates. Hence, cyclin D1-CDK4 specifically phosphorylated a 38-kDa protein while cyclin D3-CDK4 specifically phosphorylated proteins of 105, 102, and 42 kDa. A 24-kDa protein was phosphorylated by both complexes. Cyclin D3-CDK6 exhibited similar substrate preferences to cyclin D3-CDK4, phosphorylating the 105- and 102-kDa proteins but not the 24-kDa protein. Hence, both the cyclin D1 and D3 as well as CDK4 and CDK6 subunits can confer substrate specificity on the overall cyclin D-CDK complex. Cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylated a greater number of substrates than the cyclin D-CDKs, ranging in size from 10 kDa to over 200 kDa. Twenty-two substrates were common to both complexes, while six were specific for cyclin A-CDK2 and only one protein of 34 kDa was specific for cyclin E-CDK2. These studies indicate that cyclins E and A modulate the specificity of CDK2 and have demonstrated substrates that may be important for the specific roles of these cyclin-CDKs during G1 and S phase progression. Protein sequencing of one of the cyclin-CDK substrates characterized in this study identified this protein as nucleolin, a previously characterized CDC2 (CDK1) substrate, thus indicating the utility of this approach in identifying cyclin-CDK targets. These results show that both the cyclin and CDK subunits can regulate the substrate specificity of the overall cyclin-CDK complex and have demonstrated numerous substrates of D-, E-, and A-type cyclin-CDK complexes potentially involved in regulating transit through the G1and S phases of the cell cycle.

Cell division in higher eukaryotes is regulated by the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MQ, Mono Q; MS, Mono S; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol. Active CDKs consist of a protein kinase subunit, catalytic activity of which is dependent on association with a regulatory cyclin subunit (1Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 195-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells both the kinase and cyclin subunits consist of families with numerous members, including cyclins A–H and at least eight different kinases (2Grana X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). The association of different kinase subunits with different cyclin subunits controls progression through different stages of cell division. Therefore, following mitogenic stimulation, the D-type cyclins in association with either CDK4 or CDK6 are the first complexes activated and are important for progression during the G1phase of the cell cycle (3Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Subsequently, transition through G1 into S phase is controlled by cyclin E in association with CDK2 (4Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), followed by cyclin A association with CDK2 controlling S phase progression (5Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Cyclin A-CDC2 is active during the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and finally, transition throughout mitosis is regulated by cyclin B activation of CDC2 (6King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Although cyclin binding is required for activation of the kinase subunit of the complex, other means of modulating the activity of cyclin-CDKs also exist. Hence, the activity of the different CDKs can also be controlled by both activating and inhibitory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key residues on the CDK subunit (7Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar), as well as the binding of inhibitory proteins (8Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 143-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Apart from their roles during normal cellular proliferation, emerging evidence indicates that perturbations of genes involved in cell cycle progression contributes to oncogenesis in numerous tissues (9Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Since cyclin-CDKs play pivotal roles in cell proliferation and their aberrant expression or activity can contribute to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis, an important issue relates to the substrate targets of these complexes. Although the activities of the different cyclin-CDK complexes throughout the different phases of the cell cycle has been characterized relatively well, the downstream targets of most of these complexes have not been extensively defined, particularly for the G1 and S phase cyclin-CDKs. The necessity for different cyclin-CDK complexes during the different stages of the cell cycle is related to the distinct functions required during these stages, such as transcription during the G1phase, DNA synthesis during S phase, and chromosome condensation during mitosis. Results to date indicate that differential substrate phosphorylation confers the cell cycle stage-specific functions of the different cyclin-CDKs. For example, both cyclin A-CDC2 and cyclin B-CDC2 phosphorylate histone H1, but only cyclin A-CDC2 phosphorylates the retinoblastoma related protein, p107, indicating that the cyclin subunit plays an important role in substrate specificity (10Peeper D.S. Parker L.L. Ewen M.E. Toebes M. Hall F.L. Xu M. Zantema A. van der Eb A. Piwnica-Worms H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To date, a number of substrates have been identified for the mitotic cyclin B-CDC2 complexes, including histone H1, nuclear lamins, caldesmon, vimentin, myosin regulatory light chain, protein phosphatase 1, p60 src, casein kinase II, nucleolin, numatrin, and DNA polymerase α (11Litchfield D.W.

Unlike the mitotic substrates described for the cyclin B-CDC2 complexes, relatively few substrates for the G1 and S phase-specific cyclin D-, E-, and A-associated kinases have been described. In mammalian cells, there are three D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) that associate with either CDK4 or CDK6 and are expressed differentially in different cell types (3Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific action of the different D type cyclins is exemplified by studies showing that generation of mice lacking cyclin D1 results in a lack of normal mammary gland development in adult female mice as well as retinopathy (15Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner h. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 16Fantl V. Stamp G. Andrews A. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking cyclin D2 are infertile due to lack of development of ovarian granulosa cells (17Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that a major substrate of D-type cyclins, in association with either CDK4 or CDK6, is the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) (3Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 18Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar). This protein is a tumor suppressor, which inhibits progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle by sequestering transcription factors such as members of the E2F family. Phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin D-CDKs and cyclin E-CDK2 results in release of E2F from pRb, which can then bind to the promoters and thereby activate the transcription of genes required for progression through G1 into S phase, such as DNA polymerase α, thymidylate synthase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, ribonucleotide reductase, cyclin A, and CDC2 (19DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Studies using either a human sarcoma cell line or mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for pRb have shown that cyclin D1 is not required for progression through G1 phase in the absence of functional pRb, indicating that at least in these cells pRb is the major and possibly only target of cyclin D1 (20Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, in myoblasts, cyclin D1 prevents myogenic differentiation as a result of cyclin D1-mediated MyoD-phosphorylation independent of pRb phosphorylation, suggesting that these effects are mediated by phosphorylation of other cyclin D1-CDK substrates (21Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study using a yeast two-hybrid screen has identified a Myb-like transcription factor termed DMP1, which is phosphorylated by all three D-type cyclins in association with CDK4in vitro, suggesting a role for cyclin D-CDK phosphorylation in transcriptional control (22Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These emerging studies suggest that other substrates unrelated to pRb are important for cyclin D-CDK action. Cyclin E-CDK2 also phosphorylates pRb during the G1-S phase transition (23Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). However, unlike cyclin D1, cyclin E is required for G1-S phase progression in pRb-deficient cells (24Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), suggesting that cyclin E-CDK2 phosphorylates other substrates. Evidence for the existence of other cyclin E-CDK2 substrates comes from a recent study, which showed that both cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylate the transcriptional regulator Id2, thus inhibiting its ability to negatively regulate the binding of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors to DNA, which are critical for regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (25Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 also associate with and phosphorylate a p300 coactivator, thereby modulating the regulation of NF-κB transcriptional activation (26Perkins N.D. Felzein L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In addition to common substrates of these two cyclin-CDKs, specific substrates for cyclin A-CDK2 but not cyclin E-CDK2 have been demonstrated, including DP-1 and p53. Cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylation of DP-1, a component of the E2F-1·DP-1 transcription complex inhibits the transcriptional activity of this complex (27Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1772-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 28Xu M. Sheppard K. Peng C. Yee A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8240-8431Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 increases the sequence-specific DNA binding ability of this protein (29Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This differential substrate specificity of cyclins A and E in association with CDK2 is attributable to sequences in the cyclin box and C terminus of the cyclin subunits (30Horton L.E. Templeton D.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several approaches for identifying substrates of protein kinases have been utilized previously. An oriented degenerate peptide library has been used to successfully determine the primary sequence preference for cAMP-dependent kinase as well as cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDC2 (31Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Other workers have employed the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify protein kinase substrates (22Hirai H. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel approach of using a λ phage cDNA expression library for solid phase phosphorylation of proteins expressed and bound to nitrocellulose filters has been used to identify substrates of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (33Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to investigate endogenous substrates of the D-, E-, and A-type cyclin-CDK complexes to gain an insight into potential substrates involved in the regulation of G1-S phase progression, as well as the substrate preferences of these complexes. We utilized the approach of phosphorylating endogenous proteins from partially purified T-47D breast epithelial cell nuclear lysates with exogenous cyclin-CDKs. This work unveiled numerous in vitro substrates and revealed that substrate specificity can be modulated by both the cyclin and CDK subunit. One of the characterized substrates was identified as nucleolin, a previously described cyclin-CDK substrate (34Peter M. Nakagawa M. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating the applicability of this approach in identifying cyclin-CDK substrates and suggesting that many of the substrates demonstrated in this study may have important roles during cell cycle progression. Recombinant human cyclin proteins D1, D3, E, and A were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) insect cells. For this purpose, a GST cassette was amplified from pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 5′-GGACTGCAGATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTG-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CCTAGATCTCAGTCATGCACGATGAATTCC-3′ as the reverse primer. The product was digested with PstI and BglII and cloned into the PstI and BamHI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), resulting in the pVL1392-GST transfer vector. Subsequently, all cyclin DNA sequences were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites of this vector in-frame with the GST coding sequence. To create suitable subcloning ends, the different cyclin cDNAs were either first subcloned into pUC18 or pBluescript, or amplified by PCR as follows. Cyclin D1 cDNA was excised from plasmid pD1-H124 by partial NcoI and complete HindIII digestion and subcloned into XbaI-digested pUC18. Cyclin D3 cDNA was excised from plasmid pD3-H347 by NruI and BsaHI digestion and subcloned into SmaI-digested pBluescript II KS+. Cyclin E cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′-CCTGGATCCATGAAGGAGGACGGCG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CCTGAATTCACGCCATTTCCGGCCC-3′ as reverse primer. A 2.5-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment containing the cyclin E cDNA excised from pBluescript KS− served as template. Cyclin A cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′-CCTGGATCCATGTTGGGCAACTCTGCGC-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CCTGAATTCTTACAGATTTAGTGTCTCTGG-3′ as reverse primer and cyclin A cDNA inserted in pGEM4Z plasmid as template. All cyclins were subsequently digested with BamHI and EcoRI and the respective fragments subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pVL1392-GST. Recombinant baculoviral CDKs were generated with 6 histidine residues in the N terminus. A pVL1392–6xHistidine cassette was first generated into which different CDKs were subcloned to create a pVL1392–6xHistidine-CDK baculoviral transfer vector. The pVL1392–6xHistidine cassette was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-GATGCACCATCACCATCACCATGGATCCCCGGGAATTCTGACTGACT-3′ and 3′-ACGTCTACGTGGTAGTGGTAGTGGTACCTAGGGGCCCTTAAGACTGACTGACTAG-5′ and ligating into PstI- and BamHI-digested pVL1392, resulting in destruction of the BamHI site of pVL1392. This cassette encodes for 6 histidine residues and BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites. Subsequently, all CDK cDNA sequences were ligated in frame into the BamHI and EcoRI sites immediately 3′ to the 6-histidine coding sequence. CDK2 cDNA was amplified using 5′-CCTGGATCCATGGAGAACTTCCAAAAGGT-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CCTGAATTCAGAGTCGAAGATGGGGTA-3′ as reverse primer, CDK4 cDNA was amplified using 5′-CCTGGATCCATGGCTACCTCTCGATATGAG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CCTGAATTCACTCCGGATTACCTTCATC-3′ as reverse primer, and CDK6 cDNA was amplified using 5′-CCTGGATCCATGGAGAAGGACGGCCTG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-CCTGAATTCAGGCTGTATTCAGCTCCG-3′ as reverse primer. The plasmids containing CDK open reading frames used as templates for amplification were pBluescript (CDK2 and CDK6) and pcD-PSK-J3 (CDK4). Following amplification by PCR, all CDKs were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and subcloned into the pVL1392–6xHistidine vector. The identity of all final constructs was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. The recombinant transfer vectors (2 μg) were mixed with 0.5 μg of Baculogold viral DNA (PharMingen) and co-transfected into Sf9 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 5 days at 27 °C, recombinant viruses were isolated and four single clones obtained by plaque assay. Each clone was used to infect Sf9 cells to express recombinant proteins, and the clone expressing the greatest level of protein as judged by immunoblotting was amplified and used for subsequent work. Sf9 cells were co-infected with the recombinant GST-cyclin and 6xHis-CDK recombinant baculoviruses and incubated at 27 °C for 3 days. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm vanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were freeze-thawed twice and then sonicated (two 10-s bursts). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated in wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. The glutathione-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was then incubated with fresh glutathione agarose two more times for 1 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-agarose beads from the three separate incubations were pooled and washed five times with ice-cold wash buffer. The bound GST-cyclin-CDK complexes were eluted by adding wash buffer containing 15 mm reduced glutathione, pH 7.5, followed by centrifugation to pellet the glutathione-agarose beads. After five elution steps, the eluates were pooled, concentrated to approximately 500 μl and equilibrated in wash buffer using Centricon-30 (Amicon). The final concentrated cyclin-CDK enzymes were then stored in aliquots at −80 °C. T-47D breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 μg/ml human insulin and 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (35Musgrove E.A. Hamilton J.A. Lee C.S.L. Sweeney K.J.E. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For preparation of nuclear lysates, 20 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks of T-47D cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, removed from the flask using a cell scraper, and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 5 × packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and harvested again by centrifugation. The cells were then resuspended in 3 × packed cell volume of ice-cold hypotonic buffer and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, followed by homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The nuclei were collected by centrifuging the homogenate at 3,300 × g, 15 min, 4 °C. The packed nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and frozen in liquid N2. The nuclei were then freeze-thawed twice prior to sonication (two 10-s bursts). The nuclear homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C, and the supernatant collected as the nuclear lysate. The T-47D nuclear lysate was diluted 20-fold with ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing 0.3 mm PMSF, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Sartorius), and then loaded onto a Mono Q (HR 5/5) anion-exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was developed with a 200–600 mm linear NaCl gradient at 0.5 ml/min, and 30 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions where the majority of the protein eluted were combined into three separate pools: fractions 8–14 (pool 1), fractions 15–20 (pool 2), and fractions 21–27 (pool 3). Each pool was diluted by the addition of 30 ml of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) and then loaded onto a Mono S (HR 5/5) cation-exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was developed with a 240–600 mm linear NaCl gradient for pool 1, or 300–600 mm NaCl gradient for pools 2 and 3 at 0.5 ml/min, and 30 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Eluted fractions were named according to which column they eluted from, followed by which fractions the protein(s) eluted in and the pool that was loaded on the column. For example, fraction 4 eluting off the Mono S column after loading pool 1 was named MS 4 (pool 1). Phosphorylation of partially purified T-47D nuclear fractions separated by ion-exchange chromatography was performed in a final volume of 30 μl consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of cyclin-CDK. Prior to phosphorylation of nuclear fractions, the different cyclin-CDK complexes were normalized for activity using GST-pRb773–928 as substrate to ensure equivalent amounts of kinase activity were added. GST-pRb773–928 was prepared as described previously (36Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 3 × sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) stop buffer (187 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 6% SDS, 15% β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were then heated at 100 °C for 2 min, centrifuged in a microcentrifuge, and 25 μl was loaded and electrophoresed on a 20-cm length 7–15% linear sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) (Protean II; Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, the proteins were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, dried under vacuum, and exposed to Kodak Biomax MR x-ray film for autoradiography. For protein sequencing of cyclin-CDK substrate protein, P105, the protein was first separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained, and, after drying, the polyacrylamide gel strip containing the protein was excised. The protein was eluted from the polyacrylamide and then passively absorbed onto polyvinylidene difluoride prior to amino acid sequencing on a Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer (model 494). To investigate substrates of the G1 and S phase cyclin-CDK complexes, we constructed recombinant baculoviruses expressing N-terminal GST fusion proteins for cyclins D1, D3, E, and A as well as N-terminal 6-histidine-tagged proteins for CDKs 2, 4, and 6. Following co-infection of insect Sf9 cells with the appropriate combination of cyclin and CDK, the cyclin-CDK complexes were purified using glutathione-agarose resin. The expression of each cyclin and CDK was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). To evaluate the catalytic activity of the different combinations of cyclin-CDK complexes, we utilized a recombinant GST-pRb fusion protein comprising the C-terminal fragment of the retinoblastoma gene product (GST-pRb773–928), which contains phosphorylation sites for CDK2 and CDK4 (37Kitagawa M.

Co-infection of Sf9 cells with both the cyclin and CDK subunits, followed by purification of the complexes with glutathione-agarose, resulted in catalytically active complexes for all the combinations of cyclin-CDKs, namely cyclin D1-CDK4, cyclin D3-CDK4, cyclin D3-CDK6, cyclin E-CDK2, and cyclin A-CDK2 (Fig.1). There was no phosphorylation of GST alone, indicating that the kinase complexes were phosphorylating the pRb773–928 portion of the fusion protein, and as expected purified monomeric cyclin or CDK subunit alone resulted in no kinase activity toward GST-pRb773–928 (data not shown). In the absence of added GST-pRb773–928, autophosphorylation of both the cyclin and CDK subunits was observed (Fig. 1, lanes 1–5). Interestingly, the level of autophosphorylation of the GST-cyclin D3 subunit (65 kDa) and the associated CDK4 (35 kDa) or CDK6 (40 kDa) subunits was significantly greater than the GST-cyclin D1 subunit (65 kDa) associated with CDK4 (35 kDa) (Fig. 1), even though the level of the protein subunits in these complexes was similar as judged by Coomassie staining. Furthermore, both cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 exhibited a significantly greater specific activ"

It has been shown that the DnaA protein which binds to DnaA boxes upstream of the TrfA-binding sites (iterons) cannot by itself form an open complex, but it enhances the formation of the open complex by TrfA (Konieczny, I., Doran, K. S., Helinski, D. R., Blasina, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20173). In this study an in vitroreplication system is reconstituted from purified TrfA protein and E. coli proteins. With this system, a specific interaction between the DnaA and DnaB proteins is required for delivery of the helicase to the RK2 origin region. Although the DnaA protein directs the DnaB-DnaC complex to the plasmid replication origin, it cannot by itself activate the helicase. Both DnaA and TrfA proteins are required for DnaB-induced template unwinding. We propose that specific changes in the nucleoprotein structure mediated by TrfA result in a repositioning of the DnaB helicase within the open origin region and an activation of the DnaB protein for template unwinding.

The initiation of replication of a plasmid that is able to be maintained in a diverse group of bacteria (broad host range) is considerably less well understood than the initiation of replication of other prokaryotic replicons. It is of particular interest to determine the nature of the interactions between a broad host plasmid origin of replication, the plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein and the host specific replication proteins that are responsible for initiating replication. The broad host range plasmid RK2 requires for its replication in Escherichia coli an origin of replication (oriV) (Fig. 1) and a plasmid encoded initiation protein (TrfA) (1Figurski D.H.

In addition, RK2 replication in E. coli requires the host specified proteins DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DNA gyrase, DnaG primase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and SSB (6Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E.

A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the E. coli DnaA protein binds to four DnaA consensus sequences that potentially can form a cruciform structure within the RK2 origin (8Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this same study it was found that the TrfA initiation protein in the presence of HU produces an opening of a set of 13-mers located in the A + T-rich region of the RK2 oriV. The DnaA protein enhances and/or stabilizes this open complex formation, but cannot on its own form an open complex. Initiation of replication at the E. coli chromosome origin (oriC) has been studied extensively and the formation of several distinct nucleoprotein complexes has been described (9Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. II. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar). The initial step involves binding of the DnaA protein to DnaA boxes localized within oriC (10Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A.

Cross-linking, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and monoclonal antibody interference studies have shown that a physical interaction between the DnaA protein and the helicase is required for loading (19Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An E. coli prepriming complex consisting of oriC DNA and the DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and HU proteins can be isolated in vitro (19Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two stages of prepriming complex formation at oriC have been described (9Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. II. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar). During the first stage (prepriming complex I) helicase is loaded but is not active. It has been proposed that the activation of prepriming complex I is the result of the repositioning of the helicase leading to the formation of prepriming complex II. At this stage helicase can unwind template DNA thus allowing the priming reaction to occur. This study utilizes an in vitro replication system reconstituted from purified components to address the mechanism of helicase loading during the initiation of plasmid RK2 replication in E. coli and the role of the DnaA and TrfA proteins in this process. We show that not unlike that observed with oriC(19Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a specific interaction between DnaA and DnaB is required for helicase delivery to the initiation complex. The TrfA protein activates the DnaB helicase for template unwinding presumably by forming a specific nucleoprotein structure and an open complex at the A + T-rich region of the origin. These results are discussed in the context of the broad host range replication properties of the RK2 plasmid. Purified proteins were used for the various assays. DnaB (21Arai K. Yasuda S. Kornberg A.

The RK2 oriV DNA replication reaction was established with purified components similar to those required for in vitro replication of oriC (26Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A.

Reactions were assembled on ice and then incubated at 32 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by placing on ice and adding 1 ml of 0.1m sodium pyrophosphate in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Total nucleotide incorporation (picomoles) was measured by liquid scintillation counting after filtration onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. The reaction mixture for oriC plasmid replication was assembled as described for RK2 oriV DNA replication except that the TrfA protein and RK2 oriV plasmid DNA were omitted and the reaction was supplemented with 200 ng of pBSoriC DNA. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C. Column gel filtration was used to isolate RK2 prepriming complexes. The reaction mixture (total volume 100 μl: 40 mm Hepes/KOH pH 8.0, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% sucrose, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) contained the amount of proteins equivalent to four standard in vitro replication reactions except that SSB, DNA gyrase, primase, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, CTP, GTP, UTP, dNTP's, and the ATP regeneration system were omitted. The TrfA-33 254D/267L protein was used instead of His6-TrfA 254D/267L and HU protein (100 ng) was added. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 32 °C. After incubation the reactions ware run through a Sepharose CL-4B column (0.5 × 12 cm), equilibrated at room temperature with the incubation buffer and 0.01% Brij 58. Fractions (80 μl) were collected and a portion of each (40 μl) was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by a semi-dry protein transfer and immunoblot with rabbit antisera specific against DnaA, TrfA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins. Bound rabbit antibody was detected by a colorimetric reaction with an alkaline phosphatase conjugate goat anti-rabbit IgG. The replication reaction assay was similar to the RK2 in vitro replication reaction reconstituted with purified components described above. A 20-μl portion of each fraction collected from the Sepharose CL-4B column was supplemented by the addition of a mixture (10 μl) containing all other replication components in a standard replication buffer. After 30 min incubation at 32 °C, reactions were stopped by placing on ice followed by the addition of 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate and 10% trichloroacetic acid. The total nucleotide incorporation (picomoles) was measured as described above. The reaction mixture is identical to the RK2 in vitro replication system reconstituted with purified components except that the DnaG primase and DNA Pol III holoenzyme components were omitted. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C and the reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA and SDS at a final concentration of 10 mm and 2%, respectively, followed by 2 min incubation at 65 °C. Sucrose and bromphenol blue were then added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 10 and 0.05%, respectively. The mixture was then analyzed on a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer (0.09m Tris borate, 0.002 m EDTA). The samples were electrophoresed at 25 V for 20 h and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide solution. The RK2 in vitro replication system described in this study was established with highly purified proteins. As for the RK2 in vitro replication system using E. coli crude extract (6Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the replication mixture contained an ATP regeneration system, rNTPs, dNTPs, and MgOAC. The RK2oriV replication template was the supercoiled DNA form of plasmid pTJS42 which contains a 393-bp RK2 minimal origin (Fig.1). The replication reaction demonstrated a stringent dependence on oriV containing DNA and the copy-up mutant His6-TrfA 254D/267L protein (TableI). The largely dimeric His6-TrfA protein was unable to support replication in the purified system (data not shown). The monomer form of TrFA is the active form for binding to the iterons at the RK2 origin (5Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Perri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and since the His6-TrfA 254D/267L protein is largely in the form of a monomer, 2A. Toukdarian and D. R.

The HU protein was found to be dispensable for RK2 replication in the purified system although a previous study showed it was essential for open complex formation in the absence of the DnaA protein (8Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Replication of intact RK2 plasmid or RK2 mini-replicons in E. coli is DnaA dependent (6Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the reconstituted RK2 replication system there is a stringent requirement for the E. coli DnaA protein (Table I). It is of interest that the amount of DnaA protein required for E. coli oriC and RK2oriV replication in vitro differs (Fig.2). In comparison to oriC, RK2oriV replication in vitro requires at least 5-fold less DnaA protein for maximum DNA synthesis (with molar ratios approximately 1:75 for oriC:DnaA and 1:15 for oriV:DnaA). This may indicate differences in affinity for the DnaA boxes in the two origins, or differences in the nucleoprotein structures of oriV-DnaA and oriC-DnaA. Unlike with oriC (29Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10625-10632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yung B.Y.M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1282-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) an excess of DnaA protein at the highest concentrations used did not result in an inhibition of oriVreplication (Fig. 2). The kinetics of the replication reactions with supercoiled pTJS42 or pBSoriC DNA as templates were not found to be significantly different (data not shown). The initiation of replication of E. coli oriC and bacteriophage λ DNA requires that the helicase be delivered to and loaded on ssDNA to convert the open complex into an activated prepriming complex (18Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Mallory J.B. Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13297-13307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the initiation of replication of oriC DNA in vitro, DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins interact and associate with oriC to form a prepriming complex (32Ogawa T. Baker T.A. van der Ende A. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3562-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33van der Ende A. Baker T.A. Ogawa T. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3954-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a specific interaction between DnaB and DnaA proteins is critical for the formation of this complex and helicase delivery at oriC (19Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of helicase delivery to oriV during the initiation of RK2 replication, prepriming complexes were formed and then isolated by gel filtration using a Sepharose CL-4B column. When the DnaB helicase was incubated with supercoiled oriV plasmid DNA (pTJS42) and the DnaC, DnaA, and TrfA proteins, all four proteins were detected along with pTJS42 DNA in the column void volume (Fig.3 A). When oriVtemplate DNA was incubated only with DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins, and not with the TrfA protein, again DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC were found in the void volume with pTJS42 DNA. Although under the conditions of this experiment these three proteins together do not open pTJS42 at the origin in the absence of the TrfA protein (8Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it is clear that DnaB and DnaC form a prepriming complex with the DnaA protein and oriV DNA (Fig. 3 B). When both the SSB and HU proteins were added to the preincubation mixture containing oriV and the DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins, the DnaB helicase and DnaC proteins were once again observed in the void volume along with the DnaA protein (data not shown). In contrast, when the experiment was carried out in the absence of the DnaA protein but in the presence of the TrfA protein and under conditions that promote origin opening by the TrfA protein (i.e. the presence of HU), we did not observe DnaB helicase and DnaC in the void volume, indicating that the TrfA protein by itself cannot deliver the helicase to the RK2 origin (Fig. 3 C). Finally, incubation of only DnaB and DnaC with the supercoiled pTJS42 DNA did not result in the presence of DnaB or DnaC in the void volume (Fig. 3 D). We also tested the Sepharose CL-4B void fractions for replication activity. The complex of oriV, TrfA, DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC found in the void volume (Fig. 3 A) was active under complete in vitro replication assay conditions, i.e. when gyrase, DnaG primase, SSB, Pol III holoenzyme, rNTPs, and dNTPs were added (Fig. 4). The recovery of replication activity was estimated to be about 80% of the activity of an equivalent amount of incubation mixture that was not subjected to Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. The in vitro replication activity found for the prepriming complex formed from oriVand the DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins without the TrfA protein (Fig. 4) was approximately at a background level, i.e. similar to that obtained when both the TrfA and DnaA proteins were not present during the formation of the complex. 3I. Konieczny and D. R. Helinski, unpublished observation. The relatively high background level observed for the complex formed in the absence of the TrfA protein was probably due to degradation of a portion of the template during the course of the experiment and, consequently, nonspecific nucleotide incorporation. The subsequent addition of TrfA to the complex formed in the absence of TrfA restored replication activity to a level approaching that seen with the complex formed from all four proteins (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the TrfA protein is still required for replication even after the helicase is delivered to the RK2 origin and that the formation of a prepriming complex that includes oriV, DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC can precede the formation of a TrfA-dependent open complex. We determined the kinetics of the oriV in vitro replication reaction using different preincubation conditions. Preincubation of TrfA, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and gyrase proteins with pTJS42 in the presence of HU and SSB resulted in an approximately 2-min advance in the time for significant nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 5). Presumably under these conditions, a prepriming complex consisting of oriV, TrfA, DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC is formed. By comparison, a 1-min time difference was observed when either the TrfA or the DnaA protein was omitted during the preincubation period (Fig. 5). These results may indicate that the DnaA and TrfA proteins act independently in the formation of a prepriming complex during the preincubation period. Several template unwinding assays have been developed for measuring helicase unwinding activity (17Baker T.A. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

In this study the agarose TBE-electrophoresis method was used to determine unwinding of the supercoiled pTJS42 DNA template (35Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S.

The formation of an electrophoretically distinct form of DNA, designated FI*, has been shown to be produced as a result of the unwinding activity of a helicase in the presence of gyrase and SSB proteins (18Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This covalently closed circular DNA exhibits more rapid electrophoretic mobility and, as shown by electron microscopy (18Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), is extensively single-stranded. Using RK2 in vitroreplication conditions including ATP, TrfA, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, gyrase, HU, and SSB proteins, we observed unwinding of a substantial fraction of the oriV supercoiled DNA template molecules as determined by the appearance of the FI* form of pTJS42 DNA (Fig.6). Not unlike that found for the initiation of oriC and λ DNA replication, the formation of extensively unwound DNA is gyrase dependent (18Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In comparison to unreacted supercoiled pTJS42 DNA, and not unexpectedly, we observed that this extensively single-stranded reaction product was very sensitive to nuclease P1 digestion (data not shown). Omission of TrfA or DnaA protein resulted in a failure to produce the fast migrating FI* form (Fig. 6). Thus, DnaB helicase activity on the oriV template requires both the DnaA and TrfA proteins. These results suggest that helicase remains inactive in the prepriming complex consisting of oriV, DnaA, DnaC, and DnaB and that activation requires the TrfA protein. A specific interaction between the DnaA and DnaB proteins has been shown to be required for helicase loading at oriC (19Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interference of this protein-protein interaction using monoclonal antibody M7 results in an inhibition of in vitro oriC replication (19Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the M7 antibody on RK2 replication in vitro. OriVreplication was inhibited by approximately 50% with 50 ng and 90% with 200 ng of M7 antibody (Fig. 7). These results indicate a similar requirement for a specific DnaA-DnaB interaction for the formation of an RK2 prepriming complex as was found for the E. coli replication origin. Altering the order of addition of the M7 monoclonal antibody and the DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and TrfA proteins during the assay for helicase activity allowed us to obtain information as to what stage the antibody was inhibitory. When M7 antibody was added to the incubation mixture with DnaA but before DnaB, DnaC, and TrfA were added, we observed an approximately 75% inhibition of the formation of the FI*form (Fig. 8). This is consistent with the M7 antibody blocking the DnaA-DnaB interaction and, therefore, delivery of the helicase to the template. In contrast, the addition of M7 after incubation of DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and TrfA had little or no inhibitory effect on helicase activity (Fig. 8). Surprisingly, when the order of addition was changed and the TrfA protein was added at the last step together with M7 antibody, we also observed reduced helicase activity (Fig. 8). This result may indicate instability of the prepriming complex involving the DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins in which case the M7 monoclonal antibody can continue to compete with the DnaB protein for binding to DnaA even if added after the addition of both the DnaA and DnaB proteins to the supercoiled plasmid DNA template. If this is the case, then when the TrfA protein is present along with the DNA, DnaB, and DnaC proteins, the DnaA-DnaB interaction is stabilized or the DnaB protein is repositioned on the template so that it no longer is associate with the DnaA protein. We have demonstrated that plasmid RK2 can be replicated in vitro using purified proteins if the plasmid-specific initiation protein, TrfA, is added. This reconstituted replication system, similar to the system described previously for oriC(26Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 138-190Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19334-19340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus, can support the replication of supercoiled RK2oriV and E. coli oriC DNA. In the case of RK2oriV replication, we found that a much lower concentration of the DnaA protein is required for maximum replication of oriV when compared with oriC (Fig. 2). We also found that the excess of DnaA protein at the highest concentrations used in our experiments inhibited oriC replication"

SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions showed that the norrin expressed had an apparent <i>M</i> <sub>r</sub> = 14,000 and was present only in cell lysates and the extracellular matrix. Under nonreducing conditions, most of the norrin in the extracellular matrix was oligomers that contained up to ∼20 monomers. One of the major extracellular species of norrin under reducing conditions after cross-linking of norrin oligomers with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate had an apparent <i>M</i> <sub>r</sub> = 28,000, consistent with covalent cross-linked dimers. Thus the covalently cross-linked dimers are key structural components of norrin oligomers. By site-directed mutagenesis, the codon for half-cystine 95 in norrin was changed to one encoding alanine. The norrin C95A found in the extracellular matrix of cells transfected with this mutant was the size of dimers, indicating that half-cystine 95 is involved in oligomer formation. The corresponding half-cystine residue in human prepro-von Willebrand factor is also involved in interchain disulfide bond formation, which is consistent with the sequence identity of the half-cystine residues in norrin and part of the half-cystine residues in a disulfide-rich domain of von Willebrand factor. Replacement of valine at residue 60 in norrin by glutamic acid, a mutation found in humans with a severe type of Norrie disease, results in a considerable reduction (50%) in the amount of norrin in the extracellular matrix of transfected COS-7 cells. Replacement of arginine at residue 121 by glutamine, which is associated with a less severe type of Norrie disease, results in a reduction in the amount of norrin R121Q in the extracellular matrix (26%). These studies suggest that norrin is a secreted protein that forms disulfide-bonded oligomers that are associated with the extracellular matrix upon secretion from cells. Moreover, the disulfide-rich motif of norrin and prepro-von Willebrand factor promotes interchain disulfide bond formation among polypeptides in which it is found."

To further understand the cellular mechanisms responsible for this adaptive response, the Glut1 transcription rate and mRNA stability were assessed. Nuclear run-on assays revealed 2.0- and 2.4-fold increases in Glut1 transcription rates in glucose oxidase- and xanthine/xanthine oxidase-pretreated cells, respectively. Glut1 mRNA stability was increased with both treatments compared with the control (t½ = 7.8 ± 1.3, 6.0 ± 2.0, and 2.4 ± 0.5 h, respectively). The serum-responsive element and AP-1 (but not the cAMP-responsive element) showed increased binding capacity following oxidative stress. Both activation of AP-1 binding and elevation of Glut1 mRNA were prevented by cycloheximide. The involvement of enhancer 1 of the Glut1 gene was demonstrated using transfected 293 cells. Induction of Glut1 mRNA in response to oxidative stress differed from its activation by chronic insulin exposure as demonstrated by the ability of rapamycin to inhibit the latter without an effect on the former.

Glucose transport is a rate-limiting step in the metabolism of many cell types and therefore in energy production (1Furler S.M. Jenkins A.B. Storlien L.H. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E337-E347PubMed Google Scholar). This process is mediated by a family of transmembrane glycoproteins differing in their kinetics and tissue distribution (2Mueckler M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 6-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the six known glucose transporters, Glut1 is the ubiquitous glucose transporter. Its gene expression is regulated in different cell types by various stimuli. These include hypoglycemia (3McMahon R.J. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12094-12099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), hypoxia (4Bashan N. Burdett E. Hundal H.S. Klip A. Am. J.

Physiol. 1995; 269: E1052-E1058PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that under such stress conditions, energy requirements are increased, and induction of the Glut1 isoform is therefore instrumental in cellular adaptation. However, the cellular mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear.Increased oxidative stress has been suggested to play a role in many pathophysiological conditions. Altered transcriptional regulation of various genes, postulated to be mediated by transcriptional activation factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB, is a well described cellular reaction to oxidative stress (9Pahl H.L.

We observed that exposure of both cell types to prolonged low grade oxidative stress caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in Glut1 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels, resulting in increased basal glucose transport activity.Recently, the transcriptional regulation of the Glut1 gene has been shown to involve regulatory elements that include a promotor and two enhancers (21Murakami T.

These elements include potential binding sites for various transcriptional activation factors, including the serum-responsive element (SRE), 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum-responsive element; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element; Xan/XO, xanthine/xanthine oxidase; Glc/GO, glucose/glucose oxidase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; kb, kilobase pairs. 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum-responsive element; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element; Xan/XO, xanthine/xanthine oxidase; Glc/GO, glucose/glucose oxidase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; kb, kilobase pairs. the cAMP-responsive element (CRE), and AP-1-binding sites (TRE). In this study, we aimed to elucidate the cellular mechanisms responsible for Glut1activation in response to oxidative stress. We demonstrate that following exposure to oxidative stress, the Glut1 gene transcription rate is enhanced, concomitant with increased stability of mRNA transcripts. This transcriptional activation is at least partly mediated by enhancer 1 of the Glut1 gene and requires de novo protein synthesis. Increased binding activity of AP-1 and SRE to DNA is observed in response to oxidation and may mediate Glut1 transcriptional activation in response to oxidative stress.RESULTSA 24-h exposure of L6 myotubes to 50 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase in medium containing 5 mm glucose (Glc/GO) or to 20 milliunits/ml xanthine oxidase in the presence of 50 μmxanthine (Xan/XO) caused an ∼2-fold increase in glucose transport activity attributed to elevated levels of Glut1 protein (TableI). Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, prevented elevation of both glucose transport activity and Glut1 protein expression (20Kozlovsky N. Rudich A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 23: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that reactive oxygen species stimulated the de novo synthesis of this glucose transporter. The activation of glucose transport activity was reversible when, following treatment, cells were further exposed to fresh medium. Full recovery to pretreatment 2-deoxyglucose uptake activity was observed after 40 h, with a t½ of 17.5 h. Steady-state mRNA levels were increased to a similar extent by oxidation (Table I), suggesting an increased transcription rate of the Glut1 gene and/or increased mRNA stability. To address this question, nuclear run-on and mRNA stability assays were performed, respectively. Following treatment with oxidant-generating systems for 24 h, transcriptionally active nuclei were isolated from cells, and in vitro transcription was performed for 30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This was followed by Northern dot-blot analysis using an empty plasmid or a plasmid containing the full-length cDNA probes of either Glut1 or β-actin. The empty plasmid did not react with nascent mRNA (data not shown). However, nuclei isolated from cells exposed to either Glc/GO or Xan/XO had a higher Glut1 transcription rate compared with the control, with no similar effect observed on the transcription rate of β-actin (Fig. 1). Densitometric analysis of three independent experiments indicated 2.0- and 2.4-fold increases in Glut1 transcription rates in Glc/GO- and Xan/XO-pretreated cells, respectively, compared with control cells. This suggests a specific effect of oxidative stress on the transcriptional regulation of the Glut1 gene. Under the same conditions,Glut1 mRNA stability was evaluated. Following a 24-h exposure to Glc/GO or Xan/XO, cells were further incubated with the mRNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D. The half-life of pre-existing Glut1 mRNA was increased in both Glc/GO- and Xan/XO-treated cells compared with control cells (t½ = 7.8 ± 1.3, 6.0 ± 2.0, and 2.4 ± 0.5 h, respectively; p < 0.05 for each treatment versus the control) (Fig.2). These results suggest that both increased transcription rate and mRNA stability may account for the increased steady-state Glut1 mRNA content following oxidation.Table IEffect of a 24-h exposure to Glc/GO or Xan/XO on 2-deoxyglucose uptake and Glut1 protein and mRNA content in L6 myotubesGlc/GOXan/XO2-DG1-a2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose. uptake (-fold of control)2.65 ± 0.43 (10)2.2 ± 0.7 (8)Glut1 protein (arbitrary units)2.1 ± 0.4 (5)1.95 ± 0.2 (5)Glut1 mRNA (arbitrary units)2.3 ± 0.7 (4)2.0 ± 0.3 (4)1-a 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose.

To assess the involvement of these regulatory elements in oxidative stress-induced Glut1 gene activation, plasmids containing the Glut1 promotor and the CAT reporter gene either alone or with enhancer 1, enhancer 2, or both (Fig.3) were transfected into 293 cells. These cells exhibited an ∼50% increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake activity following exposure to Xan/XO (data not shown). To control for CAT activity, cells were simultaneously transfected with plasmids containing β-galactosidase as described above. Cells were then exposed for 3 h to Xan/XO, after which both CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Cells containing a plasmid with the promotor alone (pGT1-1.3CAT) did not exhibit an increased CAT/β-galactosidase activity ratio following oxidation compared with control cells. A maximal 4.2 ± 0.25-fold increase in the CAT/β-galactosidase activity ratio was observed following oxidation of cells transfected with a plasmid containing both enhancers (pGT1-1.3CAT/Bxb/SBb). This effect could be attributed mainly to enhancer 1, as a 2.4 ± 0.21-fold increase in the CAT/β-galactosidase activity ratio was observed in cells containing the pGT1-1.3CAT/SBb plasmid, without a similar effect in cells transfected with a plasmid containing enhancer 2.Figure 3Effect of Xan/XO on the CAT/β-galactosidase activity ratio in 293 cells transfected with plasmids containing various regulatory regions of the Glut1 gene. 293 cells were transfected with plasmids containing β-galactosidase and the Glut1 promotor region either alone or with enhancer 1, enhancer 2, or both as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following a 3-h exposure to Xan/XO, CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Enhancer 1 of the Glut1 gene has been shown to contain consensus sequences for the binding of various transcriptional activation factors.

To further evaluate the respective role of the AP-1 transcription factor in Glut1gene transcriptional activation, steady-state mRNA levels of c-fos and c-jun were measured in L6 myotubes exposed to Glc/GO or Xan/XO. As shown in Fig.5 A, c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels were increased following oxidation, without a similar effect on β-actin mRNA levels (data not shown). The ability of cycloheximide to inhibit both AP-1 activation and Glut1 mRNA elevation following oxidation was assessed. Fig. 5 B demonstrates that activation of AP-1 DNA-binding activity was inhibited when L6 myotubes were exposed to oxidative stress in the presence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide. Under similar conditions, the elevation of Glut1 mRNA levels was prevented by cycloheximide (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these results confirm the role of de novo protein synthesis in both activation of AP-1 DNA-binding activity and induction of the Glut1 gene in response to oxidative stress.Figure 5Effect of Xan/XO, Glc/GO, and cycloheximide on c-fos, c-jun, and Glut1 mRNA levels and AP-1 binding activity. A, L6 myotubes were treated for 24 h with Xan/XO or Glc/GO, after which total RNA was extracted and analyzed for the amount of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, cells were incubated as described for A in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), followed by a gel electromobility shift assay as described in the legend to Fig. 4.

This transcription factor has been shown to mediate Glut1 transcriptional activation in response to insulin exposure (22Todaka M. Nishiyama T. Murakami T. Saito S. Ito K. Kanai F. Kan M. Ishii K. Hayashi H. Shichiri M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29265-29270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In L6 myotubes, chronic insulin-induced elevation of Glut1 protein is inhibited by rapamycin, a pp70S6K inhibitor, but not by the expression of a Ras dominant-negative mutant (28Taha C. Mitsumoto Y. Liu Z. Skolnik E.Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24678-24681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In accordance, the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade was not involved in increasing the expression of Glut1 in L6 myotubes in response to oxidative stress, as no increase in immunoreactive active mitogen-activated protein kinase was observed (data not shown). To compare the insulin-induced activation of the Glut1 gene with the effect of oxidative stress,Glut1 mRNA levels and glucose transport activity were evaluated following exposure to Glc/GO or insulin for 24 h in the absence and presence of rapamycin. L6 myotubes were incubated with either 100 nm insulin or Glc/GO for 24 h in the absence and presence of 30 or 100 ng/ml rapamycin. Under these conditions, cell viability as detected by protein recovery and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test was not affected. Fig. 6 Bdemonstrates that rapamycin did not exert an effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake activity of control cells. However, 100 ng/ml rapamycin totally prevented insulin-induced elevation of Glut1 mRNA levels (Fig. 6 A) and glucose transport activity (Fig.6 B). In contrast, no similar effect of rapamycin was observed on oxidative stress-induced elevation of Glut1mRNA levels and glucose transport activity. Taken together, these results provide evidence that oxidative stress-induced Glut1transcriptional activation is distinct from Glut1 activation by insulin.Figure 6Rapamycin prevents insulin-induced (but not Glc/GO-induced) Glut1 mRNA and glucose transport activation. L6 myotubes were treated without or with 100 nm insulin or 25 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase for 24 h in the absence (□) or presence of 30 ng/ml (▨) or 100 ng/ml (▪) rapamycin (rapa), a pp70S6K inhibitor.Glut1 mRNA levels (A) and glucose transport activity (B) were assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are a representative Northern blot performed three times and the means ± S.E. of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake values obtained from four independent experiments, each performed at least in duplicate. *, p< 0.01 compared with the control without rapamycin; †,p < 0.01 compared with chronic (chr.) insulin in the absence of rapamycin; #, p < 0.001 compared with chronic insulin in the absence of rapamycin.G/GO, Glc/GO; prot., protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWith accumulating evidence suggesting a significant role for oxidative stress in diverse pathophysiological conditions, there is increasing interest in understanding cellular response to oxidative stress. The ability of oxidative stress to alter gene expression has been shown in many cell types and in various experimental models (10Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar,11Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13422-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the expression of the glucose transporter isoform Glut1 is increased in both L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to oxidative stress, resulting in increased glucose transport and metabolism (19Rudich A. Kozlovsky N. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E935-E940PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kozlovsky N. Rudich A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 23: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These are believed to provide the elevated energy required for the recruitment of repair and antioxidant defense mechanisms. In this study, we investigated further the cellular mechanisms by which Glut1 expression is increased following exposure to oxidative stress.The results of this study indicate that in L6 myotubes, the increase in steady-state Glut1 mRNA levels following oxidative stress can be attributed to both an enhanced Glut1transcription rate, as determined by nuclear run-on assay (Fig. 1), and increased mRNA stability (Fig. 2). The fact that steady-state Glut1 mRNA levels are increased by not more than 2–2.5-fold (Table I) suggests that additional mechanisms may be involved in regulating Glut1 mRNA levels following oxidative stress. For example, increased mRNA stability may develop as a consequence of an earlier occurring enhancement of the transcription rate if mRNA degradation mechanisms become rate-limiting.A combination of increased mRNA stability and elevated transcription rate in the regulation of this glucose transporter gene expression has been observed in clone 9 cells exposed to the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor sodium azide (29Shi Y. Liu H. Vanderburg G. Samuel S.J. Ismail-Beigi F. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21772-21778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Increased stability of Glut1 mRNA was reported in cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor α (7Szalkowski D. White Carrington S. Berger J. Zhang B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1474-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and phorbol ester and glucose deprivation (30Boado R.J. Pardridge W.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2290-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), whereas an increased transcription rate without an alteration in mRNA stability was reported in ARL 15 cells treated with thyroid hormone (31Weinstein S.P. Haber R.S. Thyroid. 1993; 3: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Weinstein S.P. Watts J. Graves P.N. Haber R.S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The direct cellular mechanism responsible for elevated steady-state Glut1 mRNA levels in response to anoxia, iron chelators, malignant transformation, heat shock, and viral infection has yet to be determined. However, it appears that increasing Glut1 gene expression represents a common cellular response to various stress conditions, including oxidative stress, by mechanisms that result in transcriptional activation and/or stabilization of pre-existing mRNA transcripts. Alternative mechanisms to increase Glut1 protein content to enhance glucose flux may occur at the protein stability level.The transcriptional regulation of Glut1 in response to oxidative stress is mediated at least partly by enhancer 1 of the regulatory region of this gene (Fig. 3). Among the three transcription factors known to have a potential binding site on enhancer 1, AP-1 and SRE are shown to be activated in response to oxidative stress (Fig. 4), whereas CRE is not. While this excludes the direct or indirect (through the activation of another gene) involvement of CRE in Glut1transcriptional activation, the contribution of AP-1 or SRE activation to this process cannot be conclusively sorted out by this study. The dependence of this process on de novo protein synthesis is demonstrated by the ability of cycloheximide to inhibit elevation of Glut1 mRNA levels following oxidation. Under the same conditions, oxidative stress-induced AP-1 activation is also inhibited, which may provide circumstantial evidence for a direct or indirect role for AP-1 in Glut1 transcriptional activation following oxidative stress.H2O2 has been shown to increase cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation by altering the tyrosine kinase-to-phosphatase balance and was further demonstrated to exhibit insulinomimetic effects (33Heffetz D. Bushkin I. Dror R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2896-2902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wilden P.A. Broadway D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The effect of chronic exposure to insulin on Glut1 induction was studied using various experimental models. In L6 myotubes, the activation of Glut1following an 18-h exposure to insulin was inhibited by rapamycin, a pp70S6K inhibitor (28Taha C. Mitsumoto Y. Liu Z. Skolnik E.Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24678-24681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In NIH/3T3HIR3.5 cells transfected with hybrid genes containing the enhancer and promotor of the Glut1 gene, a 1-h exposure to insulin resulted in activation of SRE and enhancer 1 (22Todaka M. Nishiyama T. Murakami T. Saito S. Ito K. Kanai F. Kan M. Ishii K. Hayashi H. Shichiri M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29265-29270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the effect of chronic insulin with the effect of prolonged oxidative stress on Glut1 gene expression, we assessed the ability of rapamycin to prevent Glut1 activation. While rapamycin completely prevented the activation of glucose transport and Glut1 following chronic exposure to insulin, no similar effect on the induction of Glut1 in response to oxidative stress was observed (Fig. 6). Thus, the activation of Glut1 by prolonged low grade oxidative stress may not be identical to that exerted by chronic exposure to insulin.In conclusion, the cellular response of L6 myotubes to oxidative stress involves the transcriptional activation of the Glut1 gene, mediated at least partly by enhancer 1 of the Glut1 gene, and requires de novo protein synthesis. This effect may not be attributed to an insulinomimetic effect of H2O2. The respective role of various transcription factors including AP-1 and SRE in mediating this response requires further study.

One of them involves the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and controls the expression of ZmFer2 gene(s). Another pathway, ABA-independent, has been characterized in a de-rooted maize plantlet system and involves an oxidative step. The ZmFer1 maize ferritin gene is not regulated by ABA, and it is shown in this paper that the corresponding mRNA accumulates in de-rooted maize plantlets and BMS (Black Mexican Sweet) maize cell suspension cultures in response to iron via the oxidative pathway described previously. To investigate ZmFer1 gene regulation further, the BMS cell system has been used to develop a transient expression assay using a ZmFer1-β-glucuronidase fusion. Both iron induction and antioxidant inhibition of ZmFer1 gene expression were observed in this system. Using Northern blot analysis and transient expression experiments, it was shown that both okadaic acid and calyculin A, two serine/ threonine phosphatase inhibitors, specifically inhibit ZmFer1 gene expression. These data indicate that an okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase activity is involved in the regulation of the ZmFer1 ferritin gene in maize cells, and this activity is required for iron-induced expression of this gene.

Iron homeostasis needs to be controlled tightly in living cells because this element is both essential for important metabolic processes and potentially toxic (1Guerinot M.L. Yi Y. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Iron deficiency or overload leads to important physiological disorders in plant and animal cells. Iron toxicity is linked to the high reactivity of this transition metal with oxygen species and the hydroxyl radicals produced, which can damage all cell components (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J. Atlas of Science: Biochemistry. 1988; : 48-51Google Scholar). Therefore, free iron storage is a key step in the prevention of oxidative stress. Among the mechanisms controlling iron homeostasis, ferritins are a class of ubiquitous multimeric proteins able to store iron in a soluble and nontoxic form (3Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Injection of H-type ferritins into the cytoplasm of endothelial cells prevents H2O2-induced cytolysis (4Vile G.F. Tyrrell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14678-14681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proving that ferritin iron storage capacity can confer oxidative stress resistance. Ferritin synthesis is induced by iron excess, mainly at the translational level in mammalian cells (5Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), whereas a transcriptional control has been demonstrated in soybean cell suspension culture (6Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H.

Ferritin cDNAs and genes have been isolated from various plant species (6Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In maize, two mRNA subclasses have been identified, and the corresponding genes, named ZmFer1 and ZmFer2, have been cloned (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences corresponding to the open reading frames encoded by the ZmFer1 and ZmFer2 transcripts are highly similar, suggesting a common function for both subunits (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, promoter sequence analysis of the two genes reveals a high level of divergence (11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis of differential regulation of these ferritin genes. Iron overload of maize plantlets has been found to induce ferritin mRNA and subunit accumulation (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two transduction pathways involved in this response have been identified. The first one requires the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) 1The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; PP, protein phosphatase; OA, okadaic acid; CA, calyculin A; BMS, Black Mexican Sweet; MS medium, Murashige and Skoog medium; bp, base pair; GUS, β-glucuronidase; kbp, kilobase pair(s); IRE, iron-responsive element; IRP, iron-responsive protein. 1The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; PP, protein phosphatase; OA, okadaic acid; CA, calyculin A; BMS, Black Mexican Sweet; MS medium, Murashige and Skoog medium; bp, base pair; GUS, β-glucuronidase; kbp, kilobase pair(s); IRE, iron-responsive element; IRP, iron-responsive protein. as a cellular relay (12Lobréaux S. Hardy T. Briat J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and leads to ZmFer2 mRNA accumulation (11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No ZmFer1 transcript accumulation has been observed in response to exogenous ABA or abiotic stress (drought) known to raise cellular ABA concentrations (11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When de-rooted maize plantlets are incubated in iron citrate solution, a rapid accumulation of ferritin mRNA and subunits has been detected (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This response has even been observed in an ABA-deficient maize mutant, demonstrating that this activated pathway is ABA-independent. Ferritin mRNA accumulation in this de-rooted maize plantlet system in response to iron overload was inhibited in the presence of antioxidant agents such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This result suggests that an oxidative step occurs in this pathway, and this is supported by the fact that hydrogen peroxide treatment induced ferritin transcript accumulation. Whether ZmFer1 is regulated by iron through this ABA-independent pathway remained to be determined. Eukaryotic cells may elicit adaptative responses to environmental stresses by recruiting intracellular signal cascades, many of which involve reversible protein phosphorylations, controlled by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Physiological responses to various cellular stresses involve mitogen-activated protein kinases, in mammalian (14Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

In plants, cellular responses to some abiotic stresses (cold, drought, wounding, osmotic shock) might also be mediated by plant mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (21Seo S. Okamoto M. Seto H. Ishizuka K. Sano H. Ohashi Y. Science. 1995; 270: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 22Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N.S. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatases have also been shown to regulate some cellular signaling cascades in response to stress. In yeast, a calcineurin (PP2B) has been found to confer tolerance to salt stress (24Mendoza I. Quintero F.J. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23061-23067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and PPZ has been demonstrated to play a role in the maintenance of cell integrity (25Posas F. Casamayor A. Ariño J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as well as in the control of salt homeostasis (26Posas F. Camps M. Ariño J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis PP2C (ABI1) is required for stomatal closure, seed dormancy, and growth inhibition, indicating its key role in some of the transduction pathways involving ABA (27Leung J.

Recent insights into the role of protein phosphorylation in cellular signal transduction have been established by the use of drugs that are permeable to biological membranes and interact specifically with protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Among such pharmacological agents, okadaic acid (OA) and calyculin A (CA) are two potent inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A (30MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 31Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem.

Using these toxins, initial evidence for the involvement of PP1/2A activities was established for numerous cellular events in plants (33Smith R.D. Walker J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this paper, using Northern blot experiments and a transient expression assay, we demonstrate that ZmFer1 is the maize ferritin gene induced in de-rooted plantlets and cell suspension cultures, through the previously identified ABA-independent oxidative pathway. This iron-induced expression of ZmFer1 is inhibited in the presence of OA and CA, suggesting that a serine/threonine phosphatase is involved in the regulation of this gene. Maize plants (Zea mays var. M017) were grown hydroponically in iron-free medium as described previously (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After 7 days of iron starvation, plantlets were cut at the level of the collar, and stems were dipped into the various treatment solutions. Samples were harvested at various times after treatment, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Maize BMS (Black Mexican Sweet) cells were cultivated in the dark and with constant shaking at 70 rpm, in 100 ml of Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid culture medium as described (34Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar), containing macronutrients and vitamins purchased from Sigma. For 2-week subcultures, 10 ml of 15-day-old cell suspension was added to 90 ml of fresh medium. For iron-starved cell cultures, the subculture was carried out with 20 ml of the 15-day-old cell suspension added to 80 ml of iron-free fresh medium. Experiments were carried out using iron-starved cell suspensions, 1 week after subculture. For H2O2treatments, cells were grown in iron-containing medium, and cells were resuspended in fresh complete medium before the addition of H2O2. The iron citrate mixture for the induction of ferritin synthesis, NAC, reduced gluthathione (GSH), and H2O2 (Sigma) were prepared and diluted as described previously (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). OA (Biomol) and CA (Life Technologies, Inc.) were dissolved in ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively. To obtain accurate cell treatments when using OA over a concentration range, 500 μm OA solution (10% dimethyl sulfoxide) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. After treatments, cells were filtered and washed with a solution of 10 mm EDTA and 20 mm KCl, then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Total RNA, from frozen maize plantlets and BMS cells, was extracted using the guanidine method (35Logeman J. Shell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) with modifications (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA for each sample was electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose and formaldehyde gel (36Rosen K.M. Villa-Kermaroff L. Focus. 1990; 2: 23-24Google Scholar) and blotted onto a nylon filter (Hybond N, Amersham). Blotted RNA was hybridized with the probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The FM probe, which hybridizes to ferritin ZmFer1 and ZmFer2 transcripts, was a 620-bp SacI-StuI fragment from the FM1 cDNA (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The FM1 probe, which hybridizes specifically to the ZmFer1transcripts, was a 53-bp StuI-BclI fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of the ZmFer1 cDNA (11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S.

The FM2 probe corresponds to a 56-bp fragment of the ZmFer2cDNA 3′-untranslated region (11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Probe H1 corresponded to a maize H1 histone cDNA (37Razafimahatratra P. Chaubet N. Philipps G. Gigot C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1491-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C in the presence of 50% formamide (38Suty L. Moureaux T. Leydecker M.T. Teyssendier de la Serve B. Plant Sci. 1993; 90: 11-19Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After washing twice with 2 × SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and once with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C, the filters were autoradiographed at −70 °C using X-Omat films (Kodak). Total proteins were extracted from 0.2 g of frozen maize BMS cells as described previously (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total protein for each sample was electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide (15%) gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C). Ferritin subunit immunodetection was performed using polyclonal antibodies raised against maize seed ferritin (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and anti-rabbit IgG sheep immunoglobulins coupled to peroxidase (Biosys), as described previously (39Laulhère J.P. Lescure A.M. Briat J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10289-10294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pRD109 containing the β-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) fused to the maize histone H3C4 promoter and rice actin introns was a gift from R. DeRose (Rhône Poulenc Agrochimie, Lyon, France). The plasmid pAHC18 containing the luciferase reporter gene fused to the promoter, the 5′-untranslated region, and the first intron of the the maize ubiquitin 1 gene was a gift of Prof. P. Quail (UCLA, Berkeley). The 674-bp fragment SacI-ClaI from ZmFer1 gene, spanning exons 1–4, was subcloned into SacI-AccI-digested M13mp19, and single-stranded DNA was produced according to standard procedures (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce an NcoI site into the sequence corresponding to exon 3 using the Sculptor in vitromutagenesis system (Amersham) and the deoxyoligonucleotide 5′-GCTGAAAAGCCCATGGAGTAC-3′. Mutations were selected by sequencing using the T7 Sequencing kit (Pharmacia). The mutated fragment was excised from double-stranded M13mp19 using SacI-NcoI restriction enzymes and introduced into the corresponding sites of the pRD109 to obtain pSL3 and produce a translational fusion between exon 3 of the ZmFer1 gene and the uidA open reading frame encoding GUS. Then, a 1.9-kbp NsiI-SacI fragment from the ZmFer1gene was subcloned into PstI-SacI sites of pSL3 to produce the pSL5 construct (see Fig. 6 A). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the polyethylene glycol method (41Sadhu C. Gedamu L. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 20-21PubMed Google Scholar). Gold particles (Bio-Rad) were washed in 100% ethanol and resuspended in 50% glycerol at 130 μg/μl. For DNA coating of microcarrier, 6 μg of construct (pSL5 or pRD109) and 6 μg of the internal standard plasmid (pAHC18) were added to 25 μl of gold particles. Then, 32 μl of 2.5 mCaCl2 and 12.5 μl of 100 mm spermidine were added, mixed, and incubated for 5 min on ice. The DNA-carrier mix was centrifuged briefly, and then 64 μl of supernatant was removed. 2 μl of DNA-coated gold particles was used for each transformation. 8 days after subculture, 0.5 g of BMS cells cultured in the presence of 100 μm Fe-EDTA was filtered, and the cells on the filter paper were transferred to iron-free MS solid medium. After a 3-h incubation at 28 °C in the dark, cells were transformed with a helium biolistic device using 2 μl of DNA-microcarrier preparation. For bombardments, the particle gun was set to 25 mbar of vacuum, 4 bars of helium pressure, and the distance between the microcarrier and target cells was 21 cm. Transformed cells were transferred to 3 ml of iron-free liquid MS medium in six-well microplates and incubated overnight at 28 °C on a rotary shaker. If required, a 6-h incubation was performed before iron treatment in the presence of the appropriate inhibitor. Then when indicated, iron citrate was added. Cells were incubated subsequently under the same conditions for 24 h. For reporter gene activity detection, cells were washed in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and 400 μl of extraction buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added. After a 10-s sonication, lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, 4 °C, and supernatants were recovered. 20 μl of extract was used to measure the reporter gene activities using the GUS light kit (Tropix) and the luciferase assay system (Promega), with a luminometer (1203 Bio-Orbit, Turku, Finland). Results are expressed as relative light units corresponding to the ratio between the GUS (assay) and the luciferase (internal standard) activity. It has been previously demonstrated that iron overload of de-rooted maize plantlets leads to an increase of ferritin transcript abundance (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This response was shown to be mediated by an ABA-independent pathway because ferritin mRNA still accumulates in response to iron in the ABA-deficient maize mutant vp2. This pathway was defined as requiring an oxidative step because antioxidant agents inhibit the iron-induced accumulation of ferritin mRNA in this system. In this study, Northern blot experiments were performed using a probe called FM, which hybridized to all of the different subclasses of maize ferritin mRNA identified so far. However, using specific probes hybridizing specifically the ZmFer1 and ZmFer2subclasses of maize ferritin transcripts, it has been shown that in iron-treated hydroponic cultures of maize plantlets ZmFer1mRNA accumulates independently of ABA (11Fobis-Loisy I. Loridon K. Lobréaux S. Lebrun M. Briat J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine if in de-rooted plantlets the increased abundance of ZmFer1mRNA is stimulated in response to iron through the previously identified oxidative and ABA-independent pathway, Northern blot experiments were performed using the FM1-specific probe in this system (Fig. 1 A). As described previously (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a significant increase in ferritin mRNA level was detected using the FM probe when de-rooted plantlets were dipped into a 500 μm iron citrate solution (Fig. 1 A, FM probe). A transient accumulation was observed, reaching a maximum 3 h after the addition of iron and similar kinetics detected using the FM1-specific probe (Fig. 1 A, FM1 probe). In contrast, hybridizations using the FM2 probe revealed that no ZmFer2mRNA accumulated in response to the iron excess during the time course of the experiment (Fig. 1 A, FM2 probe). The iron treatment has no effect on the maize H1 histone mRNA (Fig.1 A, H1 probe). Therefore, iron overloading of de-rooted maize plantlets induces specifically the accumulation of ZmFer1 ferritin mRNA, and the level of ZmFer2mRNA remains undetectable. To determine if this increased abundance of ZmFer1 mRNA is sensitive to antioxidant agents, plantlets were pretreated for 3 h in 10 mm NAC or 1 mm GSH before a 3-h iron treatment (Fig. 1 B). Hybridizations using FM or FM1 probes, respectively, revealed that the iron-induced accumulation of ferritin mRNA was inhibited completely in the presence of NAC and partially diminished when plantlets were cotreated with GSH. These data are in agreement with the results obtained previously using the FM probe (13Lobréaux S. Thoiron S. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 443-449Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, no ZmFer2 mRNA accumulation was detected in response to an iron overload (Fig. 1 B, FM2 probe). Hybridizations using the H1 probe show that the H1 mRNA level is not affected in the presence of NAC or GSH (Fig. 1 B, H1 probe). Furthermore, it has been shown recently in Brassica napus seedlings that ferritin and acorbate peroxidase mRNA abundances were increased in response to iron with the same kinetics and dose dependence (42Vansuyt G. Lopez F. Inzé D. Briat J.F. Fourcroy P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Iron-induced accumulation of ascorbate peroxidase mRNA was independent of an ABA pathway and not affected by NAC treatment, whereas ferritin mRNA accumulation induced by an iron excess was blocked by NAC treatment in this system. Together these observations demonstrate that NAC treatment does not lead to a general inhibition of gene expression but rather to a specific inhibition of ZmFer1 mRNA accumulation in our system. Therefore, the ZmFer1 transcripts are the ferritin transcripts that accumulate in response to iron overload of de-rooted plantlets through the activation of the oxidative and ABA-independent pathway. To study further the iron-induced ZmFer1 mRNA accumulation, maize cell suspension cultures were chosen as model. Indeed, it has already been reported that plant cell suspension cultures provide a suitable cell system for the study of ferritin synthesis (6Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The cell system used in this study consists of nonphotosynthetic BMS maize cells. Cells were subcultured for 1 week in iron-free medium before iron treatment during the exponential growth phase. ZmFer1 transcripts were not detected in these cells before the iron treatment (Fig.2 A). When BMS cells were incubated in the presence of 500 μm iron citrate, an increased abundance of ZmFer1 transcripts was detected, reaching its maximum 24 h after iron treatment and decreasing at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 2 A). Similar kinetics of ferritin mRNA accumulation have been observed in iron-overloaded maize plantlet leaves (7Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ZmFer1 transcript accumulation was proportional to increasing iron citrate concentrations from 0 to 500 μm, supplied in the culture medium for 3 h (Fig.2 B). To determine if iron overload of maize cell suspension cultures leads to ferritin accumulation, total protein extracts from iron-induced BMS cells were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot, using an antibody raised against maize seed ferritin subunits. A very low level of ferritin subunits was detected in iron-starved cells (Fig. 2 C), consistent with previous observations using plants or soybean cell suspension cultures (6Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The addition of iron citrate led to an increase in the amount of ferritin subunits up until 72 h after the beginning of the treatment (Fig.2 C), whereas the ZmFer1 mRNA level reached its maximum 24 h after the addition of iron (Fig. 2 A). This discrepancy could be the result of the almost constitutive expression of the ZmFer2 gene in the BMS cell suspension cultures (data not shown). Such a deregulation of ABA responsive genes in cell suspension cultures has already been observed. 2M. F. Niogret and M. Pages, personal communication. Also, a post-translational effect of iron on ferritin stability has been evidenced in animal and plant cells (12Lobréaux S. Hardy T. Briat J.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Crichton R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 229: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 44Drysdale J.W. Shafritz D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 383: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the presence of the iron core inside the ferritin shell stabilizing the protein structure in vivo. Then, in iron-overloaded cells, ferritins translated from ZmFer2 mRNA would be stabilized by iron. The antibody used in our experiment does not allow discrimination of the two maize ferritin subunits (such an antibody is not available). Taken together, our results demonstrate that iron induces an increased abundance of ZmFer1 transcripts and ferritins in maize BMS cells. The results described above demonstrated the involvement of an oxidative pathway in ZmFer1 transcript accumulation in iron-treated de-rooted maize plantlets. To determine if the same pathway is activated by iron in maize cell suspension cultures, the effect of antioxidant and oxidant agents on ZmFer1 mRNA accumulation in BMS cells was investigated. When maize cells were pretreated for 3 h by an antioxidant such as NAC before a 3-h iron treatment, the increase in ZmFer1 transcript abundance was inhibited (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). This inhibition is specific to ZmFer1 transcripts as maize histone H1 mRNA abundance, which is not increased on"

https://openalex.org/W2014494306,"Three exons in the fibronectin primary transcript are alternatively spliced in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. One of these exons, EDA, has been shown previously by others to contain two splicing regulatory elements between 155 and 180 nucleotides downstream of the 3′-splice site: an exon splicing enhancer and a negative element. By transient expression of a chimeric β-globin/fibronectin EDA intron in COS-7 cells, we have identified two additional exonic splicing regulatory elements. RNA generated by a construct containing the first 120 nucleotides of the fibronectin EDA exon was spliced with an efficiency of approximately 50%. Deletion of most of the fibronectin EDA exon sequences resulted in a 20-fold increase in the amount of spliced RNA, indicative of an exon splicing silencer. Deletion and mutagenesis studies suggest that the fibronectin exon splicing silencer is associated with a conserved RNA secondary structure. In addition, sequences between nucleotides 93 and 118 of the EDA exon contain a non-purine-rich splicing enhancer as demonstrated by its ability to function in a heterologous context.

Higher eukaryotes have evolved alternative splicing as a common means of producing several different mRNAs and polypeptides from a single primary transcript (for review, see Ref. 1Smith C.W.J. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Transcripts that undergo alternative splicing can produce mRNAs and proteins with different structures, properties, and functions. The utilization of alternative splice sites can be regulated to prevent the inappropriate accumulation of one or more alternative products. To date, several examples of cis-acting regulatory elements, distinct from bona fide splice sites, have been identified which modulate splicing in a diverse assortment of genes from viruses (2Staffa A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The fibronectin gene is a classical example of a gene that undergoes alternative splicing (34Hynes R.O. Rich A. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 35Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The fibronectin gene is evolutionarily conserved and is predicted to yield up to 20 different mRNAs in human cells. The generation of this remarkable number of different mRNAs, and consequently polypeptides, is made possible by alternative splicing in three different coding regions of the fibronectin primary transcript (for review, see Refs. 36Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and 37ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the alternatively spliced regions encompasses the EDA (also referred to as EIIIA or EDI) exon. This exon is excluded selectively in fibronectin mRNAs produced by hepatocytes, but it is included to various extents by other cell types (Fig. 1 A). EDA exon splicing is also subject to developmental regulation as EDA exon inclusion generally declines with age and differentiation (36Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition to tissue-specific and developmental regulation, inclusion of the EDA exon is modulated during the process of tissue repair and in certain diseases. For these reasons, regulation of fibronectin EDA exon splicing has been the subject of several studies. In fact, the EDA exon was the first exon with which it was demonstrated that proper alternative splicing could occur in the context of transfected minigenes (38Vibe-Pedersen K. Kornblihtt A.R. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2511-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using the same experimental approach, it was determined subsequently that the central 81 nucleotides of the 270-nucleotide EDA exon were required for its inclusion into mRNA (31Mardon H.J. Sebastio G. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using a chimeric adenovirus/fibronectin EDA intron substrate in an in vitrosplicing system, Lavigueur et al. (32Lavigueur A. La Branche H. Kornblihtt A.R. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) further mapped the element required for EDA exon inclusion to a 9-nucleotide purine-rich motif (5′-GAAGAAGAC-3′). Caputi et al. (33Caputi M. Casari G. Guenzi S. Tagliabue R. Sidoli A. Melo C.A. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1018-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) identified the same purine-rich sequence as a positive cis-acting element by transfection experiments. Similar exonic purine-rich motifs have been demonstrated to stimulate splicing (39Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell.

A negative element (5′-CAAGG-3′) involved in down-regulation of EDA exon inclusion was also identified within the EDA exon just downstream of the ESE (33Caputi M. Casari G. Guenzi S. Tagliabue R.

RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar), it is not yet known if trans-acting factors interact with the negative element. Using a chimeric intron composed of sequences flanking the 5′-splice site (5′ss) of the first intron of human β-globin and sequences flanking the 3′-splice site (3′ss) of the human fibronectin EDA exon (2Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we observed that deletion of most of the fibronectin EDA exon sequences resulted in a dramatic increase in splicing efficiency. We have carried out mapping experiments to characterize this novel exon splicing silencer (ESS) element. Closer examination of the ESS revealed an adjacent positive element that is able to stimulate splicing when placed downstream of a heterologous intron. This novel ESS and adjacent positive element represent the third and fourth splicing regulatory elements to be identified within the 270-nucleotide EDA exon. The presence of so many different regulatory elements is of particular interest because they may explain the complex, dynamic splicing pattern exhibited by the fibronectin EDA exon. All plasmids are derivatives of pSVβFN– (2Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Truncation of fibronectin exon sequences (accession no.X07718) was carried out by PCR using the sense primer FN3′ss, 5′-CGT CGA CAA AGA AAA TGG TAT CTG C-3′ (nucleotides 1146–1164) and the following antisense primers: Δ, 5′-CCC CCG GAT CCA ATG CCA GTC CTT TAG GG-3′ (nucleotides 1255–1272); Δ1, 5′-CGG GAT CCC ACC CTG TAC CTG GA-3′ (nucleotides 1331–1345); Δ2, 5′-CGG GAT CCA ACT TGC CCC TGT GG-3′ (nucleotides 1316–1330); Δ3, 5′-CGG GAT CCG CTT TCC CAA GCA AT-3′ (nucleotides 1301–1315); and Δ4, 5′-CGG GAT CCT TTG ATG GAA TCG AC-3′ (nucleotides 1286–1300) to generate the respective constructs. The mod series of fibronectin exon mutations was carried out by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (43Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the FN3′ss sense primer and the antisense primer CATR1 (described below) along with the following mutagenic primers: mod1, 5′-CAC AGG GGC AAGatcTAC AGG GTG ACC-3′ (nucleotides 1317–1348); mod2, 5′-CAT CAA AAT TGCagatct CAC AGG GGC AAG-3′ (nucleotides 1294–1328); and mod3, 5′-CAC TGA TGT GGAgatcTC AAA ATT GCT T-3′ (nucleotides 1273–1307) to generate the respective constructs. Lowercase letters indicate nucleotides introduced to create a unique BglII restriction enzyme site (underlined). The single stem-loop 1 mutation (SL1B) was generated in a similar fashion using the mutagenic primer SL1B, 5′-TCA CTG ATG TGG tac TCG ATT CCA T-3′ (nucleotides 1272–1296), except that it was introduced in the context of the Δ1 truncation. The single stem-loop 2 mutation (SL2B) was generated in the context of the Δ1 truncation by PCR using FN3′ss sense primer and the SL2B antisense primer 5-CCG GAT CCC ACC CTG TAC Cac cAA ACT TGC CCC TGT G-3′ (nucleotides 1317–1345). The double stem-loop 2 mutation (SL2TB) was derived from pSVβFNSL2B by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using the mutagenic primer SL2T, 5′-GAT TCC ATC AAA ATT GCT acc GAA AGC CCA CAG-3′ (nucleotides 1289–1321). The double stem-loop 1 mutation (SL1TB) was generated as follows. The PCR product generated using the FN3′ss/SL1T primer pair was gel purified and mixed with an equimolar amount of gel purified PCR product generated with the SL1T, 5′-CCA CAT CAG TGA tac CCA GTC CTT T-3′ (nucleotides 1259–1283)/CATR1 (described below) primer pair. One end of each of these two DNA fragments contains a 12-bp overlap flanked by either the SL1B or SL1T mutation. By virtue of this 12-bp overlap, the two fragments were annealed and elongated by 10 cycles of low stringency PCR (25 °C annealing step) and then amplified by 25 cycles of normal stringency PCR (55 °C annealing step) using the FN3′ss/CATR1 primer pair. Approximately 75% of clones sequenced contained the desired double mutation. The SalI-BamHI fragments of truncated or mutated PCR products were reinserted into the SalI and BamHI sites of pSVβFN–. The plasmid pSVCBSB has been described previously (43Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its derivatives, containing fibronectin EDA exon sequences in the sense (pSVCBSBFs) or antisense (pSVCBSBFas) orientation, were generated by inserting the 30-bp BglII-BamHI fragment of pSVβFNmod1 into the unique BamHI site of pSVCBSB. The +1C, Δ5′ss, and ΔAC mutations were introduced in the context of pSVCBSBFs by PCR using the sense primer βPCR1, 5′-CTT AAG TTG GTG GTG AGG-3′ (43Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in conjunction with the following antisense primers: +1C, 5′-CGG ATC CGG TCA GGG CTA GAG TAG GTC AgC CTG TAG ATC CG-3′ (nucleotides 1337–1362); Δ5′ss, 5′-CCG GAT CCG GTC AGG GCT CGA GTA GGT TGT AGA TCC GGT CTG-3′ (nucleotides 1337–1340, 1346–1362); and ΔAC, 5′-CCG GAT CCG GTC ACC CTG TAG ATC CG-3′ (nucleotides 1337–1348). The SalI-BamHI fragments of the resulting PCR products were reinserted into the SalI and BamHI sites of pSVCBSB. COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL1651) were transfected as described previously (44Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 152: 684-704Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm Petri dish. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed directly on the culture dish by the addition of 1 ml of 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 0.5% sarkosyl, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and total RNA was isolated as described previously (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). When actinomycin D was used, the drug was added to the culture medium 48 h post-transfection at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and total RNA was extracted as described above at the indicated times. To generate probes for S1 nuclease analysis, the XhoI-SalI fragment of each construct was deleted, and the resulting plasmids were linearized with PvuI. Linearized plasmids were used as templates for primer extension using the 5′-end labeled antisense primer CATR1, 5′-CGG AAT TCC GGA TGA GCA TT-3′, which overlaps the EcoRI restriction endonuclease site of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) open reading frame. 50 fmol of PvuI-linearized template DNA and 1 pmol of 5′-end-labeled CATR1 primer were subjected to 15 thermal cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C) with 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a 20-μl reaction. Free CATR1 primer was removed by agarose gel purification of the extended primer. S1 nuclease protection assays were carried out as described previously (43Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μg of total RNA and 5–10 × 104 cpm (approximately 50–100 fmol) of the appropriate probe. S1-resistant probe DNA fragments were subjected to electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels and subsequently visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All cited ratios of spliced to unspliced RNAs are averages of results obtained in at least three independent experiments. In previous studies, our laboratory generated a chimeric gene composed of sequences flanking the 5′ss of the first intron of the human β-globin gene and sequences flanking the 3′ss upstream of the EDA exon of the human fibronectin gene (2Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The fibronectin sequences within the chimeric construct include 99 nucleotides of the intron and the first 118 nucleotides of the EDA exon (Fig.1 B). The previously characterized purine-rich ESE and the adjacent negative element, which are located between 155 and 180 nucleotides downstream of the EDA 3′ss, are not present in pSVβFN– and thus do not contribute to the level of splicing observed. S1 analysis of RNA isolated from transfected COS-7 cells showed that splicing of pSVβFN– RNA is relatively inefficient and results in the accumulation of roughly equal amounts of spliced and unspliced RNA (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). In an attempt to study the positional effect of a heterologous ESS element, we generated a truncated form of the EDA exon (designated pSVβFNΔ; see Fig. 2) in which sequences from +28 to +118 were deleted. Deletion of these sequences resulted in a 20-fold increase in the ratio of spliced to unspliced (S:U) RNA (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). This finding indicates that a splicing silencer element may exist within this region of the fibronectin EDA exon and that the EDA 3′ss may be intrinsically efficient. To map the fibronectin ESS element, we generated sequential 3′-truncations of the EDA exon sequences (Fig. 2). S1 analysis of RNA from COS-7 cells transfected with pSVβFNΔ1, Δ2, Δ3, or Δ4 (Fig.3) revealed that, with the exception of Δ1 (lane 2), splicing efficiency steadily increased as fibronectin EDA exon sequences were progressively shortened (lanes 3–5); the ratio of spliced to unspliced RNA approached that obtained with pSVβFNΔ. The Δ1 truncation defines the 3′-boundary of the fibronectin ESS as nucleotide +101 relative to the EDA 3′ss. The correlation between the size of the truncation and the splicing efficiency observed with Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4 suggests that the fibronectin ESS may be comprised of multiple smaller elements dispersed within the first 100 nucleotides of the EDA exon or that its function is dependent upon the stability of a secondary structure. However, based on the effect of these 3′-deletions alone, we could not exclude the possibility that the progressive increase in splicing is caused by the positioning of CAT sequences closer to the EDA 3′ss and not by disruption of an ESS within the EDA exon. To test this possibility, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce small internal deletions in the EDA exon within the context of pSVβFN– (Fig. 2). The net effect of these internal modifications is a 5-nucleotide deletion in pSVβFNmod1 and pSVβFNmod2 and a 7-nucleotide deletion in pSVβFNmod3. All three mutations resulted in a moderate (4–8-fold) increase in splicing efficiency (Fig.4). These results suggest that the effects seen in Fig. 3 are caused by deletion of a splicing silencer element between nucleotides +28 and +101 rather than by movement of CAT sequences closer to the EDA 3′ss. To verify that the alteration in the spliced:unspliced RNA ratio is not attributable to differences in RNA stability, the half-life of the spliced and unspliced RNAs of several constructs was examined. As indicated in Fig.5, all three constructs tested had half-lives of approximately 6 h for spliced RNA (filled circles) and 2–4 h for unspliced RNA (empty circles). Thus, no apparent difference in the stability of spliced RNA was observed among pSVβFN–, pSVβFNmod3, and pSVβFNΔ4. Therefore, the marked increase in accumulation of spliced RNA cannot be attributed to a longer half-life. The small decrease in half-life observed for the unspliced RNA of pSVβFNΔ4 compared with that of pSVβFN– or pSVβFNmod3 is consistent with more efficient splicing kinetics.Figure 5Increased accumulation of spliced RNA is not caused by changes in RNA stability. COS-7 cells transfected with pSVβFN–, pSVβFNΔ4, or pSVβFNmod3 were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Act D). Total RNA isolated at 0, 3, 6, and 9 h after the addition of the drug was analyzed by S1 nuclease protection. Unspliced and spliced RNA was quantitated and expressed as the percentage of the respective RNA (spliced or unspliced) at 0 h detected at the indicated time. Spliced RNA is indicated by filled circles and unspliced RNA by empty circles. Dotted, solid, and dashed lines represent pSVβFN–, pSVβFNΔ4, and pSVβFNmod3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The complete abrogation of splicing observed with the pSVβFNΔ1 construct suggests that the sequences deleted in pSVβFNΔ1 (nucleotides 102–118) harbor a splicing enhancer element. However, if that is the case, it differs from “classical” ESE elements (39Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 40Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3360-3374Google Scholar, 41Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) in that it is not purine-rich. To test if these EDA exon sequences could stimulate splicing when placed in a heterologous context, nucleotides 93–118 of the EDA exon were inserted into pSVCBSB (Fig. 6 A) downstream of a chimeric β-globin/HIV-1 intron. The pSVCBSB chimeric intron is not spliced (43Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) since critical HIV-1 exon splicing regulatory elements have been deleted (2Staffa A. Cochrane A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that splicing of this intron can be stimulated significantly by several classical purine-rich ESEs, including the ESE within the fibronectin EDA exon. Consistent with our previously published results (43Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only trace amounts of spliced RNA were detected with pSVCBSB (Fig. 6 B,lane 1). Insertion of nucleotides 93–118 of the EDA exon in the sense orientation (pSVCBSBFs) stimulated splicing at least 25-fold (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). Conversely, insertion of the same EDA sequences in the antisense orientation did not have a stimulatory effect on splicing (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). The region associated with enhancer activity contains the sequence 5′-AGGGTGACC-3′, which bears homology (a 6 out of 9 match; underlined) to the 5′ss consensus sequence, 5′-(C/A)AGGT(A/G)AGT-3′. One model to explain how this novel enhancer functions is that this pseudo-5′ss element recruits U1 snRNP to stimulate recognition of the EDA 3′ss much like authentic 5′-splice sites have been demonstrated to stimulate exon recognition (46Robberson B.L. Cote G.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 47Hoffman B.E. Grabowski P.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2554-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we introduced a point mutation that converted the critical GT dinucleotide of the pseudo-5′ss to CT (designated +1C in Fig. 6 C), deleted the majority of the pseudo-5′ss (Fig.6 C, Δ5′ss), or deleted the A/C-rich region immediately downstream of the pseudo-5′ss (Fig. 6 C, ΔAC). Analysis of the effect of these mutations revealed that none of the mutations tested resulted in loss of enhancer function. Rather, in all cases the mutation resulted in a further enhancement in the ratio of spliced to unspliced RNA (Fig. 6 D, compare lanes 3–5 with lane 2). Therefore, the splicing enhancer activity associated with this non-purine-rich sequence cannot be attributed solely to the 5′ss-like element. The relatively large size of the fibronectin ESS prompted us to examine its ability to form a secondary structure. The 118 nucleotides of the EDA exon present in pSVβFN– are predicted to form three stem-loops (Fig.7 A). Each of the two stem-loops closest to the EDA 3′ss contains a hairpin loop of 4 nucleotides and an internal loop that interrupts the 13-bp stem. The third and most distal stem-loop is predicted to consist of a stem of only 6 bp and a relatively large loop of 11 nucleotides. The fibronectin gene and its alternative splicing patterns are highly conserved among human, rat, and chicken (36Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the first 118 nucleotides of the EDA exon of other species retained the potential to form a secondary structure similar to that in Fig. 7 A. Fibronectin sequences of different species were obtained from sequence data bases and aligned (Fig.7 B). Compared with the human fibronectin sequence, the EDA exons from fibronectin of other mammals such as dog, rat, and mouse differ by only a few nucleotides, whereas those of chicken, newt, and frog are slightly more divergent. As expected, most of these nucleotide substitutions are silent at the amino acid level. The interesting observation is the occurrence of covariance and conservative substitutions. The region comprising step-loop 1 is completely conserved among human, dog, and rat fibronectin sequences. Chicken, newt, and frog fibronectin sequences contain several substitutions that do not compromise the ability of this region to form step-loop 1. An example of covariance is seen in chicken fibronectin involving positions +23 and +44. As depicted in Fig. 7 A, the nucleotides at these two positions are predicted to form a G-C bp in stem-loop 1. In chicken fibronectin, the nucleotide at +23 is replaced by an A, and a compensatory C → T substitution occurs at nucleotide +44, thus maintaining the ability to form a canonical Watson-Crick bp. Several examples of conservative substitutions involving putative base pairing between G and U residues are also observed. In both chicken and frog, a G-U bp in stem-loop 1 is converted to a canonical A-U bp by a G → A substitution at position +24. Examples in which canonical Watson-Crick bp are replaced by a wobble bp are also observed. In frog, a U-A bp is converted to a U-G bp by an A → G substitution at +40, and a G-C bp is converted to a G-U bp by a C → T substitution at +44. Taken together, these examples of covariance and conservative nucleotide substitutions support the notion that the stem-loop 1 secondary structure depicted in Fig. 7 Ais absolutely conserved and is indicative of selective pressure for maintenance of this secondary structure in addition to the protein-coding potential. Compared with stem-loop 1, there are only a few examples of covariance or conservative substitutions in the region comprising the putative stem-loop 2."
https://openalex.org/W1988941187,"Bryostatin 1 (Bryo) has been shown to induce biphasic dose-response curves for down-regulating protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) as well as for protecting PKCdelta from down-regulation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). To identify regions within PKCdelta that confer these responses to Bryo, we utilized reciprocal PKCalpha and PKCdelta chimeras (PKCalpha/delta and PKCdelta/alpha) constructed by exchanging the regulatory and catalytic domains of these PKCs. These chimeras and wild-type PKCalpha/alpha and PKCdelta/delta constructed in the same way were stably expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Twenty-four h of treatment with Bryo induced a biphasic dose-response curve for down-regulating both wild-type PKCdelta/delta and the PKCalpha/delta chimera. In contrast, Bryo led to a nearly complete down-regulation of both PKCalpha/alpha and PKCdelta/alpha and also produced a faster mobility form of these species on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The nature of both the regulatory and, to a lesser extent, the catalytic domains affected the potency of Bryo to down-regulate the chimeric PKC proteins as well as to protect PKCalpha/delta and PKCdelta/delta from down-regulation. Bryo at high concentrations also inhibited the down-regulation of PKCdelta/delta and PKCalpha/delta induced by 1 microM PMA when co-applied. The portion of PKC protected by Bryo from down-regulation by either Bryo or PMA was localized in the particulate fraction of the cells. We conclude that the catalytic domain of PKCdelta confers protection from down-regulation induced by Bryo or Bryo plus PMA, suggesting that this domain contains the isotype-specific determinants involved in the unique effect of Bryo on PKCdelta."
https://openalex.org/W1931557988,"Animal research has indicated that the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can be influenced by classical (Pavlovian) conditioning procedures. To test the hypothesis that alterations in plasma cortisol levels can be conditioned in humans, the present study used a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which a distinctively flavored beverage was paired with p.o. administration of dexamethasone. Twenty-five healthy men were randomly assigned to one of two groups. During the conditioning phase of the study, subjects in the experimental group received three conditioning trials (pairings of a distinctively flavored beverage with a capsule containing 5 mg dexamethasone) separated by 1 wk recovery periods. Subjects in the control group were treated identically, except that the capsule contained a placebo. During the test phase, all subjects underwent a test day (reexposure to the distinctively flavored beverage before receiving a placebo capsule) and a comparison day (no exposure to the beverage or the capsule). Plasma cortisol was assessed repetitively before and after administration of the beverage and capsule, as were possible confounding factors, including: behavioral variables, psychological distress, aversive reactions to the beverage, and expectations of treatment. After reexposure to the beverage and administration of a placebo capsule (conditioned stimuli), the experimental group had significantly higher levels of plasma cortisol than the control group, after controlling for variability in baseline levels of cortisol (F(5,60)=3.09; P=0.015) that could not be explained by differences in other study variables. No differences in cortisol levels were found on the comparison day. These results support the study hypothesis that changes in plasma cortisol levels can be classically conditioned in humans by pairing a distinctive beverage with p.o. administration of dexamethasone."

RNA preceding the translational start site of every mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 1Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This short RNA is derived from a 3–4-fold longer RNA, called the spliced leader (SL) RNA or Mini Exon Donor RNA. The 5′-end of the SL RNA fuses to a primary mRNA and the 3′-end is rapidly degraded. Although the trans-splicing of mRNA by an SL RNA occurs in several trematodes, nematodes, and euglenoids, only in trypanosomatids is addition of an SL RNA essential for the formation of every mRNA (2Bonen L. FASEB. 1993; 7: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The SL RNA genes are members of the small nuclear (sn) RNA class of eukaryotic genes (3Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M.

These genes encode short, nonpolyadenylated RNAs that participate in mRNA-processing reactions. In higher eukaryotes, in which snRNA genes have been extensively studied, snRNAs are synthesized from independent transcription units that contain promoter elements specific to this gene class (6Connelly S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6711-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Bellofatto V. Hartree D.E. Torres J. J. Parasitol. 1993; 79: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Three upstream cis-acting elements, positioned between bp −1 to −10, −30 to −40, and −60 to −70 upstream from the transcription initiation site (+1) were identified (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Analysis of the SL RNA gene promoter from two other trypanosomatids, Leishmania tarentolae and L. amazonensis, revealed a similar SL RNA gene promoter structure (3Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,5Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the bp −60 to −70 region of the SL RNA gene promoter in trypanosomes is analogous to the proximal sequence element (PSE) found within the snRNA genes of other eukaryotes (3Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PSEs, identified in vertebrates and sea urchins, are located ∼55 bp upstream of the snRNA gene transcription initiation site in these eukaryotes (8Hernandez N. Yamamoto K.R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-312Google Scholar, 9Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

The trypanosomatid SL RNA gene PSE sequence contains a trypanosome-specific 5′-GAC-3′ core region (5Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (and see below) but is divergent from higher eukaryotic PSE sequences, as expected. In preliminary biochemical experiments, we detected two specific protein-DNA complexes that required wild type (WT) DNA sequences in two promoter elements defined in vivo (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized these complexes (now called I and II) and identified two proteins that assemble at the SL RNA gene promoter. L. seymouri (ATCC 30220) was maintained in logarithmic phase at room temperature with gentle stirring in Crithidia medium described previously (16Melendy T. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and supplemented with 13 mm sodium phosphate adjusted to pH 7.4. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 mm leupeptin. Complex I and II forming activities were monitored by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA, see below) (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Complex I and II forming activities were separated by chromatography on phosphocellulose (P-11, Whatman). 1.5 × 1011 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer I (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and sheared by passage through a StanstedTM model 516 Cell Disrupter (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, 3000 ×g for 10 min, resuspended in Buffer BC (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl). To extract nuclear proteins, 4 m KCl was added to a final concentration of 350 mm, the mixture was stirred gently for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against Buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm KCl, clarified, and 100 mg of protein was applied to a 22-ml P-11 column at 0.5 ml/min. Protein was eluted using a linear 0.05–0.6 m KCl gradient. Protein from 1.2 × 1012 cells, extracted as described above, was applied to a 70-ml Trisacryl-M DEAE column which was developed with a discontinuous gradient of increasing KCl concentrations (100 mm, 200 mm, 300 mm) in Buffer A. The peak activity fractions were pooled and diluted 2-fold with Buffer A to a final concentration of 100 mm KCl and applied to a 30-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that was developed with a linear 100–500 mm KCl gradient in Buffer A. Peak activity fractions were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, and applied to a 1.5-ml double strand DNA-cellulose column (Sigma). Protein was eluted using a linear 0.1–1 mKCl gradient in Buffer A lacking Nonidet P-40. Active fractions were combined and dialyzed against affinity buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 90 mmKCl). The activity peak (0.96 mg of protein) obtained from the nonspecific double-strand DNA-cellulose chromatographic step was applied to a specific DNA affinity column containing the basal SL RNA gene promoter. To obtain only complex I, 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was added to the dialysate and the 1.5-ml column was loaded and run at 0.1 ml/min. To obtain complexes I and II, 4 mm MgCl2 was also added to the dialysate and the column was loaded and run at 0.05 ml/min. In addition, loaded protein was retained on the affinity column for 10 min before the wash step. The column was washed extensively with affinity buffer and developed using a linear 0.09–0.5 mKCl gradient. Plasmid pHL7, which contains two head-to-head copies of the SL RNA gene promoter sequence, from bp −10 to −86 (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1), 2H. Luo and V. Bellofatto, unpublished data. cloned into the polylinker region of pBluescript (pBS/SK II; Stratagene Co.), was digested using SacI and BamHI. The BamHI 3′ ends were selectively biotinylated using dATP, dGTP, and biotinylated dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The promoter-containing DNA fragment was separated from the vector sequences after A-15 chromatography and digestion with HindIII. The 0.19-kilobase HindIII-BamHI fragment that contained the SL promoter DNA was bound to 4 ml of immobilized streptavidin (Boehringer Mannheim) and used to make a 1.5-ml specific DNA affinity column (containing 108 pmol of DNA) (17Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (S-200, Pharmacia Biotech.) was calibrated at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, using affinity buffer containing 0.3 m KCl and the following standards (total protein, 150 μg in 0.1 ml): ferritin, 61 Å; rabbit muscle aldolase, 48.1 Å; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 35.5 Å; and carbonic anhydrase, 20.1 Å. Affinity-purified protein, containing either complex I or both complex I and II forming activity, was concentrated in a CentriconTM 10 (Amicon) to 0.1 ml (∼35 μg) and run under the conditions used for the standards. Triplicate 5- ml 15–30% (v/v) linear glycerol gradients in affinity buffer containing 0.3m KCl were set overnight at 4 °C. The gradients were overlaid with 10–30 μg/0.1-ml S-200-purified proteins or 30 μg/0.1-ml standards (bovine liver catalase (11.30 S), rabbit muscle aldolase (7.35 S), BSA (4.30 S), hen egg ovalbumin (3.66 S) (Pharmacia Biotech). Protein eluted from the S-200 column was concentrated in a CentriconTM 10 to 0.1 ml and loaded onto the gradient. The gradients were centrifuged at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 55 rotor, for 28 h at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated from top to bottom and 0.125-ml fractions were collected. The 66-bp WT promoter (bp −17 to −83 region) was made by annealing two 66-nt complementary oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1). The 95-bp WT substrate (bp −1 to −95 region) was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a cloned copy of the SL RNA gene and appropriate primers (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The “37-bp” and “29-bp” probes were made by digesting the 66-bp WT promoter with Tru 9 I. The 37-bp probe contained the bp −46 to −83 region, the 29-bp region contained the bp −45 to −17 region. The “δ-43/46” probe was made by annealing an oligonucleotide that contained the sequence from nt −83 to −65 of the coding strand (5′-GGCTACTATATATACATAGA-3′) to a 64-nt oligonucletide that contained the noncoding strand from nt −17 to −88, but without nt −43 to −46. The coding strand was extended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to produce a double-strand DNA. The “Δ-31/40” probe was made by annealing two complementary 66 nt oligomers, from nt −17 to −83, with a 10-bp mutation of nt −31 to −40 (5′-(C)8CT-3′ on the coding strand) to 5′-GAGGTTAACG-3′. The “δ-60/74” substrate was made by annealing an oligonucleotide (5′-CTATATACACGCTGGTACCAGCTGGAGCGGGTGCATTAACTCCCCCCCCTCATTTCGTCATGGGCA-3′) to a primer complementary to nt −17 to −36. The Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I was used to complete the double-strand molecule. The product was cloned into pBS/SK II and a standard polymerase chain reaction, using SK and KS primers (Stratagene), produced a 133-bp fragment that contained the mutated promoter. Nonspecific substrates were made by amplifying a 70-bp DNA fragment from pBS/SK II in a standard polymerase chain reaction using the SK and KS primers or by annealing two 69-nt oligonucleotides that contained the polylinker region of pBS/SK II. Each substrate DNA was polyacrylamide gel-purified before use. Reaction mixtures (20 μl), containing affinity buffer, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 20 fmol of the γ-32P-labeled substrates were incubated with titrated amounts of protein for 30 min at room temperature (4Hartree D. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 71: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction products were applied to a neutral 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer and electrophoresed at 13 mA for 2 h at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were quantitated by PhosphorImagerTM analysis of dried gels. A 130-bp HindIII/BamHI fragment from pLL 95-6 (a derivative of pBS/SK II containing the bp −1 to −95 SL RNA gene promoter region) was gel purified and uniquely 3′-end labeled at the recessed 3′ HindIII site using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. 10 ng of probe (105 cpm) was incubated with 8 μl (∼1 μg) of affinity-purified protein in a 20-μl reaction under standard EMSA conditions. DNase I (25 ng) and CaCl2 (1 mm) were added, and the reaction was terminated with 5 mm EDTA after 1 min at room temperature (18Schmitz A. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). DNase I-nicked free and bound substrate was separated by EMSA and visualized by autoradiography. The DNA fragments were excised from the EMSA gel and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The corresponding dideoxy-sequenced SL RNA gene promoter region was run on the same gel. Uniformly-labeled DNA was prepared by annealing an oligonucleotide (nt −83 to −63, top strand) to the bottom strand (66 nt oligonucleotide) WT SL promoter template and filling in with dATP, dCTP, 5′-bromouracil, and [α-32P]dGTP. The product was digested with Tru 9 I, and the 37-bp DNA fragment (bp −83 to −46) was gel purified. Protein (∼1.5 μg) was incubated with DNA in a standard EMSA prior to irradiation at 2 cm from the UV source (302 nm, relative intensity at 3 in. is 1500 microwatts/cm2) for 40 min on ice. CaCl2 concentration was adjusted to 2 mm and the DNA was digested for 10 min using DNase I (10 units, Boehringer Mannheim). 5 × loading buffer (0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added, heated at 65 °C for 3 min, and resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel. Nuclear extracts contained proteins that generated two specific protein-promoter complexes. The more slowly migrating complex, complex II, was in greater abundance. Fractionation of extract on phosphocellulose resulted in the loss of complex II forming activity and a substantial increase in complex I forming activity. Fig. 2 shows that complex II could be restored by mixing the complex I forming fraction (fraction 42) with a fraction (fraction 64) that alone did not produce a significant gel shift. When a fixed amount of fraction 42 was mixed with increasing amounts of fraction 64, more complex II was produced. As was the case for unfractionated extract, both complexes could be competed only with WT promoter-containing unlabeled DNA (data not shown). These data suggest that complex I and II share a common specific DNA-binding protein. This protein is namedpromoter binding protein (PBP)-1. The protein that supershifts complex I to complex II is referred to as PBP-2. We fractionated nuclear extract through several chromatographic steps and obtained a 320-fold purification (Table I). The essential features of the fractionation included a high salt extract of protein from a crude preparation of nuclei (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar); the use of an ion-exchange chromatography step followed by heparin-Sepharose, a nonspecific double-strand DNA-cellulose column, and a specific DNA affinity column. EMSA of fractions obtained from the final chromatography step showed that the peak of PBP-1 activity eluted at 0.26 m KCl (Fig.3, panel A). Although the recovery of PBP-1 from this final column was low (10%) this step was key in removing a majority of the protein that co-purified with PBP-1 through the nonspecific DNA column. We found that three polypeptides co-fractionated with the peak of complex I forming activity (Fig. 3,panels A and B). These proteins have apparent molecular masses of 57, 46, and 36 kDa. The affinity-purified PBP-1 was used to analyze the activity of this protein on DNA and for its physical characterization.Table IPartial purification of PBP-1FractionProtein1-aProtein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce).VolumeTotal activity1-bOne unit is equal to an arbitrary number of PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) density values present in complex I after EMSA analysis.(108)Specific activity1-cSpecific activity is total activity per mg of protein.mgmlNuclear extract760.0190.0133.00.17DEAE1-dPeak activity fractions were pooled and diluted 2-fold prior to loading onto heparin.72.046.0156.02.17Heparin9.6046.084.68.75dsDNA-cellulose0.961.231.733.0DNA affinity0.071.03.8054.31-a Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce).1-b One unit is equal to an arbitrary number of PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) density values present in complex I after EMSA analysis.1-c Specific activity is total activity per mg of protein.1-d Peak activity fractions were pooled and diluted 2-fold prior to loading onto heparin. Open table in a new tab PBP-1 was subjected to two analytical procedures. Gel filtration chromatography on Superdex-200 showed that PBP-1 had a molecular mass of approximately 140 kDa and a Stokes' radius of 41 ± 3.3 Å (Fig.4, panel A). After concentration of the PBP-1 peak from gel filtration, PBP-1 was sedimented through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. EMSA analysis of protein fractionated in the glycerol gradient is shown in Fig.5, panel A. The activity was present in fraction 17–28; the peak of activity was in fraction 17–23. These fractions contained an approximately quantitative recovery of PBP-1 activity. Fig. 5, panel B, shows that the PBP-1 recovered from the sedimentation procedure retained the same DNA binding specificity as did the input material. This analysis of PBP-1 gave an s 20, w of 7.25 ± 0.8 (Fig.4, panel B).Figure 5Density sedimentation fractionation of the PBP-1 fraction. EMSA analysis of fractions obtained from density centrifugation. A, protein from S-200 chromatography (load) was applied to a 15–30% glycerol gradient. The probe was the WT 95-bp DNA. B, the binding specificity of fractionated PBP-1 was assessed using competitor DNAs in an EMSA. Fractions 20–23 were pooled, incubated with WT 95-bp probe in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of either unlabeled WT 95-bp DNA (“S”) or a pBS DNA fragment (“N”). Complex I and free DNA are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since these data were obtained using nondenaturing conditions, a reasonable estimate for both native molecular weight and frictional ratio could be made. The native molecular weight was calculated by incorporating the Stokes' radius and sedimentation coefficient values into the standard hydrodynamics equation of Siegel and Monty (20Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). A native molecular mass of 122 ± 16 kDa (x ± 1 S.D.) was calculated for PBP-1. Using this value, we calculated a shape factor of f/f o of 1.2, which indicated that PBP-1 was a relatively symmetric molecule. This predicted symmetry was qualitatively consistent with the independent molecular weight calculations made by comparing either the peak of PBP-1 activity that eluted from the gel filtration column or the relative sedimentation of PBP-1 with molecular weight standards. These data indicate that PBP-1 is either a single polypeptide that was proteolytically cleaved into the 57-, 46-, and 36-kDa polypeptides during purification or that PBP-1 is a multisubunit protein. DNase I footprint analysis was used to localize the binding site of PBP-1 on the SL promoter. Fig.6, panel A, shows that the DNase I-resistant area was between nt −55 to −74 on the bottom strand of the promoter (the top strand represents the SL RNA coding region that is downstream from the promoter). The breadth of the footprint was 18 nt, indicating that PBP-1 was a large protein, consistent with a molecular mass of 122 kDa. To assess the sequence specificity of the PBP-1:DNA interaction, a mutated DNA probe (Δ-60/74; Fig. 1) was tested for PBP-1 binding. Fig. 7, panel A, shows that complex I did not assemble on this mutated DNA. In the converse experiment, panel B shows that the 37-bp region (bp −46 to −83) was sufficient for PBP-1 binding. To test if PBP-1 was specific for double- or single-strand DNA we performed the EMSA analysis shown in Fig.8. These data show that neither strand of the promoter nor two irrelevant DNA strands could compete complex I (Fig. 8, panel A, lanes 1–8). Complex I was destabilized only when the oligonucleotides that correspond to the SL promoter were annealed prior to being used as competitor (lanes 9–12). To determine if PBP-1 bound weakly to single-strand promoter DNA, we used radiolabeled single-strand DNA probes in EMSA. Fig. 8, panel B, lanes 4 and 5, shows that PBP-1 did not bind to these probes. These data demonstrate that PBP-1 is a sequence-specific double-strand DNA-binding protein. Photocross-linking was used to determine which polypeptide present in the affinity-purified PBP-1 preparation interacted with the SL promoter. Fig. 9, panel A, shows that the 37-bp promoter region (bp −46 to −83) cross-linked to the 46-kDa species (see Fig. 3, panel B). The 46-kDa protein binding was specific for the promoter sequence since this interaction could be competed by the WT SL promoter and not by the mutated promoter (Δ-60/74; Fig. 1). Panel B shows the complexes remaining after UV cross-linking and before DNase I treatment. These results show that detection of the 46-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE was UV-dependent and observed only under conditions that produced complex I. These data show that the 46-kDa protein that co-purifies with complex I activity is likely responsible for the specific PBP-1 interaction with the promoter. Complex II forming activity co-eluted with complex I forming activity through DEAE, heparin-Sepharose, and double-strand DNA cellulose. The specific DNA affinity step was used to co-purify complex II with complex I by altering the loading and running conditions of this column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.10, panel A, shows the elution of complexes I and II. Complex II activity eluted at a slightly higher salt concentration (0.3 m KCl) than did complex I (0.26 m KCl). Competition experiments (panel B) show that complex II forms specifically on the SL promoter. PBP-2 was separated from PBP-1 by gel filtration chromatography of the 0.3 m KCl fraction from the affinity column. Fig.11 shows that PBP-2 eluted from the S-200 column regenerated complex II when mixed with affinity-purified PBP-1. Fig. 4 shows that the elution of PBP-2 in gel filtration analysis indicated a Stokes' radius of 62 ± 1.4 Å. S-200-fractionated PBP-2, sedimented in a glycerol gradient, indicated an s 20, w of 6.2 ± 0.6. The native molecular weight of PBP-2, determined using the Siegel and Monty (20Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) hydrodynamic equation, was 157 ± 17-kDa (x ± 1 S.D.). This molecular weight and Stokes' radius indicated a shape factor for PBP-2 of 1.6, which suggested an asymmetric molecule. Such asymmetry was consistent with the finding that PBP-2 eluted from gel filtration before PBP-1 but sedimented more slowly than did PBP-1 during density centrifugation. The 0.3 mKCl affinity-purified fraction, which contained complex I and II forming activities, was used in DNase I footprint analysis. Fig. 6,panel B, shows the DNase I protection pattern obtained when enzyme-nicked complex II was subject to denaturing gel electrophoresis. The protected region was from bp −28 to −82. This region includes both the bp −60 to −70 and bp −30 to −40 promoter elements (see Fig. 1). These footprint data suggest that both elements are required for complex II assembly. To test this prediction, we assayed complex II formation on several promoters with mutations. A deletion in the spacing between the bp −30 to −40 and bp −60 to −70 regions (δ-43/46, Fig. 1) markedly reduced complex II assembly (Fig. 12,panel A). Sequence substitution of the bp −30 to −40 region (Fig. 12, panel B) showed similar results. These alterations did not disrupt the PBP-1-DNA interactions required to assemble complex I (Fig. 12, panel A, lanes 4 and 8; panel B, lane 2). In addition, PBP-2 did not form a complex with the 29-bp probe (bp −17 to −45 Tru 9 I fragment, data not shown). The 37-bp probe (bp −46 to −83 Tru 9 I fragment) could only form complex I when incubated with PBP-1 and PBP-2 (Fig.7, panel B). Mutation of the PBP-1-binding region not only blocked complex I formation but also destroyed complex II assembly (Fig. 12, panel C). Taken together, these data show that PBP-2 supershifts complex I into complex II and this larger complex requires the WT sequence and spatial arrangement of two SL promoter elements defined in vivo. Fig. 13 shows the effect of varying KCl and MgCl2 concentrations on complex I and II formation in EMSA. Complex II formation was increased with increasing concentrations of KCl whereas complex I was decreased (panel A). Complex II was markedly affected by MgCl2concentrations; optimal binding was observed at 2–4 mmMgCl2 (panel B). Complex I was insensitive to varying MgCl2 concentrations. Addition of ATP did not appear to have an effect on formation of either complex (data not shown). Panel C shows that BSA mixed with either PBP-1 (lanes 4–6) or PBP-2 (lanes 7–9) did not yield complex II. Therefore, PBP-2 cannot be replaced with a nonspecific protein to assemble complex II. We examined the association and dissociation rates of complexes I and II. PBP-1 was incubated alone or with PBP-2 and DNA under standard EMSA conditions for increasing amounts of time. Complexes were detected by EMSA (Fig. 14). PBP-1 alone bound DNA very rapidly; the rate was so rapid that by “0.1” min significant amounts of complex I were formed. Complex II formed much more slowly; initially rates were low and the amount of complex formed increased during the 32-min assay (panel A). The dissociation rate of both complexes I and II were compared by mixing either PBP-1 alone or with PBP-2 and DNA for 10 min, to establish binding, and then challenging the complexes with unlabeled 50-fold molar excess WT promoter DNA (Fig. 14, panel B). PBP-1 alone readily dissociated from DNA; this reaction was very rapid and most of complex I was destabilized by the first time point (0.1 min). In contrast, complex II was stable and did not significantly dissociate after 32 min. Studies of SL RNA gene expression in three organisms of the Trypanosomatidae family of protozoa have shown that the basal SL RNA gene promoter lies upstream from the transcription initiation site (+1) between bp −1 and −100. In L. seymouri, base substitution mutagenesis data indicated that sequences between bp −1 to −10, −20 to −40, and −50 to −70 were essential for gene expression in vivo (summarized in Fig. 1). PBP-1 binds in a sequence specific fashion to double-strand DNA in the bp −60 to −70 promoter element. This promoter element contains a 5′-GAC-3′ sequence that is also present in the SL promoters of two Leishmania species (3Agami R. Aly R. Halman S. Shapira M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,5Saito R.M. Elgort M.G. Campbell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5460-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PBP-1 is a transcription factor within the SL initiation complex. Three polypeptides, 57, 46, and 36 kDa, co-fractionated with PBP-1 binding activity through multiple chromatographic steps and finally through sedimentation density centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography at 0.3 mKCl. The 46-kDa species was photocross-linked to the SL gene promoter. These data suggest that PBP-1 may be a tightly assembled trimeric complex which has an apparent molecular mass of 122 ± 16 kDa. Proof of these contentions awaits in vitro transcription experiments in which the role of PBP-1 can be assessed directly. We have recently developed an L. seymouri in vitrotranscription system that accurately initiates SL RNA gene transcription (21Huie J. He P. Bellofatto V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). This system will be instrumental in defining PBP-1's role in transcription. In vivo experiments showed that both the bp −30 to −40 and the bp −60 to −70 sequences were necessary for SL transcription. Both regions were necessary in their WT configuration for complex II formation. Kinetic experiments showed that complex II had a slower dissociation rate from DNA than did complex I. In addition, complex II elutes from the specific DNA affinity column at a higher salt concentration than did complex I. Therefore, complex II is a more stable protein-promoter interaction than is complex I. These experiments argue that complex II may facilitate the formation of the initiation complex that assembles at the SL promoter. The data presented here support two models for complex II formation. Complex II is PBP-2 bound to complex I and to the bp −30 to −40 promoter element (model 1). Alternatively, complex II is PBP-2 bound independently or in the presence of a third protein (or a modified PBP-1) to the two promoter elements (model 2). Both models are consistent with the finding that complexes I and II have different KCl and MgCl2 optima, different dissociation and association rates, and overlapping DNase I footprint patterns. Model 2 is supported by the findings that complex II could not be completely lost during S-200 fractionation and that complex I could not be completely supershifted to complex II with increasing amounts of S-200 purified PBP-2. However, the majority of our findings support model 1. First, PBP-2, isolated from P-11 chromatography, did not bind to DNA in an EMSA unless it was mixed with PBP-1. Second, limiting amounts of PBP-1 incubated with PBP-2 generated increased amounts of complex II (Fig. 2,lanes 2–4). S-200-purified PBP-2 only produced complex II when incubated with affinity-purified PBP-1 and not with an irrelevant protein (Fig. 11, lane 6, and Fig. 13, panel C, lanes 7–9). In addition, PBP-2 is required specifically for the supershift with PBP-1 since it could not be replaced with BSA (Fig. 13,panel C, lanes 4–6). Third, the difference in migration of complex II as compared with that of complex I in EMSA is consistent with the addition of a protein (PBP-2) added to complex I. Finally, increased stability by the addition of proteins to a promoter:DNA-binding protein complex is reminiscent of transcription factor assembly at other eukaryotic promoters (22Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the findings that support model 2 do not exclude model 1. S-200-fractionated PBP-2 appeared to shift a very small amount of DNA into complex II (see Fig. 13, panel C, lanes 2 and 7–9). This is likely to be due to contamination by small amounts of PBP-1 since PBP-1 and PBP-2 activity peaks were only 1.5 ml apart. Addition of PBP-1 to the S-200 PBP-2 fraction produced significant amounts of complex II, but not at the obvious expense of complex I. Although we would expect that if complex II is a supershifted form of complex I, PBP-2 should titrate all of complex I into complex II. However, this need not occur for several reasons. First, the overall amount of total probe shifted in these experiments was small, and the amount of PBP-2 activity in this final PBP-2 fraction was limiting. Second, the association and dissociation rates of PBP-1 binding to DNA are very rapid whereas the binding of PBP-2 to complex I is relatively slow (see Fig. 14). The result is that complex I cannot be easily captured by PBP-2 to form complex II. Finally, complex II may require an additional protein, or a modified form of PBP-1, that is limiting in the affinity-purified PBP-1 fraction. A detailed analysis of the PBP-2 interaction with PBP-1 awaits the production of purified recombinant proteins. Studies of snRNA gene transcription in mammalian cells may provide useful paradigms for PBP-1 structure and function in SL RNA gene expression in trypanosomes. In mammalian cells, snRNA genes are expressed from promoters that contain an essential element, the PSE, located ∼55 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site. The PSE is bound by SNAPc (snRNA activatingprotein complex), also called PTF (PSE binding transcription factor), which is a stable 4-subunit complex with an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa (23Henry R.W. Sadowski C. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Yoon J.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest the Leptomonas PBP-1 protein may be analogous to SNAPc/PTF since it interacts within the PSE of the SL RNA gene promoter. The only promoter-binding protein in trypanosomes that has been characterized is a 40-kDa single-strand DNA-binding protein from Trypanosoma brucei (25Vanhamme L. Pays A. Tebabi P. Alexandre S. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5598-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have now identified a sequence-specific double-strand DNA-binding protein that interacts at the SL RNA gene promoter. Further analysis of these proteins will identify their structure as well as their specific role in trypanosome gene expression. As ancient eukaryotes, trypanosomes most likely possess primordial components of the eukaryotic transcription machinery. As parasitic organisms, trypanosomes may demonstrate a flexibility in gene expression that is key to their survival. Detailed studies of the protein-DNA complexes that assemble at trypanosome gene promoters will provide insights into molecular aspects of trypanosome biology.

We examined the effects of trauma on the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin in several vital organs (i.e., heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and small intestine) 2 h after induction of Noble-Collip drum trauma in anesthetized rats. Total RNA was extracted from these organs and P-selectin mRNA was quantified by RNase protection assays. P-selectin mRNA was significantly increased over control nontraumatized, anesthetized rats in all vital organs (P<0.05 or less), with the largest increase occurring in the lung (P<0.01). Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of P-selectin protein in postcapillary venules of all vital organs after trauma. To further investigate the possible mechanisms of increased P-selectin mRNA transcription promoter activity during trauma, we quantified binding of proteins from nuclear extracts to the κB site (−218GGGGGTGACCC−207) of the P-selectin gene by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We confirmed the results of NF-κB binding by demonstrating increases in p50 and p52, as well as decreases in IκB in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from the lungs of trauma rats by Western blotting. Increased activity of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), occurred in all vital organs of the trauma rats compared to sham-operated controls. Our findings suggest that severe trauma results in up-regulation of P-selectin at the transcriptional level, which is partly controlled by an NF-κB-responsive element in the region of the P-selectin promoter. This increased activation of NF-κB binding may contribute to the widespread increases in P-selectin expression observed in several vital organs 2 h after trauma, which in turn may play a key role in the pathogenesis of traumatic shock.—Armstead, V.

https://openalex.org/W2142525670,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein K (gK) plays an essential role in viral replication and cell fusion. gK is a very hydrophobic membrane protein that contains a signal sequence and several hydrophobic regions. It has been shown that mutations inducing cell fusion map to two distinct domains of gK, suggesting that these domains are functionally important. To understand the transmembrane topology of gK and the localization of these functional domains, we constructed a set of gK deletion, insertion, and truncation mutants and expressed these by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomal membranes. The transmembrane topology of gK was determined by examination of the post-translational processing and protease sensitivity of the mutant proteins. Our data demonstrate that gK contains three transmembrane domains (amino acids 125-139, 226-239, and 311-325). Another hydrophobic domain (amino acids 241-265), which is relatively less hydrophobic and much longer compared with the transmembrane sequences, is located in the extracellular loop. The analysis showed that the domains containing syncytial mutations are both ectodomains. They may interact with each other to form a complex tertiary structure that is critical for the biological function of gK."

This statute permits the confinement, in mental hospitals, of sex offenders after the completion of their criminal sentences if they have a mental abnormality that might lead to future dangerous behavior. The broad definition of mental abnormality, includes both serious disorders and personality disorders that may reflect only antisocial traits, coupled with the fact that past behavior which occurred years before, is an adequate predicate for confinement. This represents a significant expansion of traditional civil commitment and a blurring of the boundaries of mental illness and deviance. The costs for this confinement are three to four times the cost of customary civil commitment and compete with costs for treatment of the seriously mentally ill."

Cell. 1996; 85: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).During progression into G1 and S phase, cell cycle-specific proteolysis and tyrosine phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 need to be coordinated in some way to ensure that mitosis does not occur during G1 or before DNA replication has been completed. For instance, if the APC failed to function during late mitosis or G1, then accumulation of cyclin B could potentially form a complex with p34 cdc2 and, if the balance between Wee1 and Cdc25 still favored dephosphorylation of p34 cdc2, MPF could be generated and so promote cells back into a mitotic state. Therefore, during the transition from metaphase into interphase, a coordinated inactivation of APC activity (to allow accumulation of cyclin B) and re-activation of Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 (to prevent premature accumulation of MPF activity) must occur.In the current study, we have asked how tyrosine phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 and proteolysis mediated by the APC are coordinated to allow normal progression from G2 into M and then from M into G1 and S phase. Our studies indicate that during G1 the function of the APC helps prevent progression into mitosis. The function of nimQ MCM2, a homologue of MCM2 (37Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K.

Our data further show that cells lacking the nimQ MCM2 function undergo multiple rounds of spindle pole body (SPB) duplication in the absence of the chromosomal cycle. The molecular mechanisms proposed help explain the logic of the cell cycle in organisms regulating mitotic initiation by tyrosine dephosphorylation of p34 cdc2 and mitotic exit via the APC.DISCUSSIONThe nimQ20 MCM2 mutation joins a group of mutations that interfere with temporal control of S phase and mitosis, which also play a role in initiation of DNA replication (63Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,66Hofmann J.F. Beach D.

These observations have led to the proposal that the act of initiating DNA replication activates a negative control system preventing initiation of mitosis during S phase (69Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 72Li J.J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 223-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The nature of this negative control system has not been demonstrated previously. Here we demonstrate that upon execution of nimQ20 MCM2 function Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 becomes activated to help prevent mitotic initiation during S phase. Thus, lack of nimQ MCM2 not only prevents DNA replication, it also prevents Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2. By contrast, S phase arrest caused by mutation of the nimP polε gene or by HU (at which initiation complexes would be activated but immediately stalled due to lack of deoxyribonucleotides) allows Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2, and after the HU arrest point, there is no longer a requirement for nimQ MCM2 in the Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2. The function of nimQ MCM2 therefore acts like a trigger to allow Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 upon initiation of DNA replication, after which it is not required for Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2.This result provides a molecular explanation for why mitosis can be initiated before DNA replication in the double nimQ20 +bimE7 mutant strain of A. nidulans (35James S. Mirabito P. Scacheri P. Morris N. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3485-3499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that arrest of mitotic initiation after S phase in A. nidulans is mediated by the combined actions of bimE APC1 and Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 (13Ye X.S. Fincher R.R. Tang A. O'Donnell K. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3599-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, any treatment interfering with both APC function and the ability to Tyr-15 phosphorylate p34 cdc2 will promote lethal premature mitosis in A. nidulans. As lack of nimQ MCM2 leads to S phase arrest during which p34 cdc2 cannot be tyrosine-phosphorylated, the double nimQ20 + bimE7 mutations in essence phenocopy the p34 cdc2 AF + bimE7 double mutant when DNA replication is inhibited. By preventing the transition from G1 into S phase at a stage that blocks activation of Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 (inactivate nimQ MCM2) and also inactivating APC function (bimE7 APC1 mutation), negative controls over MPF, and other mitotic regulators such as NIMA (13Ye X.S. Fincher R.R. Tang A. O'Donnell K. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3599-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), are removed and mitosis is prematurely initiated from G1/S.Coordination of APC and Tyr-15 Phosphorylation of p34cdc2At some point during progression out of mitosis into interphase, the APC needs to be inactivated (it is activated to permit exit from mitosis) to allow mitotic cyclin accumulation for the next mitosis. Additionally, Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 needs to be turned back on (it is turned off after activation of Cdc25 at G2/M) to prevent premature activation of pre-MPF during interphase. We show that Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 during G1/S progression occurs after the function of nimQ MCM2, which may involve down-regulation of Cdc25, which is activated during G2/M of the previous cycle. Because APC activity is known to remain active during G1 in both yeast (73Amon A. Irniger S. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 77: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and human cells (74Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), it is likely that cyclin B cannot normally accumulate and bind p34 cdc2 in G1 of many cell types and so they have no need to negatively regulate p34 cdc2 by Tyr-15 phosphorylation during this cell cycle stage. However, as soon as APC activity is reduced during the G1/S transition, and cyclin B begins to accumulate in preparation for the next mitosis, it becomes critical to prevent production of MPF, which is achieved by allowing Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2. A transition thus occurs, during which negative control over mitotic p34 cdc2 is transferred from the APC in G1 to include the Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 in S phase. Here we show that this transition is dependent upon nimQ MCM2 function.The requirement for nimQ MCM2 to trigger Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 at G1/S is likely to involve its capacity to promote the initiation of DNA replication as nimQ MCM2 is not required for Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 after DNA replication has been initiated (for instance, at the HU-arrest point). Additionally, as mentioned before, nimQ20 is not unique as numerous mutations have been identified that interfere with temporal control of S phase and mitosis, which also play a role in the initiation of DNA replication (63Piatti S.

We further propose that APC inactivation may occur only after Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 is activated to ensure that mitosis is not initiated in G1by accumulation of cyclin B (Fig. 7).Work using Schizosaccharomyces pombe has also indicated the existence of another level of control over mitotic p34 cdc2 during G1 because p34 cdc2 is tyrosine-dephosphorylated during M/G1 until execution of Start (75Hayles J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2760-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This pre-Start checkpoint was suggested to act in an undefined manner by preventing formation of the p34 cdc2 p56 cdc13 complex. Our studies partially support such a mechanism but, importantly, more directly implicate the APC in the pre-Start, or pre-DNA replication, negative control of p34 cdc2. It is worth pointing out that at the nimQ20arrest point some cyclin B protein is present and significant H1 kinase activity exists (Fig. 4 C). This likely helps explain why some nimQ20-arrested cells enter a mitotic state from G1/S. However, only upon inactivation of the APC by the bimE7 mutation do nimQ20-arrested cells increase cyclin B protein levels and H1 kinase activity and so overwhelmingly and rapidly enter mitosis (Fig. 4 C). The possibility exists that BIMEAPC1 also negatively regulates the NIMA kinase as NIMA is also required to promote premature mitosis in the nimQ20-arrested cells and it is unstable during exit from mitosis (76Pu R.T. Osmani S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that tyrosine-dephosphorylated p34 cdc2 in combination with lack of BIME function leads to deregulation and activation of NIMA in S phase, a point in the cell cycle when NIMA is normally inactive (13Ye X.S.

Purification of licensing factor from Xenopus egg extracts identified two complexes having licensing activity (85Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C. Blow J.J.

One of these (RFL-M) contains MCM homologues, further supporting the role of this class of protein in the regulation of DNA replication to one round per cell cycle. Our data additionally suggest a potential role for nimQ MCM2 in the regulation of SPB duplication. Inactivation of nimQ MCM2 prevents DNA replication, which normally prevents SPB reduplication (Fig.5 B). However, SPB duplication is uncoupled from these normal controls in the nimQ20 MCM2-arrested cells, leading to the production of multiple SPBs in the absence of DNA replication.The elevated numbers of SPBs generated when nimQ MCM2 is inactivated were functional because they were capable of nucleating microtubules leading to the generation of tripolar and other multipolar spindles. Indeed, at the resolution of the light microscope, many of the excess SPBs observed were similar in size to normal SPBs. A similar phenotype has been reported in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Cells containing multiple centrosomes forming tripolar and other abnormal spindles were observed in cultured mouse cells lacking p53 (87Fukasawa K. Taesaeng C. Kuriyama R. Rulong S. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1996; 271: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The defects observed in mouse cells lacking p53 are remarkably similar, in relationship to microtubule organizing centers, to what we have observed for A. nidulans cells lacking the function of an Mcm2 homologue. The potential relationship between the roles of p53 and Mcm2 in microtubule organizing center duplication will be of interest in higher eukaryotic cells.It is intriguing that a function known to be involved in the regulation of DNA replication may also play a key role in the regulation of SPB duplication. Perhaps these two levels of regulation are linked in some way via the Mcm2 function to ensure normal coupling of the DNA replication cycle and the SPB duplication cycles. However, in the present study it is not certain how Mcm2, in addition to its role in initiation of DNA replication, regulates SPB duplication. Regardless of what potential roles Mcm2 may play in the regulation of SPB duplication, the uncoupling of the SPB from the chromosomal cycle in cells lacking Mcm2 could help us understand how these two cycles are normally coordinated during the cell cycle.ConclusionsWe present a model whereby control of mitosis during the G1 to S transition is transferred from the APC in G1 to include the Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 after initiation of DNA replication (Fig. 7). This transition from APC-controlled inhibition of mitosis to inhibition by Tyr-15 phosphorylation of p34 cdc2 was revealed through examination of a mutation in the nimQ MCM2 gene, which is required for initiation of DNA synthesis. We also show that the SPB duplication cycle is uncoupled from the chromosomal cycle in cells lacking nimQ MCM2, suggesting a potential role for Mcm2 in the control of SPB duplication. The data provide a molecular logic for negative control of mitosis during G1/S, which is likely to be applicable to other eukaryotes that regulate mitotic exit via the APC and mitotic entry by Tyr-15 dephosphorylation of p34 cdc2. Promotion of mitosis is controlled by coordinate activation of the p34 cdc2 /cyclin B (1Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 2Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu.

Rapid tyrosine dephosphorylation of p34 cdc2 occurs by tipping the balance between the Wee1 kinase and the Cdc25 phosphatase to favor dephosphorylation during G2/M (9Russell P. Nurse P.
