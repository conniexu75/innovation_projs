https://openalex.org/W2032698727,"Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences can adopt noncanonical four-stranded secondary structures called guanine (G)-quadruplexes. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that G-quadruplex motifs are prevalent in genomes, which raises the need to elucidate their function. There is now evidence for the existence of DNA G-quadruplexes at telomeres with associated biological function. A recent hypothesis supports the notion that gene promoter elements contain DNA G-quadruplex motifs that control gene expression at the transcriptional level. We discovered a highly conserved, thermodynamically stable RNA G-quadruplex in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene transcript of the human NRAS proto-oncogene. Using a cell-free translation system coupled to a reporter gene assay, we have demonstrated that this NRAS RNA G-quadruplex modulates translation. This is the first example of translational repression by an RNA G-quadruplex. Bioinformatics analysis has revealed 2,922 other 5' UTR RNA G-quadruplex elements in the human genome. We propose that RNA G-quadruplexes in the 5' UTR modulate gene expression at the translational level."

https://openalex.org/W2015844604,"Phytochromes are red/far red light photochromic photoreceptors that direct many photosensory behaviors in the bacterial, fungal, and plant kingdoms. They consist of an N-terminal domain that covalently binds a bilin chromophore and a C-terminal region that transmits the light signal, often through a histidine kinase relay. Using x-ray crystallography, we recently solved the first three-dimensional structure of a phytochrome, using the chromophore-binding domain of Deinococcus radiodurans bacterial phytochrome assembled with its chromophore, biliverdin IXα. Now, by engineering the crystallization interface, we have achieved a significantly higher resolution model. This 1.45Å resolution structure helps identify an extensive buried surface between crystal symmetry mates that may promote dimerization in vivo. It also reveals that upon ligation of the C32 carbon of biliverdin to Cys24, the chromophore A-ring assumes a chiral center at C2, thus becoming 2(R),3(E)-phytochromobilin, a chemistry more similar to that proposed for the attached chromophores of cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes than previously appreciated. The evolution of bacterial phytochromes to those found in cyanobacteria and higher plants must have involved greater fitness using more reduced bilins, such as phycocyanobilin, combined with a switch of the attachment site from a cysteine near the N terminus to one conserved within the cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA domain. From analysis of site-directed mutants in the D. radiodurans phytochrome, we show that this bilin preference was partially driven by the change in binding site, which ultimately may have helped photosynthetic organisms optimize shade detection. Collectively, these three-dimensional structural results better clarify bilin/protein interactions and help explain how higher plant phytochromes evolved from prokaryotic progenitors.

They play critical roles in various light-regulated processes, ranging from phototaxis and pigmentation in bacteria to seed germination, chloroplast development, shade avoidance, and flowering in higher plants (1Vierstra R.D. Karniol B. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, Germany2005: 171-196Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Quail P.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Phys are homodimeric complexes with each polypeptide containing an N-terminal chromophore-binding domain (CBD) that autocatalytically attaches via a thioether linkage a single linear tetrapyrrole (or bilin) chromophore, a PHY domain that is important for spectral integrity, and a C-terminal domain that promotes dimerization and often signal transmission (3Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Through unique interactions among the bilin and the CBD and PHY domains, Phys can exist as two metastable conformers, a red light (R)-absorbing Pr form and a far red light (FR)-absorbing Pfr form. By photoconverting between Pr and Pfr, Phys act as unique light-regulated switches in various signal transduction cascades. In bacteria and fungi, a canonical histidine kinase (HK) domain is typically present downstream of the PHY domain, thus allowing these Phys to participate in various two-component phosphorelays (1Vierstra R.D. Karniol B. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, Germany2005: 171-196Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M.

Although higher plant Phys contain a C-terminal HK-related sequence that promotes dimerization (2Quail P.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 3Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), it remains unclear if this domain has phosphotransferase activity (6Yeh K.C. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13976-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) or is even involved in signal transmission (7Matsushita T. Mochizuki N. Nagatani A. Nature. 2003; 424: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 8Krall L. Reed J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8169-8174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite intensive physico-chemical analysis of various Phys, we do not yet understand how contacts between the polypeptide and the bilin enable photointerconversion between Pr and Pfr, how this transformation reversibly alters the activity of the photoreceptor, or how the holoprotein dimerizes (3Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Important insights were made recently with our determination of the first three-dimensional structure of the CBD domain derived from the sole bacteriophytochrome (BphP) present in the proteobacterium Deinococcus radiodurans (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This ground state Pr structure confirmed sequence predictions that the CBD is composed of Per/Arndt/Sim (PAS) and cGMP phosphodiesterase/adenyl cyclase/FhlA (GAF) domains and revealed that the GAF domain contains a deep pocket that cradles the bilin in a ZZZsyn, syn, anti conformation in the Pr form. The most unexpected feature of the DrCBD structure is the presence of a deep knot, where a conserved insertion within the GAF domain lassos the N-terminal 34 residues upstream of the PAS domain (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 10Virnau P. L A.M. Kardar M. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: 1-9Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This knot bridges the PAS and GAF domains and contacts the chromophore, suggesting that it stabilizes the CBD and possibly participates in signal transmission. The high degree of conservation for residues that form the PAS and GAF domains, contact the chromophore, and create the knot strongly suggests that the unique topology of the DrCBD is present in most, if not all, members of the Phy superfamily and probably helps generate the unique R/FR photochromic spectral properties of these photoreceptors (4Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity, there are differences in bilin preference and in the bilin attachment site between the bacterial and fungal Phys and their cyanobacterial and higher plant counterparts. In bacterial and fungal Phys, the chromophore is biliverdin IXα (BV) (11Froehlich A.C. Noh B. Vierstra R.D. Loros J. Dunlap J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2140-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which is synthesized by oxidative cleavage of heme by a heme oxygenase. BV is attached to the CBD via a thioether linkage between a conserved cysteine upstream of the PAS domain and the A-ring C3 vinyl side chain of BV (4Karniol B. Wagner J.R. Walker J.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13Lamparter T. Michael N. Caspani O. Miyata T. Shirai K. Inomata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33786-33792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cyanobacterial and higher plant Phys use phycocyanobilin (PCB) or phytochromobilin (PΦB), respectively (14Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 15Lagarias J.C. Rapoport H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4821-4828Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 16Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Gartner W. Borner T. Hartmann E. Hughes J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Production of PCB and PΦB includes enzymatic reduction of the A-ring in BV to generate an ethylidene side chain at the C3 position. The conserved cysteine attachment site for these Phys is within the GAF domain (3Rockwell N.C. Su Y.S. Lagarias J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 837-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 15Lagarias J.C. Rapoport H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 4821-4828Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Park C.M. Shim J.Y.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13487-13495Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although these differences in bilin chemistry and ligation site do not appreciably alter the ability of cyanobacterial and plant Phys to photointerconvert between Pr and Pfr, they may have important adaptive consequences for maximizing light perception. Most noticeably, they blue shift the absorption spectrum of Pr to better coincide with those of chlorophylls and thus to be more efficient in detecting shade from other photosynthetic organisms (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar, 20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-167Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). In an attempt to better define the structure of Phys, we have engineered the surface of DrCBD to optimize crystal packing and have obtained substantially higher resolution diffraction. The new 1.45 Å resolution structure supports conclusions drawn from the previous 2.5 Å model (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and unequivocally confirms that BV is linked to Cys24 via the C32 carbon of the A-ring side chain. Comparisons of the crystal contacts in the 2.5 and 1.45 Å resolution structures identified an extensive buried surface between symmetry mates that we speculate represents a biologically relevant dimerization site in the photoreceptor. The 1.45 Å resolution structure also revealed that upon ligation, BV assumes a chiral center at C2 in the A-ring and is converted to 2(R),3(E)-PΦB, a structure similar to that proposed for bound PCB and PΦB. Given this similarity of the bound bilins, we then tested the hypothesis that one key step in the evolution of higher plant Phys from bacterial BphPs involved swapping the attachment site from the N-terminal region to the GAF domain to favor PCB/PΦB ligation. Collectively, our results provide a more accurate description of the bilin-binding pocket of a Phy and offer a partial mechanism for how plant Phys evolved from prokaryotic progenitors. Protein Production and Crystallization—DrCBD encompassing the first 321 amino acids of DrBphP and containing an N-terminal T7 tag and a C-terminal His6 tag was as described (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). DrCBD-Y307S was generated by correcting the inadvertent point mutation that substituted Pro-240 for a Thr and converting the Tyr-307 codon to that for a serine with the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DrCBD-Y307S apoprotein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen, San Diego, CA) with or without simultaneous expression of the heme oxygenase from Synechocystis PCC6803 (12Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The crude lysates were incubated for 30 min with a >10-fold molar excess of BV (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT), and the resulting holoproteins were purified by sequential nickel-chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography as previously described (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Bilin binding was assayed by zinc-induced fluorescence of the chromoprotein following SDS-PAGE (12Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Optimal crystallization conditions were identified by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using the sparse matrix Cryoscreen (Nextal Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada). Each trial included 2 μl of well solution and 2 μl of 20 mg/ml DrCBD-Y307S in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Large crystals (0.2 × 0.18 × 0.08 mm) were generated with 0.095 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 19% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 19% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals were briefly washed in mother liquor and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Structure Determination—Two x-ray diffraction data sets were collected on DrCBD-Y307S crystals. One data set was collected at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI) with a Proteum CCD detector with x-rays generated by a Microstar rotating anode (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI). One degree images were captured for 360 degrees with 30-s exposure times and processed with HKL2000 and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The second data set was collected at the Advanced Photonic Source (APS, Argonne, IL) on beamline 51DB using a MAR225 detector. One degree images were captured for 180 degrees with 1.2-s exposure times. These images were integrated and scaled to the edge of the detector to a maximum resolution of 1.45 Å (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData setRotating anodeSynchrotronData collectionWavelength (Å)1.540.972No. of unique reflections17,484 (1,401)aThe value for the highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.56,868 (4,813)Resolution (Å)24-2.15 (2.23-2.15)20-1.45 (1.5-1.45)Completeness (%)96.4 (78.8)97.5 (83.3)Redundancy6.2 (2.6)3.7 (2.9)Rsymm (%)10.4 (33.3)3.9 (27.6)I/σI10.0 (2.8)12.6 (3.0)Space groupC2C2Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)89.5, 51.6, 80.989.3, 51.8, 80.4α, β, γ (degrees)90.0, 116.4, 90.090.0, 116.3, 90.0Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)24.0-2.15 (2.2-2.15)20-1.45 (1.49-1.45)R-factor (%)18.9 (21.8)16.5 (21.3)Free R-factor (%)23.7 (25.1)19.2 (27.3)Protein atoms2,4452,531Solvent molecules111301Heteroatoms4343Dual conformers1025Isotropic average temperature factors (Å2)Overall32.424.2Protein atoms32.623.2Heteroatoms22.921Water molecules31.832.1Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0140.012Bond angles (degrees)1.81.8Estimated coordinate error (Å2)0.140.044a The value for the highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Phases for both x-ray data sets were determined by molecular replacement with the program AmoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-167Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar), using the previously described DrCBD structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1ZTU (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)) without the chromophore or His6 tag as the search model. Unambiguous solutions for both DrCBD-Y307S data sets were nearly identical with correlation coefficients of 68.2 and 67.0 and R-factors of 42.6 and 38.5% for the low resolution and high resolution data sets, respectively. After an initial round of positional refinement with Refmac5 (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar), electron density maps were constructed; nearly all of the residues from the search model correctly fit into a 2Fo - Fc electron density map. The protein-chromophore linkage was modeled by creating a modified amino acid consisting of a cysteine bonded via a thioether linkage to the C32 carbon of the A-ring vinyl group of BV. To account for the rotation of the D-ring, the energy penalty for rotation about the C15=C16 double bond in this adduct was removed. This adduct was introduced into the structure using the Fo - Fc difference electron density maps, and the model was again refined with Refmac5 (24Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Based on interpretation of both the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps generated from data to 1.45 Å, the double bond in the A-ring was removed from between the C2 and C3 carbons and introduced between the C3 and C31 carbons, and the restraints forcing the A-ring to be planar and parallel with the B- and C-rings were released. Both models were refined by iterative rounds of model building with Xfit (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) or COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) and TLS and positional refinement with Refmac5 (24Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The final models have excellent geometry and appropriate R-factors (Table 1). In both models, the 16 N-terminal residues (13 of which comprise the T7 tag) and the 5 C-terminal histidines of the His6 tag were not modeled because of disorder. Although the model constructed from the 1.45 Å data set exhibited no gaps in the polypeptide chain, several residues forming the linker between the PAS and GAF domains were omitted in the 2.15 Å model. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure figures were generated with PyMOL (Delano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the 2.15 and 1.45 Å resolution models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (25Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27325) Google Scholar) under accession codes 2O9B and 2O9C, respectively. Native Size Determinations—The coding sequence for DrCBD-PHY (amino acids 1-501) was PCR-amplified from the full-length DrBphP construction by using primers designed to introduce BamHI and XhoI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The BamHI-XhoI-digested PCR product was cloned into pET21b(+) (Novagen), which was similarly digested, to direct the expression of DrCBD-PHY bearing an N-terminal T7 tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. Nickel-chelate affinity-purified fulllength DrBphP, DrCBD-PHY, DrCBD, and DrCBD-Y307S were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and resuspended in 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of ∼5 mg/ml. Dynamic light scattering was performed using a DynaPro (Protein Solutions/Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) multiangle light scattering instrument with a 5 mg/ml concentration of each DrBphP dissolved in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Approximate molecular radii assuming spherical proteins were calculated by the Dynamics software package (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The column was calibrated using the gel filtration standards from Bio-Rad. Nondenaturing PAGE was performed as described (26Book A.J. Yang P. Scalf M. Smith L.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and ovalbumin (Sigma) as standards (16Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Gartner W. Borner T. Hartmann E. Hughes J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Analysis of Site-directed Mutants—The PAS and GAF cysteine codon mutations were generated by the QuikChange method using the full-length DrBphP construction bearing a C-terminal His6 tag (12Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To assess chromophore preference, the apoproteins were expressed as above without co-expression of Synechocystis heme oxygenase (12Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and assembled with the chromophore in vitro, using a >10-fold molar excess of either BV, PCB purified from Spirulina platensis (27Terry M.J. Maines M.D. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26099-26106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or various ratios of BV and PCB. The assembled proteins were purified from the crude lysates by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. Absorption and difference spectra were obtained with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 650 spectrophotometer following saturating irradiations with R (690 or 660 nm) and FR (770 nm) enriched by interference filters. To quantitate binding efficiency of BV relative to PCB, the absorbance maxima of BV- and PCB-bound proteins were identified in the Soret and Q bands for the Pr spectrum generated by each BV/PCB mixture. By incorporating these absorbance values in the ratio (QBV/QPCB)/(SoretBV/SoretPCB), the relative contributions of BV-bound and PCB-bound holoproteins in the mixtures were calculated. These ratios were normalized by subtracting the value calculated for the 100% PCB sample (100% PCB-bound sample now represented 0% BV incorporation) from all other values and scaling all of the adjusted values so that the values from samples generated solely with BV equaled 100%. Crystal Lattice Engineering Leads to a High Resolution Structure of DrCBD—To better define the structure of BV and its interactions with the CBD and to generate crystals suitable for time-resolved x-ray analysis of the Pr to Pfr phototransformation, we sought to improve the diffraction resolution of DrCBD crystals. We noticed a chemically impossible overlap of symmetry-related Tyr-307 side chains in the 1ZTU structure (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) that could create local disorder detrimental to crystal formation (Fig. 1A). To reduce this conflict, we replaced Tyr-307 with Ser (Fig. 1B), reasoning that a substitution of residue 307 should not appreciably affect DrCBD folding or photochemical activity, given its surface location and considerable distance from the chromophore (Fig. 1C). Indeed, the DrCBD-Y307S apoprotein was stable and soluble and readily assembled with BV to generate a chromoprotein spectrophotometrically indistinguishable from DrCBD following R or FR irradiation. 4J. R. Wagner, J. Zhang, R. D. Vierstra, and K. T. Forest, unpublished data. DrCBD-Y307S holoprotein did not crystallize under the previously described condition (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), but in subsequent unbiased screens, we identified new conditions that readily generated bright blue crystals in the space group C2. Importantly, the DrCBD-Y307S crystals yielded data sets to maximum resolutions of 2.15 and 1.45 Å using x-rays generated from a rotating anode and synchrotron radiation, respectively (Table 1). From this pair of data sets, two models for DrCBD-Y307S were created by molecular replacement and subsequent refinement (Table 1). Whereas the prior 2.5 Å model lacked several residues in two disordered loops (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), the 1.45 Å model for DrCBD-Y307S includes all 318 residues of the CBD with no breaks in the polypeptide chain from amino acid 4 to 322 (Fig. 1D). Alternate conformations were modeled for 25 mostly solvent-exposed residues; however, even in this high resolution structure, seven disordered side chains were truncated to alanine. Although DrCBD-Y307S crystallized in a different space group than DrCBD, the 1ZTU model and the new structure were remarkably coherent, with a least squares alignment of all protein backbone atoms yielding a root mean square deviation of 0.49 Å2. Even the structure of α8 surrounding residue 307 was not substantially altered, indicating that the Tyr to Ser substitution in DrCBD-Y307S had minimal impact on CBD folding. The adjacent α4 was slightly distorted, presumably to accommodate the altered crystal packing (Fig. 1, A-C). In contrast to the clash at Tyr-307 with its symmetry mate in the DrCBD structure, the Ser at this position in the DrCBD-Y307S structure pointed away from its symmetry mate, which we presume improved crystal packing (Fig. 1B). The higher resolution model confirmed the presence of the knot between the GAF and PAS domains (Fig. 1D), along with the positioning of Ile35 and Gln36 at its center (9Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). As recently noted by Virnau et al. (10Virnau P. L A.M. Kardar M. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: 1-9Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar) in a large scale survey of knotted protein structures, the knot in DrCBD has four crossover points and is thus defined as a figure-of-eight knot (Fig. 1, D and E). Although we have not explicitly addressed the mechanism of protein folding in our current work, we note parenthetically that this accurately refined CBD structure revealed a cis peptide bond at Asp235-Pro236 within the extended GAF insertion that forms the knot crossover (Fig. 1D). Cis-trans isomerization of prolines is well known to be a rate-limiting step in protein folding in general (28Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and is important for the folding of at least one knotted protein (29Mallam A.L. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For this reason, we speculate that the proline-rich nature of the GAF insertion (5 prolines within 15 residues) and in particular the cis conformation of Pro236 could be critical in stabilizing intermediate folded states until the knot is threaded and the hydrophobic amino acids in the GAF domain insertion condense around the invariant Ile35 within the N-terminal extension. Dimerization of DrCBD—Our previous 2.5 Å resolution structure of DrCBD contained a large contact surface between 2-fold symmetry mates. Although we altered a residue in this crystallographic interface and obtained a different space group (C2 versus P2121"

https://openalex.org/W2011251205,"Telomerase is an essential cellular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that solves the end replication problem and maintains chromosome stability by adding telomeric DNA to the termini of linear chromosomes. Genetic mutations that abrogate the normal assembly of telomerase RNP cause human disease. It is therefore of fundamental and medical importance to decipher cellular strategies for telomerase biogenesis, which will require new insights into how specific interactions occur in a precise order along the RNP assembly pathway. Here we use a single-molecule approach to dissect the individual assembly steps of telomerase. Direct observation of complex formation in real time revealed two sequential steps of protein-induced RNA folding, establishing a hierarchical RNP assembly mechanism: interaction with the telomerase holoenzyme protein p65 induces structural rearrangement of telomerase RNA, which in turn directs the binding of the telomerase reverse transcriptase to form the functional ternary complex. This hierarchical assembly process is facilitated by an evolutionarily conserved structural motif within the RNA. These results identify the RNA folding pathway during telomerase biogenesis and define the mechanism of action for an essential telomerase holoenzyme protein."

Interaction of cytochrome c reductase (complex III) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was investigated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Projection maps at 15Å resolution of supercomplexes III2 + IV1 and III2 + IV2 were obtained by electron microscopy. Based on a comparison of our maps with atomic x-ray structures for complexes III and IV we present a pseudo-atomic model of their precise interaction. Two complex IV monomers are specifically attached to dimeric complex III with their convex sides. The opposite sides, which represent the complex IV dimer interface in the x-ray structure, are open for complex IV-complex IV interactions. This could lead to oligomerization of III2 + IV2 supercomplexes, but this was not detected. Instead, binding of cytochrome c to the supercomplexes was revealed. It was calculated that cytochrome c has to move less than 40Å at the surface of the supercomplex for electron transport between complex III2 and complex IV. Hence, the prime function of the supercomplex III2 + IV2 is proposed to be a scaffold for effective electron transport between complexes III and IV.

On a global scale, aerobic respiration provides most of the energy for metabolism and cellular activity. In prokaryotes and mitochondria of eukaryotes it is based on the occurrence of membrane bound oxidoreductase complexes termed complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), complex II (succinateubiquinone oxidoreductase), complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase or cytochrome bc1 complex), and complex IV (cytochrome c-O2 oxidoreductase), which together constitute the respiratory chain. The main task of the respiratory chain is to generate the electrochemical proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes or the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes, which is utilized by complex V (ATP synthase) to synthesize ATP (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 2Schägger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence now that three of the respiratory chain complexes and the ATP synthase complex are part of defined supramolecular structures termed respiratory supercomplexes. Mainly due to employment of the detergent digitonin for mild solubilization and Blue native (BN) 4The abbreviations used are: BN, Blue native; EM, electron microscopy; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.-PAGE for purification, various supercomplexes were isolated and characterized in several organisms (see Refs. 2Schägger H.

Plant Mitochondria, Annual Plant Reviews Series. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK2007Google Scholar for recent reviews). One main group of supercomplexes consists of combinations of complexes I, III, and IV; one other supercomplex is a homodimer of complex V. At least two forms of yeast III + IV supercomplexes were identified by two-dimensional BNSDS-PAGE: a III2 + IV1 and a III2 + IV2 supercomplex (5Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Although structural evidence is so far lacking, inhibitor titration studies, gel filtrations, and immunoprecipitations further support the occurrence of III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes in yeast (5Cruciat C.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In bovine heart mitochondria, up to four copies of complex IV might be bound to dimeric complex III (6Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian I + III2 + IV1-4 supercomplexes were described and named “respirasomes” because they are composed of three of the respiratory chain complexes, which deliver most of the proton motive force to yield ATP (6Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Also in bacteria respiratory complexes were reported to form defined supercomplexes (8Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stroh A. Anderka O. Pfeiffer K. Yagi T. Finel M. Ludwig B. Schägger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5000-5007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In schematic “text book” representations of the respiratory chain its individual protein complexes are commonly depicted as single copies in a flat membrane, but this is actually an oversimplification of the overall membrane organization. The inner mitochondrial membrane is heavily folded into lamellar or tubular structures termed cristae. In addition, the cristae membrane morphology is dynamic and regulated, at least in part, by proteins that control inter-mitochondrial fission and fusion (10Mannella C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy three-dimensional reconstructions of quickly frozen mitochondria give the impression of a dynamic interconnected membrane continuum. The lipid to protein ratio within the inner mitochondrial membrane is as low as 1:2-3 (11Schwerzmann K. Cruz-Orive L.M. Eggman R. Sänger A. Weibel E.R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There are many indications that this tight packing of proteins in a heavily folded membrane very much restricts the free movement of protein complexes (12Allen R.D. Schroeder C.C. Fok A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2233-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). At the same time, the specific way of membrane protein packing most likely influences membrane morphology. Hence, for a closer understanding of respiration, it is necessary to characterize the supramolecular structure of the building blocks of the cristae membranes. Recently, the first projection maps of respiratory supercomplexes were obtained by single particle electron microscopy. Characterization of a I + III2 supercomplex of Arabidopsis revealed lateral association of dimeric complex III to the membrane arm of complex I (13Dudkina N.V. Eubel H. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, lack of a high-resolution structure of the membrane arm of complex I has so far prevented insight into the precise subunit interactions responsible for formation of this supercomplex. The structure of a dimeric ATP synthase supercomplex was characterized for bovine, Polytomella, and yeast (14Minauro-Sanmiguel F. Wilkens S. Garcia J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12356-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Dudkina N.V. Heinemeyer J. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3427-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interaction of the monomers takes place between their F0 parts and the long axes of the monomers form angles of up to 90°, resulting in strong local bending of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This bending is believed to be a prerequisite for cristae formation, because yeast mutants lacking dimer-specific ATP synthase subunits lack ATP synthase dimers and at the same time have a flat inner membrane without the characteristic foldings (17Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 2: 221-230Crossref Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 18Giraud M.F. Paumard P. Soubannier V.

A first projection map of the mammalian I1 + III2 + IV1 supercomplex was also presented recently (19Schäfer E. Seelert H. Reifschneider N. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Vonck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15370-15375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but lack of detail prevents a consistent modeling of the individual complexes within it. So far, the interaction of complexes III and IV within respiratory supercomplexes is the least understood and therefore was addressed by our current investigation. The advantage of characterizing III-IV supercomplexes is that high resolution structures of the individual complexes III and IV are available. We have chosen to work on the III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because they were previously shown to be rather stable (5Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The tightly associated lipid cardiolipin was found to stabilize this supercomplex (20Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43553-43556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 21Pfeiffer K. Gohil V. Stuart R.A. Hunte C. Brandt U. Greenberg M.L. Schägger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52873-52880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Moreover, S. cerevisiae does not possess a respiratory chain complex I involved in proton translocation, which reduces the complexity of this supramolecular system. Here, we report projection maps of yeast III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes on the basis of single particle electron microscopy using a set of 86,000 single projections. Various side views and angled side views of particles could be assigned to the supercomplexes. Based on a comparison of our maps for the III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes with the existing atomic x-ray structures for the individual complexes III2 (22Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and IV (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar), we present a model on their precise interaction. Within the III2 + IV2 supercomplex, complex IV is specifically attached to complex III2 as a monomer on two opposite sides. Complex IV interacts with complex III2 with its convex side which is opposite to the dimer interface within dimeric complex IV as revealed by x-ray crystallography. This supramolecular configuration most likely forms the basis for efficient electron transfer from complex III2 to complex IV by cytochrome c, which is partially attached to the III2 + IV2 supercomplex. Cultivation of S. cerevisiae—S. cerevisiae (strain Y187) was cultivated in YPD medium (1 liter of YPD medium contains: yeast extract (10 g), bactopeptone (20 g), d(+)-glucose (20 g)). For mitochondrial isolations, cells were transferred into Lactate medium (2.6 mm glucose, 7.3 mm KH2PO4, 18.7 mm NH4Cl, 4.5 mm CaCl2, 8.6 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm MgCl, 2.2% lactate). Preparation of Mitochondria—Isolation of yeast mitochondria was based on differential centrifugations and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described by (31Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were shock-frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Characterization of Mitochondrial Protein Complexes by Blue Native PAGE—Mitochondria from yeast were solubilized by digitonin solution (5% digitonin, 30 mm HEPES, 150 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerine, pH 7.4), and protein complexes were separated by one-dimensional Blue native PAGE (32Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 33Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). For subunit analysis, gel stripes including the resolved protein complexes were transferred horizontally onto a second gel dimension, which was carried out in the presence of SDS (two-dimensional Blue native/SDS-PAGE). For supercomplex analysis, gel stripes of the Blue native gel were incubated in transfer solution (0.03% dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris, 0.02% Coomassie 250G, pH 7.0) and resolved by another Blue native PAGE (6Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 34Sunderhaus S. Eubel H. Braun H.P. Leister D. Herrmann J. Mitochondrial Genomics and Proteomics Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology Series. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2006Google Scholar). Gels were either Coomassiestained (35Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar) or stained by an in-gel activity assay for cytochrome c oxidase (36Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Purification of Supercomplexes III2 + IV2—The membranebound protein complexes of yeast were solubilized using digitonin solution (5% digitonin, 30 mm HEPES, 150 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) and separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (gradients of 0.3-1.5 M sucrose, 15 mm Tris base, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, 0.2% digitonin; centrifugation for 17 h at 150,000 × g at 4 °C). Afterward, the gradients were fractionated and the protein complex compositions of the fractions analyzed by one-dimensional Blue native PAGE. Electron Microscopy—Selected fractions of the gradients including supercomplexes of complex III and complex IV were directly used for electron microscopy and single particle analyses. Samples of purified complexes were negatively stained by using the droplet method with 2% uranyl acetate on glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grids. Electron microscopy was performed on a CM120 electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) operated at 120 kV. Images were recorded under low dose conditions (a total dose ∼25 e-/Å2) with a 4000 SP 4K slow-scan CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) at -340 nm defocus and at the final magnification of 80,000 at the level of the CCD camera with GRACE software for semi-automated specimen selection and data acquisition (37Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The pixel size (after binning the images) was 3.75 Å at the specimen level. In total, about 4.300 images were recorded and over 86,000 single particle projections were selected for image analysis. A major part of the projections was selected using Boxer, a graphical program for semiautomatic particle selection from EMAN software package (38Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Single-particle analysis was performed with the Groningen Image Processing (GRIP) software package on a PC cluster. Selected single-particle projections were aligned by multireference and reference-free alignment procedures (37Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 39Van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Particles were then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis followed by hierarchical classification (39Van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). From the whole data set, almost 85% of single particles were assigned to specific supercomplexes, of which the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes were present in almost equal amount (about 44 and 41%, respectively). Final two-dimensional projection maps of different angular views of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes were calculated from the best resolved classes, which represented about 20% of whole data set. The remaining classes represented the same views of supercomplexes, however, with less resolved features. Resolution was measured using Fourier-ring correlation and the 3 σ criterion (40Van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 95-100Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of the yeast cytochrome c reductase (22Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and the bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar) were used for generating the pseudo-atomic model of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes (the Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1KB9 and 1OCC, respectively). Mammalian subunits Cox VIIb and Cox VIII, which are not present in the yeast cytochorme c oxidase, were removed from the x-ray data file. Atomic coordinates of cytochrome c were obtained from (22Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (the Protein Data Bank accession number 1KYO). Pseudo-atomic models of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes were constructed manually using Swiss Protein Data Bank viewer (41Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). First, a starting model of the most symmetrical view of the III2 + IV2 supercomplex (Fig. 5A) was constructed. Importantly, a contact (or a distance) between the complexes III and IV in the starting model was such that there were no clashes detected between transmembrane helices of the complexes III and IV within 2 Å. Afterward, the model of the III2 + IV2 supercomplex was closely fitted into the EM averaged projection. Subsequently, the tilted views of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes (coordinates of one complex IV monomer were deleted from the Protein Data Bank file) were generated solely by a rotation of the whole starting model and manually fitted into the tilted EM projections. If structural inconsistencies were found, the starting model was modified. The position of complex IV with respect to complex III was repeatedly changed by a rotational increment of about 20° followed by fine shifts and rotations until all generated models of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes closely matched the EM maps. Different views of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes were finally displayed using PyMOL software (42DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Truncated versions and two-dimensional projection maps of the generated models for the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes at 15 Å resolution were generated using routines from the EMAN package (38Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). All Complex IV Is Bound to a Dimeric Complex III2 Scaffold—The presence and composition of complex III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes after membrane solubilization with the detergent digitonin was first explored by BN-PAGE (Fig. 1). Using one-dimensional native gels, III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes are visible at ∼650 and ∼850 kDa in accordance with previous investigations (6Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional BN/BN-PAGE system, which is carried out in the presence of digitonin for the first gel dimension and in the presence of dodecylmaltosid for the second, was employed to investigate the protein complex composition of the two supercomplexes. Under the conditions applied, both supercomplexes are dissected into monomeric complex IV (∼200 kDa) and dimeric complex III (∼450 kDa) as reported previously (6Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The ratio of complex IV to complex III2 clearly differs within the supercomplexes, with complex IV being relatively less abundant within the smaller supercomplex. The two supercomplexes were interpreted as supercomplex III2 + IV1 (650 kDa) and III2 + IV2 (850 kDa). In-gel complex IV activity staining reveals that complex IV of the supercomplex is active (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, activity staining reveals that all complex IV is present within the two supercomplexes. No free monomeric (∼200 kDa) or dimeric (∼400 kDa) forms of complex IV were detected upon detergent solubilization, indicating that complex IV is completely bound to dimeric complex III within the yeast mitochondrial membrane. Multiple Projection Views of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 Supercomplexes—To obtain III2 + IV1-2 supercomplexes free of Coomassie Blue, which might alter supercomplex structure due to the introduction of negative charge, proteins of digitonin-treated mitochondrial fractions were resolved by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2A). The protein complex content of the fractions of the gradient was subsequently analyzed by one-dimensional BN-PAGE. Sucrose gradient fractions 4 and 5 were found to include the 650- and 850-kDa supercomplexes in the purest form. Separation of the subunits of the two supercomplexes by two-dimensional BN-SDS-PAGE revealed the known subunits of the complexes III and IV, which previously were identified by cyclic Edman degradation (6Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens of the sucrose gradient fractions 4 and 5 revealed the presence of complexes with variable size and shape, which could potentially represent views of the III2 + IV1 and III2 + IV2 supercomplexes with varying orientations on the carbon support film (Fig. 3). From about 4300 electron micrographs, all plausible projections of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes were selected and a data set of over 86,000 single particle projections was subjected to image analysis. The analysis revealed that fraction 4 was almost free of other supercomplexes, whereas fraction 5 (Fig. 3) also contained dimeric ATP synthase particles, which have a very different shape. (An analysis of 20,000 supercomplex V2 projections is presented in (16Dudkina N.V. Sunderhaus S. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3427-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). Fig. 4 shows the gallery of the best resolved two-dimensional projection maps obtained by statistical analysis and classification. Fig. 4A represents the most symmetrical view of the supercomplex. As the central part of the supercomplex exhibits the characteristic shape and features of the x-ray structure of dimeric complex III and the dimensions of the two additional densities are similar to the dimensions of the x-ray model of complex IV, the averaged projection in Fig. 4A could be unambiguously assigned to the side view of the III2 + IV2 supercomplex (see below). Fig. 4, B-H, represents averaged projections of slightly tilted views of the III2 + IV2 supercomplex. In addition to the III2 + IV2 supercomplex, different projections of a smaller supercomplex containing only one copy of complex IV were also found (Fig. 4, I-N). Interestingly, extensive analysis of the whole data set revealed about 100 particles which show characteristic features of the III2 + IV2 supercomplex, and one or two additional densities on the intermembrane-space-exposed side of the supercomplex (Fig. 4, O and P, respectively). This additional density is attached to complex III2 at the position of the mobile electron transporter cytochrome c, as present in the x-ray structure of the complex III2+cytochrome c particle of yeast (22Lange C.

Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and bovine heart complex IV (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar), as the x-ray structure of the yeast complex IV has not been solved yet. Although the bovine heart complex IV contains two additional subunits (Cox7b and Cox8) compared with yeast complex IV, the overall structure of the yeast complex IV can be considered to be similar to its mammalian counterpart (24Khalimonchuk O. Rödel G. Mitochondrion. 2005; 5: 363-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). First, the largest core subunits Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3, which represent the major part and active core of the complex, are highly conserved in eukaryotes. Second, the other subunits are less conserved, however, they are smaller than the core subunits and several of them, including Cox7b and Cox8, are represented merely by a single transmembrane helix. As the resolution in the best EM projections was about 15 Å, we assume that the x-ray structure of the bovine complex with excluded Cox7b and Cox8 subunits can be substituted for the structure of the yeast complex IV. Unambiguous assignment of the complex III dimer to the central part of the supercomplex is facilitated by the characteristic shape and well resolved features of the almost 100-kDa membrane-protruding core 1 and 2 subunit moieties (Fig. 4). This implies that complex IV is peripherally located. One copy is flanking each side of the complex III dimer in the III2 + IV2 supercomplex, which means that complex IV is not present as a dimer in the supercomplex, although it is present as a dimer in the crystals used for structure determination (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). It is also obvious that one copy of complex IV is lacking in a substantial number of particles (Fig. 4, I-N). Determination of the exact orientation of complex IV was more difficult due to the presence of a detergent shell and less resolved features of the complex IV in the projection maps. The availability of various angular projections of the III2 + IV2 and III2 + IV1 supercomplexes turned out to be crucial for an unambiguous assignment of the complex IV orientation and its interaction with the complex III2 within the supercomplex. A pseudoatomic model of the whole supercomplex was constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”) and compared with different angular projection maps of the I"

Nitrite reacts with deoxyhemoglobin in an allosteric reaction that generates NO and oxidizes deoxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. NO then reacts at a nearly diffusion-limited rate with deoxyhemoglobin to form iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, which to date has been considered a highly stable adduct and, thus, not a source of bioavailable NO. However, under physiological conditions of partial oxygen saturation, nitrite will also react with oxyhemoglobin, and although this complex autocatalytic reaction has been studied for a century, the interaction of the oxy- and deoxy-reactions and the effects on NO disposition have never been explored. We have now characterized the kinetics of hemoglobin oxidation and NO generation at a range of oxygen partial pressures and found that the deoxy-reaction runs in parallel with and partially inhibits the oxy-reaction. In fact, intermediates in the oxy-reaction oxidize the heme iron of ironnitrosyl-hemoglobin, a product of the deoxy-reaction, which releases NO from the iron-nitrosyl. This oxidative denitrosylation is particularly striking during cycles of hemoglobin deoxygenation and oxygenation in the presence of nitrite. These chemistries may contribute to the oxygen-dependent disposition of nitrite in red cells by limiting oxidative inactivation of nitrite by oxyhemoglobin, promoting nitrite reduction to NO by deoxyhemoglobin, and releasing free NO from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin.

The reaction of nitrite with deoxyhemoglobin (referred to as the “deoxy-reaction”) was first fully characterized by Brooks in 1937 (26Brooks J. Proc. R. Soc. Med. 1937; 123: 368-382Crossref Google Scholar) and by Doyle et al. in 1981 (27Doyle M.P. Pickering R.A. DeWeert T.M. Hoekstra J.W. Pater D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12393-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Equation 1, in an anaerobic environment nitrite is reduced to NO, whereas deoxyhemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin. This mechanism provides for effective pH and oxygen sensing, as both deoxyhemoglobin and a proton are required for the reaction (17Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A.

Nitrite(NO2−)+deoxyhemoglobin(FeII)+H+←NO+metemoglobin(FeIII)+OH− We have also shown that the deoxy-reaction is allosterically regulated with maximal rates of nitrite reduction around the P50 of hemoglobin (7Crawford J.H.

Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This occurs secondary to the higher maximal nitrite reductase activity of R-state hemoglobin (the lower redox potential of the heme tetramer in the R-state is associated with a higher bimolecular rate constant for nitrite reduction) and the amount of T-state deoxyhemoglobin available for nitrite binding (17Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Notably, NO has very high affinity for the ferrous heme and binds deoxyhemoglobin with a ka of 2 × 107m-1 s-1 (29Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 290-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). NO, therefore, reacts with red cell deoxyhemoglobin at a nearly diffusion-limited rate to yield iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin (Equation 2) (30Kim-Shapiro D.B. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which has always been considered a highly stable adduct with a kd of 3 × 10-3 s-1 (29Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 290-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). NO+deoxyhemoglobin(FeII)←iron−nitrosyl−hemoglobin(FeII−NO) A major challenge to the hypothesis that deoxyhemoglobin is a physiological nitrite reductase is that the scavenging of NO by deoxyhemoglobin (Equation 2) should sequester any generated NO (31Luchsinger B.P.

Physiol. 2005; 67: 99-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). If deoxyhemoglobin irreversibly binds NO, then iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin produced by this mechanism cannot contribute to nitrite-mediated hypoxic vasodilation. Yet, studies of NO gas inhalation in humans have demonstrated increases in red cell iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin and plasma nitrite concentrations associated with peripheral NO-dependent vasodilation (3Cosby K.

Moreover, despite the apparent biochemical stability of iron-nitrosyl heme, artery-to-vein gradients of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin were observed by reductive chemiluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in humans breathing NO gas, suggesting rapid in vivo dissociation of NO from the heme under these conditions (2Gladwin M.T.

Indeed, because NO affinity for heme is 100,000-fold greater than that of oxygen and 1,000-fold greater than that of CO, physiological mechanisms should exist to remove NO from deoxyheme and limit NO poisoning during conditions of high NO output such as septic shock or cigarette smoking. Interestingly, certain heme oxidants such as ferricyanide and peroxynitrite accelerate NO release from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin via the oxidation of the ferrous nitrosyl (FeII-NO) to the ferric nitrosyl (FeIII-NO) heme (2Gladwin M.T.

Cho M. Spencer N.Y. Patel N. Huang Z. Shields H. King S.B. Gladwin M.T. Hogg N. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We, therefore, considered the possibility that the oxidative reaction of nitrite and oxyhemoglobin could facilitate the release of NO from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin. The reaction of nitrite with oxyhemoglobin (referred to as the “oxy-reaction”) has been studied for over a century. It is a complex autocatalytic reaction that ultimately oxidizes oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin and nitrite to nitrate (42Kim-Shapiro D.B. Gladwin M.T. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 43Kosaka H. Imaizumi K. Tyuma I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 702: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This reaction demonstrates unique autocatalytic kinetics, as it is initially slow (lag or induction phase) but ultimately enters a rapid autocatalytic (or propagation) phase involving radical-mediated chain reactions and branching steps. Although the mechanism of the oxy-reaction is not fully understood, it proceeds via key catalytic intermediates, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2·) and ferrylhemoglobin (FeIV=O) (44Lissi E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1535-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although these intermediates clearly oxidize hemoglobin and may similarly oxidize FeII-NO to FeIII-NO, the disposition of iron-nitrosylhemoglobin when the oxy-reaction (generating oxidative intermediates) and the deoxy-reaction (producing iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin) occur in parallel has never been explored. We, therefore, studied the reaction of hemoglobin with nitrite at a range of oxygen partial pressures and found that intermediates of the oxy-reaction oxidize the ferrous heme of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin and release NO from the ferric heme. This reaction also quenches oxy-reaction intermediates, thereby limiting autocatalysis. These results help explain numerous paradoxes in the field of NO-hemoglobin chemistry, such as the short half-life of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin in human circulation during NO inhalation (2Gladwin M.T.

Preparation of Hemoglobin and Myoglobin Reagents—All reagents were prepared at 25 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Purified horse heart myoglobin was purchased from Sigma and reduced by incubation of an anaerobic myoglobin stock solution with 500 mm sodium hydrosulfite. Excess sodium hydrosulfite was removed by passage through two sequential Sephadex G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Human hemoglobin was prepared by hypotonically lysing erythrocytes, discarding membrane fractions after centrifugation, and dialyzing against 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with storage of the hemolysate at -80 °C as previously described (17Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Iron-nitrosylhemoglobin and iron-nitrosyl-myoglobin were synthesized by anaerobic incubation of 150 mm deoxyhemoglobin or deoxymyoglobin with 450 mm PROLI NONOate (Alexis Biochemicals). Excess PROLI NONOate was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column. Hemoglobin was oxidized to methemoglobin by the reaction of hemoglobin with 20 mm potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), which was subsequently removed by passage through two sequential Sephadex G-25 columns. Nitrite-methemoglobin and nitrite-metmyoglobin were prepared by incubation of methemoglobin or metmyoglobin with 150 mm sodium nitrite. Ferrylhemoglobin and ferrylmyoglobin were prepared by incubation of methemoglobin with a 100-fold excess hydrogen peroxide and metmyoglobin with a 2.5-fold excess hydrogen peroxide. Carboxyhemoglobin was prepared by incubation of deoxyhemoglobin under positive CO pressure with a channel for gas escape. Oxygen saturation and concentration of heme species were measured by visible absorption spectroscopy (HP8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer; Hewlett-Packard) followed by deconvolution of the spectrum into components from standard spectra of hemoglobin or myoglobin using least squares analysis as previously described (17Huang Z. Shiva S. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Patel R.P. Ringwood L.A. Irby C.E. Huang K.T. Ho C. Hogg N. Schechter A.N. Gladwin M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Standard reference spectra were composed of oxyhemoglobin (-myoglobin), deoxyhemoglobin (-myoglobin), iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin (-myoglobin), methemoglobin (-myoglobin), nitrite-methemoglobin (-myoglobin), and ferrylhemoglobin (-myoglobin). Carboxyhemoglobin was included only when reaction solution was exposed to CO gas. Each reaction was deconvoluted at greater than 70 time points (or with a minimum interval of 0.5 s between time points for shorter reactions). Reactions of Nitrite with Hemoglobin—All reactions were run at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The anaerobic reaction was carried out with 50 μm deoxyhemoglobin and 10 mm sodium nitrite in anaerobic buffer. The aerobic reaction was carried out with 50 μm oxyhemoglobin and 10 mm sodium nitrite while open to room air. Reactions with partially oxygenated hemoglobin were run using a 50 μm hemoglobin solution that was partially deoxygenated under positive helium pressure to the desired oxyhemoglobin concentration and immediately reacted with 10 mm sodium nitrite. During the anaerobic and partially oxygenated reactions, oxygen leak into the system was prevented by application of positive helium pressure without a channel for gas escape. Reaction kinetics were monitored by absorption spectroscopy in a glass cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Experiments with greater than 0.05% methemoglobin or oxyhemoglobin (for anaerobic reactions) before the addition of nitrite were always discarded. The concentrations of heme species at each time point were determined by least squares spectral deconvolution using standard reference spectra as described above. The instantaneous reaction rates were measured as the instantaneous rate of deoxy- or oxyhemoglobin consumption (negative change of deoxyor oxyhemoglobin concentration with respect to the time interval). Aerobic Reaction of Nitrite with Hemoglobin or Myoglobin in the Presence of Exogenous Iron-Nitrosyl-Heme or Met-Heme—Reactions were carried out open to room air at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and monitored by absorption spectroscopy in a glass cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. 50 μm hemoglobin was reacted with 5 mm sodium nitrite alone and with the addition of 15 μm iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin or 15 μm methemoglobin. Similarly, 50 μm myoglobin was reacted with 1 mm sodium nitrite alone and with the addition of 15 μm iron-nitrosyl-myoglobin or 15 μm metmyoglobin. Oxyhemoglobin-Nitrite Reaction in the Presence of Iron-Nitrosyl-Hemoglobin Monitored by Absorption Spectroscopy and Chemiluminescence—25 μm oxyhemoglobin, 3 μm iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, and 0.0134% antifoam B emulsion were incubated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 24 °C for 30 s, and 5 mm sodium nitrite was added to initiate the reaction. One reaction was carried out open to room air and was monitored spectrophotometrically in a glass cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. A parallel reaction was carried out in a purge vessel in line with a chemiluminescent NO gas analyzer (Sievers NO analyzer; GE Analytical Instruments) for detection of NO; the vessel was purged with oxygen. Oxygenation of the Deoxyhemoglobin-Nitrite Reaction Monitored by Absorption Spectroscopy and Chemiluminescence—25 μm deoxyhemoglobin was reacted with 5 mm sodium nitrite and 0.0134% antifoam B emulsion in anaerobic 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 24 °C. One reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically in a glass cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. After 3 min the reaction vessel was rapidly opened to room air and mixed with oxygen for 5 s to achieve full oxygenation. A parallel reaction was carried out in a purge vessel in line with a chemiluminescent NO gas analyzer for detection of NO. The anaerobic reaction was purged with helium for 3 min and was then rapidly oxygenated by switching the purging gas to oxygen; oxygenation was confirmed by detecting the color change of the hemoglobin solution from burgundy to bright red. EPR Spectroscopy with Spectral Deconvolution of the Oxyhemoglobin-Nitrite Reaction in the Presence of Iron-Nitrosyl-Hemoglobin—65 μm oxyhemoglobin and 15 μm iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin were incubated in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 26 °C for 3 min 17 s, when 1 mm sodium nitrite was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was monitored by absorption spectroscopy in a 1-cm path length glass cuvette, with 500-μl fractions of the reaction periodically withdrawn, frozen in liquid nitrogen in quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad LabGlass), and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. Iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin was measured using a Bruker EMX 10/12 spectrometer operating at 9.4 GHz, 5-G modulation, 10.1-milliwatt power, 655.36-ms time constant, and 167.77-s scan or 327.68-ms time constant and 83.89-s scan over 600 G at 110 K. The concentration of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin measured by EPR was determined by double integral calculation and comparison to standard samples. The concentrations of heme species measured by absorption spectroscopy were determined by least squares spectral deconvolution using standard spectra as described above. EPR Spectroscopy with Spectral Deconvolution of Deoxy-to-Oxy Cycling of the Hemoglobin-Nitrite Reaction—80 μm deoxyhemoglobin was reacted with 1 mm sodium nitrite in anaerobic 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 26 °C. After 19 min the reaction vessel was mixed with oxygen for 10 s to achieve full oxygenation and was subsequently maintained under positive oxygen pressure. The reaction was monitored by absorption spectroscopy in a 1-cm path length glass cuvette, with 500-μl fractions of the reaction periodically withdrawn by gas-tight syringes, placed into helium-purged anaerobic quartz EPR tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subjected to analysis by EPR spectroscopy as described above.

This post-translational modification alters protein function, and its reversal (deglutathionylation) is catalyzed specifically and efficiently by glutaredoxin (GRx, thioltransferase), a thioldisulfide oxidoreductase. We hypothesized that changes in glutaredoxin might be important in the development of diabetic retinopathy, a condition characterized by oxidative stress. Indeed, GRx protein and activity were increased in retinal homogenates from streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Also, incubation of rat retinal Müller cells (rMC-1) in normal glucose (5 mm) or diabetic-like glucose (25 mm) medium led to selective upregulation of GRx in contrast to thioredoxin, the other thioldisulfide oxidoreductase system. Under analogous conditions, NF-κB (p50-p65) translocated to the nucleus, and expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), a transcriptional product of NF-κB, increased. Proinflammatory ICAM-1 is increased in diabetic retinae, and it is implicated in pathogenesis of retinopathy. To evaluate the role of GRx in mediating these changes, intracellular GRx content and activity in rMC-1 cells were increased independently under normal glucose via infection with an adenoviral GRx1 construct (Ad-GRx). rMC-1 cells exhibited adenovirus concentration-dependent increases in GRx and corresponding increases in NF-κB nuclear translocation, NF-κB luciferase reporter activity, and ICAM-1 expression. Blocking the increase in GRx1 via small interfering RNA in rMC-1 cells in high glucose prevented the increased ICAM-1 expression. These data suggest that redox regulation by glutaredoxin in retinal glial cells is perturbed by hyperglycemia, leading to NF-κB activation and a pro-inflammatory response. Thus, GRx may represent a novel therapeutic target to inhibit diabetic retinopathy.

Thus, GRx may represent a novel therapeutic target to inhibit diabetic retinopathy. Reactive oxygen species are redox signals essential to physiological processes, but they can disrupt normal redox signaling, damage cell components, and irreversibly oxidize cellular proteins when produced in excess (1Finkel T.

Thus, oxidative signals promote protein modifications on redox-sensitive cysteine sulfhydryls in a continuum of oxidative states from redox-activated signal transduction to oxidative stress-induced molecular damage (3Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).

S-nitrosylated proteins (protein-SNO), and S-glutathionylated proteins (protein-SSG) are thought to protect against irreversible oxidation (3Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar), and S-glutathionylation is likely the predominant physiological sulfhydryl modification due to the abundance of cellular glutathione (5Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5947) Google Scholar) and the ready conversion of cys-SNO and cys-SOH moieties to cys-SSG (6Thomas J.A. Mallis R. Gitler C. Danon A. S-Nitrosylation, and Irreversible Sulfhydryl Oxidation: Roles in Redox Regulation, in Cellular Implications of Redox Signaling. Imperial College Press, London2003: 258-264Google Scholar). S-Glutathionylation results in protein-specific functional changes (activation or deactivation), important in regulation of signaling mediators involved in cellular processes. For example, S-glutathionylation activates Ras and leads to downstream phosphorylation of Akt and p38, increased protein synthesis, and cell proliferation (7Adachi T. Pimentel D.R. Heibeck T. Hou X.

In contrast, glutathionylation inactivates PTP1B phosphatase, which consequently amplifies the effects of kinase activation in associated signaling pathways (8Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Konig S.

Reversal of S-glutathionylation, i.e. deglutathionylation, is catalyzed specifically and efficiently by the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase enzyme glutaredoxin (GRx) (10Gravina S. Mieyal J.

This characteristic has led to the use of GRx as a diagnostic tool, whereby reversal of protein functional changes by GRx, both in biochemical analysis and in cell culture studies, is interpreted as regulation by S-glutathionylation (13Hamnell-Pamment Y.

Accordingly, alterations in the activity of GRx in cells in the context of diseases that involve oxidative stress would be expected to perturb sulfhydryl homeostasis and redox signaling. With this in mind, we were interested in the status of redox regulation in diabetes, where the hyperglycemia produces a state of chronic oxidative stress leading to a variety of complications such as retinopathy. Retinas from diabetic animals show numerous abnormalities consistent with oxidative stress (17Du Y. Smith M.A. Miller C.A. Kern T.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Kowluru R.A. Tang J. Kern T.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and the retinopathy is being interpreted by many investigators as an inflammatory disease (19Joussen A.M. Poulaki V. Le M.L. Koizumi K. Esser C. Janicki H. Schraermeyer U. Kociok N. Fauser S. Kirchhof B. Kern T.S. Adamis A.P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1450-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 20Zheng L. Szabo C.

Sci. 2005; 46: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Increased adhesion of leukocytes to the wall of retinal vessels has been linked to increased vascular permeability and capillary cell death, and each of these has been linked to increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in retinas of diabetic animals (19Joussen A.M. Poulaki V. Le M.L. Koizumi K. Esser C. Janicki H. Schraermeyer U. Kociok N. Fauser S. Kirchhof B. Kern T.S. Adamis A.P.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Retinal glial (Müller) cells from diabetic rats also display increased ICAM gene expression (21Gerhardinger C. Costa M.B. Coulombe M.C. Toth I. Hoehn T. Grosu P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), suggesting a contribution to the inflammatory response. Müller cells play an essential support role in the retina, interacting with nearly all the other retinal cells, spanning 70% of the width of the retina, acting as metabolic regulators, and storing most of the retinal glutathione content (23Pow D.V. Crook D.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 193: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Schutte M. Werner P. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 246: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Newman E. Reichenbach A. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose an immortalized rat retinal glial cell line (rMC-1) as the model system for the current study. ICAM-1 expression is regulated by NF-κB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor composed of NF-κB/Rel family protein dimers (p50/p105, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52/p100, and RelB) (26Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 27Ledebur H.C. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 933-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), where p50-p65 is the classical and predominant active dimer in most cell types. NF-κB is activated in retinal glial cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells in diabetes (this study and Refs. 20Zheng L. Szabo C. Kern T. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar and 28Romeo G. Liu W. Asnaghi V. Kern T.S. Lorenzi M.

In this regard, many proteins that are implicated in the pathway of regulation of NF-κB activity have been reported to have their functions altered by S-glutathionylation in different contexts. These proteins include p50, p65, IKK, Akt, MEKK-1, and NF-κB-inducing kinase (29Pineda-Molina E. Klatt P. Vazquez J. Marina A. Lacoba M.G. de Perez-Sala D. Lamas S.

The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that the oxidative stress associated with high glucose alters glutaredoxin-regulated redox signaling in retinal glial cells. Here we report that high glucose induces glutaredoxin in retinal Müller cells, with concomitant NF-κB activation and increased ICAM-1 expression. Overexpression of glutaredoxin in these cells in normal glucose leads to analogous increases in NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression. Conversely, knock-down of GRx1 in cells in high glucose prevents the induction of ICAM-1. These data suggest that redox regulation by glutaredoxin in retinal glial cells is perturbed by hyperglycemia, leading to NF-κB activation and a pro-inflammatory response. Cell Culture—Cell culture supplies were obtained from Invitrogen except where indicated. Rat retinal glial (Müller) cells (rMC-1) were a kind gift from Dr. Vijay Sarthy (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Cells were cultured for up to 5 days in high glucose (25 mm) or normal glucose (5 mm) in DMEM with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Fisher, Cellgro MT) and 2 mm glutamine with daily replacements in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Glucose concentrations in the medium were monitored with a glucose oxidase kit (Pointe Scientific) to ensure that glucose consumption of the cells did not deplete the medium. HEK 293 cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Animal Retinae—Treatment of animals was in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on Treatment of Animals in Research and Case Western Reserve University guidelines. Animals were treated with streptozotocin to induce diabetes and with insulin to prevent wasting, as described previously (17Du Y. Smith M.A. Miller C.A. Kern T.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Retinas were excised from rats 10 weeks after induction of streptozotocin-induced diabetes or from non-diabetic control rats and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 150 mm NaCl. GRx Activity of Rat Retinal Homogenates—Rat retinal homogenates (0.1–0.2 mg) were assayed for GRx activity via GSH-dependent release of radiolabel (as [35S]GSSG) from the prototype substrate [35S]BSA-SSG as described previously (12Chrestensen C.A.

Cellular Disulfide Reducing Capacity of Intact rMC-1 Cells— Müller cells (50,000–100,000 cells/60-mm dish) were cultured in normal or high glucose medium for 3–5 days and assayed for disulfide reducing capacity (36Biaglow J.E. Donahue J. Tuttle S. Held K. Chrestensen C. Mieyal J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with two different cell permeable disulfides. Reduction of bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide (HEDS) is attributable to total reducing capacity (thioredoxin (TRx) and GRx systems), and lipoate reduction is selective to the TRx system (36Biaglow J.E. Donahue J. Tuttle S. Held K. Chrestensen C. Mieyal J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 5 ml of medium containing 5 mm HEDS or 5 mm lipoate. Aliquots of the medium were taken at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min and added to separate wells of a 96-well plate containing dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid (1 mm final) in each well, and absorbance change at 405 nm for each well was monitored in a plate reader. The functional extinction coefficient (6.1 mm–1) was determined from a standard curve for GSH using the dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid assay with 0.2 ml of total volume in each well and reading absorbance values with a Molecular Devices THERMOmax™ microplate reader. Data were analyzed with the Molecular Devices SOFTmax® version 2.3. Propagation and Titration of Adenoviral Constructs in HEK 293 Cells—Adenoviral vector containing the GRx1 cDNA construct (Ad-GRx) and empty vector control construct (Ad-Empty) were created with the CRE-Lox recombination system in collaboration with Dr. Yong Lee (University of Pittsburgh, PA) (37Song J.J. Rhee J.G. Suntharalingam M. Walsh S.A. Spitz D.R. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46566-46575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the adenovirus was propagated and titrated in HEK 293 cells. For propagation, HEK 293 cells were infected with 5 plaque-forming units/cell of adenovirus (Ad-GRx or Ad-Empty). Medium and cells were collected when the cells lifted off the plate (usually after 3–6 days). The cells were lysed via freeze-thaw three times, and then virus was collected by centrifugation at 2,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For adenoviral titration, HEK 293 cells were infected with serial dilutions (0–1014) of stock virus, overlaid with 0.9% low melting point agarose, and incubated until plaques stopped forming (usually 5–7 days). Virus concentration (plaque-forming units/ml) was calculated by dividing the number of plaques by the volume of adenovirus used to infect the cells. Adenoviral Expression of GRx1 in Müller (rMC-1) Cells— Müller cells (500,000 cells/100-mm dishes) were grown in normal glucose medium for 2 days and infected with various multiplicities of infections (m.o.i. 0–80) of Ad-GRx or Ad-Empty in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM for 1 h. Cells were cultured for 2 days in normal glucose medium and collected in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm NaCl). Inhibition of Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB via sn50 in Adenoviral Overexpressing rMC-1 Cells—Müller cells (500,000 cells/100-mm dishes) were grown in normal glucose medium for 2 days, infected with m.o.i. 10 of Ad-GRx in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM for 1 h in the absence or presence of sn50 inhibitor (BIOMOL). Cells were subsequently cultured in normal glucose medium in the absence or presence of sn50 inhibitor and collected in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Control cultures (uninfected and m.o.i. 10 of Ad-Empty) were incubated in parallel in the absence of sn50. Immunoblotting—Müller cells were collected, lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Cleared supernatants were assayed for protein content with the microbicinchoninic acid method (BCA) (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were mixed 4:1 with 4× SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% SDS (w/v), 1% bromphenol blue, and 20 mm dithiothreitol), heated for 15 min at 95 °C, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Tokyo). Membranes were immunoprobed with the appropriate antibodies: anti-p50 (1:1,000) (ab7971) (AbCam, Cambridge, MA); anti-p65 (1:3,000) (sc372) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-ICAM-1 (1:500) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); anti-GAPDH (1:10,000) (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA); anti-actin (1:30,000) (Sigma); anti-yy1 (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-GRx1 (1:1,000) (generated and purified via an adaptation of the McKinney and Parkinson caprylic acid method (38Gravina S. Characterization and Kinetic mechanism of Thioltransferase. 1993; (Ph.D. thesis, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH)Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:10,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). were used, and Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Band intensities were quantified using a Bio-Rad calibrated imaging densitometer GS-710 with Bio-Rad Quantity One software version 4.1.1. Changes in band intensity are reported as ratios relative to loading controls. Nuclear Extraction—Müller (rMC-1) cells were collected in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged for 3 min at 800 × g, and lysed in 300 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min. Centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min yielded a cytosolic supernatant. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in 80 μl of high salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 30 min 4 °C, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min in 4 °C. Protein content was determined via BCA assay. NF-κB Luciferase Reporter Assay—Müller (rMC-1) cells (50,000 cells/well of a 6-well dish) were grown for 2 days and co-transfected for 10–12 h with 1 μg of NF-κB luciferase (5×) plasmid (Stratagene) and 0.1 μg of Renilla plasmid (Promega) as a control reporter according to the Lipofectamine™ reagent protocol (Invitrogen). The binding element for the NF-κB luciferase plasmid is derived from the consensus NF-κB binding sequence and contains five repeats of (TGGGACTTTCCGC). 2–4 h after the end of the transfection, cells were infected with Ad-GRx or Ad-Empty for 1 h and collected 8 h later in 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). NF-κB activity was assayed via the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega, Madison WI) with the Molecular Devices Lmax luminometer and SOFTmax PRO software. Assay readouts were reported as ratios of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase. GRx1 Knockdown via siRNA—Müller (rMC-1) cells (30,000–40,000 cells/well of a 6-well dish) were grown in high glucose (25 mm) for 1 day, transfected with Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA targeted to rat GRx1 or ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL non-targeting pool siRNA according to manufacturer's instruction for Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), and grown in high glucose for three subsequent days. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for immunoblotting with antibodies directed toward GRx1, ICAM-1, actin, and GAPDH. Statistical Analysis—All values and graphs report means ± S.E. (S.E.). Statistical analysis was determined via the Student's t test. Differences displaying p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. GRx Is Induced in Diabetic Rat Retinae—Retinae from non-diabetic rats and rats diabetic for 10 weeks were homogenized and assayed for GRx activity to assess whether the diabetic condition altered global glutaredoxin activity. In fact, the GRx activity of diabetic rat retinae was increased ∼2.5-fold relative to control (Fig. 1). These data reflect the collective change in GRx activity for all cells comprising the retina, although the extent of change in any of the individual cell types is not known. We reasoned that retinal Müller cells comprise a large portion of the total retina and influence the vitality of neighboring cells. Therefore we conducted further studies with this well known in vitro model. High Glucose Selectively Induces GRx in Müller Cells—To elucidate changes in sulfhydryl homeostasis in the retinal glial (Müller) cells in response to high glucose, the rat Müller cell line (rMC-1) was used, and the cells were cultured under conditions mimicking diabetes (i.e. 25 mm glucose in the medium). The cells were assayed for cellular disulfide reducing capacity with two different disulfide substrates to distinguish the relative contributions of the glutaredoxin and TRx systems in the intact cells (36Biaglow J.E. Donahue J. Tuttle S. Held K. Chrestensen C. Mieyal J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the disulfide reducing capacity of cells is attributable to the two cytosolic thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase enzyme systems, i.e. GRx and TRx and their corresponding reductase systems (GSH, glutathione disulfide reductase, NADPH) and (thioredoxin reductase, NADPH), respectively. Reduction of HEDS is attributable to total reducing capacity (GRx and TRx systems), and lipoate reduction is attributable to the TRx system alone. Therefore changes in the capacity of the respective systems can be distinguished. After 3–5 days of high glucose treatment, the activity of the TRx system (rate of lipoate reduction) of Müller cells was not significantly changed (Fig. 2), and TRx protein was unchanged in Western blot analysis (data not shown). However, the total reducing capacity (rate of HEDS reduction) was increased by nearly 2-fold (Fig. 2), indicating that the change in total disulfide reducing capacity is due to a selective increase in activity of the GRx system. Since this result suggests a selective induction of GRx in the Müller cells in response to high glucose (25 mmd-glucose), we examined the content of GRx1 directly. Consistent with high glucose-induced GRx activity, GRx1 protein expression was increased more than 2-fold according to Western blot analysis of lysates from glucose-treated Müller cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In separate experiments, it was confirmed that no change in GRx1 content occurred when cells were incubated in 25 mml-glucose as a control for increased osmolarity (data not shown).FIGURE 3Effects of high glucose (25 mm) on GRx1 and ICAM-1 proteins in rMC-1 Müller cells. After 5 days in normal (5 mm) or high (25 mm) glucose medium, Müller cells were lysed and immunoprobed with anti-ICAM-1 (1:500) or anti-GRx1 (1:1,000). Anti-GAPDH (1:10,000) was used as a loading control. High glucose induced GRx1 expression by 2.3-fold (± 0.3) (A and B) and ICAM expression by 3-fold (± 0.7) (C and D)(n = 5). *, p < 0.05.

High Glucose Leads to Increased Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB (p50 and p65) in Müller Cells—To test whether the observed increase in ICAM-1 production in Müller cells is mediated by NF-κB, we measured changes in nuclear NF-κB after incubation in high glucose. The p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB in the nucleus increased by about 2–3-fold, whereas cytoplasmic contents were essentially unchanged (Fig. 4, A–C). The concomitant increase in GRx1, NF-κB translocation, and ICAM-1 expression in response to high glucose suggested that GRx1 might be directly responsible for regulating NF-κB activity and ICAM-1 expression in Müller cells. Therefore we tested this hypothesis directly. Infection of Müller Cells in Normal Glucose with Adenovirus Containing cDNA for GRx1 Leads to Increased GRx1 Content and Activity and Concomitant Increase in ICAM-1 Production— We selectively increased GRx activity in Müller cells grown in normal glucose conditions (5 mm) by overexpressing GRx1 using adenovirus containing GRx1 cDNA (Ad-GRx). Infection of the cells with empty vector (Ad-Empty) served as control. Ad-GRx increased cellular GRx1 content and activity in an m.o.i.-dependent fashion (Figs. 5, A and B, and 6, respectively). GRx activity correlated well to GRx protein content at most m.o.i., but cells infected with Ad-GRx at m.o.i. 40 showed an unexplained high amount of GRx1 protein content. Ad-Empty had"

Here, we report that PARP-1 enzymatic activity is inhibited by macroH2A, a vertebrate histone H2A variant that is enriched on facultative heterochromatin. MacroH2A family members have a large C-terminal non-histone domain (NHD) and H2A-like histone domain. MacroH2A1.2 and PARP-1 interact in vivo and in vitro via the NHD. The NHD of each macroH2A family member was sufficient to inhibit PARP-1 enzymatic activity in vitro. The NHD of macroH2A1.2 was a mixed inhibitor of PARP-1 catalytic activity, with affects on both catalytic activity and the substrate binding affinity of PARP-1. Depletion of PARP-1 by RNA interference caused reactivation of a reporter gene on the inactive X chromosome, demonstrating that PARP-1 participates in the maintenance of silencing. These results suggest that one function of macroH2A in gene silencing is to inhibit PARP-1 enzymatic activity, and this may affect PARP-1 association with chromatin.

These results suggest that one function of macroH2A in gene silencing is to inhibit PARP-1 enzymatic activity, and this may affect PARP-1 association with chromatin. In eukaryotic cells DNA is packaged into chromatin, and this packaging impacts all DNA-templated processes, including transcription. Regulated changes in chromatin structure are crucial to establish and maintain the diverse expression profiles that characterize the hundreds of cell types in multicellular organisms (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The nucleosome is the structural unit of chromatin and comprises 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, which is composed of two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.Chromatin structure can be affected through the action of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes or by the covalent modification of histone proteins, creating binding sites for additional regulatory proteins (1Kornberg R.D.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). PARP-1 is the prototypical member of a family of PARP proteins, which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose units from donor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) molecules to target proteins (5Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). PARP-1 functions as a structural component of chromatin, modulator of chromatin structure, and a sensor of DNA damage through its intrinsic enzymatic activity (4Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 6Rouleau M. Aubin R.A. Poirier G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 7Hassa P.O.

In the absence of NAD+, PARP-1 binds to nucleosomes, compacts chromatin, and inhibits transcription in vitro (3Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Furthermore, catalytically inactive PARP-1 maintains silencing of heterochromatic retrotransposons in Drosophila (8Tulin A. Stewart D. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2108-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, at physiological concentrations of NAD+, PARP-1 is enzymatically active and does not bind nucleosomes (3Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Despite this, PARP-1 binds chromatin in vivo and is implicated in transcriptional silencing, suggesting that modulation of PARP-1 activity in vivo may be a mechanism that is employed to direct changes in chromatin structure.Chromatin structure can also be regulated by replacement of core histones with histone variants. MacroH2A1 and macroH2A2 are vertebrate-specific variants that replace H2A in an estimated three percent of nucleosomes (9Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). MacroH2A family members consist of a histone domain that is highly similar to H2A and a large C-terminal non-histone domain (NHD). The NHD domain is related to a family of proteins that includes a class of ADP-ribose processing enzymes and NAD+ metabolite binding proteins (10Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M.

MacroH2A1 consists of two isoforms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, that are produced by alternative splicing and differ by only 30 amino acids in the NHD.

MacroH2A1 is also required for silencing of the IL-8 gene in a cell-type specific fashion, indicating that it regulates gene expression at individual loci as well as larger domains (19Agelopoulos M. Thanos D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Both the H2A-like domain and the NHD of macroH2A are implicated in regulation of gene expression. When the macroH2A1 H2A-like domain is incorporated into nucleosomes, it interferes with SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling in vitro (20Angelov D. Molla A. Perche P.Y. Hans F. Cote J. Khochbin S. Bouvet P.

Here, we provide evidence for a mechanism by which macroH2A can regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. We find that macroH2A associates with PARP-1 through the NHD in vivo and in vitro and that macroH2A blocks PARP-1 enzymatic activity in vitro. We also demonstrate that the NHD of macroH2A can promote recruitment of PARP-1 to the Xi. Finally, knockdown of PARP-1 results in reactivation of a gene on the Xi, consistent with a role for PARP-1 in maintenance of heterochromatic silencing. Together, these data suggest that transcriptional repression by macroH2A may be mediated through recruitment of PARP-1 and inhibition of its enzymatic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHEK293 Cell Culture and Immunopurification—5 × 108 293 cells or 293-histone-green fluorescent protein (GFP) cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). The resulting lysate was sonicated and centrifuged to remove debris, and the extract was adjusted to 1.8 mg ml-1. GFP-tagged histones were affinity purified from the supernatant from 293-histone-GFP cells using 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) per mg of cell extract. Endogenous macroH2A1 was purified from the supernatant of 293 cells using 20 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 (24Chu F. Nusinow D.A. Chalkley R.J.

Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for 2 h and captured on protein-A-coated magnetic beads (Dynal), and the beads were washed three times in room temperature lysis buffer. Construction of H2A-GFP and macroH2A1.2-HD-GFP was performed by PCR of sequences from cDNAs generated from HEK293 cells and cloning into a backbone originating from pBOS-H2B-GFP (Clontech), generating a construct that expresses either H2A or macroH2A-HD tagged with GFP on the C terminus. After sequencing to ensure integrity, plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and stable lines were selected for using Blasticidin S (Invitrogen).

Cells were then washed twice in PBS, swollen in 0.075 m KCl for 30 min at 37 °C. Approximately 10,000 cells were spun down onto ethanol washed slides at 1300 rpm for 10 min in a Shandon Cytospin. Cells were then incubated in KCM buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 8 min, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde diluted in 1x PBS for 10 min, and washed in PBS + 0.2% Tween 20, then processed for immunofluorescence as described (26Plath K.

All microscopy was performed on an Olympus BX-60 Fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera and Openlab Digital Darkroom software (Improvision).Protein Purification—All macroH2A non-histone domain GST/His6 constructs were generated by PCR cloning and insertion into pGEX-4T bacterial expression construct, followed by sequencing to ensure integrity of plasmids. BL21-DE3pLysS (Stratagene) bacteria transfected with constructs were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after growth to an absorbance of A600 0.6 for 3 h and harvested. Cells were lysed in EQ buffer (50 mm sodium Phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml Aprotinin, 1 μm Leupeptin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, loaded onto Talon Metal affinity beads, washed with 20 column volumes of EQ buffer, then 5 column volumes of high salt EQ buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) to ensure removal of contaminating DNA, washed in 10 column volumes of EQ buffer with 20% glycerol, and then eluted with buffer EQoff (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 150 mm imidazol, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Fractions containing eluted proteins were then bound to glutathione resin in EQ buffer with 2 mm DTT added, washed in GST wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT). Proteins were eluted in GST wash buffer plus 10 mm glutathione, then dialyzed against GST dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol). FLAG-tagged human PARP-1 was expressed and purified from bacculovirus infected SF9 insect cells as described previously (3Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).GST IP Protocol of Recombinant and in Vitro Transcribed Proteins—PARP-1 in vitro transcription templates were generated using PCR primers that allowed for the addition of a T7 promoter to the 5′ end and introduction of a HA epitope to the C terminus of the PARP-1 fragment. Templates were added to a TNT T7 Quick for PCR DNA (Promega) in vitro transcription and translation kit to generate HA-tagged proteins. 500 nm GST bait constructs were mixed with 75 nm FLAG-hPARP-1 or 16% of in vitro translated and transcribed PARP-1 pieces in GST IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF) and incubated with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, then washed five times with 1 ml of GST IP buffer, then boiled in SDS-loading buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant PARP-1 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-PARP-1 antibody directed against the DNA-binding region (3Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and HA was detected using mouse anti-HA.11 (Covance) 1:1000.PARP Enzyme Assays—PARP-1 activity assays to determine an IC50 with macroH2A family members were performed under the following conditions (1 μl of high specific activity human PARP-1 (Trevigen), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 400 μm NAD+, and [32P]NAD+ to a final specific activity of 0.5 μCi/nmol NAD+) in a final volume of 100 μl. Inhibition by Gst-macroH2A1.2-NHD-His deletion constructs was performed in 100-μl assays with 65 nm purified FLAG-hPARP-1, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 400 μm NAD+, and [32P]NAD+ to a final specific activity of 0.5 μCi/nmol NAD+. Kinetic analysis of GST-macroH2A1.2-NHD-His of PARP-1 was performed as above, except trichloroacetic acid-precipitatable counts were normalized for the specific activity of NAD+ for each reaction (μCi/nmol NAD+). Each reaction was incubated with either 10 μl of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) or the appropriate purified GST construct in dilution buffer. PARP-1 and GST constructs were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C, then NAD+ was added for 10 min at 30 °C, and reactions were stopped with the addition an icecold solution of 5% trichloroacetic acid/1% inorganic phosphate. Reactions were precipitated on ice for 10 min, spun at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and washed twice more with ice cold 5% trichloroacetic acid/1% inorganic phosphate. Precipitatable counts were measured using a Beckman scintillation counter. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitatable PARP activity was in the linear range for reaction conditions (data not shown).Short Hairpin RNA Interference (shRNAi) and X Chromosome Reactivation Experiments—Plasmid for RNAi constructs carrying short hairpin RNA sequences expressed under the control of the U6 or the H1 promoter were made as previously described (27Brummelkamp T.R.

Mel-18 and macroH2A1 RNAi plasmid have been described previously (18Hernandez-Munoz I. Lund A.H. van der Stoop P. Boutsma E. Muijrers I. Verhoeven E. Nusinow D.A. Panning B.

Reactivation of GFP in SV40 T antigen-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts with the X-inactivated GFP transgene was performed as described before (18Hernandez-Munoz I. Lund A.H. van der Stoop P. Boutsma E. Muijrers I. Verhoeven E. Nusinow D.A. Panning B. Marahrens Y. van Lohuizen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7635-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, Phoenix cells were transfected and used to generate retroviral stocks, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts cultures were transduced with the viral supernatants in the presence of polybrene (4 μg/ml). Puromycin selection was added to the cultures 24 h after viral transduction (4 μg/ml). After selection, the cells were exposed to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC)(4 days at 300 nm) and to 500 nm trichostatin A (TSA) for the last 24h. The cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis counting a minimum of 100,000 cells per sample. Experiments were performed in duplicate at least three times.RESULTSMacroH2A1.2 Associates with PARP-1 via the NHD— MacroH2A1.2 contains a large C-terminal NHD of unknown function. To investigate function of the NHD, we identified proteins that associated with full-length macroH2A1.2 (mH2A1.2) but not canonical H2A or the histone domain of macroH2A1 (mH2A1-HD). HEK293 cell lines expressing mH2A1.2, H2A, or the mH2A1-HD fused to GFP were generated. All three GFP-tagged histones were detected in the nucleus and on mitotic chromosomes, demonstrating they were incorporated into chromatin (data not shown). Whole cell extracts from all three histone-GFP lines and HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibodies. SYPRO Red staining of immunoprecipitated material showed co-precipitation of the core histones with the GFP-tagged histones (Fig. 1A), confirming that all three fusion proteins were incorporated into chromatin. A prominent band of ∼110 kDa present only in the mH2A1.2-GFP immunoprecipitates was identified as PARP-1 by mass spectrometry, a protein implicated in regulation of chromatin structure. Western blotting of GFP immunoprecipitates confirmed that mH2A1.2-GFP exhibited significant PARP-1 binding, while H2A-GFP and mH2A1-HD-GFP did not (Fig. 1B). In addition, we detected co-precipitation of endogenous PARP-1 with macroH2A1 from HEK293 cells, using polyclonal antiserum that recognizes both macroH2A1 splice variants (mH2A1.1 and mH2A1.2 (24Chu F. Nusinow D.A. Chalkley R.J. Plath K. Panning B. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 194-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); Fig. 1C). Together, these data show that mH2A1.2 interacts physically with PARP-1 and that the interaction requires the NHD.MacroH2A1.2 is enriched on the Xi relative to the active X chromosome and autosomes, and sequences sufficient for enrichment on the Xi lie within the mH2A1-HD (21Perche P.Y.

Valley C.M. Willard H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2699-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We examined whether PARP-1 was also enriched on the Xi by immunostaining for PARP-1 in mitotic chromosome spreads from the macroH2A1.2-GFP, mH2A1-HD-GFP, H2A-GFP, and parental HEK293 cell lines. In mitotic spreads from HEK293 cells, PARP-1 was not appreciably detectable (data not shown). While the H2A-GFP line showed an overall increase in the amount of PARP-1 staining of all chromosomes, it did not show enrichment of PARP-1 on a particular chromosome. Both mH2A1.2-GFP and mH2A1.2-HD-GFP are enriched on the Xi (24Chu F. Nusinow D.A. Chalkley R.J. Plath K. Panning B. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 194-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which allows for easy identification of the Xi in spreads. In the mH2A1.2-GFP line, PARP-1 was enriched on the Xi in 79.3 ± 5.1% of spreads (Fig. 1D), while in the mH2A1-HD-GFP line PARP-1 was enriched on the Xi in 1 ± 0.8% of spreads (n = 400). These data indicate that enrichment of macroH2A1.2-GFP on the Xi promotes PARP-1 association in vivo, consistent with a role for the NHD in recruiting PARP-1.The PARP-1 Catalytic Domain Interacts with the MacroH2A1.2 NHD—To test whether the macroH2A1.2 NHD and PARP-1 interact directly, in the absence of additional proteins, as well as to map the domains of each protein required for association, we performed in vitro binding assays. The NHD consists of a basic region, a leucine zipper-like region, and an ADP-ribose phosphoesterase-like region (Fig. 2A). We expressed and purified GST and His6-tagged mH2A1.2-NHD, basic region (Basic), leucine zipper-like region (LZ), ADP-ribose phosphoesterase-like region (ADP), and the NHD without the leucine zipper-like region (NHDΔLZ). These were employed as bait in pulldown experiments, using recombinant, FLAG-tagged PARP-1 as the prey. PARP-1 associated strongly with the NHD, the leucine zipper-like region, the ADP-ribose phosphoesterase-like region, and the NHD without the leucine zipper-like region (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7) but not with the basic region or GST alone (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 5). Thus, both the leucine zipper-like region and the ADP-ribose phosphoesterase-like region of the mH2A1.2-NHD can each independently interact with PARP-1 in vitro.FIGURE 2Mapping of the PARP-1 and macroH2A1.2 NHD interaction.

PARP-1 consists of a zinc finger (ZnF) DNA binding region, a BRCA1 C-terminal repeat region (BRCT) automodification domain, and a catalytic (CAT) domain (Fig. 2C). HA-tagged versions of these three regions of PARP-1 were transcribed and translated in vitro and used as prey in the presence of GST-His6 tagged mH2A1.2-NHD, which served as bait. Compared with GST-alone, the GST-mH2A1.2-NHD interacted with the zinc finger region (Fig. 2D, lane 8) and interacted even more strongly with the catalytic domain of PARP-1 (Fig. 2D, lane 12). The mH2A1.2-NHD did not interact with the BRCT automodification domain (Fig. 2D, lane 10). These data show that multiple domains of each protein facilitate direct interaction of macroH2A1.2 with PARP-1.The MacroH2A NHD Inhibits PARP-1 Enzymatic Activity— The interaction between the macroH2A1.2 NHD and the catalytic domain of PARP-1 prompted us to investigate whether the NHD had any affect on PARP-1 catalytic activity. Human PARP-1 and [32P]NAD+ were incubated with GST-mH2A1.2-NHD-His6, GST, or buffer alone and the products of the PARP-1 enzymatic reaction visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The high molecular weight smear observed when PARP-1 and [32P]NAD+ were incubated with buffer or GST alone is indicative of the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) oligomers to PARP-1 or PARP-1 automodification (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). GST-mH2A1.2-NHD-His6 significantly inhibited PARP-1 automodification relative to buffer or GST alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). Quantitation of PARP-1 activity showed that GST-mH2A1.2-NHD-His6 inhibited PARP-1 enzymatic activity by ∼10-fold (Fig. 3B). To examine whether inhibition of PARP-1 was a common feature of the macroH2A family, we purified and tested the NHDs of other macroH2A variants: macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). We found that GST fusions of these NHDs also inhibited PARP-1 activity ∼10-fold (Fig. 3B). In titration experiments, the NHDs of all three macroH2A isoforms exhibited a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ≈100 ± 20 nm (Fig. 3C), indicating that the ability to inhibit PARP-1 enzymatic activity is conserved amo"

Nature. 1980; 283: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and is now known to be an important regulator of the excitability of many neuronal cell types in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The characteristic voltage and time dependence of the M-current leads to a “clamping” of the resting membrane potential upon activation of the current. The M-current therefore exerts a stabilizing effect on the resting membrane potential and attenuates neuronal excitability, thus limiting repetitive firing of neurons (2Marrion N.V. Annu. Rev.

Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are associated with epilepsy, in particular, benign neonatal familial seizures, and suppression of the M-current in conditional transgenic mice has been reported to cause spontaneous seizures (7Robbins J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 9Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). At the single channel level, the M-current has been reported to be regulated by several receptor-mediated pathways and changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (reviewed in Refs. 2Marrion N.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar and 10Delmas P. Brown D.A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 850-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the factors that determine the cell surface density of the channels that underlie this current. One recently characterized mechanism for the regulation of cell surface levels of membrane proteins is ubiquitination by the Nedd4 Nedd4-2 ubiquitin ligases, which results in the removal of the protein from the membrane (reviewed in Refs. 11Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and 12Abriel H. Staub O. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This mechanism was originally identified in the regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC (13Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar); however, Nedd4/4-2 are now known to regulate a diverse number of ion channels, receptors, and transporters in a variety of tissues. In neurons, these include voltage-gated Na+ channels (14Fotia A.B. Ekberg J. Adams D.J. Cook D.I. Poronnik P. Kumar S. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8195-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nedd4/4-2 contains a HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) ubiquitin ligase domain, an N-terminal C2 domain involved in membrane localization, and four WW (Trp-Trp) domains. These WW domains typically bind to PY motifs (PPXY) in the C terminus of target proteins (20Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 21Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); however, Nedd4/Nedd4-2 can also regulate proteins that lack these motifs (16Henke G. Maier G. Wallisch S. Boehmer C. Lang F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Boehmer C. Palmada M. Rajamanickam J. Schniepp R. Amara S. Lang F. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The C termini of both KCNQ3 and KCNQ2 contain atypical PY motifs PPX- PPY and XPXPPY. We have recently shown that the PPXPPY sequence in the Cl- channel ClC-5 binds Nedd4-2 and that this interaction controls cell surface levels of ClC-5 in the proximal tubule cells (23Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L. Kumar S. Guggino W.B. Cook D.I. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54996-55007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of these motifs in the C terminus of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 suggests a potential role for Nedd4/Nedd4-2 in the regulation of these channels, and the current study was undertaken to explore this possibility. Plasmids and Expression Constructs—Rat KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were received from Dr. David McKinnon, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY. Rat KCNQ5 was a gift from Dr. Thomas J. Jentsch, Hamburg University, Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie, Hamburg, Germany. A limited deletion of the C-terminal region of the KCNQ3 subunit was carried out using the restriction enzyme StuI (New England Biolabs) to delete approximately the last two-thirds (∼1000 bp) of the C terminus. The PY motif of KCNQ3 (PPDPPY) was mutated by exchanging tyrosine against alanine at position 698 using standard PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) to generate KCNQ3[Y698A]. Capped RNA transcripts encoding full-length rat KCNQ2, wild-type (wt) and PY mutant rat KCNQ3, rat KCNQ5, human Nedd4, human Nedd4-2, and a ligase-deficient mutant of Nedd4-2 (Nedd4-2[C922S]) were synthesized using an mMESSAGE mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). The coding region of rat KCNQ2 was amplified by PCR with an N terminus Myc tag and cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pcKCNQ2-Myc. pcKCNQ3-V5 was generated by PCR amplification of the rat KCNQ3 open reading frame with a V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) engineered at the N terminus and cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1. pcKCNQ3-mV5 (PY mutant) was similarly generated, except that the rat KCNQ3 open reading frame had a Y698A mutation introduced via site-directed mutagenesis. hNedd-1-Myc (24Kumar S. Matsuzaki T. Yoshida Y. Noda M. J. Biol.

The generation of pcDNA3-Nedd4-2-FLAG and pcDNA3-Nedd4-2[C922S]-FLAG have been described previously (25Konstas A.A. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A.B. Degger B. Riccardi D. Cook D.I. Korbmacher C.

Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin (Ub-HA) was kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann, Aab Institute Biomedical Sciences, Rochester, NY. Electrophysiological Recording of K+ Currents Mediated by KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 Expressed in Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus laevis stages V-VI oocytes were removed and treated with collagenase (Sigma type I) for defolliculation. Oocytes were injected with combinations of KCNQ2/3 (7.5 ng/oocyte) and KCNQ3/5 (7.5 ng/oocyte) alone and in combination with wt Nedd4-2 or Nedd4-2[C922S]) (5 ng/oocyte). Similar results were obtained from oocytes injected with lower amounts of RNA for Nedd4-2. The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm pyruvic acid, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.5) prior to recording. Three days after cRNA injection, whole-cell K+ currents were recorded from oocytes using the two-electrode (virtual ground circuit) voltage clamp technique. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and typically had resistances of 0.2-2.0 MΩ. All recordings were made at room temperature (20-23 °C) using ND96 solution. Using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier, a Digidata 1322A interface, and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments Inc, Union City, CA), data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed off-line. To generate outward K+ currents, oocytes were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -80 mV and depolarized to voltages between -70 mV and +80 mV in 10-mV increments for 1 s depending on the experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical significance was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test. Immunoprecipitations and Ubiquitination Assays—HEK293T cells were transfected with expression constructs as indicated using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for adherent cells. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete Protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein G-Sepharose (10 μl, GE Healthcare) was incubated with the cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the appropriate antibody and protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dissolved in 30 μl of protein loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol), subjected to 8-10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science), anti-V5 rabbit affinity-purified antibody (1 μg/ml, Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science), and anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (4.3 μg/ml, Sigma). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were used (1:2000, Chemicon), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:2000, GE Healthcare) were used as secondary antibodies. Detection of bound antibody was achieved using either ECF (Amersham Biosciences) and quantification with a Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) or the ECL Plus Western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare) and exposure to Fuji medical x-ray Super Rx film. Immunofluorescence Analysis—KCNQ2-Myc (2 μg), KCNQ3-V5 (2 μg), and Nedd4-2 (4 μg) were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were stained after 24 h as follows. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. Cells were then blocked in 1% fetal calf serum/PBS for 30 min and stained with mouse anti-Myc (1:200) and rabbit anti-Nedd4-2 (1:200) for 2 h. For the secondary antibodies, anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), both at 1:1000, were added for 1 h before samples were mounted onto slides and imaged using a confocal microscope (Radiance 2100; Bio-Rad Laboratories). Nedd4-2 Regulates KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Depolarization-activated K+ currents were recorded from oocytes expressing KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 heteromers. The currents exhibited similar current-voltage (I-V) relationships (see Fig. 1) and sensitivity to linopirdine (data not shown) as reported previously (4Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 8Schroeder B.C. Hechenberger M. Weinreich F. Kubisch C. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1173-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Co-expression with Nedd4 did not significantly alter the current amplitude of KCNQ2/3 (n = 20) and KCNQ3/5 (n = 20) (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, Nedd4-2 caused a significant down-regulation of both KCNQ2/3- and KCNQ3/5-mediated current amplitudes without altering the I-V relationships (Fig. 1, C and D). When co-expressed with Nedd4-2, the K+ current amplitude mediated by the KCNQ2/3 heteromer was reduced to 53.6 ± 5.2% (n = 70; p < 0.01) of control (KCNQ2/3 expressed alone) (Fig. 1, A and C). Similar effects were observed for the K+ current mediated by the KCNQ3/5 channels, which was reduced to 43.9 ± 5.1% (n = 28; p < 0.001) of control (Fig. 1, B and D). To investigate whether Nedd4-2 regulated the homomeric KCNQ2 and KCNQ5 channels, these subunits were then co-expressed with Nedd4-2 in the absence of KCNQ3. As reported previously (4Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), the amplitude of K+ currents mediated by KCNQ2 and KCNQ5 alone were 5-10-fold smaller than the currents mediated by the heteromeric channels, whereas currents mediated by KCNQ3 were almost undetectable (data not shown). Nedd4-2 had no effect on the current amplitudes of KCNQ2 (n = 20) and KCNQ5 (n = 10) expressed alone (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of the heteromeric channel is necessary for the Nedd4-2-mediated down-regulation to occur. To demonstrate the functional specificity of the interaction between Nedd4-2 and KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5, a point mutation of cysteine→serine in the HECT domain of Nedd4-2 was tested. In contrast to Nedd4-2, the ligase-deficient Nedd4-2[C922S] had no effect on the K+ currents mediated by KCNQ2/3 (n = 38) and KCNQ3/5 (n = 30) (see Fig. 2), suggesting that the catalytic activity of Nedd4-2 was required for the inhibitory function of this enzyme on KCNQ2/3- and KCNQ3/5-current amplitudes. Nedd4-2 Down-regulates KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 Heteromers Independently of the PPXPPY Motif in KCNQ3—The dependence of Nedd4-2-mediated down-regulation of the KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 heteromers on the PPXPPY motif in the C-terminal region of KCNQ3 was examined by the site-directed mutagenesis of this motif in KCNQ3, in which tyrosine was substituted with an alanine (Y698A). When coexpressed with KCNQ2 and KCNQ5, the channels containing KCNQ3[Y698A] exhibited a similar I-V relationship as the wt heteromers (data not shown); however, the current amplitude mediated by the KCNQ3[Y698A] channel was significantly lower than the KCNQ3 channel (Fig. 3). Similar to the wt channels, Nedd4-2 significantly reduced the current amplitude mediated by heteromeric channels containing KCNQ3[Y698A] by ∼31.0 ± 8.9% (KCNQ2/3, n = 55, p < 0.001) and 32.7 ± 4.0% (KCNQ3/5, n = 30, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Nedd4-2 Does Not Down-regulate KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 Heteromers Containing a Truncated KCNQ3 C Terminus—To investigate whether the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of KCNQ3 is required for the Nedd4-2 down-regulation of KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 K+ current amplitudes, a limited deletion analysis of the KCNQ3 was undertaken. The KCNQ3 subunit was truncated by deleting the last two-thirds (333 amino acid residues) of the C-terminal region at Arg-502 (Fig. 4A). The truncated KCNQ3 subunit (KCNQ3Δ) was co-expressed with either KCNQ2 or KCNQ5 in Xenopus oocytes, and K+ current amplitudes were recorded in the absence and presence of Nedd4-2. The steady-state K+ current amplitude obtained for both truncated KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 in the absence and presence of Nedd4-2 was not significantly different at all voltages (n = 4-17 oocytes) (Fig. 4, B and C). In control experiments, using the same batch of oocytes, co-expression of either KCNQ2/3 or KCNQ3/5 and Nedd4-2 resulted in a significant reduction in K+ current amplitude as shown previously in Fig. 1. The failure of Nedd4-2 to reduce K+ current amplitude when the C-terminal region of KCNQ3 was truncated demonstrates that the intracellular C-terminal region of KCNQ3 is involved in Nedd4-2 regulation of KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 channel expression at the plasma membrane. Nedd4-2 Interacts with KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 but Not via the PPXPPY Motif—To determine whether Nedd4-2 bound directly to the C-terminal region of KCNQ3, GST fusion pulldowns were performed using the C-terminal region of KCNQ3 (GST-KCNQ3-CT) and KCNQ3[Y698A] (GST-KCNQ3[Y698A]-CT). GST-KCNQ3-CT and GST-KCNQ3 [Y698A]-CT bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with rat brain lysate. The proteins bound to the beads were subsequently eluted, immunoblotted, and probed with an antibody directed against Nedd4-2. The bands appeared as doublets, which are most likely because of Nedd4-2 splice variants (29Itani O.A. Campbell J.R. Herrero J. Snyder P.M. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F916-F929Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nedd4-2 was detected in the presence of both GST-KCNQ3-CT and GST-KCNQ3[Y698A]-CT but not GST alone (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the interaction between Nedd4-2 and KCNQ3 is independent of the PY motif. To demonstrate that KCNQ3 and Nedd4-2 did interact under normal cellular conditions, co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out on lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Nedd4-2 and V5-tagged KCNQ3 and KCNQ3[Y698A] alone and in the presence of Myc-tagged KCNQ2. Proteins interacting with Nedd4-2-FLAG were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, immunoblotted, and simultaneously probed with an anti-V5 antibody to detect KCNQ3-V5 and an anti-Myc antibody to detect KCNQ2-Myc. Bands of the appropriate size were detected in the lanes loaded with lysate containing KCNQ2 (∼89 kDa), KCNQ3 (∼97 kDa), and KCNQ3[Y698A], demonstrating that Nedd4-2 interacted with both the KCNQ2 and the KCNQ3 subunit and that the PY motif in KCNQ3 was not required for the interaction. We found that interaction of Nedd4-2 with V5-tagged KCNQ3 and KCNQ3[Y698A] did not require the presence of KCNQ2-Myc, and conversely, KCNQ3-V5 was not required for the interaction between Nedd4-2 and KCNQ2-Myc (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the catalytically inactive Nedd4-2[C922S] mutant did not interact with KCNQ2-Myc and KCNQ3-V5 compared with wt Nedd4-2, despite similar expression levels of both wt Nedd4-2 and Nedd4-2[C922S] (Fig. 5B). Additionally, in HEK293T cells transfected with Nedd4-2 and KCNQ2, the majority of the two proteins colocalized (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that Nedd4-2 and KCNQ2 not only physically interact but also have the ability to localize to similar subcellular compartments. Nedd4-2 Ubiquitinates KCNQ2 and KCNQ3—To investigate whether binding of Nedd4-2 to KCNQ2/3 resulted in ubiquitination of the channels, ubiquitination assays were performed in HEK293T cells transfected with Myc-tagged KCNQ2, V5-tagged KCNQ3 (wt and [Y698A]), HA-tagged ubiquitin, and FLAG-tagged Nedd4-2 (wt and [C922S]) in various combinations. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against either the Myc tag (KCNQ2) or the V5 tag (KCNQ3 and KCNQ3[Y698A]). Immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and ubiquitinated species were detected with an anti-HA antibody. Poly-ubiquitination of a target protein typically results in high molecular weight smearing. High molecular weight species were detected in cells expressing KCNQ2, wt KCNQ3, or KCNQ3[Y698A] in combination with both Nedd4-2 and ubiquitin (Fig. 6). Ubiquitinated species were observed when the KCNQ channels were expressed as either monomers or heteromers. In the absence of Nedd4-2-FLAG or when the catalytically inactive Nedd4-2[C922S]-FLAG was included, only weak endogenous ubiquitination of KCNQ2-Myc and KCNQ3-V5 was observed. Thus, the binding of Nedd4-2 to the C terminus of KCNQ results in ubiquitination of the channel. To date, little is known regarding trafficking and turnover of the K+ channels that mediate the neuronal M-current. In the present study, we have identified ubiquitination by the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 as a potential regulatory mechanism for the KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 heteromultimers that constitute the molecular correlates of this current. We found that Nedd4-2 (but not the closely related ubiquitin ligase Nedd4) caused a pronounced down-regulation of the current amplitudes mediated by the heteromeric channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These data suggest that Nedd4-2 (rather than Nedd4) may be the physiological regulator as described for other ion channels. We demonstrated that Nedd4-2 interacts not only biochemically but also functionally with the KCNQ3-subunit. The fact that Nedd4-2 can bind and ubiquitinate individual KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 monomers, whereas the down-regulation of currents was observed only with the heteromeric KCNQ2/3 channels, highlights the complex nature of the interactions between the individual subunits. It is clear from the current study and previous reports (4Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 8Schroeder B.C. Hechenberger M. Weinreich F. Kubisch C. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 1173-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that heteromeric KCNQ channels display higher cell surface expression levels than monomeric channels. It appears that heteromerization increases the trafficking efficiency of the channels to the membrane, and this regulation has been proposed to involve the exposure of a previously hidden trafficking motif or the unmasking of an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (30Etxeberria A. Santana-Castro I. Regalado M.P. Aivar P. Villarroel A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9146-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Schwake M. Jentsch T. Friedrich T.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the interaction between the C-terminal regions of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 is also required for optimum internalization of the complex, perhaps by facilitating the binding of an accessory protein or endogenous KCNE-encoded auxiliary K+ channel subunit in Xenopus oocytes (33Gordon E. Roepke T.K. Abbott G.W. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nedd4-2 failed to reduce K+ current amplitude when the intracellular C-terminal region of KCNQ3 was truncated, demonstrating that the interaction between Nedd4-2 and the C terminus of KCNQ3 is required for the regulation of KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 channel density in the plasma membrane. In contrast to our findings with ClC-5 (23Hryciw D.H. Ekberg J. Lee A. Lensink I.L. Kumar S. Guggino W.B. Cook D.I. Pollock C.A. Poronnik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54996-55007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the interaction between Nedd4-2 and KCNQ2/3 was not mediated via the C-terminal PPXPPY motif. This observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Nedd4-2 can regulate proteins that do not possess a PY motif, including the glutamate transporter EAAT2 (18Boehmer C. Palmada M. Rajamanickam J. Schniepp R. Amara S. Lang F. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.3 (16Henke G. Maier G. Wallisch S. Boehmer C. Lang F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the dopamine transporter (19Sorkina T. Miranda M. Dionne K.R. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8195-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). One possibility is that Nedd4-2 may bind to a different, yet unidentified, intracellular motif on the target protein. Previous reports have shown that sequences that are similar but not identical to the classical PY motifs can bind Nedd4-2 (14Fotia A.B. Ekberg J. Adams D.J. Cook D.I. Poronnik P. Kumar S. J. Biol.

In addition, accessory proteins can mediate the interaction of Nedd4/4-2 with target proteins, and a number of adapter proteins containing PY motifs that link ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family to their target proteins have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 35Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. BioEssays. 2006; 28: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For example, mGrb10α mediates the interaction between Nedd4 and the insulin growth factor 1 receptor (36Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Bsd2p connects the Nedd4-2 Saccharomyces cerevisae homologue Rsp5p to a metal ion transporter (37Hettema E.H. Valdez-Taubas J. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). One such candidate is the chaperone KChAP, which has been shown to interact with Kv channels (38Kuryshev Y.A. Gudz T.I. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C931-C941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KChAP contains a classical PY motif and may therefore mediate an interaction with Nedd4-2. It is also possible that Nedd4-2 regulates another E3 ubiquitin ligase that may act on KCNQ2/3, as has been suggested for dopamine transporter (19Sorkina T. Miranda M. Dionne K.R. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8195-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the case of dopamine transporter, ubiquitination by Nedd4-2 appears to be dependent on protein kinase C activity, and it has been suggested that phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter by protein kinase C may allow access of binding or ubiquitination sites for Nedd4-2 or a Nedd4-2-regulated ubiquitin ligase or may alternatively directly increase the activity of Nedd4-2 (19Sorkina T. Miranda M. Dionne K.R. Hoover B.R. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8195-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms by which Nedd4/Nedd4-2 can regulate substrate proteins are highly complex in terms of accessory proteins and modulation by other factors such as protein kinases. Mutating the PY motif of KCNQ3 resulted in significantly lower K+ current amplitudes than the wt channel KCNQ2/3 heteromer. The mutated residue (Tyr-698) is localized in the proximity of the TCC2 domain in the C terminus of KCNQ3, a region known to be involved in heteromerization (32Schwake M. Athanasiadu D. Beimgraben C. Blanz J. Beck C. Jentsch T.J. Saftig P. Friedrich T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Substitution of Tyr-698 with an alanine may result in a conformational change that could affect the assembly or stabilization of the heteromeric KCNQ2/3 complex, resulting in reduced K+ currents. Another interesting finding was that the catalytically inactive Nedd4-2 analogue (Nedd4-2[C922S]) did not appear to interact with KCNQ2/3 as well as wt Nedd4-2. Replacement of Cys-922 with a serine may not only abolish the catalytic activity but may also affect binding to KCNQ2/3 as a result of a conformational change in Nedd4-2. This catalytically inactive Nedd4-2 mutant has been shown to have a dominant negative effect on cell surface levels of certain target proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes by competing with endogenous xNedd4-2 (11Harvey K.F.

We did not observe any increase in the current amplitude mediated by either KCNQ2/3 or KCNQ3/5 in the presence of Nedd4-2[C922S], suggesting that xNedd4-2 does not regulate KCNQ2/3/5 as has been shown previously for the neuronal voltage-gated Na+ channel (14Fotia A.B.

Originally thought of primarily as a regulator of ENaC, the Nedd4/Nedd4-2 ubiquitin ligases have been shown to regulate a number of ion channels, receptors and transporters in several tissues. In terms of neural cells, Nedd4-2 may be of importance in pathological conditions such as stroke when cell surface levels of neuronal ion channels change dramatically (39Gribkoff V.K. Winquist R.J.

Nedd4-2 has been implicated in the regulation of voltage-gated Na+ channels, the internalization of the dopamine transporter, and turnover of receptors that regulate growth, differentiation, and axonal guidance (14Fotia A.B.

Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2005; 47: 629-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The potential regulation of the M-current by Nedd4-2 may be of particular importance during development as well as in the adult brain, where it is possible that Nedd4-2 plays a crucial role in the fine-tuning of M-current activity. This regulation may have profound effects on neuronal excitability, because subtle reductions (<25%) in M-current activity can alter excitability to the point of causing seizures (47Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Genetic variants in human Nedd4-2 have recently been identified in patients with photosensitive epilepsy (48Dibbens L.M. Ekberg J. Taylor I. Hodgson B.L. Conroy S.-J. Lensink I.L. Kumar S.

Abnormal or decreased activity of the M-current is directly linked to certain disease states (not only epilepsy but also Alzheimer disease (49Passmore G.M. Selyanko A.A. Mistry M. Al-Qatari M.

In summary, this study describes a new paradigm for the regulation of KCNQ2/3/5 channels by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. This finding provides a novel mechanism for the modulation of the M-current with a potential role in the regulation of neuronal excitability."

We previously showed that dual stimulation with three-dimensional type-I collagen and interleukin-1 (IL-1) synergistically induces HSC trans-differentiation in a manner dependent on the activation of matrix metallopreinase-9 (MMP-9). The present study is aimed to determine the mechanism of MMP-9 activation in this model. The pro-MMP-9-converting activities expressed by trans-differentiating HSCs are characterized as secreted factors that are sensitive to MMP inhibitor and have apparent molecular masses of 50 and 25 kDa. This is in sharp contrast to the pro-MMP-9 activator from mouse and human skin, which is a chymotrypsin-like proteinase. Among multiple MMPs induced in HSCs by the dual stimulation, MMP-13 is most conspicuously up-regulated and meets all criteria as the pro-MMP-9 activator. HSC cultured in three-dimensional type-I collagen, but not in Matrigel, IL-1 induces expression of MMP-13 and its matured form at 50 and 25 kDa, respectively. In vitro reconstitution experiment proves that MMP-13, but not its zymogen, activates pro-MMP-9. Further, short hairpin RNA targeting MMP-13 abolishes pro-MMP-9 activation and HSC trans-differentiation. We further demonstrate that pro-MMP-13 activation is facilitated with a membrane-associated factor, inhibited with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, and abolished with short hairpin RNA against MMP-14. Moreover, pro-MMP-13 is also activated by a secreted factor, which is absorbed by gelatin-Sepharose and reconstituted with MMP-9. Thus, IL-1-induced trans-differentiation of HSCs in three-dimensional extracellular matrix is facilitated by an MMP activation cascade (MMP-14 > MMP-13 > MMP-9) and a positive feedback loop of MMP-9 > MMP-13, suggesting their critical roles in liver injury and repair.

Residing in the perisinusoidal space of Disse between the sinusoidal endothelium and hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSCs, hepatic stellate cells; ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; IL-1, interleukin-1; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin. are vitamin A-storing and ECM-producing cells (1Wake K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 66: 303-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 2Geerts A. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In normal liver, HSCs are embraced within loose ECM composed of the basement membrane components mostly produced by these cells themselves (1Wake K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 66: 303-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 2Geerts A. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In response to liver injury, HSCs undergo trans-differentiation (activation) to myofibroblastic cells that may produce excessive interstitial ECM (3Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Boyles J. Bissell D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 4Jezequel A.M. Mancini R. Rinaldesi M.L. Macarri G. Venturini C. Orlandi F. J.

Accompanying the trans-differentiation is the gradual replacement of the basement membrane-like ECM milieu in the space of Disse by fibrillar collagen-rich fibers produced by trans-differentiated, myofibroblastic HSCs. Despite an intensifying need for the development of new therapeutic modalities for cirrhosis and decades of research on HSCs, the key questions still remain as to how HSCs retain their quiescence in normal liver and how the homeostasis is disrupted to provoke activation of HSCs within the perisinusoidal ECM environment. Isolated HSCs undergo spontaneous activation when cultured on plastic (8de Leeuw A.M. McCarthy S.P. Geerts A. Knook D.L. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Friedman S.L. Rockey D.C. McGuire R.F. Maher J.J. Boyles J.K. Yamasaki G. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that the basement ECM acquires and maintains HSC at quiescence in normal liver; conversely, ECM degradation is critical to provoke the onset of HSC activation (10Han Y.P. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2006; 21: S88Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The original observation of the correlation of MMP with liver fibrosis was reported almost three decades ago (11Okazaki I. Maruyama K. Nature. 1974; 252: 49-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The temporal association of MMPs with liver fibrosis was further defined in greater detail, and was tied to the initiation of fibrogenesis by the non-parenchymal hepatic cells (12Milani S. Herbst H.

Mehde M. Kobold D. Saile B. Dinter C. Ramadori G. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 48-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Very recently, MMP-13 deficiency was shown to attenuate liver fibrogenesis (15Uchinami H. Seki E. Brenner D.A. D'Armiento J. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Given the unique ECM-rich architecture in the space of Disse we have designed our study to recapitulate such milieu by culturing isolated HSCs in three-dimensional ECM scaffolds. The resting state of HSCs in normal liver was reproduced by culturing isolated HSCs in three-dimensional basement membrane ECM (Matrigel), and initiation of perisinusoidal fibrosis was simulated by replacing Matrigel with type I collagen. Development of liver fibrosis is closely associated with persistent inflammation (16Friedman S.L. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 17Gressner A.M. Bachem M.G. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 30-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Tsukada S. Parsons C.J. Rippe R.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2005; 364: 33-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We speculated that the acute phase cytokines might directly initiate the activation of HSCs. To this end, we tested a role of acute phase cytokines in this three-dimensional culture model. Such work has led to our finding that dual stimulation by IL-1 and type-I collagen results in most conspicuous ECM degradation and HSC trans-differentiation (19Han Y.P. Zhou L. Wang J. Xiong S. Garner W.L. French S.W. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4820-4828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This finding is novel and remarkable in that HSCs have been shown to serve as a major source of multiple MMPs required for ECM degradation and consequent HSC trans-differentiation. Many secreted MMPs are nearly absent in healthy, resting tissues, although they are expressed in “active” tissues in which ECM breakdown is indispensable, for instance, during development, tumor metastasis, tissue injury, and repair (20Parks W.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Nascent MMPs are made dormant through the interaction between a conserved cysteine in the N terminus pro-domain and a zinc ion chelated by the conserved histidines within catalytic domains. Activation is normally mediated by cleavage of the prodomain, leading to reorganization of the zinc cysteine interaction, a process called “cysteine switch” (21Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro reconstitution with purified proteins, MMP-3 was proposed as a potential pro-MMP-9 activator (22Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar approach showed that plasmin is an upstream activator of the pro-MMP-3 and down-regulation of TIMP-1 is essentially required (23Ramos-DeSimone N. Hahn-Dantona E. Sipley J. Nagase H. French D.L. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13066-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 24Hahn-Dantona E. Ramos-DeSimone N. Sipley J. Nagase H. French D.L. Quigley J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transformed mast cells activate pro-MMP-9 by using chymase (25Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Lazarus S.C. Caughey G.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Fang K.C. Raymond W.W. Blount J.L. Caughey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25628-25635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The role of chymase in activation of pro-MMP-9 is confirmed by mice deficient in a subtype of chymase (27Coussens L.M. Raymond W.W. Bergers G. Laig-Webster M. Behrendtsen O. Werb Z. Caughey G.H. Hanahan D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1382-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 28Tchougounova E. Lundequist A. Fajardo I. Winberg J.O. Abrink M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9291-9296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In human skin, stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α or IL-1 results in activation of pro-MMP-9 through an unrecognized chymotrypsin-like proteinase tightly attached to skin tissue (29Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Hughes M. Wu H. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22341-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Han Y.P. Downey S. Garner W.L. Surgery. 2005; 138: 932-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, how pro-MMP-9 is activated in other organs is largely unknown. We have shown that HSCs activate pro-MMP-9 during their trans-differentiation process in response to a very selective condition of dual stimulation by IL-1 and three-dimensional type-I collagen. Once converted to myofibroblasts, HSCs mostly cease to produce MMPs, thus shifting the equilibrium to accumulation of ECM in fibrosis (19Han Y.P. Zhou L. Wang J. Xiong S. Garner W.L. French S.W. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4820-4828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this report we delineated a cascade of pro-MMP-9 activation by HSCs under the dual stimulation with IL-1 and type-I collagen. We started with profiling potential candidates by their temporal correlation with pro-MMP-9 activation. We characterized that the pro-MMP-9-converting activators are soluble factors with molecular masses of 50 and 25 kDa. The converting enzymes are sensitive to inhibitors for MMPs but not serine proteinases. These results promoted us to examine the MMPs expressed by HSCs in the three-dimensional culture. Such analysis pointed to MMP-13 as a candidate that satisfied all criteria as a pro-MMP-9 activator produced by HSCs. We proved this by in vitro reconstitution and RNA inference-mediated knockdown experiments. We also identified MMP-14 and MMP-9 as two independent activators of pro-MMP-13. In support of the roles of these MMPs in HSC trans-differentiation, we demonstrated that HSCs from either MMP-9 knock-out mice or those with MMP-13 knockdown failed to be activated by the dual stimulation. Thus, this study illustrates a complex MMP activation cascade in IL-1 induced trans-differentiation of HSCs within ECM as an example of MMP interactions in tissue injury and repair. Materials—MMP inhibitor (catalogue number 444247), type-IV collagenase assay kit, pro- and MMP-13 were purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies for rat MMP-13 (MAB13426), MMP-14 (MAB3317), and TIMP-2 protein (CC1064) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody against α-SMA was from Sigma-Aldrich. The kit for adenoviral-based shRNA knockdown, including pENTR/U6 plasmid, was purchased from Invitrogen. Type-I collagen was from Cohesion Technologies (Palo Alto, CA), and IL-1α was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The pro-MMP-9 was expressed by keratinocytes transduced with lentivirus to express human MMP-9. The proteinase in the conditioned medium was purified by gelatin-conjugated Sepharose 4B as previously described (31Han Y.P. Nien Y.D. Garner W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27319-27327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Determination of the Molecular Weight of Pro-MMP-9-converting Activators—Conditioned medium was prepared by primary rat HSCs cultured in three-dimensional type-I collagen and treated with IL-1α (1 ng/ml) for 5 days. After depletion of endogenous gelatinases by passing through a column of gelatin conjugated Sepharose-4B, the conditioned medium was concentrated by precipitation with ammonia sulfate at 85% saturation. The protein was dissolved in NT buffer (100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5), filtered before loading to Superdex-200 (GE Health Sciences), and resolved by fast-protein liquid chromatography. Fractions were monitored by absorbance at A280, and their molecular weights were calibrated by standard proteins. The pro-MMP-9-converting activities were measured by incubation of 30-μl fractions, 15 μl of purified human pro-MMP-9, and 5 μl of 50 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 16 h. Then the reactions were resolved by zymography. Conversion of pro-MMP-9 was measured by the ratio of 82-kDa MMP-9 versus the 92-kDa zymogen. The molecular weight was also measured by resolving the conditioned medium in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Briefly, the gelatinase-depleted and concentrated conditioned medium was resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% w/v) in the cold room. Then the gel was sliced into 20 pieces according to molecular weight. The gel slices were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 in NT buffer to remove residual SDS. After the gel slices were ground in 35 μl of NT buffer, the reactions were made active by adding 15 μl of pro-MMP-9 and 5 μl of CaCl2 followed by incubation at 37 °C for 16 h. Finally, the reactions were resolved by zymography. Isolation of Mouse HSCs and Culture in Three-dimensional ECM—Isolation and culture of rat HSCs have been previously described (32Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-9-deficient and wild-type FVB mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Isolation of mouse HSCs was similar to the procedure for isolation of rat HSCs except the following: liver perfusion from the superior vena cava instead of the portal vein, reduced concentrations of Pronase and collagenase, and adjusted speeds for low-speed and ultracentrifugation. Briefly, the mouse liver was subjected to perfusion with 50 ml of 0.4% Pronase for 12 min followed by 0.02% collagenase for 8 min in a circulating water bath at 37 °C. Then the collapsed liver tissue was minced, suspended in 40-ml solution of 10 μg/ml DNase, and shaken for 10 min at 37 °C. After removal of parenchymal cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min, non-parenchymal liver cells were collected by additional centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 8 min. The cell suspension was subjected to gradient centrifugation. The stellate cells were collected from the second top layer between 1.034 and 1.043 g/cm3. After washing, stellate cells were seeded in a culture dish in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin. Purity of HSCs was judged by comparison of cell number under microscopy of phase contrast and auto-fluorescence excited by UV light. After 2-day recovery, the cells were embedded in three-dimensional ECM as described previously (19Han Y.P. Zhou L. Wang J. Xiong S. Garner W.L. French S.W. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4820-4828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cell Treatment and Quantitative RT-PCR—Isolated rat HSCs (day 2) were either plated on culture dishes or embedded in three-dimensional type-I collagen as described previously. Cells were treated with or without IL-1α (1 ng/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum for 16 h. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was produced using First-Strand cDNA Synthesis by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase with random primers. Two micrograms of total RNA was used for each reverse transcription reaction mixture (20 μl). Real-time PCR was carried out using an ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). 10-μl reactions were carried out in a 384-well PCR plate using the following final concentrations: 1 μmol each of forward and reverse primers, 1× SYBR Green master mix (qPCR Mastermix Plus for SYBR Green I, Eurogentec), and 5 ng of cDNA. For each condition triplicates were used to minimize the variation. Cycling conditions were as follows: initial step (50 °C for 2 min), hot activation (95 °C for 10 min), amplification (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min) repeated 40 times, and quantification with a single fluorescence measurement. Data were analyzed using ABI Prism SDS 2.1 software. The relative gene expression was calculated by the ΔΔCt method. Briefly, the resultant mRNA was normalized to its own GAPDH. Final results were expressed as n-fold difference in gene expression relative to GAPDH mRNA and calibrator as follows: n-fold = 2-(ΔCt sample -ΔCt GAPDH), where ΔCt values of the sample and the calibrator were determined by subtracting the average Ct value of the transcript under investigation from the average Ct value of the GAPDH gene for each sample. For rat MMP-9 the forward primer has the sequence CAG ACC AAG GGT ACA GCC TGT, and the reverse primer is AGC GCA TGG CCG AAC TC. For rat GAPDH the forward and backward primers are CCT GGA GAA ACC TGC CAA GTA T and CTC GGC CGC CTG CTT. The sequence information for the primers of other MMPs and TIMPs will be released upon request. Immunofluorescence Staining—After being fixed with cold methanol for 20 min, the cells in three-dimensional ECM were permeabilized by 0.15% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody against α-SMA (1:100, Sigma). Nuclei were stained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) for 5 min. Images were captured by a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U, a digital camera from Roper Scientific Photometrics, and Metamorph software. Knockdown of MMP-13 and MMP-14—The shRNA for rat MMP-13 and -14 was designed according to the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen). The inserts for shRNA targeting of the N-terminal region of rat MMP-13 have the following sequences (construct AB): forward, 5′-CACCGCAGAGCACTACTTGAAATCACGAATGATTTCAAGTAGTGCTCTGC-3′ and backward, 5′-AAAAGCAGAGCACTACTTGAAATCATTCGTGATTTCAAGTAGTGCTCTGC-3′. Another set of shRNA against the catalytic region of rat MMP-13 (construct CD) has the following sequences: forward, 5′-CACCGCCAGAACTTCCCAACCATGTCGAAACATGGTTGGGAAGTTCTGGC-3′ and backward, 5′-AAAAGCCAGAACTTCCCAACCATGTTTCGACATGGTTGGGAAGTTCTGGC-3′. For shRNA against rat MMP-14, the construct AB has the following sequence: forward, CACCGTCTAGGAATCACATTCCGTTCCTTTCGAAAAAGGAACGGAATGTGATTCCTAGA; backward, AAAATCTAGGAATCACATTCCGTTCCTTTTTCGAAAGGAACGGAATGTGATTCCTAGAC. Construct CD for MMP-14 shRNA has the following sequence: forward, CACCGTCATGATCTTGTTTGCTGAGGGTTTCGAAAAACCCTCAGCAAACAAGATCATGA; backward, AAAATCATGATCTTGTTTGCTGAGGGTTTTTCGAAACCCTCAGCAAACAAGATCATGAC. A control vector that expresses shRNA for lacZ was also constructed with the insert sequence according to the manufacturer's instruction. Both the plasmid (U6 promoter)- and adenovirus-based knockdown procedures have been applied. For plasmid-mediated knockdown, rat HSCs were plated in a 6-cm dish and transfected with pENTR/U6-shRNA for 3-4 h using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For viral-based delivery, HSCs on a culture dish were infected by adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100. The transfected or transduced cells were seeded in three-dimensional type-I collagen and stimulated with or without IL-1 (1 ng/ml) in 5% fetal bovine serum for 3 days. Knockdowns of MMP-13 and MMP-14 were confirmed by Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. Preparation of Crude Membrane Fractions and Assay of Pro-MMP-13-converting Enzyme—HSCs were seeded in three-dimensional type-I collagen treated with or without IL-1 for 24 h. After washing with NT buffer the gel lattice was collected and collapsed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in NT buffer and homogenized by Dounce homogenizer. After repeating wash with NT buffer, the pellet was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The membrane fractions and pro-MMP-13 or conditioned medium were mixed together with or without TIMP-2, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the defined time. Conversion of pro-MMP-13 was measured by Western blot. Expression and Activation of Pro-MMP-9 in Trans-differentiation of HSCs—First, we assessed temporal correlation between IL-1-induced HSC trans-differentiation and pro-MMP-9 expression/activation in the three-dimensional ECM culture. HSCs were isolated from rat liver and recovered by culture on plastic for 2 days. At this point, HSCs still appear quiescent as judged by ample vitamin A droplets as measured by autofluorescence and typical star-shaped morphology. Then the cells were embedded in three-dimensional type-I collagen and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum with or without IL-1α. At the indicated time intervals, the cells were immunostained for α-SMA, and the conditioned medium was resolved by gelatinolytic zymography. As shown in Fig. 1A, under IL-1 stimulation HSCs were morphologically converted to myofibroblastic cells, as evident by filamentous actin fibers. Vitamin A droplets, as measured by autofluorescence under UV, were depleted by the treatment (data not shown). Pro-MMP-9 (105 kDa for rodents) appeared on day 2 without activation. On day 3, activation of pro-MMP-9 (95 kDa) began to occur, and this became more pronounced on days 4 and 5 (Fig. 1B). This temporal pattern of MMP-9 expression/activation coincides with initiation and progression of HSC trans-differentiation (Fig. 1A) and degradation of collagen lattices, which indicates a possible causative relationship between MMP-mediated ECM remodeling and cellular activation (Fig. 1C). Genetic and Pharmacological Evidence Demonstrates an Essential Role of MMP-9 in Trans-differentiation of HSCs in Three-dimensional ECM—Previously we showed that exogenous TIMP-1 or depletion of gelatinases attenuated IL-1-induced trans-differentiation of HSCs in three-dimensional type-I collagen. In light of closely associated induction and activation of pro-MMP-9 in this cellular activation process, our results suggested the critical role of MMP-9 in trans-differentiation of HSC in three-dimensional ECM (19Han Y.P. Zhou L. Wang J. Xiong S. Garner W.L. French S.W. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4820-4828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, TIMP-1 also inhibits other MMPs, and gelatin affinity depletion may remove other gelatinases such as MMP-2. To directly test the role of MMP-9 in activation of HSCs in three-dimensional ECM, we isolated HSCs from MMP-9 null and genetically matched wild-type mice. Isolated mouse HSCs were highly pure (>96%), because almost all the cells identified by phase-contrast microscopy had characteristic transient emission of UV-excited autofluorescence as evidence of intracellular vitamin A storage (Fig. 2A, lower panels). The HSCs were plated on plastic or embedded in type-I collagen followed by treatment with or without IL-1 for 4 days. Cultured on plastic, HSCs from wild-type and MMP-9 knock-out mice exhibited similar extent of activation, demonstrating MMP-9 independence for cellular activation in this “ECM-free” and artificial setting (Fig. 2B). In fact, no MMP-9 was induced by HSCs cultured on plastic (data not shown). In contrast, cultured in three-dimensional type-I collagen, the wild-type but not MMP-9-deficient cells underwent activation in response to IL-1 treatment as determined by the expression of α-SMA stress fibers. Then, we tested the effect of a hydroxamate-type MMP inhibitor on pro-MMP-9 conversion and trans-differentiation. Isolated rat HSCs were cultured in three-dimensional type-I collagen, treated with IL-1 together with the MMP inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 2C, the MMP inhibitor abolished the IL-1-induced HSC activation in three-dimensional type-I collagen as demonstrated by reduced stress fibers and exhibited ruffled actin rings around cells, a typical phenotype of HSC in three-dimensional collagen. In contrast, the compound was without effect on activation of HSCs grown on plastic, demonstrating the lack of cellular toxicity of the inhibitor (data not shown). The type-IV collagenase activities in the conditioned medium, as determined by a fluorogenic substrate, were significantly abrogated by the inhibitor, supporting its efficacy (Fig. 2D). Conversion of pro-MMP-9 as well as global degradation of the collagen gel were clearly prevented by the inhibitor, indicating an interstitial collagenase may also be involved in degradation of type-I collagen and cell activation (Fig. 2E). Thus, these results demonstrate that activation of pro-MMP-9 is likely mediated by another MMP and that active MMP-9 plays an unequivocal role in cellular activation induced by IL-1 and three-dimensional type I collagen. Pro-MMP-9-converting Activators Are Secreted with Molecular Masses of 50 and 25 kDa—First, we attempted to determine if the converting enzymes are secreted. To this end, the conditioned medium derived from the three-dimensional culture of HSCs in type-I collagen and exposed to IL-1 was run through gelatin-conjugated Sepharose-4B column to deplete endogenous MMP-9. Then, the conditioned medium was incubated with purified human pro-MMP-9 for 16 h at 37 °C to assess the conversion of pro-MMP-9. As shown in Fig. 3A, the converting activity was evident in the conditioned medium, demonstrating a soluble form of the putative pro-MMP-9 activator released by HSCs. Then, we estimated the molecular weight of the converting enzymes. The conditioned medium was concentrated by precipitation with ammonia sulfate and resolved by gel filtration (Superdex-200). The protein profile was monitored by A280 absorbance, and the pro-MMP-9-converting activity was assayed by incubation of the fractions with purified human pro-MMP-9 followed by zymography. The molecular weight of the fractions was calibrated by standard proteins. The converting activities were eluted in fractions of a major peak of ∼50 kDa and a minor one at 25 kDa (Fig. 3B). Because the 50-kDa molecule may represent a dimmer of the 25-kDa converting enzyme, we resolved the converting activity by a non-denaturing SDS-PAGE, and slices were analyzed for the pro-MMP-9-converting activities. The converting activities were not only preserved in the SDS-PAGE but also gave the similar molecular mass of a major peak at ∼50 kDa and a minor one at ∼25 kDa (Fig. 3C). These results indicate a monomeric status of the 50-kDa converting enzyme secreted by HSCs in response to IL-1 and type-I collagen. Pro-MMP-9-converting En"
https://openalex.org/W1989673862,"Mice lacking Epas1, encoding the transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible Factor 2α (HIF-2α), exhibit an apparent mitochondrial disease state. Similarities between knock-outs of Epas1 and of Sod2, encoding the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase, led to the identification of Sod2 as a HIF-2α target gene. However, Sod2 levels in Epas1–/– liver are intermediate between that of Sod+/– and Sod2–/– mice, which have subtle or severe phenotypes, respectively. This suggests that additional HIF-2α target genes besides Sod2 contribute to the Epas1–/– mitochondrial disease state. To define the nature of the mitochondrial defect in Epas1–/– liver, we performed biophysical, biochemical, and molecular studies. In the setting of decreased Sod2 levels and increased oxidative stress, we found reduced respiration, sensitized mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, intact electron transport chain activities, and impaired mitochondrial aconitase activity. Mitochondrial aconitase protein levels were preserved, whereas mRNA and protein levels for frataxin, the oxidative stress-regulated mitochondrial aconitase chaperone protein, were markedly reduced in Epas1–/– livers. The mouse Fxn promoter was preferentially activated by HIF-2α through a consensus HIF-responsive enhancer element. In summary, the studies reveal that Fxn, like Sod2, is a nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial-localized HIF-2α target gene required for optimal mitochondrial homeostasis. These findings expand upon the previously defined role of HIF-2α in the cellular response to oxidative stress and identify a novel link of HIF-2α with mitochondrial homeostasis."

Despite extensive data addressing the roles for sphingolipids in heat stress, the mechanism(s) by which heat induces sphingolipid synthesis remains unknown. This study was undertaken to determine the events and/or factors required for heat stress-induced sphingolipid synthesis. Data presented indicate that heat does not directly alter the in vitro activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme responsible for initiating de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Moreover deletion of the small peptide Tsc3p, which is thought to maximize SPT activity, specifically reduced production of C20 sphingolipid species by over 70% but did not significantly decrease overall sphingoid base production. In contrast, the fatty-acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin nearly completely blocked sphingoid base production after heat, indicating a requirement for endogenous fatty acids for heat-mediated sphingoid base synthesis. Consistent with this, genetic studies show that fatty acid import does not contribute to heat-induced de novo synthesis under normal conditions. Interestingly the absence of medium serine also ameliorated heat-induced sphingoid base production, indicating a requirement for exogenous serine for the response, and consistent with this finding, disruption of synthesis of endogenous serine did not affect heat-induced sphingolipid synthesis. Serine uptake assays indicated that heat increased serine uptake from medium by 100% during the first 10 min of heat stress. Moreover treatments that increase serine uptake in the absence of heat including acute medium acidification and glucose treatment also enhanced de novo sphingoid base synthesis equivalent to that induced by heat stress. These data agree with findings from mammalian systems that availability of substrates is a key determinant of flux through sphingolipid synthesis. Moreover data presented here indicate that SPT activity can be driven by several factors that increase serine uptake in the absence of heat.

The contribution of sphingolipids to yeast biology has become increasingly appreciated because of recent findings that they regulate processes as diverse as endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, the cell cycle, sporulation, translation, and post-translational protein assembly, modification, and routing (for reviews, see Refs. 1Dickson R.C.

In particular, the role of sphingolipids in stress responses has generated significant interest due to the discovery that heat stress induces transient flux through de novo sphingolipid synthesis (4Wells G.B.

Although much research has addressed functions of sphingolipids in yeast, the mechanisms of regulation of sphingolipid metabolism during heat stress remains largely undetermined. De novo sphingolipid metabolism commences with the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), 2The abbreviations used are: SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; YPD, yeast proteose dextrose medium; SC, synthetic complete medium; SC Ser-, synthetic serine-free medium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. the rate-limiting step in de novo sphingolipid synthesis (11Perry D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This reaction generates 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, a short lived intermediate that is quickly converted to dihydrosphingosine. The Syr2 hydroxylase then catalyzes the conversion of dihydrosphingosine to phytosphingosine (12Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol.

Okamoto Y. Mao C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Shifting yeast cultures from normal growth temperature (i.e. 24-30 °C) to elevated temperature (i.e. 37-42 °C) increases dihydro- and phytosphingosine by 2-10-fold over the first 5-15 min (5Dickson R.C.

These time frames are too short to involve transcriptional or translational regulation of the enzymes responsible, and furthermore numerous microarray studies have failed to find significant regulation of the genes encoding the subunits of SPT, LCB1 or LCB2, during heat stress (10Cowart L.A.

Genomics. 2002; 2: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore the mechanism(s) of acute regulation of sphingolipid production has generated intense interest as numerous mammalian cellular processes including chemotherapy-mediated cell death require acute de novo sphingolipid synthesis analogous to that observed during the yeast heat stress response (17Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 18Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Drug Resist.

Several previous studies in mammalian cells demonstrated dependence of de novo sphingolipid synthesis on substrate concentration. Specifically in mouse LM cells, intracellular serine concentration was found to be directly proportional to that of extracellular serine, and radiolabeled serine was incorporated into sphingoid bases at rates consistent with in vitro kinetic parameters for SPT, suggesting that SPT activity was limiting for extracellular serine-induced sphingolipid synthesis (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In a subsequent study, it was determined that an acute increase in extracellular serine (accomplished by medium change) caused a “burst” of de novo sphingolipid synthesis (21Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, regulatory factors for serine import remain undefined in these systems. This study aimed to determine the mechanism(s) by which heat stress induces de novo sphingolipid synthesis in yeast. In brief, the data indicate that during heat stress, the sphingolipid fatty acid component is derived from fatty-acid synthase (FAS), whereas the serine is derived from exogenous sources. Moreover heat stimulated serine uptake from the medium, and importantly, other external stimuli that increase amino acid uptake were determined to also increase de novo sphingolipid synthesis in the absence of heat. These findings indicate that increased amino acid import is sufficient to promote a flux through de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathways. Furthermore these data suggest that heat-stimulated serine uptake may be a primary signal initiating the yeast heat stress response.

For heat stress experiments, unless otherwise indicated, cultures were aliquoted into 50-ml Falcon tubes and either returned to the 30 °C water bath or transferred to an identical water bath set at 39 °C with shaking at 200-250 rpm. For some experiments, cells were aliquoted into Falcon tubes, harvested, washed in water, and then resuspended in either fresh YPD, synthetic complete medium (SC), synthetic serine-free medium (SC Ser-), or a non-buffered 10 mm serine, 20 mm KCl solution with or without 50 mm glucose. SC consisted of yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, and complete supplemental mixture containing amino acids and uracil. SC Ser- was prepared similarly, but rather than using the complete supplemental mixture, amino acids except serine and uracil were added separately. In Vitro SPT Measurements—In vitro SPT activity was measured in yeast microsomes prepared by the glass bead procedure. Equal amounts of protein were used to assay in vitro the production of sphingoid bases by the microsomal fraction according to a yeast protocol described previously (22Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Nagiec M.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Scintillation detection of [3H]serine incorporated into Bligh-Dyer extracts (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) was used to calculate enzyme activity as described previously (22Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Nagiec M.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—The tsc3Δ mutant was generated by short flanking homology using primers with 5′ regions complimentary to non-coding portions of the TSC3 gene and 3′ regions complimentary to the G418/neomycin resistance gene. This resulted in a recombinant DNA fragment containing the G418/neomycin resistance cassette framed by 5′ and 3′ non-coding genomic sequences for TSC3. The ser3Δ/ser33Δ double mutant was constructed in a similar fashion. The ser3Δ deletion strain in the BY4742 background was obtained from Invitrogen. This library was constructed by systematic replacement of coding regions with the G418 resistance gene. Therefore, to delete SER33 in this mutant, short flanking homology recombination was used as above with primers having 5′ homology and 3′ homology to non-coding areas of SER33 and the internal sequence of the URA3 gene. In each case, appropriate recombination was confirmed by PCR using a primer from upstream of the 5′ flanking region of the recombinant construct with a downstream primer complimentary to the G418 cassette or the URA3 cassette for tsc3Δ and ser3Δ/ser33Δ, respectively, for PCR of genomic DNA of putative recombinant clones. The ser3Δ/ser33Δ double mutant was also confirmed by its inability to grow in the absence of exogenously added serine (not shown). Sphingoid Base Measurement—After heat treatments as described, cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g at room temperature for 2-3 min followed by suspension in 3 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). One-third of the sample was reserved for total lipid phosphate determination as described previously (24Saheki S. Takeda A. Shimazu T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The remaining two-thirds were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Sphingoid bases were resolved by HPLC after conversion to fluorescent derivatives with ortho-phthalaldehyde as described previously (25Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Measurement of fluorescent bases occurred by in-line fluorescence detection. [3H]Serine Uptake Assay—[3H]Serine uptake was measured according to a method described previously (26Aouida M. Leduc A. Poulin R. Ramotar D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24267-24276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown to midlog phase, washed in assay buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing 2% d-glucose, and suspended in assay buffer at a final density of 1-4 × 107 cells/ml. After 1-2 min of temperature equilibration in a shaking water bath set at 30 or 39 °C, [3H]serine was added to a final concentration of 8.7 μm containing 23 dpm/pmol specific activity. Aliquots of 100 μl were taken at indicated times and immediately pipetted into 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer on ice in Eppendorf tubes. At the conclusion of the time course, samples were harvested by benchtop microcentrifugation for 30 s at 13,000 rpm. Pellets were washed three times in ice-cold assay buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of buffer, and quantified by liquid scintillation. Intracellular Free Serine Determinations—Cells were grown in YPD to midlog phase, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed using glass beads with 5 min of continuous agitation in a Bead Beater apparatus at 4 °C. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and lysates were sent to Scientific Research Consortium, Inc. (St. Paul, MN) for analysis of serine concentration. For all experiments, statistics were performed using Microsoft Excel, and graphs were prepared using SigmaPlot. Effects of Heat on in Vitro SPT Activity—Shifting yeast growth temperature from 30 °C to the heat stress temperature of 39 °C induces a flux through de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis resulting in transient elevation of the sphingoid bases phyto- and dihydrosphingosine (6Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although this synthesis mediates the acquisition of heat tolerance in yeast, the mechanism(s) for the increased sphingolipid production remains unknown. A direct stimulation of SPT by heat could possibly explain this observation. To test this hypothesis, measurements of micro-somal SPT activity in vitro at typical growth temperature (30 °C) and at heat stress temperature (39 °C) were obtained. At 30 °C, SPT activity measurements indicated the formation of 0.318 pmol of product (ketodihydrosphingosine)/μg of protein/min; however, increasing the temperature to 39 °C did not affect SPT activity (0.297 pmol/μg of protein/min), indicating that heat does not directly increase SPT activity in vitro. These values agree with those found in a previous study; although those assays were performed at 37 °C, the results are consistent with the current finding that heat did not change SPT activity in vitro (27Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems unlikely that increasing enzyme reaction temperature in vivo stimulates de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Heat Does Not Induce Stimulating Modifications to SPT—An alternative hypothesis is that heat stress causes post-translational modification of SPT resulting in increased enzymatic activity (although such a modification has not been described previously). If such a modification were to occur (such as phosphorylation or acylation) and were preserved during isolation of microsomes, one would expect increased in vitro SPT activity from heat-treated cells. Therefore, to test this hypothesis, microsomes isolated from yeast at normal growth temperature as well as from heat-stressed yeast were assayed for SPT activity. Interestingly in vitro activity assays of microsomes isolated from heat-stressed yeast showed no increase in SPT activity relative to those isolated from untreated yeast. In fact, SPT activity from these treated cells significantly decreased relative to untreated controls (from 0.32 to 0.24 pmol/μg of protein/min). This might be explained by heat-mediated denaturation of the enzyme during heat stress, which occurs for many proteins. The results from these microsomal studies suggested that neither a direct effect of heat on SPT nor heat-mediated stable post-translational modifications mediate the observed heat-stimulated sphingoid base synthesis. On the other hand, several possibilities exist that could not be ruled out based on these data; for example, heat might induce SPT to associate with other proteins in such a manner that would not be preserved during isolation of microsomes. One such interaction may involve the recently identified yeast homologue of Serinc, a protein thought to mediate supply of endogenously produced serine to SPT (28Inuzuka M. Hayakawa M. Ingi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35776-35783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, several Serinc subtypes were identified as expressed in rat brain and found to share 24-30% amino acid identity with the yeast protein encoded by TMS1. Moreover expression of Serinc1 in COS cells enhanced both phosphatidylserine biosynthesis and de novo sphingolipid synthesis, and Serinc1 colocalized with an red fluorescent protein-tagged Lcb1 SPT subunit and demonstrated interaction with Lcb1 in two-hybrid experiments. Additionally a tms1Δ deletion strain was found to have ∼50% microsomal SPT activity as compared with the background BY4743 strain. These data provided compelling evidence that Tms1p may facilitate serine accessibility by yeast SPT during heat stress. To test this hypothesis, heat-induced sphingolipid synthesis was measured in the parental BY4742 and tms1Δ deletion strains. The heat stress in the parental strain increased dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine 2.7- and 6.2-fold, respectively; and in the tms1Δ strain those increases were similar at 2.5- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Moreover basal levels of dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine were 1.4- and 1.6-fold higher in the tms1Δ strain, respectively, possibly suggesting that the strain may compensate for reduced in vitro SPT activity determined in the previous study. Importantly, however, these data indicated that Tms1p played only a minor role in heat-induced de novo sphingolipid synthesis. The Role of Tsc3p in Regulation of SPT during Heat Stress—A previous report identified the small peptide encoded by the TSC3 gene as essential for full SPT activation (29Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This peptide was demonstrated to interact specifically with the Lcb2 subunit of SPT (30Monaghan E. Gable K. Dunn T. Yeast. 2002; 19: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data presented in that report suggested that interaction of Tsc3p with the Lcb1/Lcb2 heterodimer may regulate its activity. The product of SPT, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, is rapidly converted to dihydrosphingosine, which in turn is converted to phytosphingosine. When derived from palmitoyl-CoA, these species contain 18 carbon atoms, and when derived from stearoyl-CoA, they contain 20 carbons. Each of these species (C18 and C20 phyto- and dihydrosphingosine) accumulates transiently during heat stress, and although the C20 species are present at much lower mass levels, they increase by higher-fold changes (6Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Tsc3p in heat-induced sphingoid base production, a tsc3Δ deletion strain was constructed in the JK93dα background, and the mutant and its parental strain were heat-stressed followed by extraction of their sphingoid bases and their conversion to fluorescent derivatives. Resolution of these derivatives by HPLC as described previously (25Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) showed that heat stress induced the formation of C18 chain length sphingoid bases from around 1 to 1.5-2.5 pmol/nmol of phosphate in both the wild type and tsc3Δ strains (Fig. 1). However, deletion of TSC3 resulted in a significant decrease in specifically the C20 chain length species relative to the wild type both basally and with heat stress. Whereas the wild type yeast contained C20 species at around 0.2 pmol/nmol of phosphate at normal temperature, in mutant yeast, these species occurred near the low limits of detection (Fig. 1). Furthermore after heat stress, the wild type yeast increased their C20 sphingoid base content to around 0.8-1.0 pmol/nmol of phosphate; however, the mutant strain failed to generate more than 0.25 pmol/nmol of phosphate, indicating significant impairment of C20, but not C18, sphingoid base production in the mutant strain. This indicates a role for Tsc3p in product determination; however, deletion of TSC3 did not compromise the ability of yeast to initiate sphingolipid synthesis upon heat stress. Thus, it seems unlikely that Tsc3p mediates regulation of overall heat-induced sphingoid base production. During the course of these studies we observed that various background strains consistently showed different levels of sphingoid bases both constitutively and after heat stress. Specifically experiments performed in the BY4742 strain yielded overall lower sphingoid base content than experiments performed in the JK93dα strain or the YB332 strain (below). Therefore, as with any yeast study, background strain must be taken into account prior to interpretation of data; however, -fold changes in general were consistent from strain to strain and thus may be more useful when comparing data obtained in different background strains. The Respective Roles of Medium Fatty Acids Versus Endogenous Fatty Acids in Heat-induced Synthesis of Sphingoid Bases—Because the data suggested that heat did not directly activate the SPT complex and furthermore neither Tms1p nor the small peptide Tsc3p played a major role in regulating heat-mediated sphingoid base synthesis, it became possible that substrate availability might play some role in regulating heat-induced formation of sphingoid bases. Indeed previous studies in mammalian systems suggested that availability of SPT substrates determined levels of SPT products in cell culture (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether substrate composition of medium could influence synthesis of sphingoid bases, heat-induced sphingoid bases were measured in BY4742 cells grown in rich medium (YPD) and then either resuspended in YPD or transf"

However, CBMs are absent from plant EGases that have been biochemically characterized to date, and accordingly, plant EGases are not generally thought to have the capacity to degrade crystalline cellulose. We report the biochemical characterization of a tomato EGase, Solanum lycopersicum Cel8 (SlCel9C1), with a distinct C-terminal noncatalytic module that represents a previously uncharacterized family of CBMs. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that this module indeed binds to crystalline cellulose and can similarly bind as part of a recombinant chimeric fusion protein containing an EGase catalytic domain from the bacterium Thermobifida fusca. Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that tryptophans 559 and 573 play a role in crystalline cellulose binding. The SlCel9C1 CBM, which represents a new CBM family (CBM49), is a defining feature of a new structural subclass (Class C) of plant EGases, with members present throughout the plant kingdom.

In addition, the SlCel9C1 catalytic domain was shown to hydrolyze artificial cellulosic polymers, cellulose oligosaccharides, and a variety of plant cell wall polysaccharides. The hydrolysis of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on earth, occupies a central position in the global carbon cycle, and a broad range of organisms secrete sets of cellulolytic enzymes to degrade this complex insoluble substrate. The best studied of these are endo-β-1,4-glucanases (also termed EGases, 3The abbreviations used are: EGase, endo-β-1,4-glucanase; ASC, acid-swollen cellulose; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose; CBM, carbohydrate binding module; CD, catalytic domain; CMC, carboxymethyl cellulose; FP, fusion protein; GH9, glycosyl hydrolase family 9; MLG, mixed linkage glucan; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase.3The abbreviations used are: EGase, endo-β-1,4-glucanase; ASC, acid-swollen cellulose; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose; CBM, carbohydrate binding module; CD, catalytic domain; CMC, carboxymethyl cellulose; FP, fusion protein; GH9, glycosyl hydrolase family 9; MLG, mixed linkage glucan; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase. or cellulases; EC 3.2.1.4), which have been identified and characterized in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (1Lynd L.R.

Particular attention has been paid to microbial EGases due to their industrial importance in textile modification and their potential use in the processing of lignocellulosic biomass (4Lynd L.R. van Zyl W.H. McBride J.E. Laser M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), resulting in detailed insights into their expression, regulation, and enzymatic properties (4Lynd L.R. van Zyl W.H.

Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Moreover, exhaustive structure-function studies have identified key structural features that contribute to cellulose binding and hydrolysis. As with many glycosyl hydrolases, microbial EGases typically have a modular structure, involving at least one catalytic domain (CD) joined by a flexible linker region to a single or multiple carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (7Wilson D.B. Irwin D.C. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1999; 65: 1-21Google Scholar). CBMs are structurally diverse noncatalytic domains that typically target proteins to polysaccharide substrates, and they collectively exhibit a range of binding specificities (reviewed in Ref. 8Boraston A.D. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). CBMs attach the enzyme to the substrate surface, potentiating the catalytic activity by increasing the local enzyme concentration and possibly disrupting the surface structure for more efficient catalysis (9Linder M. Teeri T.T. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 15-28Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that CBMs can target the enzyme to specific substrates and even substrate microdomains (10Boraston A.B. Kwan E. Chiu P. Warren A.J. Kilburn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 6120-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Carrard G. Koivula A. Soderlund H. Beguin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10342-10347Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The binding of EGases to cellulose is considered to be a limiting step in cellulose hydrolysis, and CBMs are thus critical components of these modular cellulolytic proteins (12Jung H. Wilson D.B. Walker L.P. Biotech. Bioeng. 2003; 84: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to the detailed biochemical analyses of these microbial enzymes, remarkably little is known about the in vivo substrates and mechanism of action of plant EGases. Most activities have been reported using artificial soluble cellulose derivatives, such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and the few more detailed studies of substrate specificity have failed to reveal a common pattern (reviewed in Refs. 3Libertini E. Li Y. McQueen-Mason S.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and 13Brummell D.A. Lashbrook C.C. Bennett A.B. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp.

Gonzalez-Carranza Z.H. Roberts J.A. Rose J.K.C. The Plant Cell Wall. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK2003: 264-324Google Scholar), with various isozymes showing preferential activities against different classes of soluble glucans. However, an important and consistent conclusion is that plant EGases cannot degrade crystalline cellulose, a characteristic that has long been attributed to a distinct structural feature of plant EGases: the absence of a CBM. Plant EGases belong to glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) and comprise large multigene families (16Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12.22Google Scholar, 17Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Davies G.J. Plant Mol.

Evol. 2004; 58: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). α- and β-EGases all have a predicted N-terminal signal sequence for secretion to the cell wall, whereas γ-EGases have a GH9 catalytic core coupled to a long N-terminal extension, with a membrane-spanning domain that anchors the protein to the plasma membrane or intracellular organelles (14Mølhøj M.

Bennett A.B. Plant Physiol. 1998; 1181535Google Scholar) and now termed Solanum lycopersicum Cel9C1 (SlCel9C1), which represents a new divergent structural subclass within the α-EGases, and orthologs have now been identified in several plant species (3Libertini E.

The members of this subclass exhibit a distinctive modular architecture, with a conventional N-terminal signal peptide and GH9 catalytic core but with an additional discrete C-terminal extension connected to the CD by a proline and hydroxyamino acid-rich linker region (Fig. 1A). This C-terminal module has features that are reminiscent of microbial CBMs, suggesting that this domain might confer binding to cellulose, although no biochemical evidence has been presented to support this hypothesis. Repeated attempts to generate recombinant SlCel9C1 have revealed its susceptibility to hydrolysis, preventing characterization of the full-length protein. However, in this paper, we describe a dual strategy to demonstrate that the C-terminal module of SlCel9C1 binds to crystalline cellulose, the first such example in plants. Our results indicate that SlCel9C1 and orthologs comprise a distinct subclass of plant EGases, characterized by a distinct C-terminal domain that represents a new family of CBMs (designated CBM49). Data are also presented showing that the SlCel9C1 CD can hydrolyze a variety of cellulosic and noncellulosic plant cell wall substrates, and potential roles of this new structural subclass of EGase are discussed. Expression of the TfCel6A CD-SlCel9C1 CBM Fusion Protein (Cel6/Cel9C1 FP) in Escherichia coli—To create a T. fusca TfCel6A CD-SlCel9C1 CBM fusion protein construct, the SlCel9C1 CBM46 DNA sequence (amino acids 500–607) was amplified by PCR (Table S1), followed by digestion with PstI and XhoI. The cDNA encoding the TfCel6A CD (amino acids 1–312), described in Ref. 23Salminen O. Development of an Overexpression System for Production of Recombinant “Thermobifida fusca” Cellulose Cel6A and Its Multidimensional NMR Analysis. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY2002Google Scholar, that contains TfCel6A in the pET 26b+ vector (Novagen; Madison, WI) was amplified by PCR (Table S1) and digested with EcoRI and PstI. The resulting cDNA fragments were ligated into the pET vector that had been digested with EcoRI and XhoI. Expression of the Cel6/Cel8 FP in BL21 (DE3) cells was induced, and periplasmic fluid was isolated according to the pET expression system manual (Novagen, Madison, WI), with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C in M9 minimal medium (6L) containing 60 μg/ml kanamycin and 0.5% glucose. The fluid was adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mm MES, pH 6.5 (Buffer B), and applied to an SP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1.0 m NaCl in Buffer B). Fractions with EGase activity were combined and applied to a HiTrap Butyl FF column (GE Healthcare), and the fusion protein was eluted with a linear ammonium sulfate gradient (0.9-0 m in Buffer B). Molecular Protein Modeling of SlCel9C1 CBM—All-atom structural models for the SlCel9C1 CBM were built using MODELLER (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar, 25Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. VanVlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The alignments were obtained from a BLAST search from the SPMS for the SlCel9C1 CBM. Template structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Minor manual adjustments were made by shifting deletions and insertions in the initial sequence alignments that fall into α-helices and β-strands of the templates toward the neighboring loop regions. Construction of Glutathione S-Transferase-SlCel9C1 CBM Fusion Protein and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pGEX expression system was used for site-directed mutagenized proteins were expressed using the pGEX expression system. The region of the SlCel9C1 DNA sequence containing the CBM (amino acids 526–625) was amplified by PCR (Table S1) and ligated into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare) to generate GST-SlCel9C1 CBM (GST-CBM). Site-directed mutagenesis of GST-CBM was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The associated PCR primers are listed in Table S2. The presence of the individual mutations was verified by DNA sequencing (Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center, Ithaca, NY), and positive clones were further designated as GST-CBM W522A, GST-CBM Y529A, GST-CBM W559A, and GST-CBM W573A, with number designations representing amino acids in the mature SelCel9C1 protein. Protein expression of the GST-CBM and its mutants in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells (Stratagene) was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 28 °C according to the pGEX system manual (GE Healthcare). Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed with a French press followed by high speed centrifugation and filtration to remove cell debris. The cell-free extracts were loaded onto GSTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare), and bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm reduced glutathione.

Binding assays were carried out at room temperature in siliconized 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tubes with Buffer B for the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP, TfCel6A, and Cel6A CD and 50 mm MES (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 12.5 mm reduced glutathione for the GST-CBM and mutants with 0–3 mg/ml BMCC and 2 nmol of each protein. Reactions were rotated end over end at room temperature for 1 or 3 h. Unbound protein was removed by centrifugation. The unbound protein fraction was determined by measuring protein concentration (A280). The binding of proteins to Avicel cellulose, BMCC, and xylan was also determined using SDS-PAGE. Assays contained 0–50 mg of Avicel and 50 μg of protein in a final reaction volume of 0.5 ml and were carried out as described above. The polysaccharide pellet containing the bound protein was washed three times with buffer and resuspended in 2.5× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 10 or 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, respectively. For experiments comparing binding of CBM-GST and mutants to BMCC (2 mg/ml), the relative amounts of each bound and unbound fraction were determined by comparison with controls without cellulose using a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Each experiment was done in triplicate. Expression of SlCel9C1 CD in Pichia pastoris—Recombinant SlCel9C1 CD was produced in P. pastoris (Invitrogen). The cDNAs corresponding to the CD (amino acids 22–505) were amplified by PCR (Table S1) and cloned into the pPIC9K vector (Invitrogen). Cultures were grown and induced (4 days, 16 °C, 250 rpm), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The culture supernatant was adjusted to 85% ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was resuspended in 2.5 ml of Buffer A (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm CaCl2) and then desalted with a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The eluant was applied to a HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 0–0.6 m NaCl gradient.

The optimum temperature for SlCel9C1 CD activity was determined with a 1% (w/v) low viscosity CMC (Sigma) in Buffer A over a range of 25–72 °C for 4 h. The pH profile of SlCel9C1 CD activity was determined with 1% (w/v) low viscosity CMC (Sigma) in Buffer A (pH 4–8) for 4 h at 37 °C. To investigate the effect of calcium on activity, 5 mm CaCl2 plus or minus 10 mm EDTA was included in the reaction mixture for 4 h at 37°C. The substrate specificity of the SlCel9C1 CD was assayed (substrates listed in Fig. 6) in 100-μl reactions containing 0.2% (w/v) glycan substrate in Buffer A, unless otherwise noted, for 4 h at 37 °C. The ability of the SlCel9C1 CD to degrade cello-oligosaccharides (cellobiose, G2; -triose, G3; -tetraose, G4; -pentaose, G5; and -hexaose, G6; Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) and the resulting reaction products was analyzed by TLC on Whatman LK5D 150-A silica gel plates as in Ref. 31Jung E.D.

Modular Architecture of Plant EGases—EGases from tomato have historically been referred to as TomCel1 to -8; however, we have renamed TomCel8 as SlCel9C1, in accordance with the designation of tomato as S. lycopersicum and to conform to the standardized naming scheme used for bacterial EGases (32Henrissat B. Teeri T.T. Warren R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This nomenclature provides important information, since, in the case of SlCel9C1, the name indicates that this protein is a tomato (Sl) cellulase (Cel) from GH family 9 (9Linder M. Teeri T.T. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 15-28Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar) with a Class C (C) domain structure (Fig. 1A). Within the plant EGase superfamily, classes A–C correspond to the membrane-anchored, secreted GH9 catalytic module alone and the group with the additional C-terminal domain, respectively (Fig. 1A). Libertini et al. (3Libertini E. Li Y. McQueen-Mason S.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) proposed that the class with a putative CBM (Class C; Fig. 1A) is a subgroup nested within the larger group containing just a CD (Class B; Fig. 1A). However, their phylogenetic study was primarily focused on DNA sequences and provided a more evolutionary perspective, taking into account intron/exon organization. The cognate protein sequences clearly show that plant GH9 EGase families have a modular organization with three distinct subgroups (Fig. 1A). EGases are probably derived from an ancient eukaryotic ancestor that predates the divergence of eukaryotic kingdoms (33Davison A. Blaxter M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 1273-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and are thus ubiquitous. Accordingly, GH9 genes, including members of both Classes A and B, have been identified in many primitive plant taxa, such as mosses, ferns, and cycads (3Libertini E. Li Y. McQueen-Mason S.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2004; 58: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The additional presence of an expressed sequence tag encoding a predicted EGase with a similar putative CBM in the moss Physcomitrella patens (accession number BJ591253) further indicates that all three subclasses are present throughout the plant kingdom. The putative CBM domain of Class C EGases typically has 100–110 amino acids, and BLAST searches of the data bases indicate that these domains are most similar to microbial family 2 CBMs. The amino acid sequences of the putative CBM domain from SlCel9C1 and selected plant orthologs were aligned with the family 2a CBM from Cellulomonas fimi xylanase 10A (Fig. 1B), revealing the conservation of specific residues that have been experimentally determined to be critical for the binding of family 2a CBMs to cellulose (Trp17, Trp54, and Trp72 in CBM2a) (34McLean B.W. Bray M.R. Boraston A.B. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Kilburn D.G. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 801-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as indicated in Fig. 1B by asterisks. However, the low overall degree of amino acid sequence identity (∼18%) is below the threshold, estimated to be at least 35% (35Sánchez R. Šali S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13597-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), necessary to make conclusions regarding its structure or potential function. Consequently, a biochemical approach was taken to determine whether the putative CBM domain plays a role in carbohydrate binding. SlCel9C1 CBM Substrate Binding Studies—Numerous attempts to express the full-length SlCel9C1 protein in E. coli or P. pastoris consistently generated two polypeptides with the predicted size of the CD and the CBM but none with the expected size of the native protein. This probably reflects the high susceptibility of the linker region to proteolysis, which can be prevalent in cell cultures (36Jahic M. Gustavsson M. Jansen A.-K. Martinelle M. Enfors S.-O. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 102: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Many attempts were made to circumvent this problem, such as varying culture pH, temperature, and media components and the inclusion of various protease inhibitor mixtures without success. Therefore, two alternative strategies were taken to determine whether the C-terminal domain is a functional CBM. To establish that the SlCel9C1 CBM can potentiate cellulose binding as part of a modular EGase enzyme, a chimeric fusion protein (Cel6/Cel9C1 FP) was generated, comprising the CD of TfCel6A, a well characterized EGase from T. fusca (37Wolfgang D.E. Wilson D.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9746-9751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that was engineered to replace its own family 2 CBM with the SlCel9C1 CBM. The binding of the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP to two crystalline cellulose substrates, BMCC and Avicel, was compared with that of both the intact TfCel6A and the TfCel6A CD alone. TfCel6A showed the greatest binding to BMCC, with ∼80% of the protein bound to the substrate (Fig. 2A). The TfCel6A CD was used in this experiment as a negative control and, as expected, did not bind to BMCC, since it lacks a CBM, whereas at high substrate concentrations, the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP bound to BMCC almost as well as TfCel6A. Thus, under these conditions, the SlCel9C1 CBM conferred equivalent binding to that of the TfCel6A CBM2 and functioned as a discrete cellulose binding module, the first reported example from plant EGases. Similar results were obtained using a gel-based qualitative assay with Avicel as a binding substrate (Fig. 2B). Effect of SlCel9C1 CBM on Cellulolytic Activity—A key function of EGase CBMs is believed to be the potentiation of cellulose hydrolysis, by increasing the duration and degree of localized association between the CD and its substrate. In order to determine whether this is the case for the SlCel9C1 CBM, the hydrolytic activity of the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP on three cellulosic substrates was compared with that of the TfCel6A and the TfCel6A CD alone (Table 1). All three proteins hydrolyzed crystalline BMCC, but the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP and the TfCel6A CD alone had only 29 and 56%, respectively, of the TfCel6A activity. In contrast, TfCel6A and TfCel6A CD had the same activity against ASC, an insoluble, noncrystalline cellulosic substrate. Although a CBM is not required for activity on noncrystalline substrates, the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP still only had approximately half the specific activity of the other enzymes. One possible explanation for this reduced activity is the charge difference between the two domains of the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP, since the predicted pI values of the TfCel6A CD and CBM are 5.9 and 4.2, respectively, whereas those of the SlCel9C1 CD and CBM domain are 8.1 and 10.1. This large charge difference (4.2 pI units) between the two domains of the FP, which are connected by a flexible linker region, could promote an interdomain association that might hinder substrate accessibility to the active site cleft.TABLE 1Activity of the Cel6A/Cel9C1 FP on BMCC, CMC, and ASCBMCCASCCMCμmol cellobiose/min/μmol proteinT. fusca Cel6A0.34 ± 0.0123.79 ± 1.9652.70 ± 4.18T. fusca Cel6A CD0.19 ± 0.0123.52 ± 2.7742.90 ± 2.89Cel6A/Cel9C1 FP0.11 ± 0.0112.68 ± 2.9035.14 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab This was investigated by examining the activities of the three proteins with CMC, a soluble, noncrystalline cellulosic polymer (Table 1), since it was reasoned that this single chain soluble polysaccharide would enter more readily into the active site, resulting in greater activities than with BMCC or ASC. This proved to be the case for all three proteins (Table 1), but the activity of the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP was still less than that of TfCel6A or TfCel6A CD, lending support to the idea that steric hindrance at the active site may be responsible for the reduced activities. However, based on the results of the binding data with the Cel6/Cel9C1 FP, the cellulosic substrates seem to be fully accessible to the CBM. Another explanation is that the two modules are in a configuration that spatially separates the catalytic domain from the substrate, causing reduced substrate accessibility and, consequently, activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis of SlCel9C1 CBM—To further examine the nature of the SlCel9C1CBM and to gain important structure-function information, computational modeling was used to identify residues that potentially contribute to cellulose binding. The “3-D Jury” scoring function of the Structure Prediction Meta Server was used to identify probable fold architecture of the SlCel9C1 CBM (38Bujnicki J.M. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L.

We previously reported that supramaximal CCK induced apical blockade and redirected exocytosis to ectopic sites on the basolateral plasma membrane (BPM) of this polarized cell, leading to pancreatitis. Basolateral exocytosis was mediated by protein kinase C phosphorylation of BPM Munc18c, causing its displacement into the cytosol and activation of BPM-bound Syntaxin-4 to form a SNARE complex. To mimic the conditions of alcoholic pancreatitis, we now examined whether 20 mm alcohol followed by submaximal CCK might mimic supramaximal CCK in inducing these pathologic exocytotic events. We show that a non-secretory but clinically relevant alcohol concentration (20 mm) inhibited submaximal CCK (50 pm)-stimulated amylase secretion by blocking apical exocytosis and redirecting exocytosis to less efficient BPM, indeed mimicking supramaximal CCK (10 nm) stimulation. We further demonstrate that basolateral exocytosis caused by both stimulation protocols is mediated by PKCα-induced phosphorylation of Munc18c: 1) PKCα is activated, which binds and induces phosphorylation of PM-Munc18c at a Thr site, and these events can be inhibited by PKCα blockade; 2) PKCα inhibition blocks Munc18c displacement from the BPM; 3) PKCα inhibition prevents basolateral exocytosis but does not rescue apical exocytosis. We conclude that 20 mm alcohol/submaximal CCK as well supramaximal CCK stimulation can trigger pathologic basolateral exocytosis in pancreatic acinar cells via PKCα-mediated activation of Munc18c, which enables Syntaxin-4 to become receptive in forming a SNARE complex in the BPM; and we further postulate this to be an underlying mechanism contributing to alcoholic pancreatitis.

This well orchestrated exocytic pathway can be altered by supramaximal stimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes apical blockade and redirection of exocytosis to the basolateral plasma membrane (BPM) surface (1Gaisano H.Y.

Here, Munc18c on the acinar BPM binds Syn-4, and upon supramaximal CCK stimulation, becomes displaced into the cytosol via a PKC-mediated mechanism; which activates Syn-4 to become capable of forming a SNARE complex with its cognate partners, then proceeding to basolateral exocytosis (1Gaisano H.Y.

Gukovskaya A.S. Pancreas. 2003; 27: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which however is not a clinically relevant form of the disease in humans. Alcoholic pancreatitis is the most common clinical disease of the human exocrine pancreas, but neither acute nor chronic exposure to alcohol in rodents causes pancreatitis (8Pandol S.J. Gukovsky I. Satoh A. Lugea A. Gukovskaya A.S. Pancreas. 2003; 27: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Purohit V. Russo D. Salin M. Brown R.

Instead, chronic alcohol diet followed by low-dose CCK in rodents induced pancreatitis (8Pandol S.J. Gukovsky I. Satoh A. Lugea A. Gukovskaya A.S. Pancreas. 2003; 27: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the precise cellular mechanism remains vague. Interestingly, in intact acinar cells of human alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, we found that Munc18c was displaced into the cytosol, while t-SNARE proteins-Syn-4 and SNAP 23 remained intact in the BPM (13Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Whitcomb D. Pancreas. 2004; 28: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, this led us to hypothesize that alcohol pretreatment followed by low-dose CCK might mimic supramaximal CCK in inducing basolateral exocytosis by inducing Munc18c displacement into the cytosol, and that this process may be required to activate the BPM SNARE complex. Here, we performed parallel studies for these two stimulatory models (supramaximal CCK and alcohol pretreatment/low-dose CCK stimulation) in dispersed rat pancreatic acini. Our results demonstrate that: 1) similarly to supramaximal CCK, pretreatment of acini with a non-stimulatory concentration of EtOH (EtOH) reduced subsequent submaximal CCK-stimulated enzyme secretion by blocking apical exocytosis and redirecting exocytosis to less efficient ectopic BPM sites. 2) In both models, these events were caused by Munc18c displacement from the BPM into the cytosol through a PKCα-induced threonine phosphorylation of Munc18c, and which remarkably were blocked by PKCα inhibition.

Total amylase is defined as the summation of the amylase content in the respective cell pellet plus supernatant, and the amylase secreted into the supernatant is expressed as a percent of total amylase. The data obtained were collected from three separate portions of acini per experiment (from one rat) of at least five different acini preparations, which were then pooled (n > 15) and analyzed by Student's t test, with significance determined to be p < 0.05. Animal care and all the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Toronto. This was performed as we previously described (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Whitcomb D. Pancreas. 2004; 28: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Dispersed acini were plated on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min followed by 10 min in 100 mm glycine. The acini were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum with 0.1% saponin for 0.5 h at 25 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (1:100 dilution, 1 h, 25 °C) followed by appropriate fluorochrome (Cy3)-conjugated secondary antisera (1:1000 dilution, 1 h, 25 °C), along with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.2 μm) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) added at the secondary antibody step. The coverslips were mounted on slides with DAKO Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Carpinteria, CA) and examined by a laser scanning confocal imaging system (Zeiss LSM 510) equipped with the LSM software version 5.00 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All immunostaining experiments were repeated at least five times with similar results. Subcellular Fractionation—Isolated pancreatic acini, after equilibration (20 min, 37 °C) were subjected to the indicated agonist stimulation, and then terminated by adding excess volume of ice-cold KRH buffer. The acini were then pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 4 °C). Whole cell lysates and purified PMs and ZGs were prepared from the treated dispersed acini by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as previously described (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sucrose buffer consisted of: 0.3 m sucrose, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The acini or pancreatic tissues were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, followed by a 5-min centrifugation (14,000 × g, 4 °C) to separate the nuclei pellets from supernatants. The supernatant fractions were centrifuged (15 min, 14,000 × g, 4 °C) to separate the ZG pellets, and the resulting supernatants subjected to ultracentrifugation (3 h, 39,000 × g, 4 °C) to obtain the PM pellet and cytosol supernatant fractions. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing equal amounts of protein were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min). The resulting supernatants, precleared for 40 min using 40 μl of 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with the indicated antibodies (Munc18c or Syn-4) for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were captured by rotating the samples for 1 h at 4°C with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, which were then washed four times with lysis buffer containing 1 mm Na3VO4. Immunoblotting—Protein content of all these samples was determined by the BCA method. Samples of subcellular fractions or immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in Lammeli buffer and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the corresponding primary antibody. The bound antibody was visualized by relevant peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification was performed by densitometry using the NIH-Image software. Single ZG exocytosis was visualized in real-time using this imaging assay technique as previously reported (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Dispersed acini were plated on glass coverslips and mounted in a heated chamber kept at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in 2 μm FM1-43 (15 min, 37 °C) until a stable basal fluorescence staining of the acinar PM was attained. Imaging of the cells was carried out on a Nikon TE2000E inverted microscope imaging system, with a high numerical aperture lens (N.A., 1.45) executing a greater light cone that enabled a thinner and higher resolution optical section. Fluorescence images of the FM1-43-stained cells were obtained with 490/20 nm excitation provided by a Tills Photonics monochromator and 617/73 nm emission filters, with image acquisition at 1s exposure (1Hz) using an ORCA-ER CCD-camera. We determined the size and intensity of the FM1-43 fluorescence within indicated regions of interest at the X-Y axis to monitor ZG exocytosis occurring at the different sites of the acinar cell. Quantitative analysis of fluorescent signal of individual hotspots on the PM was measured using the Compix Simple PCI and NIH-Image J softwares. The intensity for each HS was normalized to the intensity of the PM adjacent to it. PKCα activity assay was performed on lysates from isolated acinar cells obtained and processed following the protocol indicated by the manufacturer using an ELISA-based detection method that is as sensitive as the radioactive one and specific to PKCα. Protein concentration of each sample was determined by the BCA method, and 10 μg of protein were run in the assay. PKCα activity is directly proportional to the color intensity developed that was read at 490 nm with the Thermo max microplate reader using the Soft max program. Measurements of each sample were performed in triplicates Activity values were normalized to the basal activity in unstimulated control acini. The data obtained were collected from three separate portions of acini per experiment (from one rat) of three different acini preparations, which were then pooled (n = 9) and analyzed by Student's t test, with significance determined to be p < 0.05. All data are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test. Significance was assumed at a p value of less than 0.05. Twenty Millimolar Alcohol Inhibits CCK-stimulated Amylase Release, Which Can Be Further Influenced by PKCα Blockade—We determined that 1 h was the minimal incubation time for submaximal CCK (50 pm) to maximally release amylase from dispersed pancreatic acini (19.6 ± 0.7% in Fig. 1A). We then examined the effects of alcohol on 50 pm CCK stimulated amylase secretion. Here, we have used 20 mm ethanol (EtOH), a concentration well within the blood alcohol levels observed with clinical alcohol intoxication (18Bedford D. O'Farrell A. Howell F. Ir. Med. J. 2006; 99: 80-83PubMed Google Scholar), but which does not stimulate amylase secretion. In Fig. 1B, we found that it takes 1 h of preincubation with 20 mm EtOH to achieve maximal reduction of 50 pm CCK stimulated secretion from 20.2 ± 0.8% to 13.4 ± 0.5%, which is a 33.6% reduction (p < 0.05). In Fig. 1D, 20 mm EtOH also inhibited maximal CCK (0.8 nm)-stimulated secretion from 30.1 ± 1.2% to 16.8 ± 0.9%, a 44.2% reduction (p < 0.05), but did not affect supramaximal CCK (10 nm)-stimulated secretion (data not shown). Because we had previously shown that nonspecific PKC activation by low level phorbol ester concentrations could induce a similar effect of reducing maximal CCK stimulated secretion, mimicking supramaximal CCK inhibition of secretion (19Gaisano H.Y. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we here explored which PKC isoform might be mediating this effect by using membrane-permeable isoform-specific PKC inhibitors to dominant PKC isoforms reported in pancreatic acini, including PKCα, δ, and ϵ (15Satoh A. Gukovskaya A. Nieto J. Cheng J. Gukovsky I. Reeve Jr., J.R. Shimosegawa T. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G582-G591Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For this purpose we used the following PKC inhibitors: PKCδ translocation inhibitor peptide δV1-1 (15Satoh A. Gukovskaya A. Nieto J. Cheng J. Gukovsky I. Reeve Jr., J.R. Shimosegawa T. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G582-G591Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), PKCϵ translocation inhibitor peptide ϵV1-2 (10 μm, 3 h) (15Satoh A. Gukovskaya A. Nieto J. Cheng J. Gukovsky I. Reeve Jr., J.R. Shimosegawa T. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G582-G591Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), PKCα myristolated pseudosubstrate inhibitor (myr-PKC-α 14 amino acid peptide unique to PKCα, 5 μm, 30 min) (14Xu K.P. Zoukhri D. Zieske J. Dartt D. Sergheraert C. Loing E. Yu F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C603-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pharmacologic PKCα inhibitor Gö6976 (200 nm, 30 min), and a general potent PKC inhibitor Calphostin C (500 nm, 40 min). Acini were pretreated with each of these PKC inhibitors under optimal conditions previously described (14Xu K.P. Zoukhri D. Zieske J. Dartt D. Sergheraert C. Loing E. Yu F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C603-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Satoh A. Gukovskaya A. Nieto J. Cheng J. Gukovsky I. Reeve Jr., J.R. Shimosegawa T. Pandol S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G582-G591Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) prior to stimulation with either 10 nm CCK or 20 mm EtOH preincubation (1 h) followed by 50 pm CCK stimulation. In Fig. 1, C, D, and E, we examined the effects of these PKC inhibitors on submaximal (50 pm), maximal (0.8 nm), and supramaximal CCK (10 nm) stimulated release, in the presence or absence of 20 mm EtOH pretreatments. PKCδ and ϵ inhibition had no effects on CCK-stimulated secretion in the presence of 20 mm EtOH. However, PKCα inhibition had profound effects. Specifically, preincubation of acini with PKCα pseudosubstrate inhibitor or Gö6976 prior to the addition of 10 nm CCK inhibited secretion from 13.1 ± 0.7% to 8.6 ± 0.6% and 8.1 ± 0.8%, respectively, which is a reduction of 34.4% and 38.2%, respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1E). Of note, these PKCα inhibitors did not affect submaximal (50 pm CCK) or maximal CCK (0.8 nm)-stimulated release. We next examined whether EtOH pretreatment might inhibit submaximal or maximal CCK-stimulated amylase release. In Fig. 1, C and D, we first confirmed that 20 mm EtOH did not stimulate significant secretion over basal release (either KRH or Me2SO vehicle control). In Fig. 1C, 20 mm EtOH inhibited submaximal 50 pm CCK-stimulated secretion from 18.3 ± 1.3% to 12.6 ± 0.5%, a 31.1% reduction (p < 0.05). Surprisingly, preincubation of acini with PKCα pseudosubstrate inhibitor or Gö6976 resulted in a further decrease in amylase secretion to 8.2 ± 0.5% and 8.0 ± 0.8%, respectively, which is a further reduction of 55.2% and 56.3%, respectively. In Fig. 1D, 20 mm EtOH inhibition of maximal 0.8 nm CCK-stimulated secretion (from 30.1 ± 1.2% to 16.8 ± 0.9%) was similarly further inhibited by PKCα pseudosubstrate inhibitor and Gö6976 to 10.1 ± 1.1% and 9.9 ± 0.8%, respectively, a further reduction of 66.4% and 67.1%, respectively. PKCα Inhibition Blocks Basolateral Exocytosis Caused by Supramaximal CCK or 20 Millimolar Alcohol/Submaximal CCK Stimulation, but Does Not Rescue Apical Exocytosis—We next examined the exocytotic events corresponding to the amylase secretion data in Fig. 1 using the epifluorescence microscopy of the FM1-43 dye, which fluoresces upon contact with the lipid PM, and appears as hotspots on the PM when the dye further permeates into the ZGs undergoing exocytosis (17Cochilla A.J. Angelson J.K. Betz W. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). While large acini of 20-30 cells often interfere with the dye penetration and visualization of the dye-tracked exocytic events, 4-7 cell acini allows a good permeation rendering good real-time visualization of exocytosis as we had previously reported (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To clearly indicate the appearance of PM hotspots we present the selected images with fluorescence intensity shown in pseudocolor. Similar to our previous report (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), normal regulated exocytosis was stimulated by 50 pm CCK at the apical poles of acinar cells, observed as increased fluorescence intensity starting at the apical lumen, which then permeates into the ZGs within the apical poles (ZGs encompassing the entire apical pole of each acinar cell can be observed on phase contrast optics) (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, panels i and ii). This apical exocytosis was not blocked by either PKCα pseudosubstrate inhibitor (Fig. 2A, panels iii and iv) or Gö6976 (Fig. 2A, panels v and vi). As previously reported (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), 10 nm CCK stimulation blocked apical exocytosis and redirected exocytosis to the basal PM of this 4-cell acinus ((Fig. 2B, panels i and ii. indicated by arrows pointing to 4 hotspots: HS1-HS4). Fig 2B, panel i shows a timed sequence of selected static images with fluorescence intensity shown in pseudocolor and Fig. 2B, panel ii shows the analysis of these hotspots (HS1-HS4) together with the corresponding apical lumens and apical poles of each of the four acinar cells. The fluorescence excursions of the 4 HS were remarkably synchronous, with HS2 and HS3 exhibiting higher peak amplitudes. We have previously shown that these basal PM FM1-43 hotspots colocalized with exocytosed amylase (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Most remarkably, this basal PM exocytosis was blocked by PKCα pseudosubstrate inhibitor (Fig. 2B, panels iii and iv) and Gö6976 (Fig. 2B, panels v and vi). Of note, apical exocytosis was however not rescued by the PKCα inhibition, which would explain the further inhibition of 10 nm CCK-stimulated amylase secretion in Fig. 1E. We then examined whether EtOH-induced inhibition submaximal CCK-stimulated amylase secretion would evoke exocytic events similar to those observed with supramaximal CCK. For this purpose, we first examined exocytosis stimulated by 20 mm EtOH, which, like KRH control, caused no detectable exocytosis in the apical pole or basal PM (data not shown). Pretreatment of acini with 20 mm EtOH followed by 50 pm CCK-stimulation showed a blockade of apical exocytosis, and instead, exocytosis occurred on the basal PM (Fig. 2C, panel i). Fig. 2C, panel i, which is very similar to the exocytotic events evoked by supramaximal CCK stimulation (Fig. 2B, panels i and ii), shows a timed sequence of selected static images of a 4-cell acinus with two basal PM hotspots indicated - HS1 and HS2, and analyzed in Fig. 2C, panel ii, which exhibit synchronous rhythmic excursions as similarly observed with 10 nm CCK stimulation (Fig. 2B, panel ii). The latter suggests cycles of single ZG exocytosis and content emptying followed by recruitment of oncoming single ZGs to the same exocytotic sites. It therefore appears that alcohol pretreatment of the acinus causes submaximal CCK-evoked exocytosis to be redirected from the apical pole to BPM sites, mimicking supramaximal CCK-evoked exocytosis (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y. Trimble W.S. Salapatek A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We then pretreated the acini with PKCα pseudosubstrate inhibitor (Fig. 2C, panels iii and iv) or Gö6976 (Fig. 2C, panels v and vi), and both completely blocked the basal PM exocytosis caused by subsequent 20 mm EtOH/50 pm CCK stimulation, but did not rescue apical exocytosis. These events were remarkably similar to those observed with the supramaximal CCK exocytotic studies (Fig. 2B, panels iii and iv). We observed additional differences between apical and basal PM exocytoses. Given that there are much fewer ZGs in the vicinity of the BPM surface and longer distance of ZGs deeper in the cell interior to get to the BPM, a much longer time (the observations in Fig. 2 are over >30 min) was required to observe these exocytic events on the BPM. This is in contrast to the highly efficient apical exocytosis, which undergoes rapid sequential granule-granule fusions (1Gaisano H.Y. Lutz M.P. Lynch G. Leser J. Sheu L. Tang L. Tamori Y.

Overexpression of the type I Hsp40 member Ydj1 in yeast cells has been found to result in the loss of [URE3]. However, the mechanism of prion curing by Ydj1 remains unclear. Here we tested the effect of overexpression of Hsp40 members Ydj1, Sis1, and Apj1 and also Hsp70 co-chaperones Cpr7, Cns1, Sti1, and Fes1 in vivo and found that only Ydj1 showed a strong curing effect on [URE3]. We also investigated the interaction of Ydj1 with Ure2 in vitro. We found that Ydj1 was able to suppress formation of amyloid-like fibrils of Ure2 by delaying the process of fibril formation, as monitored by thioflavin T binding and atomic force microscopy imaging. Controls using bovine serum albumin, Sis1, or the human Hsp40 homologues Hdj1 or Hdj2 showed no significant inhibitory effect. Ydj1 was only effective when added during the lag phase of fibril formation, suggesting that it interacts with Ure2 at an early stage in fibril formation and delays the nucleation process. Using surface plasmon resonance and size exclusion chromatography, we demonstrated a direct interaction between Ydj1 and both wild type and N-terminally truncated Ure2. In contrast, Hdj2, which did not suppress fibril formation, did not show this interaction. The results suggest that Ydj1 inhibits Ure2 fibril formation by binding to the native state of Ure2, thus delaying the onset of oligomerization.

The epigenetic factor [URE3] in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae represents the prion form of the protein Ure2 (1Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Like the mammalian prion, the heritable [URE3] phenotype is conveyed by a structural change in its protein determinant to an aggregated form (1Wickner R.B.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Like other heat-shock proteins (21Jones G.W. Tuite M.F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Hsp40 members have been found to play a role in yeast prion propagation. Overexpression of Ydj1 results in the loss of the [URE3] phenotype (22Moriyama H. Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and also cures certain variants of another yeast prion [PIN+]/[RNQ+] (23Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sis1 is unable to cure [RNQ+] (24Gokhale K.C. Newnam G.P. Sherman M.Y. Chernoff Y.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22809-22818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). [RNQ+] interacts with both Sis1 and Ydj1, and Sis1 is required for maintenance of [RNQ+], suggesting that the curing effect of Ydj1 may interfere with the role of Sis1 in maintenance (25Lopez N. Aron R. Craig E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Sondheimer N. Lopez N. Craig E.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Weak strains of [PSI+] can be cured by Ydj1 only when Ssa1 is also overexpressed (27Kushnirov V.V. Kryndushkin D.S. Boguta M. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1443-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In vitro, fibril formation of the [PSI+] determinant Sup35 was clearly reduced in the presence of the combination of Ssa1 and either Ydj1 or Sis1; Ydj1 (but not Sis1) alone also showed a moderate reduction (28Krzewska J. Melki R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 822-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Co-chaperones containing the tetratricopeptide repeat motif, such as Sti1, Cpr7, and Cns1; the nucleotide exchange factor Fes1; and Hsp40 members Ydj1 and Sis1 have all been implicated in propagation of [PSI+] through an Hsp70-dependent mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 21Jones G.W. Tuite M.F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apj1, a putative Type I Hsp40 member, was found to cure an artificial variant of [PSI+] (29Kryndushkin D.S.

In the case of [URE3], besides Ydj1, overexpression of the Hsp70 protein Ssa1 also cures [URE3] (30Schwimmer C. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3590-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a mutation in the peptide-binding domain of its closely related homologue Ssa2 abolishes [URE3] propagation (31Roberts B.T. Moriyama H. Wickner R.B. Yeast. 2004; 21: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, mutants in the ATP-binding domain of both Ssa1 and Ssa2 are found to affect [URE3] propagation (32Loovers H.M. Guinan E. Jones G.W. Genetics. 2007; 175: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hsp104 is required for maintenance of [URE3] (22Moriyama H. Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8916-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), as found for other yeast prions (21Jones G.W. Tuite M.F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since Ydj1 stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssa1/Ssa2 (18Cyr D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also cooperates with Hsp70 and Hsp104 in protein disaggregation (34Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), it cannot be deduced from the current genetic data whether [URE3] curing by Ydj1 reflects increased stimulation of Hsp70 activity or directly reflects the chaperoning properties of Ydj1 itself. In order to address this question, we examined the effect of overexpressing a variety of Hsp70 co-chaperones on curing of [URE3] in vivo and investigated the effect of Hsp40 on fibril formation of Ure2 in vitro. The results imply a direct and specific effect of Ydj1 on [URE3] propagation and suggest that Ydj1 inhibits Ure2 fibril formation by binding to the native state of Ure2, prior to the onset of oligomerization. Materials—Tris, sodium azide, GSH, β-NADPH, cumene hydroperoxide, and thioflavin T (ThT) were from Sigma. All other reagents were local products of analytical grade. Twice-deionized water was used throughout. Solutions were made volumetrically. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Genetic Methods—Strain NT64C (MATa, ade2-1, his3-11,15, leu2, 3-112, trp1-1, ura3,1, pDAL5::ADE2,[URE3]; constructed by L. Ripaud and a gift from C. Cullin) was used for assessment of in vivo co-chaperone effects on [URE3] propagation. Plasmids overexpressing co-chaperones were constructed by PCR amplification of target gene coding sequence ±500 bp using primers containing BamHI restriction sites at their ends. Following digestion with BamHI, PCR products were cloned into the unique BamHI site of the high copy HIS3-based plasmid pRS423 (35Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Co-chaperones chosen for analysis were YDJ1, SIS1, APJ1, CPR7, CNS1, STI1, and FES1. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Assessment of effects of co-chaperone overexpression on [URE3] propagation was carried out by transforming NT64C with the desired co-chaperones cloned into pRS423. Transformants were selected on medium lacking histidine. NT64C contains the DAL5 promoter sequence cloned upstream of the ADE2 coding region and allows identification of [URE3] and [ure-0] cells initially by color: white and red, respectively. White HIS3+ transformants were selected and restreaked onto medium lacking histidine to assess color phenotype. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C and a further 2 days at room temperature. The presence of red or pink colonies is indicative of a curing effect on propagation of [URE3]. Protein Preparation—Ydj1 and Hsp104 were subcloned from plasmids provided by Dr. D. C. Masison and ligated into the vector mini-pRSETa (provided by Dr. M. Bycroft). The Ydj1 plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain C41 (36Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 37 °C and induced by the addition of 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the OD at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.8. The cells were grown for a further 12 h before harvesting and lysis by sonication. The expressed protein with an N-terminal His6 tag was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography and was judged greater than 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. The protein was confirmed to be dimeric by size exclusion chromatography. The Sis1 expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Stefan Walter. Hdj1 and Hdj2 were subcloned from plasmids provided by Prof. R. Morimoto into the expression system used for Ydj1. Sis1, Hdj1, Hdj2, and Hsp104 were expressed and purified in the same way as Ydj1. Ydj1, Sis1, Hdj1, Hdj2, and Hsp104 with N-terminal His tags have been shown to be functional in vivo (19Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 37Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), so in general the His-tagged proteins were used. Alternatively, the His tag was cleaved from Ydj1 using thrombin, and the protein was further purified by gel filtration. Reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol, were omitted, since these were found in control experiments to stimulate fibril formation of Ure2, and their inclusion would therefore complicate interpretation of the results. (The mechanism of this is currently under investigation.) Wild type Ure2 and its mutants were produced with an N-terminal His tag and purified under native conditions as described (3Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 41Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All protein concentrations (in terms of monomers) were measured by absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient (42Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The mutant 90Ure2 lacks the entire repetitive sequence region (residues 1–89) of the N-terminal prion domain (3Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas 105Ure2 lacks the entire N-terminal unstructured region (residues 1–104) (9Lian H.Y. Jiang Y. Zhang H. Jones G.W. Perrett S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both mutants are dimeric, and their stability and folding properties are identical to WT Ure2 (3Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Lian H.Y. Jiang Y. Zhang H. Jones G.W. Perrett S. Biochim. Biophys.

All proteins were stored at -80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl (Buffer A) and defrosted in a 25 °C water bath immediately prior to use. (The stated pH of buffers is correct at 25 °C.) In Vitro Amyloid Fibril Formation—Amyloid formation of Ure2 was performed at 37 °C in Buffer A or in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl (Buffer B), with shaking, essentially as described previously (41Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), except that shaking was at 230 rpm instead of 200 rpm. These conditions were adopted as standard, because they have been characterized in detail previously (8Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, other conditions of temperature (4, 10, 25, and 30 °C), pH (8.0 and 8.4), and shaking speed (including no agitation) were also tested (see “Results”). The extent of Ure2 fibril formation was monitored by assay of ThT binding, as described (8Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The observed kinetics are sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and shaking speed. Therefore, samples were incubated in parallel, with several replicates for each sample. The results of replicate samples were averaged, and the S.E. was calculated, to confirm that apparent differences were significant. Each experiment was also repeated independently in order to confirm that the observed effects were reproducible. Atomic Force Microscopy—Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to analyze the change in morphology of Ure2 aggregates over time in the presence or absence of Ydj1 and was carried out essentially as described (8Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for AFM analysis by spotting 10 μl of solution onto freshly cleaved mica. Protein was allowed to adhere to the surface for 5 min in air, and then the surface was washed twice with double-distilled H2O to remove salts before drying for 4 min in a stream of nitrogen. Captured images were obtained using tapping mode with a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode-AFM (Veeco Instruments) under ambient conditions. Super sharp silicon tips (Rtesp; Veeco Instruments) with resonance frequency of about 250 kHz were used at a scan rate of 1–2 Hz. Once the tip was engaged, the set point value was adjusted to minimize the force exerted on the sample while maintaining the sharpness of the image. Samples were imaged at scan sizes between 1 and 10 μm using line scan rates below 2 Hz, and 512 × 512 pixels were collected per image. Height measurements of aggregates and fibrils were performed manually using the software provided with the Nanoscope instrument. The numbers of fibrils and aggregates were counted, and the areas of large aggregates were calculated. In order to ensure that the results were representative, we scanned at least 10 well separated regions of the mica grid for each sample, and we found that the distribution of particles or fibrils was uniform. Assay of Ure2 GPx Activity—The GPx activity of Ure2 and 90Ure2 (final concentration 1.5 μm) was measured in the presence and absence of Ydj1 at 25 °C in Buffer A, using 1.0 mm GSH and 1.2 mm cumene hydroperoxide as substrates, as described (14Bai M. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50025-50030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 30 μm Ure2 was preincubated with or without an equal concentration of Ydj1 for at least 15 min before measuring activity. Circular Dichroism—Spectra were recorded over the range 200–250 nm in a Pistar-180 Spectrometer (Applied Photophysics). Spectra of 20 μm native Ure2 (or 90Ure2), Ydj1, and their mixture were measured at 37 °C in Buffer A in a 0.1-mm path length thermostatted cuvette after preincubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Spectra of soluble oligomers or complexes formed during the lag time and throughout the time course of fibril formation were also monitored by incubating a series of duplicate samples with and without Ydj1 at 37 °C as for ThT experiments. Samples were removed at a series of time intervals and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min to remove large aggregates, and then spectra were acquired. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography experiments were performed at room temperature using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated in Buffer A. 10 μm samples of WT or N-terminally truncated Ure2 (i.e. 90Ure2 or 105Ure2) were preincubated for 15 min with a 1:1 mixture of chaperone before injection and then run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Plasmon Resonance—All of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a Biacore X instrument, at 25 °C. The instrument, chips, and buffers were from Biacore Ltd. After optimizing the immobilization conditions on the system check chip, 100 μg/ml Ure2 in pH 4.5 buffer and 40 μg/ml 90Ure2 in pH 4.0 buffer were ultimately immobilized onto CM5 chips via amine coupling, giving relative response values of 6454 and 6646, respectively. The control panel was left blank. Binding experiments were performed at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, using Hepes running buffer HBS-P (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20). Protein solutions at different concentrations were perfused over the sensor chip surfaces for 60 s to obtain real time binding data, followed by a 120-s dissociation phase, in order to obtain association (ka) and dissociation (kd) constants. The multichannel detection mode was used to subtract the signal in the reference cell. The surface was regenerated by washing with 1 m NaCl, 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.2, and 200 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5. Data fitting was performed using the software provided with the instrument, using increasingly complex models until a satisfactory fit of the data was obtained. In Vivo Effects of Co-chaperone Overexpression on [URE3] Propagation—Previous studies have shown that Hsp70 co-chaperones can have effects on yeast prion propagation and that these effects may be specific to the type of prion being studied (reviewed in Ref. 21Jones G.W. Tuite M.F. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to test, under a single set of experimental conditions, whether overexpression of these various Hsp70 co-chaperones had effects on [URE3] propagation. Fig. 1 shows the effect on [URE3] propagation of overexpression of an array of different Hsp40s and known Hsp70 co-chaperones. Using the NT64C strain allows for assessment of [URE3] status by color assay. Ure2, in its soluble functional form, binds the transcription factor Gln3, preventing induction of the DAL5 promoter. Hence, the downstream ADE2 gene is not expressed, and the result is red-pigmented cells due to the accumulation of an intermediate in the purine biosynthesis pathway, which is the substrate of Ade2 (44Silver J.M. Eaton N.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 34: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When Ure2 is in the [URE3] prion state, functional binding to Gln3 is lost, allowing expression of ADE2 under control of the DAL5 promoter. The red pigment is metabolized by Ade2, so it no longer accumulates; hence [URE3] cells are white. The presence of a high copy plasmid overexpressing Ydj1 had a clear effect on [URE3] propagation, as is reflected by the appearance of red and pink colonies, indicating curing of the prion. Moreover, introduction of an extra single copy of YDJ1 on a centromeric plasmid is enough to produce a significant number of [ure-0] cells in the NT64C strain (data not shown). These results highlight the importance of Ydj1 compared with the other co-chaperones we tested in the propagation of [URE3] in vivo and suggest that the curing effect we observe for Ydj1 may be independent of Hsp70. The Presence of Ydj1 Inhibits Formation of Ure2 Fibrils and Globular Aggregates in Vitro—Ure2 forms amyloid-like fibrils in vitro (4Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C.

Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Using AFM, a variety of globular and fibrillar species have been observed during the time course of fibril formation (8Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 45Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R.

AFM was used to monitor the morphology of aggregates generated by Ure2 in both the presence and absence of Ydj1. The various heights of aggregates are represented by a gray scale, ranging from white (high) to black (low), to form the image. Ure2 (30 μm) was incubated in the presence or absence of an equimolar concentration of Ydj1 for 15 h, which under these conditions is equivalent to the plateau region in the time course of fibril formation (8Jiang Y. Li H. Zhu L. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3361-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Representative AFM images in the absence (Fig. 2A) and presence (Fig. 2B) of Ydj1 are shown. To ensure that the areas we sampled were indeed representative for the entire sample, we scanned at least 10 areas of fixed size (10 × 10 μm) on each mica surface. We then counted the number of aggregate particles in each of these AFM images; the averaged results for the number of fibrils (Fig. 2C), number of large aggregates (Fig. 2D), and area occupied by large aggregates (Fig. 2E), per scan area are shown. AFM of Ure2 aggregates in the absence of Ydj1 revealed the presence of many fibrils with a diameter of 9–18 nm and some large globular aggregates with a height (i.e. diameter) of at least 20 nm (Fig. 2, A, C, D, and E). When Ydj1 was included in the incubation reaction, relatively few fibrils we"

The genome is continually damaged by spontaneously generated and environmental chemical agents. Many of the lesions formed in DNA strongly inhibit replicative polymerases. If repair of these lesions fails or is not fast enough, cells can biochemically adapt to “tolerate” the toxic DNA lesions, as evidenced by replication of the damaged DNA (1Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev.

Escherichia coli possess three polymerases, pol II, pol IV, and pol V, whose expression levels are up-regulated in response to DNA damage. Extensive research on the structure and function of these polymerases and their homologues suggests that these polymerases allow replication to progress in the presence of DNA lesions that are strongly inhibitory to the replicative polymerase, pol III (1Goodman M.F.

Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 617-618Crossref Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), agents such as peroxynitrite (ONOO-) preferentially oxidize G as compared with the other natural nucleobases (25Burney S. Niles J.C. Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ONOO- is a powerful oxidizing and nitrating agent (26Juedes M.J. Wogan G.N. Mutat. Res. 1996; 349: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) that forms from the diffusion-limited reaction of the endogenous radicals nitric oxide (·NO) and superoxide (O2⋅¯) (27Burney S. Caulfield J.L. Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Two types of inflammatory cells secrete these radicals during the immune response, namely activated macrophages (28Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that several DNA lesions derived from ONOO- oxidation of G are substrates for the SOS response system in E. coli (30Henderson P.T. Neeley W.L.

These findings strongly suggest involvement of the E. coli polymerases II, IV, and/or V and prompted us to investigate the roles of these polymerases in the bypass of G oxidation products. We present here a systematic examination of the effects of the SOS-inducible DNA polymerases on the bypass and mutagenicity of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), guanidinohydantoin (Gh), spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) (an in vivo product of DNA oxidation (32Hailer M.K. Slade P.G. Martin B.D. Sudgen K.D. Chem. Res.

The results of these experiments serve to examine the mechanisms at the molecular level for how ONOO- may cause genotoxicity and mutagenesis. DNA sequences (5′-GAA GAC CTX GGC GTC C-3′, where X is G or a base analogue) containing 8-oxoG, Gh, Sp1, Sp2, Oa, NI, or a tetrahydrofuran abasic site were prepared as described previously (34Henderson P.T.

The E. coli strains used were AB1157 [F- thr-1 araC14 leuB6(Am) Δ(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 supE44(AS) galK2(Oc) hisG4(Oc) rfbD1 mgl-51 rpoS396(Am) rpsL31(Strr) kdgK51 xylA5 mtl-1 argE3(Oc) thi-1], pol II- (AB1157 but polBΔ1::Ω Sm-Sp), pol IV- (AB1157 but ΔdinBW2::cat), GW8017 (AB1157 but umuDC595::cat), and pol II-/pol IV-/pol V- (AB1157 but polBΔ1::Ω Sm-Sp dinB umuDC595::cat). All strains were provided by G. Walker (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The pol II- strain was created by P1 transduction (40Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) of the polBΔ1 allele from E. coli ME101 (41Escarceller M. Hicks J. Gudmundsson G. Trump G. Touati D. Lovett S. Foster P.L. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6221-6228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the pol IV- strain, P1 transduction was used to transfer the ΔdinBW2::cat allele (18Jarosz D.F. Godoy V.G. Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Walker G.C. Nature. 2006; 439: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) to E. coli AB1157. The pol II-/pol IV-/pol V- strain was prepared by first removing the antibiotic resistance cassette from the ΔdinBW2::cat allele in the pol IV- strain using the procedure of Datsenko and Wanner (42Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar) followed by transferring the polBΔ1 and umuDC595::cat alleles into the resultant ΔdinB strain by P1 transduction. All strains were characterized by PCR and DNA sequencing of the gene regions of interest. E. coli genomes were isolated from 1 ml of an overnight LB culture grown in the presence of 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol (pol IV- and GW8017 strains), 70 μg/ml spectinomycin (pol II- strain), or both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin (pol II-/pol IV-/pol V- strain). PCR amplification of the E. coli genomic DNA was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The 50-μl PCR mixture for wild-type polB, dinB, and umuDC gene regions and ΔdinB and ΔumuDC gene regions included 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 2% Me2SO, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.05 mm each dNTP, 0.05 unit/μl Taq, and 2 μg of genomic DNA. The amplification cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 56 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. After 30 cycles, samples were incubated at 72 °C for 10 min and stored at 4 °C until further use. The 50-μl PCR mixture for the polBΔ1 gene region included 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2% Me2SO, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.05 mm each dNTP, 0.05 unit/μl Taq, and 0.5 μgof genomic DNA. The amplification cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 56 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3.5 min. After 30 cycles, samples were incubated at 72 °C for 10 min and stored at 4 °C until further use. The primers 5′-CTG GAA CGA AGT GTA TTA CGG GTT TCG-3′ and 5′-TAT GGT ACT GGA TGG CAA AGC ATT CG-3′ were used for amplification of the polB and polBΔ1 regions. The primers 5′-CAT GGG GAT AAA GTG GTG CAG C-3′ and 5′-CTG GCA CTT AAG AGA TAT CCT GCG G-3′ were used for amplification of the dinB region. The primers 5′-CCA CGT GAG CC AAG ATA AGA GAA CG-3′ and 5′-TAC CTG ATT GTC GCA GTG CTG G-3′ were used for amplification of the umuDC region. The PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer. To 5 μl of each PCR product, solution was added at 5 μl of H2O and 2 μl of 6× Ficoll loading buffer (25% Ficoll), and 10 μl were loaded into each well. The gel was run at 130 V for 1:40 h and stained with 1× SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes) in 1× TBE for 1 h. DNA sequencing was performed using the following primers. For strains containing wild-type polB, 5′-TAT CGA TGC AGC GCA AAT GCC-3′, 5′-CGA TCA TCC GCA CCT TTC TGA TTG-3′, 5′-CAA TCA GAA AGG TGC GGA TGA TCG-3′, and 5′-TAT GGT ACT GGA TGG CAA AGC ATT CG-3′ were used as primers for DNA sequencing. For strains containing polBΔ1, 5′-CTG GAA CGA AGT GTA TTA CGG GTT TCG-3′ was used in place of 5′-TAT CGA TGC AGC GCA AAT GCC-3′. For strains containing wild-type dinB and ΔdinB, the same primers used for PCR were used for DNA sequencing. For strains containing wild-type umuDC and ΔumuDC, 5′-GAA AGT TGG AAC CTC TTA CGT GCC-3′ and the same primers used for PCR were used for DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Laboratory. Genotoxicity and mutation analyses were performed using the competitive replication of adduct bypass (31Neeley W.L. Delaney J.C. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. J. Biol.

The bypass and point mutation data are reported as the average of three independent experiments, and the frameshift mutation data are reported as the average of two independent experiments. DecisionSite 8.1 (Spotfire, Inc.) was used to present the bypass and point mutation data in heat map form. In the bar graphs of figures, error bars represent a 95% confidence interval of the mean. To evaluate the role of the SOS-inducible E. coli polymerases in TLS past G oxidation products, M13 viral genomes containing single 8-oxoG, Oa, Gh, Sp1, Sp2, Ua, or NI lesions were constructed and then replicated in wild-type, pol II-deficient, pol IV-deficient, pol V-deficient, and pol II/pol IV/pol V-deficient E. coli strains under uninduced and SOS-induced conditions for a total of 10 cellular experimental systems (Fig. 1). The translesion bypass efficiencies and mutational properties of the lesions were determined using the recently developed competitive replication of adduct bypass (31Neeley W.L. Delaney J.C.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14051-14056Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which precisely and accurately report the average values for thousands of TLS events. The resultant data set consists of over 1500 data points and therefore represents a very comprehensive study of the bypass and mutational properties of G oxidation products. Fig. 2 summarizes the lesion bypass and mutagenesis data in a single heat map, which serves as a convenient framework for viewing the main findings of the work that are described in detail below. Translesion Bypass Efficiency—In the uninduced wild-type strain, Gh, Sp1, Sp2, Ua, and NI exhibited poor bypass efficiencies but were excellent substrates for the SOS system (Fig. 3). As a control demonstrating a blocking lesion and showing induction of the SOS system, the bypass efficiency of a tetrahydrofuran synthetic abasic site was determined and found to increase from 1.0 to 19%, or about 20-fold. The bypass efficiency of Gh increased about 3-fold from 19 to 65%; Sp1 increased about 4-fold from 16 to 69%; Sp2 increased about 6-fold from 8.2 to 50%; Ua increased about 6-fold from 5.2 to 34%; and NI increased about 8-fold from 4.5 to 38%. These results and our earlier studies (30Henderson P.T. Neeley W.L. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Niles J.C. Hah S.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Neeley W.L. Delaney J.C. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43568-43573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) rank the relative SOS responsiveness of eight structurally diverse DNA lesions. The bypass efficiencies of 8-oxoG and Oa were identical within experimental error to G (100%) and did not differ among the 10 replicative environments evaluated (Fig. 3 and supplemental Figs. S1–S3). With the exception of 8-oxoG and Oa, which were not blocks to replication, deletion of pol V produced dramatic changes in the bypass efficiencies of the lesions (with and without SOS induction) (Fig. 3). The bypass efficiencies were markedly lower in pol V-deficient cells. Importantly, the bypass efficiencies for the blocking lesions failed to increase upon induction of the SOS system in the absence of pol V. These results indicate a pivotal role for pol V in the bypass of these oxidative lesions under both uninduced and SOS-induced conditions. In the pol V-deficient strain, Gh was bypassed with an efficiency of about 10% regardless of SOS status. The bypass efficiencies of the Sp diastereomers decreased to less than 1% and of Ua and NI to about 2% upon removal of pol V. Results from the pol II/pol IV/pol V-deficient strain (supplemental Fig. S1) mirrored those from the pol V-deficient strain. Taken together, these results demonstrate that pol V is essential for the SOS-dependent bypass of these G oxidation products. In the case of Gh, removal of all three SOS polymerases caused only about a 50% decrease in bypass efficiency when the SOS system was not induced as compared with wild-type cells, suggesting involvement of an SOS-independent polymerase (pol I or pol III). Deletion of pol II or pol IV had no statistically significant effect on the bypass efficiencies of Gh, Sp2, Ua, or NI but halved the bypass efficiency of Sp1 from 16 to 8.2% in uninduced pol II cells (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2) and from 16 to 10% and 69 to 60% in uninduced and SOS-induced pol IV-deficient cells, respectively (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest a moderate involvement of pol II and pol IV in the bypass of Sp1.TABLE 1Contribution of pol II and pol IV to translesion synthesis past Sp1 and Sp2 in vivoLesionPolymerase knocked outBypass efficiency (%)SOS–SOS+Sp1None15.9 ± 2.169.1 ± 4.9pol II8.2 ± 2.268.4 ± 16.3pol IV10.4 ± 1.059.8 ± 0.9Sp2None8.2 ± 2.350.1 ± 8.5pol II6.8 ± 2.761.3 ± 19.8pol IV5.5 ± 1.968.0 ± 13.7 Open table in a new tab Mutation Type and Frequency—The mutational signature of each lesion was determined using the restriction endonuclease and post-labeling analysis of mutation frequency method (43Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14051-14056Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This assay allows both frameshift and point mutations to be quantified. Frameshift Mutations—In both uninduced and SOS-induced wild-type cells, frameshift mutations were negligible for all lesions (less than 1%; data not shown). Frameshifts (-1 and -2) on the order of several percent were observed upon replication of Sp1, Sp2, and NI in the pol V-deficient and the pol II/pol IV/pol V-deficient strains. A previous study suggested pol V suppresses frameshift mutagenesis in favor of base substitutions (44Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NI also induced about 2% -1 frameshifts in the pol II- and pol IV-deficient strains. Further details are published as Supplemental Material. In assessing the significance of the observed frameshift mutations, it is important to consider that these mutations were generated under conditions of very low lesion bypass. Point Mutations—In wild-type uninduced cells, the 8-oxoG hyperoxidation products Gh, Sp1, Sp2, Oa, and Ua were almost completely miscoding as shown in Fig. 4, respectively; however, the mutational signatures differed within this group as observed previously (30Henderson P.T. Neeley W.L. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Niles J.C. Hah S.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Muller J.G. Neeley W.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Burrows C.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9257-9262Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Throughout this section, the percentages refer to the percentage of total bypass events that are mutagenic. Gh bypass induced 37% G → T and 59% G → C mutations (Fig. 4A), whereas Sp1 caused 83% G → T and 15% G → C mutations (Fig. 4B), and Sp2 caused 43% G → T and 54% G → C mutations (Fig. 4C). Oa generated 99% G → T mutations (Fig. 4D), and Ua produced 55% G → T, 35% G → C, and 9% G → A mutations (Fig. 4E). In comparison, replication of 8-oxoG was only 2% mutagenic, and the mutations were essentially all G → T (supplemental Fig. S4). NI was 64% mutagenic and induced 30% G → T, 18% G → C, and 16% G → A mutations (Fig. 4F). Induction of the SOS system had a slight to negligible effect on the mutational signatures of Gh, Sp1, Oa, and Ua. This observation could indicate pol V-dependent bypass either in uninduced conditions or in an SOS-induced subpopulation that exists in the absence of external induction. Interestingly, the mutational signature of Sp2 shifted from 43 to 58% G → T mutations and from 54 to 39% G → C mutations (Fig. 4C). The mutation frequency of NI decreased to 48%, and the mutational signature shifted to fewer G → A mutations (9%) and G → C mutations (5%) (Fig. 4F). The most striking effect in mutational signatures was observed upon removal of pol V. Again, for the well bypassed lesions 8-oxoG (supplemental Fig. S4) and Oa (Fig. 4D), small effects were observed. The mutational signature of Gh, although unchanged among uninduced strains, shifted from 45% G → T and 50% G → C in SOS-induced wild-type cells to 35% G → T and 64% G → C mutations in SOS-induced pol V-deficient cells (Fig. 4A). This result suggests a preference of pol V to insert A opposite the lesion, thereby inducing G → T mutations. The data further suggest pol V inserts T opposite the lesion to a small extent because removal of pol V eliminates the G → A mutations. Also, because the bypass efficiency of Gh is unchanged at about 10% in the pol V-deficient strain versus the pol II/pol IV/pol V-deficient strain (supplemental Fig. S3), the data indicate a relatively significant contribution to mutational signature by a fourth polymerase, either pol I or pol III. Deletion of pol V had a small effect on the mutagenicity of Sp1 bypass, decreasing it from 99% in uninduced and SOS-induced pol V-proficient cells to 93 and 94% in uninduced and SOS-induced pol V-deficient cells, respectively, while still inducing principally G → T mutations (Fig. 4B). Large differences in the mutational signature of Sp2 were observed upon elimination of pol V (Fig. 4C). In both uninduced and SOS-induced wild-type cells, the overall mutation frequency decreased from 99 to 86% when compared with pol V-deficient cells, and the mutational signature shifted from similar amounts of G → T and G → C mutations to mostly G → T mutations. These data suggest pol V preferentially inserts G opposite Sp2 and that insertion of A opposite the lesion results from a different polymerase activity. With the exception of pol V, the participation of any polymerase, including those not induced by the SOS system, in the genesis of the large amount of G → T mutations cannot be excluded. A large shift in mutational signature was observed for Ua upon deletion of pol V (Fig. 4E). Although substantial amounts of G → A, G → T, and G → C mutations were observed in wild-type cells, G → T transitions comprised nearly all the mutations in the pol V-deficient strains and were greater than 90%. These data show that pol V preferentially inserts both T and G opposite Ua and that pol V is not responsible for the majority of G → T mutations. Removal of pol V caused a large decrease in the amount of G → T mutations induced by NI with a corresponding decrease in mutation frequency. In uninduced cells, the overall mutation frequency of NI decreased from 64% in the wild-type strain to 40% in the pol V-deficient strain and to 51% in the pol II/pol IV/pol V-deficient strain (Fig. 4F). In SOS-induced cells, the mutation frequency decreased from 48 to 21% when pol V was remove"
https://openalex.org/W2086721790,"The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α are structurally similar as regards their DNA-binding and dimerization domains, but differ in their transactivation domains and, as is shown by experiments using hif-1α-/- and hif-2α-/- mice, in their functions. This implies that HIF-1α and HIF-2α may have unique target genes. To address this discrepancy and identify HIF-2α-specific target genes, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis and identified the tumor suppressor Int6/eIF3e/p48 as a novel target gene product involved in HIF-2α regulation. The int6 gene was first identified from a screen in which the mouse mammary tumor virus was employed as an insertional mutagen to identify genes whose functions are critical for breast tumor formation. Here, by using two-hybrid analysis, immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells, and HRE-reporter assays, we report the specific interaction of HIF-2α (but not HIF-1α or HIF-3α) with Int6. The results indicate that the direct interaction of Int6 induces proteasome inhibitor-sensitive HIF-2α degradation. This degradation was clearly observed in renal cell carcinoma 786-O cells, and was found to be both hypoxia- and pVHL-independent. Furthermore, Int6 protein knockdown by int6-siRNA vectors or the dominant-negative mutant Int6-ΔC increased endogenous HIF-2α expression, even under normoxia, and induced sets of critical angiogenic factors comprising vascular endoplasmic growth factor, angiopoietin, and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA. These results indicate that Int6 is a novel and critical determinant of HIF-2α-dependent angiogenesis as well as cancer formation, and that int6-siRNA transfer may be an effective therapeutic strategy in pathological conditions such as heart and brain ischemia, hepatic cirrhosis, and obstructive vessel diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2053561688,"α-Hemolysin (HlyA) from Escherichia coli is a protein toxin (1024 amino acids) that targets eukaryotic cell membranes, causing loss of the permeability barrier. HlyA consists of two main regions, an N-terminal domain rich in amphipathic helices, and a C-terminal Ca2+-binding domain containing a Gly- and Asp-rich nonapeptide repeated in tandem 11–17 times. The latter is called the RTX domain and gives its name to the RTX protein family. It had been commonly assumed that membrane interaction occurred mainly if not exclusively through the amphipathic helix domain. However, we have cloned and expressed the C-terminal region of HlyA, containing the RTX domain plus a few stabilizing sequences, and found that it is a potent surface-active molecule. The isolated domain binds Ca2+ with about the same affinity (apparent K0.5 ≈150 μm) as the parent protein HlyA, and Ca2+ binding induces in turn a more compact folding with an increased proportion of β-sheet structure. Both with and without Ca2+ the C-terminal region of HlyA can interact with lipid monolayers spread at an air-water interface. However, the C-terminal domain by itself is devoid of membrane lytic properties. The present results can be interpreted in the light of our previous studies that involved in receptor binding a peptide in the C-terminal region of HlyA. We had also shown experimentally the distinction between reversible membrane adsorption and irreversible lytic insertion of the toxin. In this context, the present data allow us to propose that both major domains of HlyA are directly involved in membrane-toxin interaction, the nonapeptide repeat, calcium-binding RTX domain being responsible for the early stages of HlyA docking to the target membrane. α-Hemolysin (HlyA) from Escherichia coli is a protein toxin (1024 amino acids) that targets eukaryotic cell membranes, causing loss of the permeability barrier.

HlyA targets the plasma membrane of eukaryotic host cells, where it becomes permanently inserted and causes breakdown of the membrane permeability barrier (for reviews, see Refs. 1Goni F.M.

The secondary structure of HlyA shows two clearly distinguishable regions, the N-terminal domain, characterized by nine amphipathic helices, presumed to interact with the hydrophobic matrix of the host membrane (5Hyland C. Vuillard L. Hughes C. Koronakis V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal domain, whose main feature is the presence of 11–17 nonapeptides repeated in tandem, of consensus sequence GGXGXDXUX (X, any amino acid; U, large hydrophobic amino acid) (1Goni F.M.

The process includes two main steps, namely reversible binding (adsorption) and irreversible insertion (7Bakas L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L. Goni F.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1869-1876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Binding occurs probably via specific receptors (8Lally E.T. Kieba I.R. Sato A. Green C.L. Rosenbloom J. Korostoff J.

Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), instead of human ones. As a consequence their observation of non-saturable hemolysis by HlyA in rabbit red blood cells actually confirms the proposed role of α-glycophorin as a receptor. We had also shown that a short sequence in the C-terminal domain (aa 914–936) was the main HlyA region recognizing the α-glycophorin receptor (10Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19159-19163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and earlier reports suggested that the nonapeptide repeat, calcium-binding region was involved in the early stages of receptor/membrane binding by HlyA (13Ludwig A. Jarchau T. Benz R. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Moayeri M. Welch R.A. Infect. Inmun. 1997; 65: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore decided to clone and express the nonapeptide repeat region, to study its properties in the absence of the amphipathic helix domain. According to the crystal structures of two other (non-lytic) RTX proteins, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa alkaline protease (AprA) (15Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 16Miyatake H. Hata Y. Fujii T. Hamada K. Morihara K. Katsube Y. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1996; 119: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the repetitive sequences form a parallel β-roll structure, to which Ca2+ ions bind. The first six residues of this sequence motif form a loop and the last three form a short β-strand. Each Ca2+ ion binds a pair of these loops. Although the role and mechanism of the repetitive sequences remains to be fully understood, analysis of the secretion of mutant proteins of HlyA (19Felmlee T. Welch R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5269-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as well as the characterization of various fragments from the adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) (20Bauche C. Chenal A. Knapp O. Bodenreider C. Benz R. Chaffotte A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16914-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggest that the repetitive sequences are not required for secretion but are essential for activity. Bauche et al. (20Bauche C. Chenal A. Knapp O. Bodenreider C. Benz R. Chaffotte A. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16914-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have also shown that, in CyaA, the adjacent polypeptide sequences are essential for the folding and calcium responsiveness of the RTX module. With respect to protein folding it can be anticipated that the right-handed β-2-solenoid (β-roll) adopted by the repeats upon Ca2+ binding is not able to fold correctly by itself. It can probably accommodate a rather variable number of nonapeptides, but a number of hydrogen bonds remain unsatisfied at each end regardless of its length. In solved structures of proteins containing this motif (Protein Data Bank codes: 1SAT, 1K7I, and 1KAP) the β-roll region edges are hydrogen-bonded to strands of adjacent β-sandwich. With the aim of identifying residues belonging to the putative flanking β-region we used the PHD PredictProtein Server. The N-terminal end of the protein is predicted to contain predominantly α-helical structure. The N-terminal end of our construction was chosen to lie at the C-terminal end of the α-helical region, i.e. the start of the segment predicted as β-strand that precedes the nonapeptide repeats. An additional region is predicted as β-strand from residues following the β-roll up to residue 963. Three helices are identified in the C-terminal end of the protein that were decided to be left integral in the construction to increase the polypeptide stability (Fig. 1). In consequence, a DNA segment expressing amino acids 602–1024 of HlyA was cloned. A very similar polypeptide was used in the study by Hyland et al. (5Hyland C. Vuillard L. Hughes C. Koronakis V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In a recent report (21Sanchez-Magraner L. Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) we described the insertion of HlyA into lipid monolayers extended at a lipid-water interface and showed that such insertion was not necessarily coupled to membrane lysis. In that work we implicitly assumed that the protein region interacting with the lipid monolayer was the N-terminal, amphipathic helix region. However, our studies with the isolated calcium-binding domain reveal that this part of the protein may be the one that is (reversibly) adsorbing to the membrane in the early stages of HlyA-membrane interaction. This would lead to a novel interpretation of the role assigned to the nonapeptide repeat domain of RTX toxins. Materials—Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). Cholesterol was supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). ANTS (8-aminonaphtalene-1,2,3-trisulfonic acid) and DPX (p-xilene bis(pyridinium bromide)) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 45Ca in the form of CaCl2 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Horse erythrocytes were purchased from Microlab (Madrid, Spain). Construction of HlyAΔN601—The mutant HlyAΔN601 was obtained by PCR amplification of the hlyA fragment including the DNA sequence corresponding to aa 602–1024, using as primers two oligonucleotides that contain in their sequences NdeI (A) and BamHI (B) restriction sites (in boldface), respectively (A, 5′-AGATATACATATGGTCGGTAATAACCAGTA-3′ (Tm = 61.3 °C) and B, 5′-GCAGGATCCTTATGCTGATGTGGTCAGGGTTATTGAGTTCCGTCCATAACTAAA-3′ (Tm > 75 °C)). The fragment obtained was sequenced and the sequence was found to be the expected one. The fragment was then inserted in the expression vector pET3a, so that hlyA was expressed from the T7 polymerase promoter. Purification of Wild-type and Mutant HlyAΔN601 Proteins—Wild-type HlyA was purified as described previously by Ostolaza et al. (22Ostolaza H. Bartolome B. Serra J.L. de la Cruz F. Goni F.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The HlyAΔN601 purification protocol was achieved by extracting the protein from inclusion bodies. HlyAΔN601 was expressed in E. coli BL21 C41(DE3). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani liquid medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C, to A600 = 0.6–0.8. 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added, and expression was allowed to occur for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in “TES buffer” (10 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0), and stored at –20 °C overnight. The cells were thawed at 37 °C and treated with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml), 2.5 mm benzamidine and 0.1 mm PMSF in “lysis buffer” (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0). Cell lysis was allowed to occur for 45 min in an ice bath, followed by 25 sonication cycles (15 s sonication at 12 μm amplitude + 25 s rest) in a Soniprep 150 MSE probe sonicator. The suspension was centrifuged at 18,000 × g (20 min, 4 °C), and HlyAΔN601 inclusion bodies, recovered in the pellet, were resuspended in “TU buffer” (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH = 7.0). The sample in TU buffer was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The protein was eluted in a stepwise 0–250 mm NaCl gradient in the same TU buffer. The protein eluted at ≈50 mm NaCl. Flow rate was 1 ml/min; 5-ml fractions were collected. The purified protein was stored at –20 °C in 50 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. HlyAΔN601 was identified in SDS-PAGE gels by Western blotting with rabbit anti-HlyA polyclonal antibodies. Binding of 45Ca—The amount of Ca+2 bound to the proteins was measured by isotopic dilution of 45Ca in the form of calcium chloride, as described previously by Ostolaza et al. (23Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Protein (230 nm) was incubated with increasing 45CaCl2 concentrations for 15 min at room temperature; total volume was 1 ml. Free and bound Ca+2 were separated by filtration through cellulose mixed-ester filters (Millipore). Nonspecific binding was estimated by adding an excess (20-fold) non-radioactive Ca+2. Intrinsic Fluorescence Measurements—The intrinsic fluorescence of HlyAΔN601 was used to detect conformational changes promoted by calcium binding. Fluorescence was measured in a SLM Aminco 8100 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and emission was scanned between 310 and 400 nm. Slits were 4 nm; 1-ml cuvettes with constant stirring were used. Protein concentration was 230 nm; fluorescence was measured after equilibrating (5 min) for each calcium concentration. The proteins were dialyzed, when required, against TC buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) or TC + 6 m urea buffer in the presence of 0.1 mm EGTA at 4 °C, overnight, and then against EGTA-free buffers, at 4 °C, for 2 h. Infrared Spectroscopy Measurements—The protein solution was concentrated to 5 mg/ml using Millipore filters (30,000 molecular weight cutoff). To remove all the urea present in the sample, the concentrated protein was dialyzed against TC buffer at 4 °C for 6 h. The dialyzed proteins were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to avoid protein aggregates. Protein aliquots (0.06 ml) were dried in a Savant evaporator. Finally they were resuspended in the appropriate volume of D2O and the infrared spectra were collected. The spectra were recorded in a Bruker Tensor 27 (Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-refrigerated mercury-cadmium-telluride detector. Samples were measured using a demountable Peltier liquid cell (Biotools Inc.) with excavated calcium fluoride 50-mm diameter BioCell windows (BioTools), 25 μm optical path. 143 interferograms/min for each, background and sample, were collected at 2 cm–1 resolution and averaged after each minute. Opus 5.0 software from Bruker Optics was used for data acquisition. Data treatment and band decomposition of the original amide I have been described elsewhere (24Arrondo J.L. Muga A. Castresana J. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 25Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded in a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp., Tokio, Japan) using quartz cuvettes 1 mm optical path. The protein (15 μm) was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Spectra were recorded in the 205–250 nm range. Surface Pressure Measurements—Surface pressure experiments were carried out with a MicroTrough S system from Kibron (Helsinki, Finland) at 25 °C, under constant stirring. The aqueous phase consisted of 1.0 ml 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The lipid, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), was gently spread over the surface until the desired initial surface pressure was attained. The protein was injected with a micropipette through a hole connected to the subphase. The increment in surface pressure versus time was recorded until a stable signal was obtained. The plots show one of two closely similar independent measurements. Hemolysis Assay—A standard red blood cell suspension was used, obtained by diluting the erythrocytes with saline so that 37.5 μl of the mixture in 3 ml distilled water gave an absorbance of 0.6 at 412 nm. Equal volumes of the standard suspension of washed horse erythrocytes were added to serial 2-fold dilutions of proteins in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The assay was carried out in microtitre plates; cell and toxin mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, then centrifuged in microtitre plates in a Jouan centrifuge at 4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C. The supernatants (100 μl) were diluted in 1 ml of distilled water, and the absorbance was read at 412 nm. The blank (zero hemolysis) consisted of a mixture of equal volumes of buffer and erythrocytes. Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) made of egg phosphatidylcholine:egg phosphatidylethanolamine:cholesterol (2:1:1) were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA), pore size 0.1 μm. Buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The diameter of the resulting vesicles was of ∼100 nm, according to quasi-elastic light scattering measurements. Release of Liposomal Contents—Leakage of vesicular aqueous contents was assayed according to Ellens et al. (26Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), with the fluorescent probe ANTS and its quencher DPX entrapped in the liposomes. LUV were prepared in 70 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Non-entrapped probes were removed passing the LUV through a Sephadex G-75 column, eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The proteins (HlyA and HlyAΔN601) at different concentrations were mixed with 100 μm lipid in a total volume of 1 ml, with continuous stirring, at 25 °C. Buffer was as above, with the addition of 10 mm CaCl2. ANTS fluorescence was recorded continuously (λex = 355 nm; λem = 520 nm). When leakage reached equilibrium, Triton X-100 was added (final concentration 0.1% w/v) to induce 100% release. Percent release was computed as follows: % release = (Ff – Fo)/(F100 – Fo) × 100, where Ff, F100, and Fo were the fluorescence intensity values observed after protein addition, after Triton X-100, and before any addition, respectively. Purification of HlyAΔN601—A DNA segment coding for the C-terminal domain of HlyA (aa residues 602–1024) was amplified by PCR as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and cloned in the expression vector pET3a, under the T7 polymerase promoter. E. coli strain B121 C41(DE3) allowed highest expression of the protein among three B121(DE3) strains tested. Optimum yields (38 mg/l) were obtained after 3 h postisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction at 37 °C. The protein accumulated in the bacterial cells in the form of inclusion bodies. The latter were solubilized in a buffer containing 6 m urea (22Ostolaza H. Bartolome B. Serra J.L. de la Cruz F. Goni F.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and loaded onto an ion exchange DEAE-Sepharose column, from which the protein was eluted with a 0–250 mm NaCl gradient. HlyAΔN601 eluted at 50 mm NaCl with a high degree of purity. Purification was followed by the presence in the gels of a band of molecular mass ≈46 kDa that was recognized by anti-HlyA antibodies (Fig. 2). The protein was stable for months after storage at –20 °C in 6 m urea, just as the parent molecule HlyA (27Soloaga A. Ramirez J.M. Goni F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Calcium Binding—Calcium binding by HlyAΔN601 was directly assayed using 45Ca. After incubating the protein with the radioactive isotope, an excess cold isotope was added to remove non-specifically bound calcium. The results in Fig. 3 show that HlyAΔN601 binds about 12 Ca2+ ions/molecule, with a sigmoidal binding isotherm and an apparent K0.5 ≈ 150 μm Ca2+. The number of bound Ca2+ ions corresponded very well with the predicted number of canonical nonapeptide repeats in the protein, suggesting that, under these conditions, all nonapeptides were accessible to the solvent. This was in contrast to the situation when native HlyA was used (23Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar) when only 4 Ca2+/protein molecule were bound, and the apparent K0.5 was ≈100 μm Ca2+. Ca2+ binding by the whole protein is also shown in Fig. 3 (inset). These results indicated that, in the whole protein, most of the nonapeptide repeats were not easily accessible to the solvent, in agreement with our proposed hypothesis (23Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory (23Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar, 27Soloaga A. Ramirez J.M. Goni F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) had shown that Ca2+ binding induced significant changes in the HlyA intrinsic fluorescence. The C-terminal fragment HlyAΔN601 contains only one (W914) of the four Trp residues in the native protein. Trp-914 is located immediately after the nonapeptide repeat domain (Fig. 1). Fluorescence emission spectra of HlyAΔN601, arising essentially from the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-914, showed a very large increase (almost 3-fold) in fluorescence intensity in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4). The effect was dose-dependent, and the binding isotherm was again sigmoidal (see Fig. 3), its apparent K0.5 being ≈50 μm Ca2+. The latter figure was clearly lower than the one shown in Fig. 3, when binding was directly measured. Thus Trp-914 was sensing in particular the binding of Ca2+ to sites with a somewhat higher affinity than the average. The possibility that some Trp residues in native HlyA could be more sensitive to Ca2+ in the solvent than others had already been put forward by Ostolaza et al. (23Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-induced increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4) was not accompanied by any significant shift in the maximum wavelength of fluorescence emission. Fluorescence intensity increments are often accompanied by a blue shift of the emission maxima when the fluorophore environment becomes less polar. Both increased intensity and blue shift were observed for native HlyA (23Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goni F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of emission band shift in HlyAΔN601 indicates that the Ca2+ effect cannot be simply interpreted in terms of Trp-914 sensing a less polar environment. As its parent molecule, HlyAΔN601 was best stored in 6 m urea, so that urea had to be removed before performing any tests of biological activity (or IR spectroscopy, see below). Thus it was important to test whether different procedures of urea removal had an influence on the protein properties. Fluorescence changes caused by Ca2+ binding were chosen as a convenient and sensitive activity to test. In the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the protein had been dialyzed against a calcium-free buffer. For comparison, fluorescence spectra were also recorded under conditions when (i) the protein had been dialyzed against calcium-free buffer containing 6 m urea, then urea had been diluted out in the fluorescence spectroscopy cuvette (typically 10 μl of the protein suspension were added to 1 ml urea-free, calcium-free buffer), or (ii) a non-dialyzed fraction eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column had been directly diluted in urea-free, calcium-free buffer in the cuvette. As seen in Fig. 5, all three procedures gave essentially similar fluorescence changes in response to Ca2+ addition. These results confirmed that the protein could be stored in 6 m urea and then dialyzed without impairment of its Ca2+-binding properties and presumably of its tertiary structure. IR and CD Spectroscopy Structural Studies—The observation that HlyAΔN601 could be dialyzed without apparent loss of structure/properties opened the way to IR structural studies. IR spectroscopy is a useful tool in the study of protein structure in solution (24Arrondo J.L. Muga A. Castresana J. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 25Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), but urea interferes markedly with the main protein amide absorption region, the so-called amide I band (1600–1700 cm–1). Dialysis under the conditions given in the Methods section provided urea-free protein suspensions. The whole HlyA exists in solution in equilibrium between the monomer and aggregated forms, and the aggregates appear to be a form of storage rather than an expression of denaturation (27Soloaga A. Ramirez J.M. Goni F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Centrifugation of urea-free HlyAΔN601 provided a supernatant essentially free from protein aggregates. At the concentration used in our studies (≈2 mg/ml), aggregation was slow enough to assert that the IR samples consisted essentially of monomeric HlyAΔN601. All buffers for IR spectroscopy contained D2O instead of H2O. The amide I region of IR spectra of HlyAΔN601 in the presence and absence of Ca2+ is shown in Fig. 6. The different spectral lineshapes revealed clear effects of Ca2+ on the protein secondary structure. The spectra were decomposed as described elsewhere (24Arrondo J.L. Muga A. Castresana J. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 25Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to obtain the various bands corresponding to the different secondary structure elements. The component bands are also shown in Fig. 6."

A dimeric precursor of Spätzle is processed by an endoprotease to produce a form (C-106) that cross-links Toll receptor ectodomains and establishes signaling. Here we show that before processing the pro-domain of Spätzle is required for correct biosynthesis and secretion. We mapped two loss-of-function mutations of Spätzle to a discrete site in the pro-domain and showed that the phenotype arises because of a defect in biosynthesis rather than signaling. We also report that the pro-domain and C-106 remain associated after cleavage and that this processed complex signals with the same characteristics as the C-terminal fragment. These results suggest that before activation the determinants on C-106 that bind specifically to Toll are sequestered by the pro-domain and that proteolytic processing causes conformational rearrangements that expose these determinants and enables binding to Toll. Furthermore, we show that the pro-domain is released when the Toll extracellular domain binds to the complex, a finding that has implications for the generation of a signaling-competent Toll dimer.

Furthermore, we show that the pro-domain is released when the Toll extracellular domain binds to the complex, a finding that has implications for the generation of a signaling-competent Toll dimer. Drosophila Spätzle is the activating ligand of Toll, a class I transmembrane receptor required for embryonic dorsoventral patterning and innate immune responses to bacteria and fungi (1Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 304-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 2Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, a related family of receptors mediate responses to analogous microbial signals in the innate immune response, and these signaling events are a prerequisite for the development of adaptive immunity (3Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). It is an important objective of current research to understand the molecular mechanisms of pathway activation by Toll ligands, and such information should allow extrinsic regulation of the pathways in human autoimmune and infectious diseases (4Kirk P. Bazan J.F. Immunity. 2005; 23: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Spätzle protein is synthesized and secreted from the cell as an inactive, dimeric precursor (pro-protein) consisting of a prodomain (25 kDa) and a C-terminal region that forms a cystine knot structure (C-106) 4The abbreviations used are: C106, the C-terminal 106 amino acids of Spätzle pro-protein; NGF, nerve growth factor; SPE, Spätzle processing enzyme; TEV, tobacco etch virus; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. (14 kDa) (5DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This structural motif is found in a number of vertebrate signaling molecules, and Spätzle is most closely related to the neurotrophins, for example nerve growth factor (NGF) (6Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 7Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The precursor form of Spätzle is secreted efficiently from expressing cells and is correctly folded, containing three intra-molecular disulfide bonds and a fourth that joins the two subunits together to form a homodimer. Previous studies have suggested that the pro-domain is a natively unstructured or “loopy” domain and that covalent association of the pro-domain and cystine knot is sufficient to completely suppress binding to the Toll receptor and signaling activity (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In both dorsoventral patterning and innate immunity, specific stimuli activate a cascade of serine proteases, and the terminal member of the cascade cleaves the pro-protein at a specific site 106 amino acids from the C terminus (9LeMosy E.K. Tan Y.Q. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5055-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Dissing M. Giordano H. DeLotto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2387-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In dorsoventral patterning an endoprotease with a trypsin-like specificity, Easter, is known to cleave Spätzle (11Rose T. LeMosy E.K. Cantwell A.M. Banerjee-Roy D. Skeath J.B. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11320-11330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Chasan R. Jin Y. Anderson K.V. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 607-616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and a related protease, Spätzle-processing enzyme (SPE), has recently been shown to cleave Spätzle in the immune response (13Jang I.H. Chosa N. Kim S.H. Nam H.J. Lemaitre B. Ochiai M. Kambris Z. Brun S. Hashimoto C. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The precursor form of Spätzle has no signaling activity, but C-106 binds and cross-links two molecules of the Toll ectodomain thereby activating the receptor pathway (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 14Weber A.N. Moncrieffe M.C. Gangloff M. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22793-22799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus the pro-domain of Spätzle prevents C-106 from binding to Toll, and this suggests that unmasking of the N terminus of C-106 is necessary to form a stable complex between Toll and C-106. In this study we report that the pro-domain is required for secretion, and after endoproteolytic cleavage, C-106 and the pro-domain remain tightly associated with each other. This noncovalent complex is active in signaling, and the prodomain is displaced by binding to Toll. Taken together, these results suggest that proteolytic processing of Spätzle causes structural rearrangements that unmask a binding surface on C-106 for interaction with Toll ectodomains. Spätzle Isoforms—There are at least 15 splice isoforms of Spätzle (15DeLotto Y. Smith C. DeLotto R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the exon structure of the gene is illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2. In this study the EST clone HL01462 was used throughout (accession number EF155533, see supplemental Fig. S1). The isoforms appear to be very similar functionally (15DeLotto Y. Smith C. DeLotto R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Generation of Expression Constructs—The generation of Toll and Spätzle pro-protein expression constructs is described previously (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The constructs Mel-C106-FLAG and Toll-C106-FLAG were generated by two rounds of PCR. The Spätzle EST clone HL01462 (see supplemental Fig. S1) was purchased (Research Genetics Invitrogen) and used as a template in the first PCR. The following 5′ primers were used to fuse part of the Melittin or Toll signal peptide to the C106 sequence, respectively: atg tgc gta tac att tct tac atc tat gcg gat*gtt ggt ggc tca gacgagcga and atc atc ctg caa ctg cta cag tgg cca gga tct gaa gca tcc*gtt ggt ggc tca gacgagcga (the asterisk denotes start of the C106 sequence). As a 3′ primer agtctaat gcggcggc CTA ctt gtc gtc atc gtc ttt gta gtc gcc ctg aaa ata cag gtt ttc ccc agt ctt caa cgc gca ctt was used to introduce a C-terminal FLAG peptide tag and a NotI restriction site (start and stop codons are in boldface type and capitalized; restriction sites are in italics, tags are underlined, and rTEV protease cleavage sites are in italics and underlined). The PCR product from this reaction was purified and used as a template in a second round of PCR using the same 3′ primer and the following 5′ primers to add the remaining residues of the respective signal peptides and a BamHI restriction site: ttaagcgcggatcc ATG aaa ttc tta gtc aac gtt gcc ctt gtt ttt atg gtc gta tac att tct tac and ttaagc gcggatcc ATG agt cga cta aag gcc gct tcc gag ctg gca ttg ctt gtg atc atc ctg caa ctg cta cag. This PCR product was then gel-purified, and its sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. To generate N-His-TEV-C106, the Spätzle template was used in two different PCRs with the following primer combinations (His tag sequence underlined and TEV recognition site underlined and italicized): reaction 1, ggaattcc ggatcc ATG atg acg ccc atg tgg (5′ primer introducing a BamHI site and annealing with Spätzle pro-domain sequence) and gcc ctg aaa ata cag gtt ttc gtg atg gtg atg gtg atg gcg aga gct cac atc cgt ggg ct (3′ primer, annealing with end of pro-domain and generating first part of His and TEV recognition site); reaction 2, cat cac cat cac cat cac gaa aac ctg tat ttt cag ggc gtt ggt ggc tca gac (5′ primer generating second part of His and TEV recognition site and annealing with N terminus of C106) and tcacccagtcttcaacgcgcacttgc (anneals with C106 C-terminal sequence). Both PCR products were gel-purified. Subsequently, a third PCR was performed using a mixture of both previous PCR products and the outside primers (5′ primer reaction 1 and 3′ primer reaction 2). The resulting PCR product was blunt-end cloned into pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Sequencing of Spz Mutants—DNA was extracted from single wild-type w- flies or flies homozygous for the spz2, spz3, spz4, or spzU5 (a kind gift of J.M. Reichhart) alleles. One fly of each genotype was crushed in 50 μl of crushing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium chloride, 0.2 g/liter proteinase K). The preparation was then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 3 min at 95 °C and then kept at 4 °C. The genomic DNA was sequenced using PCR amplification products. PCRs were performed with 1 μl of each homozygous fly DNA preparation, using the primers presented in supplemental Fig. S3. PCRs were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and purified using NucleoSpin PCR purification kit (Macherey-Naegel). DNA was sequenced on a 3100 Applied Biosystems sequencer. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to delete the consensus glycosylation sequences in the Spätzle pro-domain sequence, site 1 49NQS (to NQA) and site 2 108NDT (to NDA). The following primers were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions: 5′-cag aaa cag aat cag aat caa Gct ccg ata ccc gaa acg aac c-3′ and its reverse complement for site 1; and 5′-cgt cct ttg agg aat gac Gct aaa gag cac aat ccc tgc-3′ for site 2 (mutant codon in boldface and underlined, changed base is uppercase). Site 1 was disrupted first, and the DNA mutant constructs (NGly1 construct) were sequenced after mutagenesis. To introduce the spz2 mutant (Y134N) into the Spätzle expression construct the following primer (and its reverse complement) was used according to the QuikChange instructions: 5′-cg aat gtg gac gac Aat ccg gac ctt tca ggc c-3′. The primer 5′-gac gac tat cTg gac ctt tca ggc-3′ (and its reverse complement) was used to introduce the spzU5 mutation (P135L). After mutations had been verified by DNA sequencing, the insert sequence was back-cloned into the original vector backbone before generation of a baculovirus expression construct, and this plasmid used in a second round of mutagenesis disrupting site 2 (NGly1+2 construct). Protein Expression and Purification—All expression constructs were cloned into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) and recombinant baculoviruses generated according to the Bac-to-Bac procedure (Invitrogen). The initial viral supernatant was amplified by infecting Sf9 cells grown serum-free in SF900 II medium at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for several days. This working stock was used for protein expression. Expression and purification of the Toll ectodomain, Spätzle pro-protein, and generation of C106 were performed as described previously (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The constructs Mel-C106-FLAG, Toll-C106-FLAG, and N-His-TEV-C106 were expressed by infection of Sf9 cells at 1.0 × 106 cells/ml and at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 for 48 h. For large scale protein expression, 2–4 liters of Sf9 cultures were used. N-His-TEV-C106 culture supernatant was then concentrated and buffer exchanged to 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm imidazole binding buffer using a Centramate tangential flow filtration system (Pall). Subsequently, the protein was purified using Ni-NTA Superflow agarose (Qiagen) on an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 40 mm imidazole and eluted with 250 mm imidazole-containing buffer. Relevant fractions were pooled, and the protein was usually 95% pure. To obtain cleaved N-His-TEV-C106, purified protein was incubated with recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen or produced according to Ref. 16Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar; expression plasmid was a kind gift from D. Waugh, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) as described by the manufacturer on a small scale (Fig. 4C) or at a ratio of 500 units of TEV per mg of protein for 6 h at 37 or 16 °C overnight in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, on a larger scale (Fig. 4D). Subsequently, TEV was removed by ion exchange or gel filtration on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare). S2 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (13Jang I.H. Chosa N. Kim S.H. Nam H.J. Lemaitre B. Ochiai M. Kambris Z. Brun S. Hashimoto C. Ashida M. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Protein Biochemistry—Proteins were generally analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10–12% acrylamide gels (Hoefer system) and bands stained with Simply Blue Stain (Invitrogen). For immunoblots, gels were transferred onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using transfer buffer with 15% methanol in a semi-dry blotting system. Blocking and probing of the blots with antibodies were performed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% nonfat milk powder. Between incubations, blots were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween. As primary antibodies mouse anti-penta-His (Qiagen) and mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene) were used, and a standard anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) as a secondary antibody. ECL Plus reagents (GE Healthcare) were used to identify cross-reacting bands. Protein concentrations were determined by using Bio-Rad protein assay reagents or by measuring the A280 absorption. Native ɛ280 extinction coefficients were determined by comparison with the A280 of protein denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for which computed ɛ280 extinction coefficients applied. These were obtained using Prot Param based on the primary amino acid sequence of the proteins. Analysis of Toll-Spätzle Complexes—Proteins were dialyzed into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl. Subsequently, 600 pmol of cleaved or uncleaved N-His-TEV-C106 or C106 were mixed with 600 pmol of His-tagged Toll or buffer in 300 μl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by ion exchange chromatography (not shown) or native PAGE followed by anti-penta-His (Qiagen) immunoblot. After mixing with 2× native PAGE loading dye (Invitrogen), the samples were separated on 3–8% Tris acetate native PAGE (Invitrogen). The gel was soaked in 0.1% SDS buffer for 30 min and then washed in water two times for 5 min before the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). Gel Filtration Analysis—For experiments shown in Fig. 4D, a GE Healthcare Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column was used with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as running buffer. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and 100 μl of Ni-NTA eluate (after TEV cleavage of N-His-TEV-C106) was loaded. GE Healthcare low molecular weight standards were used to calibrate the columns, and Unicorn software (GE Healthcare) was used to integrate peaks and determine precise elution volumes. For the experiment in Fig. 5, a mixture of cleaved Spätzle and Toll ectodomain with a slight molar excess (1.2-fold) of Spätzle over Toll was analyzed. In detail, 200 μg of TEV-cleaved Spz (3.2nmol) were mixed with 300 μg of Toll ectodomain (2.7 nmol) in phosphate-buffered saline; the mixture was left for 2 h at room temperature and then loaded on a GE Healthcare Superdex 200 HR 10/300 column with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, as a running buffer. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)—All experiments were performed using a Biacore 2000 instrument with research grade CM4 sensor chips using 0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20 as a running buffer (flow 10 μl/min). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide were used to activate the chip surface for amine coupling (Biacore). Sensorgrams were recorded with high sensitivity and corrected by subtraction of a control signal (empty flow cell). For experiments shown in Fig. 5A, cleaved and uncleaved N-His-TEV-C106 pro-proteins were immobilized on the chip (2000 and 500 response units, respectively; the difference in immobilization was taken into account), and 2-fold dilutions of Toll were injected starting with 19.4 μm using the settings described above. Sensorgrams were analyzed using BiaEval 3.1 software, and KD estimates were determined by fitting selected curves using the simultaneous ka/kD function with a 1:1 binding model. Luciferase Assays—The stably transfected cell line 648-1B6, derived from S2 cells (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar), was used to monitor induction of a drosomycin-luciferase reporter gene. Cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider’s medium (Biowest) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 105 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml puromycin. To monitor induction of the Toll pathway, cells were seeded at a density of 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates and stimulated overnight by addition of recombinant Spätzle to the culture medium. Cells were then lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (BCL Book, Promega) immediately after adding the substrate (luciferin; Promega). The Spätzle Pro-domain Is Required for Folding and Secretion of the Active Fragment—Previous studies (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar) revealed that the pro-domain of Spätzle is natively unstructured and appears to suppress binding of the Spätzle active fragment to the Toll receptor prior to proteolytic processing. To determine whether active C106 could be synthesized and secreted without being linked to its pro-domain, we produced a construct in which C106 is linked directly to the secretory signal sequence from honeybee melittin (17Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. Khouri H.E. Laliberte F. Vernet T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or from the Toll receptor. As shown in Fig. 1, removal of the pro-domain drastically reduced the ability of C106 to be secreted into the culture medium with most of the synthesized protein being present in the cellular fraction (compare respective lanes 2–5 in Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, intact full-length Spätzle secretes efficiently (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7). Samples were also analyzed by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and this reveals that the characteristic intermolecular disulfide bond that normally connects two polypeptide chains in the Spätzle dimer (5DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar) is absent in the synthesized C106 protein (Fig. 1C). Instead the protein appears to form multiple disulfide-linked aggregates. Description and Structural Analysis of Spätzle Cystine Knot Mutant Alleles—The importance of Spätzle in Drosophila was initially established by the phenotypic characterization of mutant embryos (18Schneider D.S. Jin Y. Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to define discrete sites in Spätzle that abolish function, we sequenced the spätzle(spz) gene isolated from three loss of function mutants generated in this mutagenesis screen (spz2,3,4) (18Schneider D.S. Jin Y. Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a fourth allele, spzU5, which was isolated in a genetic screen for mutants on the third chromosome affected in their antifungal response. 5V. Leclerc and J.-M. Reichhart, personal communication. Two of these are point mutations (spz2 and spzU5), mapped to the prodomain, providing genetic evidence that it plays an important biological role (see below and Fig. 2A). The two other alleles contain point mutations in the C106 region, Q207R (spz3) and C232Q (spz4; Fig. 2A, see also supplemental Fig. S1). 6The sequence numbering for Spätzle is based on the splice isoform HL0462 (GenBank™ accession number EF155533) which is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. On the basis of an existing model (7Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), they would be expected to severely compromise the cystine knot structure because of changes in its interior packing or absence of one canonical cystine bond, respectively. Importantly, these two residues are conserved in NGF and other neurotrophins (Fig. 2B), thus highlighting the functional relevance of the structural relationships between Spätzle and neurotrophins. Comparing the NGF structure with the C106 model (7Mizuguchi K. Parker J.S. Blundell T.L. Gay N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we found that many of the conserved residues are located on the molecular surfaces of the NGF structure (Fig. 2C). In NGF, residues that mediate binding to the p75 receptor are located in two distinct binding areas (19He X.L. Garcia K.C. Science. 2004; 304: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). It is interesting to note that, according to our analysis, equivalent residues in C106 are either conserved or charge reversals (Fig. 2E; see also “Discussion”). The Gln residue affected in the spz3 allele falls within a cluster of conserved residues involved in receptor interaction in NGF (Fig. 2B). Rather than rendering the protein dysfunctional because of defects in interior packing, as mentioned earlier, it is possible that this mutation could cause conformational changes in the surface residues surrounding the Gln residue, thereby abrogating their interactions with the Toll receptor. Further mutagenesis studies will help to ascertain if the C106 N terminus is in fact a site of interaction with Toll, analogous to that in NGF for its receptor p75. Two Loss of Function Mutations in Spätzle Map to a Discrete Site in the Pro-domain and Are Defective in Biosynthesis and Secretion—The mutant allele, spz2, which also leads to a strongly dorsalized phenotype in the embryo similar to spz3 and spz4 (20Carroll S.B. Winslow G.M. Twombly V.J. Scott M.P. Development (Camb.). 1987; 99: 327-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a tyrosine to asparagine amino acid exchange in residue 134. This residue is located in the pro-domain 31 amino acids prior to the proteolytic processing site and is included in all known splice isoforms of Spätzle (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). Remarkably, the fourth loss of function allele of spz, spzU5, contains a change in the adjacent residue proline 135 to leucine (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus two out of four sequenced mutant alleles of spz map to the pro-domain, establishing genetically its importance. To study the functional basis of the defect in Spz2, we expressed the protein in the Drosophila cell line SL2. As shown in Fig. 3, wild-type Spätzle is efficiently secreted from SL2 cells as a dimer, as indicated by the presence of a band of an apparent mass of 65 kDa (compare lane 4 with lane 2 in Fig. 3A). By contrast, Spz2 cannot be detected as dimer or monomer in supernatants (lane 6 in Fig. 3A). However, some Spz2 protein can be detected in reducing conditions (compare lanes 6 and 2 in Fig. 3B), indicating that a low level of protein can be secreted in multimeric form. Spz2 is also present in monomeric or multimeric form in cell lysates (compare lane 5 with lane 1 in Fig. 3, A and B). This result strongly suggests that the loss of function associated with the spz2 allele is caused by a defect in biosynthesis and secretion and not in signaling. We then carried out a similar analysis with SpzU5 protein. We could not detect the presence of protein in supernatants (compare lane 3 with lane 2 and lane 6 with lane 5 in Fig. 3C), but we did observe the protein in cell lysates (Fig. 3C, lane 9). Taken together, these results identify a sequence region within the pro-domain, including residues 134 and 135, that is essential for the efficient folding and secretion of dimeric Spätzle pro-protein. Glycosylation of the Pro-domain Does Not Affect Secretion of Spätzle—One hallmark of the primary sequence of the prodomain is the presence of two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-49 and Asn-108; see Figs. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1), the latter being in exon H close to the site of the spz2 mutation (see Figs. S1 and supplemental Fig. S2). We next asked whether the pro-domain was modified by N-linked glycosylation during biosynthesis. Furthermore, as N-glycosylation has been shown to promote protein folding (reviewed in Ref. 21Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), we wanted to address whether this modification was also required for biosynthesis and secretion or whether the protein backbone by itself was sufficient to bring about this effect. To address these questions we mutated the respective serine or threonine residue in either the first or both of the acceptor sites to alanine to produce SpzNGly1 and SpzNGly1+2. These constructs were then expressed in SL2 cells, and protein secretion was analyzed as for Spz2 and SpzU5. As shown in Fig. 3, D and E, the protein produced by the SpzNGly1 construct has the same mobility in SDS-PAGE as wild-type Spätzle but SpzNGly1+2 migrates faster (compare lane 4 to lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 3, D and E). This shows that Asn-108 is a site for the addition of an N-linked glycan. Treatment of SL2 cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin increases electrophoretic mobility of Spz similarly to the SpzNGly1+2 mutation, confirming that the precursor form of Spz is N-glycosylated (compare lanes 6–8 to lanes 2–4 in Fig. 3E). Fig. 3, D and E, also shows that the glycosylation of Asn-108 does not have a significant effect on the secretion of Spätzle or its assembly into a dimer. The Pro-domain and C106 Remain Associated after Endoproteolysis—In a previous study we showed that C106 could be generated by partial proteolysis with trypsin, a treatment that completely degrades the pro-domain (8Weber A. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J. Lelièvre E. Gascan H. Ray K. Morse M. Imler J. Gay N. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar). With the intention of studying the activation process in a purified system more similar to that found in vivo, we engineered an expression construct that could be processed by a specific endoprotease. We used overlapping PCR to generate a Spätzle construct in which a 7-residue recognition sequence for TEV protease (22Dougherty W.G. Parks T.D. Virology. 1989; 172: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopu"

These results were extended to determine whether the degradation of DAPK in the absence of HSP90 activity is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our results show that treatment of cells with geldanamycin (GA) leads to degradation of DAPK, and this degradation is attenuated by the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. GA-induced DAPK degradation is also dependent on phosphorylation of DAPK at Ser308, and the cellular levels of phospho(Ser308)-DAPK dramatically increase in response to GA treatment. Expression of two distinct ubiquitin E3 ligases, carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP) or DIP1/Mib1, enhanced DAPK degradation, and conversely, short interfering RNA depletion of either CHIP or DIP1/Mib1 attenuated DAPK degradation. In vitro ubiquitination assays confirmed that DAPK is targeted for ubiquitination by both CHIP and DIP. Consistent with these results, DAPK is found in two distinct immune complexes, one containing HSP90 and CHIP and a second complex containing only DIP1/Mib. Collectively, these results indicate that strict modulation of DAPK activities is critical for regulation of apoptosis and cellular homeostasis.

Mechanisms regulating cellular stabilization and turnover of DAPK, although not completely defined, appear to be critical for modulating DAPK activities. Our previous studies have shown that DIP1/Mib1 (DAPK-interacting protein 1/mindbomb 1) can ubiquitinate DAPK both in vitro and in vivo to result in degradation of DAPK by the proteasome. Recently, Citri et al. (14Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14361-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) reported that 17-AAG, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), induced DAPK degradation and in addition showed an interaction between the αC-β loop, within the kinase domain of DAPK and HSP90 (14Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14361-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). HSP90 is an important chaperone, controlling the stability of thousands of client proteins. Most HSP90 client proteins are key signaling proteins and protein kinases that regulate cell survival, proliferation metastasis, and angiogenesis (15Georgakis G.V. Younes A. Future Oncol. 2005; 1: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Dynamic assembly of client protein-HSP90 complexes by the chaperone machinery stabilizes client proteins, and inhibition of HSP90 by ansamycin antibiotics like 17-allyalamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), geldanamycin (GA), or radicicol enhances the degradation of the clients via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Georgakis G.V. Younes A. Future Oncol. 2005; 1: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). GA directly binds to the amino-terminal ATPase pocket of HSP90 at a higher affinity than ATP, locking this domain in its ADP-bound conformation. This conformational change inhibits HSP90 function and induces client protein degradation (15Georgakis G.V. Younes A. Future Oncol. 2005; 1: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a U-box-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain to independent TPR acceptor sites on HSP90 and HSP70 (17Ballinger C.A.

In the current study, we report that treatment of cells with HSP90 inhibitor GA leads to degradation of endogenous and recombinant DAPK. The GA-induced DAPK degradation was inhibited by proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. In addition, transient transfection of CHIP and DIP into HEK293 cells induced degradation of recombinant DAPK, and co-immunoprecipitation analysis of cellular extracts showed an association between DAPK and HSP90, CHIP, and DIP, suggesting that these proteins form complexes in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cellular levels of DAPK are regulated by a complex of proteins, including HSP90 and two distinct ubiquitin ligases, CHIP and DIP.

The pcDNA-His6-CHIP, pcDNA-His6-CHIP(K30A), and pcDNA-His6-CHIP(H260Q) vectors have been previously described (20Fan M. Park A. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2901-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The expression vector for human DAPK, pcDNA3-DAPK, was kindly provided by Dr. Adi Kimchi (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) Vectors for expression of hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin were provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann (University of Rochester). The human CHIP cDNA was subcloned from pcDNA-His6-CHIP into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pET28a(+). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HeLa cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was carried out using equal amounts of total plasmid DNA (adjusted with the corresponding empty vectors) by using Fugene 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for CHIP were synthesized by Dharmacon using the published sequence (target sequence 5′-GGAGCAGGGCAAUCGUCUG-3′) (25Qian S.B. McDonough H. Boellmann F. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. Nature. 2006; 440: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). DIP siRNA was also from Dharmacon (target sequence 5′-UCAUUGGCAUUCGAUGGAA-3′). Nontargeting siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and used as negative control. DharmFect 1 was used for the siRNA transfection. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein or immunoprecipitates were fractionated by electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactive proteins on Western blots were visualized using the Supersignal West Pico or West Femto detection systems (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cell extracts were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. For immunoprecipitation, the transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing recombinant DAPK were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate) containing protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with Trueblot IgG (eBioscience) beads. For each immunoprecipitation, 1-ml aliquots of lysates were incubated with 4–8 μg of DAP-3 antibody, anti-phospho-DAPK antibody, anti-His antibody, or anti-DIP antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were then isolated by the addition of 50 μl of Trueblot IgG beads and incubation for 1 h. The immune pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture, and the immune complexes were resolved by electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Expression and Purification of CHIP—His-CHIP was expressed in bacteria and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Protein concentrations of recombinant proteins were determined by the Bradford method and confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel fractionation of samples followed by Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Recombinant DAPK was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using purified chicken gizzard smooth muscle RLCs as described previously (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The amount of phosphorylated RLC was quantified from Western blotting of phospho-RLC using an antibody specific for RLC phosphorylated on Ser19. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant DAPK was incubated in a purified system containing an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (0.25 μm), an E2 UbcH5α (2 μm), His-tagged ubiquitin (0.6 mm), ATP (4 μm), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, expressed as final concentrations, for 2 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Where indicated, CHIP purified from bacteria was added to the reactions. After incubation, 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and reactions were analyzed by Western blotting to detect the ubiquitinated proteins. Geldanamycin Induces Proteasome-dependent DAPK Degradation—Our previous studies showed that the cellular levels of DAPK are post-translationally regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). That finding, together with the recent determination that DAPK is associated with HSP90 (14Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14361-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), led us to investigate whether the ubiquitin proteasome system is responsible for the degradation of DAPK when HSP90 activity is inhibited. To address this, HeLa cells were treated with varying concentrations of the HSP90 inhibitor, GA (1–10 μm for 24 h), and the levels of endogenous human DAPK were determined by Western blotting. GA induced degradation of endogenous DAPK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1), and at 10 μm GA, the relative level of DAPK decreased to 28 ± 5% of the DAPK present in the untreated control. We then examined the time course of DAPK degradation in response to 1 μm GA. Maximal degradation of DAPK was observed between 15 and 24 h post-HSP90 inhibition by GA treatment (Fig. 1B). Treatment of HeLa cells with lactacystin (10 μm) antagonized GA-induced DAPK degradation and restored expression levels of DAPK to 86 ± 8% of the untreated control (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with the proposal that in the absence of HSP90 activity, DAPK degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. To determine whether GA inhibition of HSP90 also induces degradation of exogenous DAPK, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for recombinant DAPK (rDAPK) and treated with GA in the presence or absence of lactacystin. As shown in Fig. 1C, GA treatment resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the expression levels of rDAPK, and lactacystin antagonized GA-induced rDAPK degradation. Together, these data confirm that DAPK is stabilized by HSP90 and suggest that in the absence of HSP90 activity, DAPK is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway similar to other client proteins. DAPK Forms Distinct Heterocomplexes with HSP90 and CHIP or DIP1/Mib—A recent study has shown that HSP90 recruits the U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, to target client proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (20Fan M. Park A. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2901-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and our previous studies have shown that DAPK is associated with the RING E3 ligase DIP1/Mib1 (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the DAPK·HSP90 complex may be associated either with DIP1/Mib1 or CHIP or both E3 ligases. To define the components of the DAPK·HSP90 complex, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-DAPK, pcDNA-His6-CHIP, and p3×FLAG-DIP1/Mib1. Endogenous human DAPK was immunoprecipitated using anti-DAPK antibody, and the immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to detect DAPK, CHIP, DIP1/Mib1, and HSP90 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the previous reports, DAPK co-immunoprecipitated with HSP90 (14Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14361-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and DIP1/Mib1 (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to these two known partners for DAPK, CHIP was also detected in the immune complex, demonstrating that DAPK can interact with HSP90, CHIP, and DIP1/Mib1. In order to define the dynamic nature of the interactions between DAPK, CHIP, DIP1/Mib1, and HSP90, either CHIP or DIP were immunoprecipitated using anti-His and anti-DIP1/Mib1 antibodies (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). The results in Fig. 2B show that when CHIP is immunoprecipitated, both DAPK and HSP90 are detectable in the immune complexes, but interestingly DIP1/Mib1 is not. Consistent with this, when DIP1/Mib1 is immunoprecipitated, only DAPK is detectable in the immune complexes, but HSP90 and CHIP are not (Fig. 2C). Together, these results suggest that DAPK forms two distinct complexes in cells; one complex includes both HSP90 and CHIP, and the second complex contains DIP1/Mib1 only. Effect of CHIP Expression on DAPK Stabilization in HEK293 Cells—To investigate whether the U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, CHIP, targets DAPK for proteasomal degradation, CHIP and human DAPK (rDAPK) were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. After a 48-h transfection period, the relative expression levels of CHIP and rDAPK were determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3A, increasing the expression level of CHIP resulted in a decreased expression of rDAPK. Quantitation of the Western blots showed a 6-fold decrease in DAPK expression relative to the expression level in cells in the absence of exogenous CHIP. Expression of either of two mutant CHIP proteins, K30A or H260Q, was found to have little effect on DAPK expression levels. CHIP-K30A contains a point mutation in the TPR domain and does not bind HSP90 or CHIP-H260Q, which contains a point mutation in its U box domain and fails to bind its cognate E2, thus disabling its E3 ligase activity. Lactacystin treatment (10 μm during the last 16 h of the transfection) antagonized CHIP-induced DAPK degradation and stabilized DAPK expression (Fig. 3B), indicating that the exogenously expressed CHIP enhanced degradation of DAPK by ubiquitination and targeting to the proteasome. To investigate whether depletion of CHIP could restore DAPK expression, we used a previously described CHIP-specific siRNA (25Qian S.B. McDonough H. Boellmann F. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. Nature. 2006; 440: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Transfection of increasing amounts of CHIP siRNA between 0 and 400 pm dramatically decreased the level of CHIP expression and attenuated CHIP-induced degradation of DAPK (Fig. 3C). To determine whether CHIP plays a role in GA-induced DAPK degradation, CHIP siRNA was used to deplete endogenous levels of CHIP in HEK293 cells. Transfection of increasing levels of CHIP siRNA attenuated GA-induced DAPK degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). To establish whether CHIP targets DAPK for ubiquitination, in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as previously described (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For these assays, HEK293 cells were transfected with X-press-tagged DAPK, and then DAPK was immunoprecipitated using an X-press tag antibody. These immune complexes were added to an in vitro ubiquitination assay consisting of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5a (E2), His-tagged ubiquitin, ATP, and bacterially expressed, purified CHIP. After incubation, ubiquitinated proteins were examined using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3E, inclusion of CHIP in the reaction increased ubiquitination of DAPK in vitro, a result consistent with the observed degradation of DAPK induced by expression of CHIP in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CHIP can target DAPK for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. DIP Overexpression Decreases and DIP Knockdown Increases DAPK Protein Level—Previous studies using overexpression approaches have suggested that another E3 ubiquitin ligase, called DIP1/Mib1, targets DAPK for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To confirm this, HEK293 cells were transfected with increasing amounts (0–1.5 μg) of plasmid DNA encoding DIP1/Mib1 and analyzed by Western blotting. As seen in Fig. 4A, DIP/Mib1 overexpression increased degradation of endogenous human DAPK in a dose-dependent manner to less than 30% of its original expression level, confirming that DAPK is targeted for ubiquitin proteasome-mediated degradation by DIP1/Mib1 (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To further establish that DIP1/Mib1 is a DAPK-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase, a DIP1/Mib1-specific siRNA was used to deplete exogenous DIP1/Mib1 in HEK293 cells. Depletion of DIP1/Mib1 attenuates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of DAPK induced by DIP (Fig. 4B). Because GA induces DAPK degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and DIP1/Mib1 is an E3 ligase that can ubiquitinate DAPK, we investigated the role of DIP1/Mib1 in GA-induced DAPK degradation. As shown in Fig. 4C, DIP1/Mib1 depletion by its specific siRNA attenuated GA-induced DAPK degradation in a dose-dependent manner, restoring expression to 79% of its original level. Inhibition of HSP90 Activity Induces DAPK Degradation and Decreases DAPK Activity—The catalytic activity of DAPK is inhibited by autophosphorylation of serine 308, which resides within the calmodulin-binding domain of this calcium-regulated protein kinase. Our previous studies have determined that, following activation, DAPK is ubiquitinated and degraded (9Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other studies have linked alterations of the phosphorylation status of proteins to ubiquitination (26Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Doucet C. Gutierrez G.J. Lindon C. Lorca T. Lledo G. Pinset C. Coux O. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Rees I. Lee S. Kim H. Tsai F.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To extend these results, we investigated whether or not there is a potential link between the phosphorylation status of DAPK and its association with HSP90. To test this, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μm GA for 0.5–16 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm lactacystin. Whole cell lysates were prepared and then analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to detect endogenous phospho(Ser308)-DAPK or total DAPK. Interestingly, these results show that the level of detectable phospho(Ser308)-DAPK was increased 3-fold within 16 h of GA treatment, whereas total DAPK levels diminished 4-fold (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, phospho(Ser308)-DAPK migrates as a doublet on these gels, suggesting the possibility that there may be additional modifications to the phospho(Ser308)-DAPK or multiple phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent increase in the level of detectable phospho(Ser308)-DAPK observed in HeLa cells treated with GA (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the phosphorylated, inactive form of DAPK accumulates in the absence of HSP90 activity. A previous report has demonstrated that autophosphorylation at Ser308 inhibited DAPK catalytic activity and that dephosphorylation of Ser308 was required for activation of DAPK (7Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether GA inhibition of HSP90 activity would alter the catalytic activity of DAPK, an in vitro kinase assay using purified chicken gizzard myosin II regulatory light chains (RLCs) as the substrate was performed (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with X-press-tagged DAPK were treated with 1 μm GA for 16 h prior to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation using an anti-X-press antibody. The immunoprecipitated DAPK was washed in assay buffer and added to the in vitro kinase reaction. Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the level of DAPK RLC phosphorylation activity using an anti-phospho-RLC antibody for Ser19 phosphorylation. Because DAPK is activated by Ca2+/CaM binding, the kinase assay was performed both in the presence and absence of Ca2+/CaM. In the absence of Ca2+/CaM, DAPK activity was much lower than the activity in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, a result consistent with previous studies (7Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that DAPK immunoprecipitated from GA-treated cells had much lower activity than DAPK in control cells irrespective of inclusion of Ca2+/CaM in the assay. The results of these in vitro kinase assays suggested that treatment of cells with GA significantly increases the cellular level of phospho(Ser308)-DAPK and results in a corresponding decrease in DAPK catalytic activity. To further elucidate the mechanism resulting in accumulation of the phosphorylated DAPK in the presence of GA, HEK293 cells were transfected with different amounts of CHIP or DIP1/Mib1 DAPK together with a constant amount of human DAPK, and total DAPK or phosphorylated DAPK levels were determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5D, total DAPK levels were significantly decreased in the presence of CHIP or DIP1/Mib1, whereas there was no significant change in the expression level of phosphorylated DAPK. This suggests that both CHIP and DIP1/Mib1 target only the dephosphorylated, active DAPK and not phosphorylated inactive DAPK. Consistent with this suggestion, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also showed that there is no direct interaction between phosphorylated inactive DAPK and CHIP or DIP1/Mib1, although HSP90 still can be co-immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated DAPK (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these data indicate that GA inhibition of HSP90 activities induces preferential degradation of the dephosphorylated, active DAPK to result in accumulation of autophosphorylated, inactive DAPK and attenuation of DAPK catalytic activity. Previous studies have established that the catalytic activity of DAPK is regulated by Ca2+/CaM and by autophosphorylation of Ser308 within its calmodulin-binding domain. It has also been shown that the expression levels of DAPK are modulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and that DAPK interacts with HSP90 (14Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14361-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Those studies suggest that an intricate network of protein modifications and interactions acts to regulate the activities of this fascinating Ser/Thr protein kinase. In the present study, by identifying novel components of the DAPK signaling complex and defining their roles in modulating the cellular levels of DAPK, we have extended our understanding of how DAPK activities are regulated. It has been established that in the presence of HSP90 inhibitors like GA or 17-AAG, many client proteins are destabilized and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (29Zhang H. Burrows F. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, other studies have linked phosphorylation status of proteins to ubiquitination and degradation (26Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 27Doucet C. Gutierrez G.J. Lindon C. Lorca T. Lledo G. Pinset C. Coux O. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Rees I. Lee S. Kim H. Tsai F.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we have recently reported that subsequent to its dephosphorylation and activation, DAPK is rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (9Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The recent determination that DAPK and HSP90 are associated (14Citri A. Harari D. Shohat G. Ramakrishnan P. Gan J. Lavi S. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Pietrokovski S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14361-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) prompted us to further investigate the events regulating the cellular levels of DAPK. We show for the first time that GA inhibition of HSP90 results in DAPK degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and that DAPK degradation is mediated by the activities of two distinct E3 ligases, CHIP and DIP1/Mib1. This conclusion is supported by studies demonstrating that the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin attenuates GA-induced DAPK degradation (Fig. 1). However, we also noted that lactacystin does not completely restore expression of DAPK to control levels, suggesting the possibility that additional proteolytic systems may operate to modulate the cellular levels of DAPK. The ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway is an important triage pathway that enforces quality control on protein activities in cells and consists of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes (30Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The E3 ligases are a large group of diverse molecules that function to identify target substrates and mediate the covalent ligation of ubiquitin by direct interaction with the target (31Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). We previously identified a novel RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, called DIP1, which was later also identified as mindbomb (Mib1) (32Itoh M. Kim C.H. Palardy G. Oda T. Jiang Y.J. Maust D. Yeo S.Y. Lorick K. Wright G.J. Ariza-McNaughton L. Weissman A.M. Lewis J. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Chitnis A.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 67-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Those studies showed that DIP1/Mib1 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates DAPK to promote its proteasomal degradation (8Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended those results and determined that siRNA-mediated depletion of DIP1/Mib1 expression rescues DAPK from proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 4). In addition, we show that siRNA-mediated depletion of DIP1/Mib1 attenuates GA-induced DAPK degradation, linking DIP1/Mib1-directed ubiquitination and degradation of DAPK to DAPK degradation induced in response to HSP90 inhibitors (Fig. 4). Previous studies have demonstrated that CHIP, a U-box-containing E3 ligase, binds through its TPR domain to TPR acceptor sites on HSP90 to mediate ubiquitination of at least some HSP90 client proteins (18Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Based on those reports and our finding that DAPK is targeted for proteasome degradation by ubiquitination, we asked whether CHIP could also target DAPK for degradation. The present studies demonstrate that overexpression of CHIP induces the degradation of DAPK and that inhibition of the proteasome with the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, attenuates the DAPK degradation caused by CHIP overexpression (Fig. 3). Consistent with this, we also show, using an in vitro ubiquitination assay, that CHIP increases ubiquitination of DAPK (Fig. 3). Finally, by using siRNA to deplete levels of CHIP, we can rescue DAPK from CHIP-induced degradation. Together, these results suggest that CHIP can also target DAPK for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Since CHIP has been previously reported to associate directly with HSP90 in a heterocomplex (18Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we asked whether CHIP, DIP1/Mib1, and DAPK co-associate in a heterocomplex with HSP90. These studies revealed that two distinct DAPK heterocomplexes are present in cells. In one complex, HSP90, CHIP, and DAPK are associated (Fig. 2, A and B). In a second complex, however, only DAPK and DIP1/Mib1 are associated (Fig. 2C). The finding that two E3 ligases are associated with the DAPK is surprising; however, it may suggest that regulation of DAPK activities by proteasomal degradation is critical and that when DAPK is complexed with HSP90 it can be ubiquitinated by CHIP and when released from HSP90 it can be ubiquitinated by DIP1/Mib1. This heightened surveillance of DAPK activities by HSP90, CHIP, and DIP1/Mib1 may also reflect the central importance of DAPK in regulation of cellular death and survival pathways (1Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Jin Y. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51587-51593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion are the recent findings that Cdt-1, a DNA licensing and replication protein, and p27Kip1, a DNA replication inhibitor, are targeted for degradation by two E3 ubiquitin ligases, DDB1-Cul4 and SCF-Skp2 (34Bondar T. Kalinina A. Khair L. Kopanja D. Nag A. Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2531-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Liu E. Li X. Yan F. Zhao Q. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17283-17288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). One question these results raise that is currently being investigated is whether CHIP and DIP1/Mib1 utilize the same or distinct ubiquitination sites within DAPK and the location of these ubiquitination sites. In the current report, we also show that treatment of cells with GA results in accumulation of inactive phospho (Ser308)-DAPK, consistent with the low catalytic activity found using immunoprecipitated total DAPK in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 5). Together, these data suggest that inhibition of HSP90 activity not only induces DAPK degradation, it also attenuates DAPK catalytic activity by the selective degradation of active DAPK. Unexpectedly, we found that GA also attenuated degradation of DAPK by both E3 ligases (Figs. 3 and 4), although HSP90 does not appear to be associated with the DAPK·DIP1/Mib1 complex. This finding suggests that the effect of GA on DIP1/Mib1-mediated degradation of DAPK is not directly related to its association with HSP90. If this is true, then following dephosphorylation and activation, DAPK would be released from the HSP90·CHIP complex, phosphorylate substrates such as myosin II RLC, and then become ubiquitinated through its association with DIP1/Mib1. Prior to its release from HSP90, any misfolded DAPK that is unable to achieve a native conformation could be targeted for degradation by CHIP. Alternatively, it is also possible that a fraction of HSP90 is in fact associated with DIP1/Mib1·DAPK heterocomplexes, but its association is weak or below the level that is detectable by Western blotting. The finding that DAPK is a target for at least two E3 ubiquitin ligases (DIP1/Mib1 and CHIP), one of which is found complexed with HSP90, suggests that these two heterocomplexes function to scrutinize the folding and activation of DAPK as well as to modulate DAPK activities in cells. The finding that GA inhibition of HSP90 enhances degradation of the active, dephosphorylated DAPK suggests a link between activation and degradation (Fig. 5) and is consistent with our previous results showing that tumor necrosis factor treatment results in DAPK dephosphorylation and activation, which is subsequently attenuated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of DAPK (9Jin Y. Blue E.K. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39033-39040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In summary, we find that inhibition of HSP90 results in degradation of active dephosphorylated DAPK via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The discovery that GA treatment dramatically increases the expression levels of the inactive form of DAPK, phospho(Ser308)-DAPK, whereas total DAPK decreases them, suggests that HSP90 activity is essential for stabilization of activated DAPK. The finding that DAPK can be isolated from cells in heterocomplexes composed of HSP90 and CHIP or DIP1/Mib1 and that DAPK is targeted for proteasomal degradation through the activities of two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases (CHIP, a U-box E3 ligase, and DIP1/Mib1, a RING E3 ligase) indicates that heightened surveillance and modulation of DAPK activities is critical to accurate regulation of apoptosis and cellular homeostasis."

The PPAR subfamily includes three isotypes, named α, δ (or β), and γ, that share extensive structural homology (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). Although all three isotypes act as lipid sensors and are involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism, they have distinct tissue distribution, ligand specificity, and functions (2Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 4Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). PPARα is involved in fatty acid metabolism, and high affinity ligands of this receptor, like fenofibrate and bezafibrate, are effective hypolipidemic drugs (5Lefebvre P. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). PPARγ prevalently controls lipid and glucose metabolism, and PPARγ agonists, like rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are widely used anti-diabetic drugs (6Semple R.K. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). PPARδ, which is the less studied of the three isotypes, has been implicated in wound healing, inflammatory responses, and embryo implantation in addition to lipid metabolism (4Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 7Barish G.D. Narkar V.A. Evans R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 590-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar).

Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). PPARδ is overexpressed in colon, endometrial, and head and neck cancers (9He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Consistent with a tumor promoting role, PPARδ has been shown to increase the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, like ILK (integrin-linked kinase) and PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and to activate the pro-survival Akt signaling pathway in keratinocytes (20Di-Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of this nuclear receptor in carcinogenesis is still controversial. Somatic knockdown of PPARδ decreased growth of human colon cancer xenografts in mice (21Park B.H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2598-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), whereas in other studies the frequency of colon polyps was not affected or even increased in PPARδ knock-out mice (22Harman F.S.

Thus, this nuclear receptor is involved in many critical cell functions, including proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, the mechanisms mediating its effects and the outcome in different cells and tissues remain unclear. Although much is known about the mechanisms that regulate the activity of most nuclear receptors, very limited information is available regarding PPARδ. At the transcriptional level, PPARδ was shown to be a downstream target of the oncogenic Wnt/APC/β-catenin pathway, showing for the first time a link with colon carcinogenesis (9He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Activated oncogenic Ras stimulated PPARδ expression in intestinal cells (25Shao J. Sheng H. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3282-3288PubMed Google Scholar), whereas activator protein-1 (26Tan N.S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38700-38710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) controlled its expression in keratinocytes. Activity and expression of PPARδ were inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in colon cancer cells, relating this nuclear receptor to the chemopreventive effects of this class of anti-inflammatory compounds (9He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 14Shureiqi I. Jiang W. Zuo X. Wu Y. Stimmel J.B. Leesnitzer L.M.

Less is known about post-transcriptional mechanisms that control PPARδ protein level and activity. A better understanding of the multiple mechanisms that modulate ligand-dependent and -independent activity might provide hints into the involvement of PPARδ in human diseases and indicate ways to exploit its therapeutic potential. In this study we examined the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in basal and ligand-dependent turnover of PPARδ. The UPS is the major cellular machinery responsible for degradation of proteins and determines the level of critical regulatory factors, including nuclear receptors and transcription factors (28Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 29Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W.

We found that PPARδ was ubiquitinated and subject to rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. However, unlike most nuclear receptors that are degraded upon ligand binding, PPARδ was stabilized by its ligands. PPARδ agonists inhibited ubiquitination of the receptor with consequent block of its degradation. Thus, PPARδ ligands have a dual effect on the receptor. Ligands induce conformational changes, allowing co-activator binding and promoter transactivation, and at the same time prevent ubiquitination of the receptor engaged in transcriptional activation complexes. Block of ubiquitination may be an essential step to avoid rapid degradation of a receptor with very short half-life, like PPARδ, and sustain its transcriptional activity. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Chemicals—Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells and non-small cell lung cancer H358, H441, and A549 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (LGC Promochem, Molsheim Cedex, F) and maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In all experiments involving incubation with PPARδ ligands, cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Full-length human wild type PPARδ (a gift of Bert Vogelstein, John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) was subcloned into pCMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) expression vectors. The C91A/C94A, F270A, and L432A/E435A PPARδ mutants and the truncated form of PPARδ-(1–299) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3.1/His-PPARδ using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The HA-Ub expression vector was kindly provided by Ron R. Kopito (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), and the PPREx3-tk-Luc reporter vector was a gift of Ronald M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Cells were transfected with expression and reporter vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells stably expressing PPARδ were obtained upon transfection with pCMV-PPARδ vector and selection in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). GW501516 (Alexis, Lausanne, CH), L165041 (Sigma), cPGI2 (carboprostacyclin; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and prostaglandin E2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were dissolved in Me2SO. Proteasome inhibitors PS341 and MG132 were dissolved in Me2SO. Puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma) was prepared in water. Reporter Assay—Cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were plated in 48-well plates and transfected with the PPREx3-tk-Luc, pRL-SV40 vectors and, when indicated, with PPARδ expression vectors. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Catalys AG, Wallisellen, CH) using a Turner luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). Data were normalized for Renilla luciferase activity used as control for transfection efficiency. PPARδ Half-life—U2OS cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to 90% confluence. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of His-PPARδ expression vector. The next day cells were plated into 6-well plates at a concentration of 3.5 × 105 cells/well. After overnight incubation with or without a PPARδ ligand, cells were treated with 50 μm puromycin and harvested at the indicated times for Western blotting. PPARδ Ubiquitination—U2OS cells were transfected with His-PPARδ and HA-Ub and incubated with proteasome inhibitors and/or PPARδ ligands. After 24 h cells were lysed in a denaturing buffer consisting of 8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. His-PPARδ was pulled down using His-select nickel affinity gel (Sigma) starting with ∼100 μg of protein from cell lysates. After multiple washes with urea buffer, proteins were eluted from the beads with the same buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole, pH 6.0. Aliquots of whole lysate and flow-through samples corresponding to 15 μg of proteins and an equivalent fraction of the eluates were loaded on gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). To isolate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 7.5 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as previously described (32Rodriguez-Vilarino S. Arribas J. Arizti P. Castano J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6592-6599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 5 min, sucrose (0.3 m final concentration) was added to the cell homogenate, and the cellular fractions were separated by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Proteins were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against PPARδ (H-74, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), tubulin (DM1B, Calbiochem), His tag (H1029, Sigma), FLAG tag (M2, Sigma) and HA tag (Roche Applied Science). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. Band intensity was assessed with the AlphaImager 3400 and AlphaEase Software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). RNA Isolation and Analysis—Cells (1 × 106 cells/flask) were incubated with PPARδ ligands overnight and proteasome inhibitors for 4 h. For RNA interference studies, cells were transfected with 100 nm small interfering RNA (Ambion Ltd., Huntingdon UK) specific for PPARδ (siPPARδ) or the firefly luciferase gene (siGL3) using Lipofectamine 2000, incubated for 48 h, and then treated with ligands and/or proteasome inhibitors. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and further purified with RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers for the adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and PPARδ. PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized using the AlphaImager 3400. Band intensity was determined using the AlphaEase software. For quantitative real time RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed on a 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using primer sets for ADRP and β-actin and Absolute SYBR Green ROX Mix (ABgene, Epsom, UK). Standard curves were generated for each primer set, and β-actin RNA was used as control to quantify ADRP RNA. Sequences of primers and small interfering RNAs are available as supplemental Table S1. PPARδ Ligands Stabilize the Receptor—Ligand-dependent transactivation of nuclear receptors is often associated with proteasome-mediated degradation of the receptor (33Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32565-32568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Dennis A.P. Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced proteolysis serves as a common mechanism to terminate transcriptional activity of the ligand-activated receptors (33Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32565-32568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Dennis A.P. Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPARδ was subject to a similar ligand-dependent control, human lung cancer cell lines expressing different levels of the receptor were incubated overnight with a PPARδ-selective ligand. PPARδ protein level increased after incubation with L165041 in cells expressing high (H441) and low (H358) levels of the receptor, whereas there was no effect in A549 cells in which PPARδ was undetectable in the immunoblots both before and after ligand treatment (Fig. 1A). The effect of the ligand on the receptor levels correlated well with the ligand ability to transactivate the PPAR-responsive reporter in these cells (Fig. 1B). Ligand treatment increased reporter activity ∼13- and 5-fold in H441 and H358 cells, respectively. The effect on A549 and U2OS cells was minimal (∼2-fold), in agreement with the very low levels of PPARδ in these cells. To better differentiate between transcriptional and post-translational effects, in subsequent experiments we used U2OS cells expressing recombinant PPARδ from a heterologous promoter. Increased levels of PPARδ were seen when PPARδ-expressing U2OS cells were treated with synthetic agonists (i.e. GW501516 and L165041) and a stable prostaglandin analogue (cPGI2 (carboprostacyclin)) that binds to PPARδ (Fig. 1, C and D). On the other hand treatment of cells with prostaglandin E2, a prostaglandin that activates PPARδ indirectly and does not bind to the receptor (19Wang D. Wang H. Shi Q. Katkuri S. Walhi W. Desvergne B. Das S.K. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 285-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), did not have any effect on the receptor protein level, suggesting that direct binding to the receptor was required to increase its stability. A time course experiment in PPARδ-expressing U2OS cells showed that the ligand acted rapidly (Fig. 1D). A substantial increase of PPARδ (∼2-fold) was seen already after 4 h, and the levels continued to increase (up to ∼4-fold) after 24 h. The effect on the protein level was reversible, and PPARδ returned to base-line levels within 4 h after the removal of the ligand (Fig. 1E). The effect seen in cells expressing PPARδ from a heterologous promoter made it unlikely that the increased protein level was a consequence of enhanced transcription. In fact, PPARδ transcript levels measured by RT-PCR were identical in PPARδ-expressing U2OS cells incubated with or without ligand (supplemental Fig. S1). The data described above suggested that ligands could affect PPARδ levels by influencing protein turnover. To estimate PPARδ half-life, we transiently transfected U2OS cells with a His-PPARδ expression vector and monitored protein level by Western blotting after the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. His-tagged PPARδ level was greatly reduced within 1 h of puromycin treatment (Fig. 2A). The estimated PPARδ half-life under these conditions was ∼30 min (Fig. 2C). Next, His-PPARδ expressing U2OS cells were incubated with puromycin in the presence of L165041 to determine the effects of the ligand on the receptor half-life. Incubation with L165041 increased PPARδ protein level and completely prevented the decline induced by puromycin (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, the ligand increased the receptor protein level by extending its half-life considerably. PPARδ Turnover Is Controlled by the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—The 26 S proteasome is the major cellular complex responsible for the degradation of proteins, including nuclear receptors and transcription factors (28Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 29Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W.

To determine whether proteasome-mediated degradation played a role in controlling the turnover of PPARδ, H441 and H358 cells expressing, respectively, high and low levels of the receptor were treated with the proteasome inhibitor PS341. In both cell lines PPARδ protein level increased, consistent with reduced degradation of the receptor in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained by treating cells with another proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (data not shown). To further study the role of the 26 S proteasome in PPARδ turnover, U2OS cells expressing recombinant His-PPARδ were treated with PS341, and protein level was determined at different times by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment with PS341 led to a significant accumulation of PPARδ (∼3-fold) already after 4 h of incubation. Next, U2OS cells were treated either with puromycin, PS341, or both compounds together (Fig. 3C). PPARδ level decreased rapidly in the presence of puromycin, whereas treatment with puromycin and PS341 resulted in a higher level of the receptor, indicating that PPARδ turnover was under the control of the proteasome. A necessary step for targeting proteins to the proteasome is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) chains catalyzed by Ub ligases (28Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPARδ was ubiquitinated, U2OS cells were transfected with His-PPARδ and HA-Ub expression vectors and then incubated with a proteasome inhibitor for 4 h. His-tagged PPARδ was pulled down using nickel affinity gel under denaturing conditions. This strategy avoided the use anti-PPARδ antibodies that had revealed limited specificity in preliminary immunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, it used highly stringent conditions to minimize non-covalent interactions of the receptor with potential ubiquitinated protein partners. Whole cell lysate and flow-through samples were examined along with the eluates to control for quantitative recovery of His-PPARδ throughout the procedure (Fig. 3D, lanes 1–4). The specificity of the pulldown was demonstrated using cells transfected with Histag empty vector (lanes 1, 3, and 5). In His-PPARδ-expressing cells, high molecular weight protein species were detected with the anti-HA antibody indicating the presence of PPARδ with covalently linked poly-Ub chains (lane 6). No such bands were detected in the eluate from empty vector-transfected cells (lane 5). Proteasome activity is required for receptor turnover, and its inhibition generally leads to reduced transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors (34Dennis A.P. Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 94: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Perissi V. Aggarwal A. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 511-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To determine whether a functional proteasome was required for PPARδ transcriptional activity, U2OS cells stably expressing recombinant PPARδ and H441 cells were transfected with a PPAR-responsive reporter and incubated with PS341 in the presence or absence of a PPARδ ligand (Fig. 4A). GW501516 increased reporter activity ∼ 6 and 12-fold in U2OS and H441 cells, respectively. PS341 induced a ∼2–3-fold increase in the absence of the ligand in both cell lines. The combination of PS341 and ligand increased reporter activity by ∼13 and 26-fold in U2OS and H441, respectively. Thus, inhibition of proteasome activity did not negatively affect ligand-dependent activation of PPARδ. Ligands and proteasome inhibitors had a positive and apparently synergistic effect on the activity of both recombinant and endogenous PPARδ in the reporter assays. To determine whether ligands and proteasome inhibitors had similar effects on transcription of endogenous PPARδ target genes, H358 and H441 cells were treated as described above, and the level of the ADRP RNA was monitored by real time RT-PCR or conventional RT-PCR. The ADRP gene contains a PPRE, and its transcription is activated by PPARδ agonists (36Lee C.H. Chawla A. Urbiztondo N. Liao D. Boisvert W.A. Evans R.M. Curtiss L.K. Science. 2003; 302: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In both cell lines PPARδ ligand increased ADRP RNA levels (by ∼10 and 25-fold in H358 and H441 cells, respectively). This effect was enhanced in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor (up to ∼25 and 100-fold in H358 and H441, respectively) (Fig. 4B). Neither the ligand nor proteasome inhibitor affected endogenous PPARδ RNA levels in H358 and H441 cells, confirming that they acted post-transcriptionally, increasing the protein level of endogenous PPARδ (Fig. 4C and data not shown). The specificity of these effects was further assessed by RNA interference. The increase induced by the PPARδ ligand both alone and in combination with PS341 was attenuated in cells in which PPARδ had been silenced (up to 75%) by a small interfering RNA against PPARδ before the incubation with GW501516 and/or PS341 (Fig. 4C). Despite the evident reduction of PPARδ RNA, ligand-dependent activation of ADRP transcription was reduced only partially by RNA interference because of the stabilizing effect of the ligand and proteasome inhibitor at the protein level. Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of the proteasome did not reduce PPARδ activity but, along with PPARδ ligands, led to the accumulation of transcriptionally competent receptor. To determine whether the accumulated protein had also the proper"
https://openalex.org/W2148914027,"DAPK-1 is a stress-activated tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic signal transduction pathways. To define mechanisms of DAPK-1 protein regulation, we have determined that DAPK-1 protein has a long half-life, and therefore its activity is primarily regulated at the protein level. Changes in DAPK-1 protein levels occur by a cathepsin B-dependent pathway, prompting us to evaluate whether cathepsin B plays positive or negative role in DAPK-1 function. The transfection of p55-TNFR-1 induced complex formation between DAPK-1 and cathepsin B. Depletion of cathepsin B protein using small interfering RNA stimulated TNFR-1 dependent apoptosis. The minimal binding region on DAPK-1 for cathepsin B was mapped to amino acids 836–947. The transfection of the DAPK-1-(836–947) miniprotein acted in a dominant negative manner inducing endogenous DAPK-1 protein degradation in a TNFR-1-dependent manner. These data suggest that DAPK-1 forms a multiprotein survival complex with cathepsin B countering the rate of TNFR-1-dependent apoptosis and highlights the importance of developing DAPK-1 inhibitors as agents to sensitize cells to stress-induced apoptosis. DAPK-1 is a stress-activated tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in both proapoptotic or antiapoptotic signal transduction pathways. To define mechanisms of DAPK-1 protein regulation, we have determined that DAPK-1 protein has a long half-life, and therefore its activity is primarily regulated at the protein level. Changes in DAPK-1 protein levels occur by a cathepsin B-dependent pathway, prompting us to evaluate whether cathepsin B plays positive or negative role in DAPK-1 function. The transfection of p55-TNFR-1 induced complex formation between DAPK-1 and cathepsin B. Depletion of cathepsin B protein using small interfering RNA stimulated TNFR-1 dependent apoptosis. The minimal binding region on DAPK-1 for cathepsin B was mapped to amino acids 836–947. The transfection of the DAPK-1-(836–947) miniprotein acted in a dominant negative manner inducing endogenous DAPK-1 protein degradation in a TNFR-1-dependent manner. These data suggest that DAPK-1 forms a multiprotein survival complex with cathepsin B countering the rate of TNFR-1-dependent apoptosis and highlights the importance of developing DAPK-1 inhibitors as agents to sensitize cells to stress-induced apoptosis. The tumor suppressor activity of p53 is linked to its function as a stress-responsive transcription factor (1Levine A.J. Hu W. Feng Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the p53 gene occur commonly in approximately half of human cancers, resulting in attenuation in p53-mediated transactivation (2Olivier M. Eeles R. Hollstein M. Khan M.A. Harris C.C. Hainaut P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Negative control of p53 is perhaps most well defined by a set of E3 ligases, including MDM2, PirH2, and COP-1 that accelerates ubiquitination and protein degradation (3Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Depletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligases does not spontaneously activate p53, since genetic studies have shown that positive regulation of p53 occurs through a set of protein kinases, including ATM, CHK2, DAPK-1, LKB, AMPK, and PKR. The mechanisms whereby these kinases mediate p53 activation are only partly defined for the ATM-dependent DNA damage-activated checkpoint pathway. Current models highlight the ability of the ATM target, CHK2, to phosphorylate both p53 and E2F1, which in turn leads to an induction of gene expression by both of these transcription factors (1Levine A.J. Hu W. Feng Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar).Although there are over 12 phosphorylation sites on p53 that alter transactivation, nuclear shuttling, and degradation, only two known biochemical activities are directly affected: sequence-specific DNA binding and p300 co-activator stability. Damage-stimulated phosphorylation of p53 at the C-terminal CK2 site (Ser392) forms a paradigm whereby sequence-specific DNA binding is stimulated by allosteric mechanisms (6Nichols N.M. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals with an alanine substituted CK2 phosphoacceptor site have attenuated levels of UV-induced p53-dependent transcription in mouse skin and enhanced UV-induced skin cancer development (8Bruins W. Zwart E. Attardi L.D. Iwakuma T. Hoogervorst E.M. Beems R.B. Miranda B. van Oostrom C.T. van den Berg J. van den Aardweg G.J. Lozano G. van Steeg H. Jacks T. de Vries A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8884-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 not only modulates sequence-specific DNA-binding but also protein-protein interactions with the co-activator and acetyltransferase p300. B-cell lymphoma incidence increases in transgenic mice models with an alanine-substitution (S23A) in the equivalent murine phosphoacceptor site (9MacPherson D. Kim J. Kim T. Rhee B.K.

The only known direct biochemical effect of Ser20 phosphorylation is to stabilize p300 binding (10Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Dornan D.

AMPK is a component of a metabolic checkpoint that activates p53-dependent gene expression in glucose-starved cells, although the mechanism whereby AMPK recruits p53 is undefined (13Jones R.G.

DAPK-1 is a component of an oncogene-activated checkpoint that activates p53 activity in an ADP-ribosylation factor-dependent manner (15Raveh T. Droguett G. Horwitz M.S. DePinho R.A. Kimchi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). DAPK-1 also functions as a mediator of interferon-γ-induced apoptosis (16Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A.

In this report, we focus on developing an understanding of how DAPK-1 protein is regulated in cancer cell lines. Although previous results have shown that DAPK-1 protein can be regulated at the gene expression level, we have determined that DAPK-1 protein has a relatively long half-life, and its activity can be regulated post-translationally. In particular, transfection of TNFR-1-induced complex formation between DAPK-1 and cathepsin B that coincided with relocalization of both cathepsin B and DAPK-1 in the cytosol. The depletion of cathepsin B protein using siRNA-stimulated TNFR-1-dependent apoptosis suggesting that this DAPK-1-containing multiprotein complex can regulate negatively the rate of TNFR-1-dependent cell death pathways. This survival function of DAPK-1 under these conditions highlights the importance of developing DAPK-1 inhibitors that can sensitize cells to selected stress-activated apoptotic signals. Accordingly, we have mapped the cathepsin B binding domain on DAPK-1 and report here that a miniprotein derived from the cathepsin B binding domain on DAPK-1 can act in a dominant negative manner, degrading DAPK-1 protein and stimulating TNFR-1-dependent apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Harvest, and Treatment—HeLa (human cervix epithelial carcinoma), A549 (human alveolar epithelial cell), and A375 (human melanoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, H1299 (human lung carcinoma) cells were cultured in RPMI medium, and HCT116 (human colon carcinoma) cells were cultured in McCoy medium. The medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a penicillin and streptomycin mixture at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. In a typical experiment, 106 cells were seeded into 10-cm tissue culture plates, and after seeding, cells were left for at least 24 h to attach to the bottom of the containers. Before harvesting, cells were first washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped into 1 ml of PBS. The virus mimicking reagent polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pIpC) from Sigma was used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Cycloheximide from Supleco was used at a concentration of 30 μg/ml. MG132 and cathepsin B inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-FA-fluoromethyl ketone) from Calbiochem was added to cells at a concentration of 10 μm. The HA-tagged DAPK-1 mutants were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and HA-DAPK-1 as a template. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Prior to transfection, Lipofectamine (∼2 μl/μg of DNA or siRNA) was added to Optimum medium without fetal bovine serum. After a 5-min incubation, the mixture was then added on the top of the DNA constructs or siRNA. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the whole solution was added on the cells. HA-tagged DAPK-1 was a kind gift from Adi Kimchi (Weizmann Institute), TNFR-1 vector was a gift of Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech), and GFP-cathepsin B was a gift from Antonio Baici (University of Zurich).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were extracted by lysing the cells with UREA buffer (7 m UREA, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton 100), and the protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (24Loffler B.M. Kunze H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The samples for fractionation were prepared using the subcellular proteome extraction kit from Calbiochem. NuPAGE gradient gels were used for electrophoresis and the NuPAGE gel was run in Novex XCell Sure-Lock gel apparatus filled with MOPS buffer. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane in Bio-Rad transferring kits filled with transfer buffer (3 g of Tris, 14.4 g of glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol in 1 liter of distilled H2O). Proteins were transferred at 300 mA for 1 h or 30 mA overnight. After transfer, the membranes were blocked in PBS-Tween 20 (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) with dry skimmed milk (5%, w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. Then after a quick wash with PBS-Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in the milk for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Before incubation with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min with PBS-Tween 20. After the incubation of secondary antibodies, the membrane was washed three times for 15 min. Finally, the membrane was incubated with ECL solution for 1 min, and the target proteins were detected by exposing the membrane to ECL hyperfilm.Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Protein G beads from GE Healthcare were used in the immunoprecipitation reaction. The beads were kept in 70% ethanol in a 1:1 ratio. Each reaction requires 25 μl of beads, and before the immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of IP dilution buffer (0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris/HCl, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor). Proteins for IP were extracted by lysing the cells with IP lysis buffer (1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris/HCl, 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor). The protein concentrations of each sample were tested by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of proteins were added to 1 ml of IP of dilution buffer. After that, the antibodies for IP and 50 μl of protein G beads in suspension were added into the tubes, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. After rotation, the beads were sedimented at 6000 rpm, and the supernatants were discarded. The beads were then washed six times by rotating them in 1 ml of IP dilution buffer for 5 min at room temperature.In Vitro Cleavage Assay—35S-labeled HA-DAPK-1 was synthesized using the TNT® translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 2 μl of the 35S-labeled HA-DAPK-1 was added to 3× cathepsin B reaction buffer (150 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 12 mm EDTA, and 24 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 μl of purified cathepsin B (U.S. Biological) (0.02 units/μl), which was diluted in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, with 1 mm EDTA prior to use. The final volume was brought to 15 μl with distilled water. The cleavage reaction was performed by incubation at 37 °C for times indicated. After incubation, 15 ml of 4× sample buffer was added to the samples, and then they were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were then dried, and the signals were detected by autoradiography.TUNEL Assay—HCT116 wild type cells were seeded directly onto coverslips in 6-well plates. 18 h later cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression vectors for a further 24 h. Following transfection cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were labeled using Apoptag Plus fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit S7111 (Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer's instructions and viewed by fluorescence microscopy.Annexin V Staining—HCT116 wild type cells were seeded into 6-well plates. 18 h later, cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression vectors for a further 24 h. In order to include any floating cells, medium was collected into fluorescence-activated cell sorting tubes and centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 4 min to leave a cell pellet. Medium was then discarded from tubes. Petri dishes were washed with 2 ml of PBS, PBS was discarded, and then 1.5 ml of trypsin was added to each plate and incubated until cells became detached. Following cell detachment, 1.5 ml of McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was added to each plate to stop the trypsin. The cell suspensions were then added to each of the relevant cell pellets from the floating cells. Samples were centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 4 min, and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged for a further 4 min at 1700 rpm prior to resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Samples were centrifuged for a further 4 min at 1700 rpm. Apoptotic cells were detected using a TACS Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (R&D systems) according to the manufacturer's instruction and analyzed by flow cytometry.Immunofluorescence—HCT116 wild type cells were seeded on the 4-well chamber slides. 18 h later, cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors for a further 24 h. Then the slides were washed in 1× PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and washed three times in 1× PBS afterward. The cells were then fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5 min and air-dried. After that, cells were permeabilized in freshly prepared 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 1× PBS, and slides were washed three with 1× PBS for 10 min. Following washes with 1× PBS, nonspecific sites were blocked for 1 h with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/PBS in room temperature. After three washes in 1× PBS, the chambers from each slide were removed, and cells were incubated overnight with the primary antibody (1:30,000) diluted in 1% (v/v) bovine serum albumin/PBS at 4 °C. Twenty-four hours postincubation, the slides were washed in 0.1% (v/v) PBS-Tween and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed three times in 1× PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween. Nuclei were counterstained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted with Fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation). The control for non-specific binding of the secondary antibody was the 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin/PBS, where no primary antibody was added. Microscopy analysis was performed on Zeiss microscope (Zeiss Axionplan Imaging Systems; kindly provided by the Medical Research Council, Human Genetics Unit).RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR—mRNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit following the manufacturer's suggested procedures. The optional step of DNase treatment using the Qiagen RNase-free DNase set was also included. 1 μl of the sample RNA was diluted in 100 μl of water and loaded into a 96-well UV plate. The absorbance was detected by the Bio-Tek plate reader at 260 nm. After the extraction, the real time PCRs were performed in the Opticon 4 machine using the Qiagen QuantiTect SYBR Green one-step PCR kit. Equal amounts of mRNA were loaded in each reaction. The actin primers used were as follows: L, 5′-CTACGTCGCCCTGGACTTCGAGC-3′; R, 5′-GATGGAGCCGCCGATCCACACGG-3′. The DAPK1 primers were as follows: L, 5′-CGAGGTGATGGTGTATGGTG-3′; R, 5′-CTGTGCTTTGCTGGTGGA-3′.RESULTSIn tumor cell lines with a defined p53 status, we set up experiments to determine whether DAPK-1 protein expression was controlled post-translationally. The mRNA and protein expressions of DAPK-1 in six different tumor cell lines were examined (Fig. 1A). In HCT116 cells, DAPK-1 protein is expressed in both p53 wild type (+/+) and p53 null (–/–) cells (Fig. 1A), whereas in HeLa cells, which have an HPV-E6 attenuated wild type p53 pathway, DAPK-1 levels are relatively high (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that the basal expression of DAPK-1 protein is not p53-dependent, which is consistent with previous work (25Martoriati A. Doumont G. Alcalay M. Bellefroid E. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). More interestingly, although in general the protein levels of DAPK-1 are consistent with the mRNA levels, HeLa cells actually possesses more DAPK-1 protein compared with A549 cells, whereas A549 cells have the highest mRNA level (Fig. 1A). This indicates that DAPK-1 can be regulated post-translationally, and this regulation may be important for determining the basal protein levels of DAPK-1.DAPK-1 was first discovered in interferon-γ-treated HeLa cells (16Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Therefore, we treated cells with the virus mimetic reagent pIpC to determine whether it can trigger transcriptional or post-translational changes in DAPK-1 levels. The poststress expression of a series of endogenous proteins, including interferon-responsive factor-1 (IRF-1) and DAPK-1, were detected (Fig. 1B). The IRF-1 level increased as expected, but there were no significant changes in the steady-state expression of any DAPK family members or p53. We treated cells with combined serum starvation and pIpC treatment, because the cells respond better to such stresses as reported previously (26Jang C.W. Chen C.H. Chen C.C. Chen J.Y. Su Y.H. Chen R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Upon serum starvation, DAPK-1 mRNA levels decreased by ∼50% in the HCT116 p53+/+ cells, whereas no changes were observed in the HCT116 p53–/– cells (Fig. 1C). This suggests that factors in the serum may induce DAPK-1 mRNA expression through p53, supporting the idea that p53 can induce DAPK-1 expression during some stress conditions (25Martoriati A. Doumont G. Alcalay M. Bellefroid E. Pelicci P.G. Marine J.C. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, instead of increasing DAPK-1 level, pIpC treatment has an inhibitory effect on the DAPK-1 mRNA expression in both HCT116 cell lines (Fig. 1C). This might be because pIpC works through a specific receptor pathway not involving DAPK-1 (27Kulka M. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Metcalfe D.D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2004; 114: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, despite the changes in mRNA levels, the DAPK-1 protein levels remain the same with or without treatment (Fig. 1C), suggesting again that gene transcription is not the key step for regulating DAPK-1 protein levels in cancer cell lines.The half-life of DAPK-1 protein was subsequently examined in HCT116 p53+/+ cells by performing a time course of cycloheximide, which inhibits the general translation machinery (Fig. 2, A and B). This was performed to determine whether DAPK-1 protein has a short half-life, like some signaling proteins, including p53 and IRF-1. In comparison with some short half-life proteins, such as p53 (Fig. 2A) and IRF-1 (Fig. 2A), DAPK-1 indeed has a much longer half-life (Fig. 2A). Further, in HeLa cells where DAPK-1-dependent signaling pathways operate, the treatment with cycloheximide further revealed a relatively long half-life (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that DAPK-1 protein might be stored or assembled into a stable and possibly latent multiprotein complex in cells, since it is not rapidly removed and resynthesized as are regulatory proteins like p53 and IRF-1.FIGURE 2DAPK-1 has a long half-life, and its steady-state levels are modified by MG132 and the cathepsin B inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-FA-FMK. A, DAPK-1 protein half-life in HCT116 cells. The half-life of the indicated proteins was determined by treating HCT116 p53+/+ cells with cycloheximide (CHX) and harvesting 20 min, 40 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 6 h post-treatment. DAPK-1, IRF-1, and p53 proteins were detected using the respective antibodies, and ink staining was used as the loading control. B, DAPK-1 protein half-life in HELA cells. The half-life of DAPK-1 protein in HeLa cells was determined by the cycloheximide treatment for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 6 h. DAPK-1 was detected using a DAPK-1-specific antibody. C, endogenous DAPK-1 protein levels in MG132-treated cells. The effect of MG132 on endogenous DAPK-1 protein levels was analyzed in A549 cells treated with MG132 for 6 h before harvesting (lanes 1 versus lanes 2). DAPK-1 protein was immunoblotted and the MG132-dependent cleavage changes are depicted using arrows as (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). D, transfected DAPK-1 protein levels in MG132-treated cells. The effect of MG132 on ectopically expressed GST-tagged DAPK-1 (lanes 1 and 2) and HA-tagged DAPK-1 (lanes 3 and 4) was performed in HCT116 cells treated with MG132 for 6 h before harvesting. Changes in MG132-dependent protein are depicted using arrows as (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v). E, the effect of a cathepsin B inhibitor on DAPK-1 protein levels. A549 cells were treated with MG132 (lane 2) or a cathepsin B inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-FA-fluoromethyl ketone) (lane 3) for 4 h before harvesting. The endogenous DAPK-1 was detected by immunoblotting. The arrows (i), (ii), and (iii) depict changes in the cleavage pattern of DAPK-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data are somewhat in contrast to a previous report that demonstrated that DAPK-1 can be controlled post-translationally through a proteasome-dependent pathway through the E3 ubiquitin ligase DIP-1 (28Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Shao Z. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46980-46986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We next tested the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on steady-state levels of endogenous and ectopically expressed DAPK-1 to determine whether DAPK-1 protein can be turned over by a proteasome-dependent pathway, despite the fact that it has a relatively long half-life. MG132 treatment increased slightly the DAPK-1 protein levels and rendered higher molecular mass adducts, which might be ubiquitinated DAPK-1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2 versus lane 1). However, as highlighted by the arrows, MG132 also unexpectedly depleted some lower mass fragments of DAPK-1. Ectopically expressed and tagged DAPK-1 protein also exhibited similar changes in higher and lower mass bands in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2D). This suggests that DAPK-1 protein and higher molecular mass covalent adducts are clipped by a protease(s) that can be inhibited by MG132.Several previous reports have described the appearance of DAPK-1 protein cleavage products (29Araki T. Shinoda S. Schindler C.K. Quan-Lan J. Meller R. Taki W. Simon R.P. Henshall D.C. Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Shamloo M. Soriano L. Wieloch T. Nikolich K. Urfer R. Oksenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42290-42299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These latter data are consistent with our data showing that DAPK-1 is cleaved by some proteases in vivo. Further, the accumulation of the 60-kDa cleavage band of DAPK-1 protein is specifically inhibited by a cathepsin B inhibitor (30Shamloo M. Soriano L. Wieloch T. Nikolich K. Urfer R. Oksenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42290-42299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, since MG132 can also function as a general inhibitor of cathepsins (31Kadlcikova J. Holecek M. Safranek R. Tilser I. Kessler B.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we compared the effect of cathepsin B inhibitor with MG132 on inhibition of the cleavage of DAPK-1 (Fig. 2E). The cathepsin B inhibitor depleted similar cleavage products as that observed using MG132. Further, the in vitro treatment of DAPK-1 with purified cathepsin B also induced a similar cleavage profile (Fig. 3A), suggesting that cathepsin B and not the proteasome is responsible for the accumulation of lower mass adducts seen in cells. Further, these data suggest that an interaction of cathepsin B with DAPK-1 in cells is inducing the proteolytic clipping of a small pool of the DAPK-1 protein.FIGURE 3Cathepsin B protein depletion using siRNA promotes TNF-α-induced degradation of DAPK-1 and stimulation of PARP cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2067123087,"Scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains are ancient protein modules widely found among cell surface and secreted proteins of the innate and adaptive immune system, where they mediate ligand binding. We have solved the crystal structure at 2.2 Å of resolution of the SRCR CD5 domain III, a human lymphocyte receptor involved in the modulation of antigen specific receptor-mediated T cell activation and differentiation signals. The first structure of a member of a group B SRCR domain reveals the fold of this ancient protein module into a central core formed by two antiparallel β-sheets and one α-helix, illustrating the conserved core at the protein level of genes coding for group A and B members of the SRCR superfamily. The novel SRCR group B structure permits the interpretation of site-directed mutagenesis data on the binding of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) binding to CD6, a closely related lymphocyte receptor homologue to CD5."

Here, we purify and identify the protein that interacts with procaspase-3 from rat neonatal cortex. We searched binding proteins to procaspase-3 from a cytosolic extract of neonatal rat brain using chromatogram, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and far Western immunoblot. Analysis by tandem mass spectrometry identified the protein as a regulatory subunit of calcineurin (calcineurin B). Overexpression of calcineurin B in HEK293 cells potentiated processing of caspase-3 and apoptosis triggered by tumor necrosis factor-α and cycloheximide treatment. In a cell-free system, overexpression of calcineurin B in HEK293 cells markedly increased processing of caspase-3 by cytochrome c. Immunodepletion of calcineurin B from cytosolic extracts from Jurkat cells decreased processing of caspase-3 by cytochrome c. Knockdown of calcineurin B by RNA interference resulted in reduced apoptosis in HEK293 cells but not in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that calcineurin B potentiates the activation of procaspase-3 by accelerating its proteolytic maturation.

These results suggest that calcineurin B potentiates the activation of procaspase-3 by accelerating its proteolytic maturation. Apoptosis is a type of cell death resulting from the activation of a genetically regulated cell suicide program. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetic pathway of apoptosis has been identified. Two genes, ced-3 and ced-4, are essential for the execution of apoptosis (1Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and ced-9 negatively regulates apoptosis by preventing activation of ced-3 and ced-4 (2Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Caspases, human homologues of the C. elegans CED-3, are the key effectors in the execution of apoptosis (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 4Denault J.S. Salvesen G.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4489-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized in cells as inactive zymogens (procaspases), which become proteolytically processed to generate active caspase. Although the exact mechanism that activates caspases is not fully understood, at least two major pathways have been described. In the case of the extrinsic pathway, membrane-bound receptors are oligomerized in response to ligand binding and directly activate the initiator caspases (5Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway involves release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. In the presence of cytochrome c, apoptotic protease activation factor-1 (Apaf-1), 2The abbreviations used are: Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activation factor-1; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; CHX, cycloheximide; Hsp, heat shock protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; siRNA, small interference RNA. a human homologue of the C. elegans CED-4, interacts with caspase-9 and produces a multiprotein complex, termed apoptosome (6Liu X.

The assembly of the apoptosome complex represents the initiating step for the activation of the intrinsic caspase cascade. Once activated in the apoptosome, caspase-9 cleaves procaspase-3. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and caspase-9 are crucial components of the intrinsic pathway. Two other classes of regulators have been reported. The best known of these is the Bcl-2 family, a human homologue of the C. elegans CED-9. The Bcl-2 family consists of both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic members. Antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, prevent the release of cytochrome c and thereby inhibit the subsequent activation of caspase (11Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). However, there is some evidence that Bcl-2 may prevent apoptosis downstream of cytochrome c. In C. elegans, CED-9 directly binds to CED-4 and inhibits the activation of CED-3 (12del Peso L. González V.M. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33495-33500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It has remained unclear whether Bcl-2 inhibits the function of Apaf-1 by direct binding (13Willis S. Day C.L. Hinds M.G. Huang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Another family is the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, such as X-linked IAP. IAPs directly bind to active caspases and either suppress their protease activity or target them for destruction by ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (14Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 239-252Crossref Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 15Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). X-linked IAP blocks the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by inhibiting caspase activity directly (16Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). The activity of X-linked IAP is regulated by release of other factors, such as Smac/Diablo, from mitochondria (17Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 18Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). To date, no activators have been identified that function subsequent to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Several lines of evidence indicate that heat shock proteins (Hsps) may function as apoptosis activators, but the mechanism remains unclear. Although Hsp70 or Hsp72 suppresses apoptosis by binding to Apaf-1 directly (19Xanthoudakis S. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E163-E165Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Saleh A.

Here, we purified the protein that interacts with procaspase-3 from rat neonatal cortex and identified that it is the regulatory subunit of calcineurin (calcineurin B). In addition, we report the function of calcineurin B in the processing of caspase-3. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant procaspase-3 and granzyme B and tacrolimus were from Calbiochem. Recombinant active caspase-9 and anti-caspase-9 antibody were from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Recombinant calcineurin was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-calcineurin B antibody was from Oncogene (Cambridge, MA). Anti-calcineurin A antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY).

Cycloheximide (CHX) was from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Calcineurin B cDNA was PCR-amplified from human calcineurin B cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Shibasaki), cloned into pENTR/D TOPO vector using a pENTR Directional TOPO cloning kit, and subcloned into pcDNA 6/BioEase or pET104 BioEase using Gateway System (Invitrogen). Sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. C-terminal His6-tagged wild type caspase-3 was a gift from Dr. G. Salvesen (Burnham Institute) and Dr. Takahashi (Brain Science Institute). C-terminal His6-tagged active site mutant caspase-3 was a gift from Dr. C. Clark (North Carolina State University). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), MCF-7, and PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 1 μl/ml amphotericin B. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Experimental protocols involving laboratory animals were approved by the Osaka University Animal Care and Use Committee. Wistar rats pregnant for 17 days were anesthetized under ether inhalation, and rat fetuses were removed from the uteri by Cesarean section. Cortex was prepared from fetal and neonatal rats under ether inhalation. HEK293 cells were transfected with either pcDNA 6/BioEase-GW/lacZ (control) or human calcineurin B-containing plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Clones stably expressing these constructs were then selected by growth in 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks. Individual blasticidin-resistant clones were examined for expression of calcineurin B by immunoblotting with anti-calcineurin B antibody. Cytosolic extract was prepared, as described previously (6Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Brain tissue or cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose (buffer A), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer. A postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to obtain a pellet rich in mitochondria. The postmitochondrial supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic extract. Aliquots of extracts were incubated with 2 μm horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) and 1 mm dATP (Sigma) for 2 h at 30 °C. After the incubation, cytochrome c-activated extract was incubated with 50 μm fluorescent substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) in 40 μl of 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 300 mm sucrose (caspase assay buffer). Fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Step 1: Mono Q Chromatography—The cytosolic extract was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-3 antibody, using enhanced chemiluminescence-based detection (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (25Saeki M. Maeda S. Wada K. Kamisaki Y. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 84: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Step 2: Gel Filtration Analysis—The pooled fractions number 6 and 7 in MonoQ were separated by a Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Aliquots were analyzed as described for step 1. For calibration of the column, Amersham Biosciences high molecular mass gel filtration protein standards were used (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa). The fractions were incubated with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS; Pierce) or dimethyl sulfoxide alone. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Cross-linked samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-3 antibody. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out by isoelectric focusing on 24-cm immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 4–7) using the IPGphor system, followed by SDS-PAGE using Multiphor II system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein aliquots dissolved in rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 60 mm DTT, and 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer) were applied to the immobilized pH gradient strips and rehydrated for 12 h. After rehydration, isoelectric focusing was performed for a total of 17,500 V-h by application of 500 V for 1 h, 1,000 V for 1 h, and 8,000 V for 2 h. Focused strips were then incubated in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.25% DTT) for 15 min followed by an additional 15-min incubation using equilibration buffer with 4.5% iodoacetamide instead of DTT. The strips were applied to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (ExcelGel), and electrophoresed under standard conditions. The gel was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the Bio-Rad Transblot semidry blotter system or stained with silver. BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) was transformed with pET-23b plasmid containing C-terminal His6-tagged wild type or active site mutant caspase-3 (C173S). Protein was expressed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and purified with cobalt-coated Sepharose beads (Clontech). The sample was equilibrated on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer A and further purified on a Mono-Q HT5/5 column driven by a fast liquid chromatography system. The Mono-Q column was equilibrated with buffer A and subsequently eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The peak fractions containing caspase-3 were collected and stored at –80 °C. Biotin-tagged calcineurin B was purified with streptavidin-agarose (Invitrogen). Recombinant procaspase-3 (8 nm; Calbiochem) or cytosolic extract from rat cortex of postnatal day 7 was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 20 μl of caspase assay buffer in the absence or presence of recombinant active caspase-9 (20 units/ml) or recombinant granzyme B (2 μg/ml). Aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-3 antibody or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The cytosolic extract contains approximately the same concentration (8 nm) of procaspase-3 as the recombinant extract. The partially purified extract prepared from rat cortex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h in TBST containing 5% dry milk. Recombinant procaspase-3 proteins diluted in TBST were overlaid onto the membrane and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing, the recombinant procaspase-3 was detected by the HisProbe kit (Pierce). The targeted protein spot was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin to recover the peptide. The resultant peptides were analyzed by nanoscale high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column (0.1 × 50 nm; Michrom BioResources, Inc.) coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (Q-Tof2; Micromass, Manchester, UK), and the data were used to search against the NCBI data base with MASCOT software (Matrix Science, London, UK) for protein identification. Cell Death Detection ELISA (Roche Applied Science) is based on a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies against DNA and histone to detect internucleosomal fragmented DNA. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The calmodulin bead assay was performed as described previously (26Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Calmodulin-agarose beads (Sigma) were washed three times in preincubation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2) to activate calmodulin. Recombinant procaspase-3 C173S mutant and calcineurin (Upstate) were then incubated with beads for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Jurkat cell extract in buffer A was incubated with anti-calcineurin B antibody for 3 h. After the incubation, extract was recovered by centrifugation. The depletion of calcineurin B was repeated three times and confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-calcineurin B antibody. The 25-nucleotide modified synthetic RNAs (stealth RNAi; Invitrogen) were synthesized without overhang at the 3′ end. Sequences were as follows: sense, 5′-UUUCCAAAGGAUAACUUGCCUCAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-AAUGAGGCAAGUUAUCCUUUGGAAA-3′. Stealth RNAi-negative control (Invitrogen) was used as a control. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences between groups were determined using a Tukey test after analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Purification and Identification of the Caspase Activation Factor—In previous studies, we have shown that procaspase-3 exists in a high molecular weight complex in neonatal rat brain (24Kurosu K. Saeki M. Kamisaki Y. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 44: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). During the studies, we observed that procaspase-3 in neonatal rat brain was susceptible to activation by recombinant caspase-9. As shown in Fig. 1, active caspase-9 processed only a part of the recombinant procaspase-3. However, incubation of cytosolic extract with active caspase-9 resulted in dramatic conversion of procaspase-3 into an active form. The mixture of recombinant procaspase-3 and extract also showed dramatic cleavage by caspase-9 (data not shown). On the other hand, the experiment using granzyme B showed no significant difference between cleaving efficiency of recombinant and endogenous procaspase-3 in the cytosolic extract. This suggests that caspase activation factors may exist in neonatal rat brain. To purify the caspase activation factor in the high molecular weight complex, we performed a cell-free assay for caspase activation using cytosolic extract of PC12 cells. As a first step in the purification, crude cytosolic extract prepared from rat cortex of postnatal day 7 was applied onto a Mono Q column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. As shown in Fig. 2, fractions number 6 and 7 showed high caspase-3-activating activity. Although these fractions contained an additional amount of procaspase-3, compared with the extract of PC12 cells alone, the resulting caspase-3 activity was significantly higher than that of the extract of PC12 cells in which a corresponding amount of recombinant procaspase-3 was added. These fractions were suggested to include the factor that activates caspase-3 activity. Pooled fractions number 6 and 7 were subjected to further purification by gel filtration chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3, fraction 15 showed high caspase-3-activating activity.FIGURE 3Purification of caspase activation factor by gel filtration chromatography. The pooled fraction was separated by gel filtration chromatography. The aliquots of fractions were used for assay of caspase-3-activating activity (A) as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The fractions were also separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-caspase-3 antibody (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to clarify the components of the high molecular weight complex, we chemically modified the fraction 15 with DSS. As shown in Fig. 4, DSS produced procaspase-3-reactive bands with molecular masses of 32, 64, 85, and 170 kDa. Although the band of 64 kDa is considered as a dimer of procaspase-3, the band of 85 kDa is not a multiplied complex of procaspase-3, suggesting that it may contain another protein of ∼20 kDa. By immunoblotting with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody, we confirmed that active caspase-3 is not a component of the complex. Therefore, the complex consisted of a dimer of procaspase-3 and an unidentified 20-kDa protein. We decided to identify this 20-kDa protein. To identify the procaspase-3-interacting protein, we used a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis far Western immunoblot approach. Initially, we attempted to generate recombinant wild type procaspase-3 as a probe. As reported previously, wild type procaspase-3 underwent proteolysis during purification, and the purified preparations contained mainly cleaved forms of caspase-3 (data not shown). Consequently, we generated a recombinant active site mutant of procaspase-3 (C173S) to prevent its cleavage. The recombinant procaspase-3 (C173S) was purified using nickel affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography. In SDS-PAGE, the purified procaspase-3 migrated as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig. 5). The purified procaspase-3 was cleaved into p17 and p12 fragments by granzyme B treatment. The partially purified fraction of the gel filtration was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and probed with the recombinant procaspase-3. Among the protein spots revealed by silver stain (Fig. 6A), only one spot was labeled with the recombinant caspase-3 (Fig. 6A). The spot was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The eluted peptides were sequenced using mass spectrometry, and the obtained sequence, VIDIFDTDGNGEVDFK, matched the sequence of rat calcineurin B (Fig. 6B). To confirm the direct binding of calcineurin to procaspase-3, a pull-down assay was performed using purified recombinant proteins. Recombinant procaspase-3 was pulled down in the presence of calcineurin with calmodulin-agarose beads (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Binding of procaspase-3 and calcineurin. Recombinant procaspase-3 was subjected to a calmodulin-agarose bead pull-down assay with recombinant calcineurin. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

HEK293 cells were transfected with a control vector or a calcineurin B-containing vector. The control vector did not modify calcineurin B expression as compared with the parental HEK293 cells. The expression of calcineurin B was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 8A). To examine apoptosis in the stable cell line, HEK293 cells were treated with TNF-α and CHX for 24 h. Apoptosis was assessed using cell death detection ELISA. As shown in Fig. 8B, calcineurin B enhanced apoptosis induced by TNF-α and CHX. In addition, calcineurin B enhanced the activation of caspase-3 induced by TNF-α and CHX (Fig. 9A). Extracts from cells stably transfected with a control vector or a calcineurin B-containing vector were incubated with or without cytochrome c. Overexpression of calcineurin B increased cytochrome c-dependent caspase-3 activation (Fig. 9B). When overexpressed, calcineurin B may make a complex with the preexisting endogenous calcineurin A, and this complex may account for the effect obtained with overexpression of calcineurin B. We examined the effect of calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus. As shown in Fig. 10, tacrolimus had no effect on calcineurin B-induced potentiation of apoptosis. This result suggests that the effect of calcineurin B on apoptosis is independent of its phosphatase activity.FIGURE 9Calcineurin B (CnB) potentiates caspase-3 activity induced by TNF-α and CHX.

Immunodepletion resulted in a relative decrease in calcineurin B content (Fig. 11A) and a corresponding reduction in cytochrome c-induced caspase-3 activation (Fig. 11B). To assess the role of calcineurin B in cytochrome c-induced caspase-3 activation, we added purified calcineurin B to the calcineurin B-depleted extracts (Fig. 11C). The addition of calcineurin B potentiated cytochrome c-induced caspase-3 activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 11D). Calcineurin B Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Inhibits Apoptosis Induced by TNF-α/CHX—We also tested the effect of siRNA knockdown of calcineurin B on apoptosis in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. Both in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells, the calcineurin B level in siRNA-treated cells was reduced to 20% of normal level (Fig. 12A). In HEK293 cells, treatment with siRNA against calcineurin B resulted in a significant reduction of apoptosis induced by TNF-α and CHX (Fig. 12B). A protective effect of siRNA was also observed when we used staurosporine instead of TNF-α and CHX (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that the MCF-7 cell is devoid of caspase-3 due to the functional deletion of the caspase-3 gene (27Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that although caspase-3 is required for some of the typical morphological changes of cells undergoing apoptosis, DNA fragmentation occurs in the absence of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells. In MCF-7 cells, the calcineurin B siRNA had no significant effect on apoptosis induced by TNF-α and CHX (Fig. 12C). In addition, the calcineurin B siRNA had no significant effect on cytochrome c-dependent caspase-9 activation in MCF-7 extract (Fig. 12D). These observations, together with the results from immunodepletion experiments, indicate that endogenous calcineurin B may function as a regulator of caspase-3 activation. In this study, we report the purification of a novel procaspase-3-binding protein in rat brain. As shown in Fig. 1, the cytosolic extract from rat embryonic brain promoted the activation of procaspase-3 by caspase-9. Together with the previous findings that procaspase-3 exists in a high molecular weight complex in neonatal rat brain (24Kurosu K. Saeki M. Kamisaki Y. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 44: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), these data indicate the existence of a procaspase-3 activation mechanism in neonatal brain. First, we tried to purify and identify the activation factor, using anti-caspase-3 as an indicator, with various chromatographic procedures (Figs. 2 and 3). In order to detect the 20-kDa factor in the further purification, we developed and adopted the inactive recombinant procaspase-3 because of avoidance of autodigestion (Fig. 5). Based on the observation that procaspase-3 interacts with an unidentified 20-kDa protein (Fig. 4), we have performed a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis far Western immunoblot (Fig. 6). Tandem mass spectrometry identified this protein as calcineurin B. We confirmed that calcineurin B possesses an ability to interact with procaspase-3 (Fig. 7). Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that consists of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit (28Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Calcineurin plays an important role in the coupling of Ca2+ signals to cellular responses (29Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). A major consequence of Ca2+ mobilization is activation of the transcription factor NFAT (30Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). NFAT is a family of highly phosphorylated proteins residing in the cytoplasm of resting cells. When cells are activated, NFAT is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, translocates to the nucleus, and becomes transcriptionally active (31Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P.B. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhan X.L. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Among the diverse functions of calcineurin, its role in the immune system is well understood. Calcineurin is the molecular target of immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporin A and tacrolimus (32Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 33Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that calcineurin is a critical effector of cell death. In BHK-21 cells, overexpression of active calcineurin induces apoptosis (38Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although the downstream target of calcineurin is unclear, a recent study provided evidence that calcineurin is responsible for BAD dephosphorylation and subsequent cell death of primary hippocampal neurons exposed to glutamate (39Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 40Springer J.E. Azbill R.D. Nottingham S.A. Kennedy S.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7246-7251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, so far, phosphatase activity of calcineurin has been responsible for the regulatory role in cell death. Cancer cells survive despite initiation of upstream apoptotic responses. Therefore, the elucidation of the mechanism of procaspase-3 activation and its regulation downstream of cytochrome c has clinical importance. It has been reported that heat shock proteins accelerate activation of procaspase-3 (22Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 23Xanthoudakis S. Roy S. Rasper D. Hennessey T. Aubin Y. Cassady R. Tawa P. Ruel R. Rosen A. Nicholson D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2049-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, it is interesting to note that an autoinhibitory domain exists in procaspase-3 (41Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Since procaspase-3 has been reported to be particularly resistant to processing compared with other caspases (41Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the formation of the complex may explain the susceptibility to the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis in the developing brain. To clarify the participation of calcineurin B in apoptosis, we investigated in vitro and in vivo effects of overexpression and depletion of calcineurin B in HEK293 cells and Jurkat cells. The calcineurin B transfection significantly potentiated the susceptibility to apoptosis induced by TNF-α and CHX (Fig. 8) through the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 9). In addition, cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3 in the calcineurin B-depleted cell extract was reduced (Fig. 11), and knockdown of calcineurin B inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Fig. 12). A regulatory role of calcineurin B for phosphatase activity of calcineurin A has been well established (42Yang S.A. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16147-16154Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Feng B. Stemmer P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12481-12489Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tacrolimus binds to immunophilin and inhibits phosphatase activity of calcineurin (32Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L.

Tacrolimus failed to affect TNF-α-induced apoptosis in calcineurin B-transfected cells (Fig. 10), suggesting that phosphatase activity may not be involved in the apoptosispromoting ability of calcineurin B. These results suggest that calcineurin B may possess a novel function to participate in the regulation of apoptosis, in addition to its well known ability to regulate calcineurin A. Furthermore, calcineurin B itself has no effect on apoptosis but promotes apoptotic signal transduction system through the presentation of scaffold for the activation of caspase-3 by caspase-9. Therefore, calcineurin B may be useful for therapies to induce and promote apoptosis. We thank Dr. G. Salvesen and Dr. Takahashi (Brain Science Institute) for C-terminal His6-tagged wild type caspase-3, Dr. C. Clark for active site mutant caspase-3, and Dr. Shibasaki for calcineurin B."

Here, we have characterized a new member of the Kelch-related protein family termed MRP2 (for Mayven-related protein 2) that is specifically expressed in brain. MRP2/KLHL1 is expressed in oligodendrocyte precursors and mature OLGs, and its expression is up-regulated during OLG differentiation.

Overexpression of MRP2/KLHL1 resulted in a significant increase in the process extension of rat OLGs, whereas MRP2/KLHL1 antisense reduced the process length of primary rat OLGs. Furthermore, murine OLGs isolated from MRP2/KLHL1 transgenic mice showed a significant increase in the process extension of OLGs compared with control wild-type murine OLGs.

Development of these cells is necessary for normal functioning of the brain, and injury to them is involved in the pathogenesis of important neurological disorders including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and periventricular leukomalacia (1Ludwin S.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Leviton A. Gilles F.H. J. Neurol. Sci. 1973; 18: 53-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). OLGs represent the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system. They produce numerous membranous processes, which spirally enwrap neuronal axons, forming multilamellar myelin sheaths (3Richter-Landsberg C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Barry C. Pearson C. Barbarese E. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 18: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). OLGs are metabolically the most active cells in the brain (5Wilson R. Brophy P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Before OLGs can remyelinate, they must first be able to extend their processes, and contact the demyelinated axons. However, the molecules involved in the mechanisms of OLG process extension are poorly defined. A new and unique family of actin-binding proteins with sequences and domains homologous with the Drosophila “Kelch” protein has emerged (6Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Kelch protein is believed to be important for the maintenance of the ordered cytoskeleton (7Robinson D.N. Cant K. Cooley L. Development. 1994; 120: 2015-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Collins T. Stone J.R. Williams A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The Kelch protein has two structural domains that are also found in other molecules. The first domain, which consists of about 115 amino acids, has been named the BTB (Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, Broad-complex) domain (9Godt D. Couderc J.L. Cramton S.E. Laski F.A. Development. 1993; 119: 799-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or POZ (Poxvirus zinc finger) domain (10Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The second domain, composed of about 50 amino acids repeated in tandem, has been called the “Kelch repeats.” The BTB/POZ domain has been proposed to function as a protein-protein interaction interface, which organizes higher order structures involved in chromatin folding or cytoskeleton organization (11Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). The Kelch-related proteins are a superfamily of proteins conserved in a wide range of organisms, from viruses to mammals. At least 60 Kelch-related proteins have been identified, but their physiological and biochemical functions remain largely uncharacterized (12Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 13Avraham S. Avraham H. Jiang S. Bu X. Liang X.Q. Seng S. Kim T. Recent Res. Develop. Biol. Chem. 2003; 1: 231-254Google Scholar). The Drosophila Kelch proteins colocalize with actin filaments in a structure called the ring canal, which bridges 15 nurse cells and the oocyte. Drosophila Kelch protein plays an important role in maintaining actin organization during the development of ring canals (6Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 8Collins T. Stone J.R. Williams A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The Kelch-related proteins have diverse functions in cell morphology, cell organization, and gene expression, and function in multiprotein complexes through contact sites in their β-propeller domains (14Bork P. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recently, a new member of the BTB/Kelch repeat family, gigaxonin, was reported to be a pathological target for neurodegenerative disorders in which alterations were found to contain multiple mutations in the Kelch repeats in the neurofilament network (15Bomont P. Cavalier L. Blondeau F. Ben Hamida C. Belal S. Tazir M. Demir E. Topaloglu H. Korinthenberg R. Tuysuz B. Landrieu P. Hentati F. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We have previously identified and characterized two actinbinding proteins, termed NRP/B/ENC-1 (16Kim T.A. Lim J. Ota S. Raja S.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2361-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), predominantly expressed in brain. Mayven is an actin-binding protein that is co-localized with actin filaments in stress fibers and in the patchy cortical actin-rich regions of the cell margins and processes, including the process tips in primary neurons and U373-MG astrocytoma/glioblastoma cells (19Soltysik-Espanola M.

During our study of proteins that are related to Mayven, we identified and cloned a novel gene, which we termed: MRP2 (Mayven-related protein 2) that was found to be identical to KLHL1 (20Nemes J.P. Benzow K.A. Moseley M.L. Ranum L.P. Koob M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Benzow K.A. Koob M.D. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 134-141PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the expression of MRP2/KLHL1 in OLGs and its possible role in the dynamics of cytoskeletal rearrangement, leading to the elongation of OLG processes. Both the BLAST and Align Master programs use the crystal of the PLZF BTB/POZ domain as a three-dimensional template. The structure of the human PLZF BTB/POZ domain was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank codes 1BUO and 1CS3, chain A). Superimposition, model building, construction of insertion regions, structure validation, and calculation of structural properties were carried out using the sub-programs ProMod version 3.5, SPDBV version 3.5, Loop v2.60, Parameters version 3.5, and Topologies version 3.5, which are available in the Automated SwissModel Package Program. We analyzed the amino acids of the conserved region in the Kelch domain by the use of the BLAST2 and Cn3D programs (National Institutes of Health). The three-dimensional model of the Kelch domain was obtained as described above. Rabbit anti-peptide antibodies were raised for MRP2/KLHL1 (RRCSDLSML, residues 391-399 amino acids). These polyclonal antibodies have been characterized in our laboratory and tested for their specificity, and were found to be specific to MRP2/KLHL1. No cross-hybridization between these antibodies and other members of this family was observed using these antisera. Eukaryotic expression plasmids for full-length MRP2/KLHL1 were introduced into pFLAG-CMV4. The resulting expression constructs were designated as pCMV4-MRP2/KLHL1. pCMV4-MRP2/KLHL1 was also used as a template to generate the MRP2/KLHL1 antisense constructs. N-terminal MRP2 (574 bp) was amplified using a set of primers as follows: 5′-GCGGCCGCATGTCAGGCTCTGGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGACAGCTTGATAGAATCTTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with NotI and XbaI, and the digested fragments were subcloned in a reverse manner into the pCMS-EGFP vector (BD Biosciences). The antisense constructs were designated as GFP-asMRP2, and GFP served as a reporter. pEGFP-KLHL1 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael D. Koob (University of Minnesota). Primary cultures of oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes were generated from the forebrains of 2-3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (22Vartanian T. Goodearl A. Viehover A. Fischbach G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Vartanian T. Fischbach G. Miller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain tissue was dissociated with trypsin for 20 min at 37 °C. After mechanical dissociation, the cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Mixed glial cultures containing oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes were maintained for different periods of time. After 1 week in culture, mixed glial cultures were shaken for 30 min at 180 rpm. The supernatants containing >90% microglia were then plated. Fifteen minutes after plating, nonadherent cells (predominantly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) were removed by three washes with PBS, leaving the culture with >98% microglia as shown by immunostaining. Microglia were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. Oligodendrocyte progenitors were isolated from the remaining adherent cells by a second shaking of 12 h at 180 rpm. After this second shaking, the supernatant was preplated on tissue culture flasks for 1 h and passed successively through 20- and 10-μm mesh filters, removing most of the contaminating astrocytes and microglia. Enriched oligodendroglia were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with bovine serum albumin, N2 supplements, platelet-derived growth factor-AA (10 ng/ml), and basic fibro-blast growth factor (10 ng/ml). One-half of the media was exchanged with fresh media every 2 days. These enriched oligodendrocyte cultures were assayed for contamination by microglia and astrocytes for each preparation. Typically, cultures contained ∼0.5-2% microglial cells as assessed by the uptake of diacetyl low density lipoprotein. Cultures were switched to medium containing N2 supplements to allow the development of cells to the O4+/O1-stage (24Barres B.A. Hart I.K. Coles H.S. Burne J.F. Voyvodic J.T. Richardson W.D. Raff M.C.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4627-4636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) immunofluorescence, oligodendrocyte cultures were incubated for 15 min with the O4, O1 (29Shi J. Marinovich A. Barres B.A. J.

The cultures were next washed with PBS, fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 7 min at an ambient temperature, washed with PBS again, incubated with the relevant secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and then visualized by fluorescent microscopy. For MRP2/KLHL1 immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on coverslips 2 days before each experiment at a concentration of 3-5 × 104 cells/35-mm dish. Cells were fixed directly to the coverslips by the addition of 3% formaldehyde, and then placed at -20 °C for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were rinsed extensively with PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum, and 0.2% gelatin at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Following the labeling of the cells, the coverslips were mounted and viewed under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. Confocal analyses were performed with an inverted confocal microscope. For the immunostaining of paraffin-embedded mouse brain sections, the brain sections were treated with xylene, and subsequently with 100, 95, 75, and 50% ethanol. The sections were rinsed in PBS and unmasked using Target Retrieval solution (DakoCytomation) at 99 °C for 30 min. The sections were then blocked with 10% normal goat serum and incubated with primary antibodies (MRP2/KLHL1 and O1) overnight at 4 °C. Following 3 washes in PBS, secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red were applied to the slides for 30 min at room temperature. After 3 more washes in PBS, the slides were mounted with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution and viewed under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. 3-4 × 106 primary oligodendrocytes were transfected directly by electroporation (Bio-Rad). Fifteen micrograms of GFP-MRP2/KLHL1 construct was used in each electroporation experiment. Transfected cells were analyzed using an inverted fluorescent microscope with an attached digital camera. The number of processes per cell and process length longer than half the diameter of the cell soma were measured. In each experiment, 100 GFP-positive primary OLGs were analyzed. Three individual experiments per treatment were performed. The data were pooled, and a nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test was applied for analysis of the results. Following a washing with cold PBS, 293T or primary rat OLG cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing a protein inhibitor mixture, and cell extracts were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C. After pre-clearing, 500 μg of protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-MRP2 or anti-actin antibody. The precipitates were then blotted and probed with anti-actin or anti-MRP2 antibody, accordingly. For stripping, the membranes were rinsed twice in PBS and then submerged in membrane stripping buffer (BP-96, Boston BioProduct) at 60 °C for 20 min. The membranes were rinsed in PBS/Tween 20 three times for 5 min each and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Supernatant lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For the analysis of MRP2/KLHL1 transgene expression, brain tissues isolated from mice were homogenized in lysis buffer, rotated at 4 °C for 3 h, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were loaded onto 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels, and the blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS followed by probing with primary anti-GFP antibodies and horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were washed and developed using chemiluminescent reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film. DNA Microinjection—Plasmid pEGFP/KLHL1 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael D. Koob) was digested with AseI and MluI restriction enzymes. The fragment (3.8 kb) consisting of the CMV promoter, EGFP/KLHL1, and poly(A) was excised and purified from a 1% agarose gel by using the NucleoSpin Extraction Kit (catalog number 635960, BD Biosciences). Expression of the MRP2/KLHL1 transgene was confirmed by transfecting the 293T cells, and the transgene product was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody. The transgene was microinjected into fertilized eggs at the one-cell stage, cultured overnight in embryonic culture medium, and transferred to 0.5-day pseudo-pregnant recipient mice. Offspring were screened for transgene integration and expression. DNA Purification from Mouse Tails—Tails from offspring were cut and digested in tail digestion buffer (30Seng S. Yokoyama M. Suzuki R. Maki Y. Kato M. Lim C. Zayatiin B. Inoue N. Xuan X. Igarashi I. Nagasawa H. Fujisaki K. Mikami T. Suzuki N. Toyoda Y. Parasitol. Res. 2000; 86: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) containing proteinase K (Roche) at 60 °C. Following overnight digestion, tail samples were added together with 250 μl of NaCl-saturated buffer (6 m NaCl) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and DNA was precipitated with 650 μl of isopropyl alcohol. DNA pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, air dried, and resuspended with 200 μl of TE, at which point the DNA solution was ready for the PCR and Southern blot analyses. RNA Purification from Mouse Tissues—RNA isolation was performed using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was measured and stored at -80 °C, and the TRIzol-isolated total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR analyses. Southern Analysis—Southern blotting was performed to screen founders of the MRP2/KLHL1 transgenic mice. Briefly, 20 μg of DNA from the mouse tail was digested with different restriction enzymes, run on a 1% agarose gel, and then sub-merged in two changes of denaturation solution (45 min/each change) and neutralization solution (45 min/each change). DNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences) in 20× SSC. Membranes were cross-linked and pre-hybridized in pre-hybridization solution (5× SSPE, 2% SDS, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 100 μg/ml of DNA from denatured salmon testes) at 65 °C for 6 h. pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) was digested with NheI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and purified GFP was labeled with α-32P using the NE blot kit (catalog N1500L, New England BioLabs). Membranes were incubated with hybridization solution containing the GFP-labeled probe overnight at 65 °C. The membranes were washed once in washing solution I (0.5× SSPE, 1% SDS) for 20 min, and twice in washing solution II (0.1 × SSPE, 1% SDS) for 20 min each. Membranes were then exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C. Polymerase Chain Reaction—DNA from transgenic founders was used to optimize the PCR conditions. PCR was performed using the BD Advantage 2 PCR kit (catalog number 639207, Clontech). The amplification was performed in an automated thermocycler (iCycle, Bio-Rad) using a set of specific primers as follows: 5′-TCAGGCTCTGGGCGAAAA-3′ and 5′-GCACACTTCCACCACCTG-3′ with the following temperature conditions: 95 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min. The cycling was followed by a final extension at 68 °C for 3 min. The amplified products (at the expected 903 bp in length) were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. The well established PCR conditions were used to genotype the MRP2 transgenic mice. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—TRIzol-isolated RNA was treated with DNase and purified by using a phenol-chloroform procedure. Purified RNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction. One-step RT-PCR was performed based on the manufacturer's instructions using a set of specific MRP2/KLHL1 primers: 5′-TCAGGCTCTGGGCGAAAA-3′ and 5′-GCACACTTCCACCACC TG-3′. For the internal RNA control, a set of mouse β-actin primers (5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAG GCACCAA-3′ and 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGACACGATTTC-3′) was used. The temperature conditions were 50 °C for 1 h, 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 60 s and an extension of 68 °C for 2 min. The RT-PCR product of 903 bp was visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Identification and Cloning of MRP2/KLHL1—During our search for proteins that are related to Mayven (19Soltysik-Espanola M. Rogers R.A. Jiang S. Kim T.A. Gaedigk R. White R.A. Avraham H. Avraham S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2361-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and NRP/B (16Kim T.A. Lim J. Ota S. Raja S. Rogers R. Rivnay B. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we have identified and cloned from the human brain cDNA library an additional novel Mayven-related protein (MRP), termed MRP2. MRP2 contains a BTB domain and six Kelch repeats (Fig. 1A). Sequence analysis of this Kelch protein confirmed that MRP2 is identical to the brain-specific KLHL1 transcript (20Nemes J.P. Benzow K.A. Moseley M.L. Ranum L.P. Koob M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1543-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and therefore was termed MRP2/KLHL1. Alignment between Mayven and MRP2/KLHL1 indicates significant homology in the BTB/POZ domain and Kelch repeats (shown in Fig. 1B). The C-terminal domain of Mayven and MRP2/KLHL1, which consists of six tandem Kelch repeats, is predicted to be a β-sheet organized into propeller structures. The overall structures of the BTB/POZ domain and Kelch repeats of MRP2/KLHL1 are shown in Fig. 1C. Expression of MRP2/KLHL1 at Different Stages of OLG Differentiation—Development of OLGs capable of forming myelin internodes requires several distinct environmental cues, which include early, regional, and late axonally derived signals. The initial specification of OLG precursor cells (OPCs) is dependent on signals from the ventral structures, such as the notochord and floor plate (31Warf B.C. Fok-Seang J. Miller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2477-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Timsit S. Martinez S. Allinquant B. Peyron F. Puelles L. Zalc B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1012-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar) identified by the O1 monoclonal antibody. Here, we examined the expression of MRP2/KLHL1 in OPCs at different stages of oligodendrocyte development. As shown in Fig. 2A, strong expression of MRP2/KLHL1 was seen in the OPCs. As a positive control, OPCs were stained with A2B5 antibody. Furthermore, we examined the staining of MRP2/KLHL1 in pro-oligodendroblasts. These cells showed positive staining for MRP2/KLHL1 with O4 (Fig. 2A). Mature OLGs immunostained with O1 antibody also abundantly expressed MRP2/KLHL1. Taken together, these results indicate that oligoden-drocytes at various stages of development highly express MRP2/KLHL1. Next, we demonstrated the co-localization of MRP2/KLHL1 with A2B5, O4, or O1 in O2A cells. The cells were stained with antibodies and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, as indicated in Fig. 2B. MRP2/KLHL1 was co-localized with specific developmental markers (A2B5, O4, and O1) of the OLGs. In addition, we examined the specific expression of MRP2/KLHL1 in mouse brain sections. The brain sections were analyzed using anti-MRP2 and anti-O1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, MRP2/KLHL1 was co-localized with O1 in the mouse brain section. These data indicate that MRP2/KLHL1 is developmentally expressed in OLGs. Up-regulation of MRP2/KLHL1 Expression in Differentiated Primary OLGs and Its Effects on the Process Extension of OLGs—OLGs obtained from the primary culture of neonatal rat cerebrum were grown in differentiating medium for 4 days by withdrawal of platelet-derived growth factor. Cells were then fixed and stained with affinity purified polyclonal anti-MRP2/KLHL1 antibody. MRP2/KLHL1 was expressed in the cell body of undifferentiated precursor cells, and no staining was observed with control antibody (Fig. 3A). To assess whether MRP2/KLHL1 plays a role in process formation during OLG differentiation, we immunolabeled primary OLG progenitor cells and mature OLGs with specific anti-MRP2/KLHL1 antibody. MRP2/KLHL1 showed intensive fibrous-like expression along the processes in differentiated OLGs as compared with the undifferentiated OLGs (Fig. 3A). These"
https://openalex.org/W2086280061,"TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 are two novel nucleolar proteins isolated in Trypanosoma brucei. They share 92.6% identity, except for an additional C-terminal domain of TbNOP86 of 182 amino acids in length. Both proteins are found in Trypanosomatidae, but similarity to other eukaryotic proteins could not be found. TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 are expressed at similar level in procyclic and bloodstream forms, although the relative level of expression of TbNOP66 is 11 times lower. TbNOP86 undergoes post-translational modifications, as it is found predominantly at 110 kDa compared with the predicted 86 kDa. Immunofluorescence of overexpressed ty-tagged TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 showed that both proteins accumulated in the nucleolus of G1 cells. This was confirmed by the co-localization of an endogenous TbNOP86-myc with the nucleolar protein Nopp140. TbNOP86-ty localization is cell cycle-regulated, because it colocalizes with the mitotic spindle in mitotic cells. TbNOP86 is required for mitotic progression in both life stages as depleted cells are enriched in the G2/M phase. In procyclic cells, a reduced growth rate is accompanied by an accumulation of zoids (0N1K), 2N1K, and multinucleated cells (xNyK). The 2N1K cells are blocked in late mitosis as nucleolar segregation is completed. TbNOP86 depletion in bloodstream form caused a drastic growth inhibition producing cells bearing two kinetoplasts and an enlarged nucleus (1N*2K), followed by an accumulation of 2N2K cells with connected nuclei and xNyK cells. These studies of TbNOP86 provide a more comprehensive account of proteins involved in mitotic events in trypanosomes and should lead to the identification of partners with similar function.

Trypanosoma brucei is an ancient protozoan parasite and an agent of important diseases in human (African sleeping sickness) and cattle (nagana). The cell division cycle in T. brucei displays unique characteristics compared with other eukaryotes (1McKean P.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and cellular morphology is determinant in the cell cycle progression (2Robinson D.R. Sherwin T. Ploubidou A. Byard E.H. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Indeed, cell division requires replication and segregation of the nucleus, kinetoplast (representing the mitochondrial DNA), flagellum, and basal body. The sequential G1,S,G2, and M phases that constitute the eukaryotic nuclear cell cycle is present in trypanosomes (3Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, G1 cells have one nucleus and one kinetoplast (1N1K). The kinetoplast and nuclear DNA have a discrete S phase such that segregation of the replicated kinetoplast is completed before onset of mitosis. This results in 1N2K cells in late G2, followed by mitosis (M phase) resulting in 2N2K cells and then cytokinesis producing two 1N1K cells. Mitosis must ensure faithful transmission of the nuclear genetic material to daughter cells. A more detailed model of the G2/M transition is starting to emerge in trypanosomes, a model that contrasts with the general eukaryotic model wherein numerous cellular checkpoints tightly coordinate mitotic progression and cytokinesis. Compared with other eukaryotes, cell cycle regulation in T. brucei appears simpler, as only a limited number of conserved mitotic proteins involved in the G2/M phase have been identified: cyclin homologs (CYC6 (4Hammarton T.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 31783-31791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Different cell cycle mechanisms operate as the parasite alternates between the procyclic (insect stage) and bloodstream form (mammalian stage). In procyclic cells, there is a dissociation of mitosis and cytokinesis such that entry into cytokinesis does not rely on mitosis or nuclear synthesis but mainly on basal body segregation (9Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) results in the generation of anucleated cells (zoids) (0N1K) and cells with an enlarged nucleus (1N*1K, 1N* being a replicated DNA delayed in mitosis). This suggests novel cell cycle checkpoints and contrasts with bloodstream cells, which cannot enter cytokinesis under the same conditions (6Tu X. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the study of mitotic proteins in T. brucei has highlighted distinctive stage-specific phenotypes following mitotic disorders. Depletion of the mitotic cyclin CYC6 caused enrichment of 0N1K in procyclic forms and cells with one nucleus and multiple kinetoplasts (1NxK) in bloodstream forms (4Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). CRK3-depleted procyclic cells were enriched in 1N*1K and 0N1K as compared with the bloodstream-depleted cells enriched in 1N2K and multinucleated cells (xNyK) (6Tu X. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitotic proteins were shown to have differential activities in the two life stages of the parasite, because APC1 and CDC27 depletion arrested procyclic cells in metaphase and bloodstream cells in anaphase (8Kumar P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31783-31791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Functional genomic studies in T. brucei have also shown that non-mitotic proteins could play a role in mitotic progression. For example, knockdown of TbAGO1, which itself is required for RNAi, produced abnormal mitotic phenotypes (10Durand-Dubief M. Bastin P. BMC Biol. 2003; 1: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previous studies have provided some information about the dynamic morphology of the T. brucei nucleus during mitosis (11Ogbadoyi E. Ersfeld K. Robinson D. Sherwin T. Gull K. Chromosoma. 2000; 108: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The specific stages of mitosis are not well characterized, although a general progression similar to eukaryotic mitosis is observed. In contrast with higher eukaryotes, there is no chromatin condensation, and the mitotic spindle forms within the nucleus without disruption of the nuclear envelope. Chromosomes are segregated by interaction with the mitotic spindle (12Ersfeld K. Gull K. Science. 1997; 276: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but precise details of the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, because no typical centromeric proteins or kinetochore proteins have yet been identified. The nucleolus is a key sub-nuclear organelle that coordinates the synthesis and assembly of ribosomal subunits (reviewed in Ref. 13Nazar R.N. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is also an important pool of dormant proteins, some of which are key regulators of the cell cycle. In contrast to higher eukaryotes, mitotic segregation of the nucleolus in lower eukaryotes proceeds without disassembling nucleolar structure. Accordingly, the nucleolus of trypanosomes, with the exception of Trypanosoma cruzi (14Elias M.C. Marques-Porto R. Freymuller E. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), remains intact throughout the mitotic cycle. The nucleolus is segregated along the mitotic spindle, acquiring a bar-shaped form early in mitosis before splitting into two equal clusters at a stage that resembles anaphase in a standard mitotic model (11Ogbadoyi E. Ersfeld K. Robinson D. Sherwin T. Gull K. Chromosoma. 2000; 108: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Few nucleolar proteins are described in T. brucei; most of them are involved in ribosomes biogenesis (NOG1 (15Jensen B.C. Wang Q. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32204-32211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), NOPP44/46 (16Jensen B.C. Brekken D.L. Randall A.C. Kifer C.T. Parsons M. Eukaryot.

Protein kinase CK2, involved in cell cycle progression, was also shown to accumulate in the nucleolus where it interacts with NOG1 (19Jensen B.C. Kifer C.T. Brekken D.L. Randall A.C. Wang Q.

Ong S.E. Lyon C.E. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Nature. 2005; 433: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). The T. brucei genome data base (GeneDB) predicts 15 nucleolar proteins and ∼200 ribosomal proteins, leaving considerable work to be done to identify these uncharacterized nucleolar proteins. In this study, we have identified and characterized TbNOP86, an essential protein involved in mitotic progression in T. brucei. TbNOP86-ty localization is cell cycle-regulated, because the G1 nucleolar protein co-localizes with the mitotic spindle at mitosis. TbNOP86-deficient cells are blocked at the G2/M phase and display distinct phenotypes associated with the developmental stage of the parasite. Cell Culture—The work described in this study uses T. brucei 427 strains co-expressing T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor (22Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The T. brucei 427 host cell line 29-13 procyclic forms were cultured at 27 °C in SDM79 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 5 μg.ml-1 hemin. G418 (10 μg.ml-1) and hygromycin B (25 μg.ml-1) were added to the culture medium to maintain the selection of T7RNAP- and TeTR-expressing cells. T. brucei 427 host cell line 90-13 bloodstream forms were cultured at 37 °C in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 36 mm sodium bicarbonate, 136 μg.ml-1 hypoxanthine, 39 μg.ml-1 thymidine, 110 μg.ml-1 sodium pyruvate, 28 μg.ml-1 bathocuprone, 0.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-cysteine, and 62.5 μg.ml-1 kanamycin (23Baltz T. Baltz D. Giroud C. Crockett J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The bloodstream form cell line uses G418 (2 μg.ml-1) as a single marker for co-expression of T7RNAP and TetR. Preparation of the Insoluble Protein Fraction and Characterization of NOP86—Bloodstream form total cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Seyfang A. Duszenko M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with an additional Triton X-100 treatment (25Bakalara N. Santarelli X. Davis C. Baltz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8863-8871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The insoluble protein fraction was loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The 110-kDa Coomassie Blue-stained band was digested in the gel with trypsin, and the peptide mixture was analyzed by on-line capillary high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a nanospray ion trap mass spectrometer (26Blanc J.F. Lalanne C. Plomion C. Schmitter J.M. Bathany K. Gion J.M. Bioulac-Sage P. Balabaud C. Bonneu M. Rosenbaum J. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3778-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transfection—Transfection of procyclic cells was performed essentially as described previously (27Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with pLew100 or p2T7ti vectors were selected with 5 μg.ml-1 phleomycin and cloned by limiting dilutions in microtiter plates. To induce the expression of epitope-tagged protein or RNAi, stable transfectants were cultured with 1 μg.ml-1 tetracycline. Transfectants expressing endogenous TbNOP86-myc were selected with 1 μg.ml-1 puromycin. Transfection of bloodstream cells was carried out at 37 °C. Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were harvested, washed twice with Cytomix buffer, pH 7.6 (2 mm EGTA, 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm Hepes, 0.5% glucose, 1 mm hypoxanthine, 100 μg.ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2) and suspended in 0.4 ml of Cytomix with 10 μg of linearized DNA in a 2-mm electroporation cuvette (setting: 1.25 kV, 50 microfarads and 25 ohms). Cells were immediately suspended in 24 ml of Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium, transferred to a 24-well plate, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Transfectants were selected with 2.5 μg.ml-1 phleomycin and cultured with 1 μg.ml-1 tetracycline for RNAi induction. Plasmid Constructs—T. brucei TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 are annotated on GeneDB as Tb09.160.1160 and Tb09.160.1180, respectively. According to an earlier annotation release, we have used an ATG located 9 bp downstream of the actual annotation. Constructs for the expression of TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 ty-tagged proteins were cloned in the pLew100 vector (28Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), digested with HindIII-BamHI. TbNOP86-ty and TbNOP66-ty were amplified by PCR from T. brucei total genomic DNA using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). 5′ primers contained a HindIII restriction site (underlined); 3′ primers contained the gene encoding the ty-1 tag (29Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (boldface) and a BamHI restriction site (underlined). The ty sequence (EVHTNODPLD) was modified at the nucleotides level to eliminate the BamHI site. TbNOP86-ty was amplified using 5′ primer 5′-aatggaaataagcttATGACGGGAATGAACAGATC G (named P5′) and 3′ primer 3′-agatgtagatgtggatccTTAGTCAAGTGG- ATCTTGGTTAGTATGGACCTCAGATGCCTGTTGCACAGATGCATC (named P86ty-3′). TbNOP66-ty was amplified using the following set of primers: (P5′) and 3′-agatgtagatgtggatccCTAGTCAAGTGGATCTTGGTTAGTATGGACCTCTCCATCAACTCCTCCCCTTCCAC (named P66ty-3′). The construction of the expression vector for TbNOP86-myc integration into the TbNOP86 locus required a two-step cloning into the pMOTag23M vector (30Oberholzer M. Morand S. Kunz S. Seebeck T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 145: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar): we cloned the first 300 bp of TbNOP86 3′-untranslated region amplified with 5′-ggaaatggaaatggatccACCTCTCCAACTGTTACTGACTCT (P86-3′-untranslated region-5′) and 5′-agatgtagatgttctagaACTCTTTTACTGCGGTCTTTTAGG (P86-3′-untranslated region-3′) and digested with BamH1-XbaI (restriction sites are underlined). Secondly, we cloned the last 210 bp of TbNOP86 open reading frame digested with KpnI-ApaI for fusion with the myc tag present into the vector. We used 5′-ggaaatggaaatggtaccTCAGATGGTTCCAACTCTGATATCCCGGGACCTGAGGGT (P86-last210-5′) and 5′-agatgtagatgtgggcccAGATGCCTGTTGCACAGATGCATC (P86last210-3′) for amplification. The integration cassette was linearized with KpnI-XbaI. Double-stranded RNA expression was used for simultaneous knockdown of TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 in T. brucei (31Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment corresponding to a common region (nucleotides 1-470) was cloned BamHI-HindIII into the p2T7ti vector, which allows double-stranded RNAs synthesis from a single template flanked by opposing T7 promoters (32Wang Z.

Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The primers used were 5′-tattattatggatccATGACGGGAATGAACAGATCG (BamHI is underlined) and 3′-tattattataagcttACAGTTCCTCTCGAGGATTG T (HindIII is underlined). Expression of Recombinant tbNOP86 and Production of Antisera—A polyclonal rabbit antibody was generated against a common region of TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 (amino acids 370-565) (rNOP). A 598-bp fragment was generated by PCR and cloned into the pET3a expression vector (Novagen). The 5′ primer contained a NdeI site (underlined) and the ATG codon (boldface) followed by six histidine codons (lowercase) 5′-TATTATCATATGcatcaccatcaccatcacGAAGAAGTACTGAAGATGCAG. The 3′ primer contained a BamHI site (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface) 3′-TATTATGGATCCTCATAGAGAATGGTAGAAGGCACA. The resulting His6-Pm110a recombinant protein was expressed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (2-h induction at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) and purified from the His·Bind® column according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Novagen) followed by gel purification. Protein concentration was estimated by Coo-massie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. We used Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma) and a minimum of four immunizations. rNOP specificity was confirmed by comparing pre-immune and immune sera on Western blots against T. brucei 427 total cell extracts (not shown). Western Blotting—Total protein extracts from T. brucei 427 procyclic and bloodstream cells were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and blotted on Immobilon-P filters (Millipore) (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween, 5% milk, for 30 min at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and were incubated overnight, at 4 °C and 1 h at room temperature, respectively. Primary antibodies used were polyclonal rabbit anti-NOP (rNOP, 1:1,000), a monoclonal mouse anti-human β-tubulin (β-tub, 1:1,000, Sigma), an undiluted monoclonal mouse anti-ty (BB2) (29Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal mouse anti-myc (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 and 1:10,000, respectively, Sigma). Peroxidase activity was revealed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma). The relative level of protein was estimated with Image software (National Institutes of Health). Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Trypanosomes were centrifuged from log phase cultures for 5 min, washed in PBS, allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and fixed 1 h with methanol at -20 °C. After a brief wash in PBS at room temperature, fixed cells were incubated at room temperature with primary and secondary antibodies (diluted in PBS) for 1.5 h and 30 min, respectively, and washed three times for 5 min with PBS after each of the incubations. Primary antibodies were undiluted monoclonal mouse anti-ty (BB2), monoclonal mouse anti-myc (1:20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit anti-Nopp140 (1:400) (17Kelly S. Singleton W. Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 876-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin (KMX-1, 1:10) (35Sasse R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 577-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG 1:100 (Molecular Probes), and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:100 (Molecular Probes). Finally, cells were incubated 7 min with 1 μg.ml-1 DAPI and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, UK). Cells were analyzed on a Zeiss UV microscope, and images were captured by a MicroMax-1300Y camera (Princeton Instruments) and MetaView software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Flow Cytometry—Propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed as described previously (6Tu X. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in PBS/70% ethanol (v/v). Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS supplemented with PI (20 μg.ml-1) and RNase DNase-free (10 μg.ml-1) (Roche Applied Science). Cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed with a BD Biosciences FACSCanto flow cytometer using Diva software. TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 Proteins Share a Similar Molecular Organization—Highly purified insoluble proteins from T. brucei bloodstream forms were separated by SDS-PAGE. A 110-kDa protein was identified following in-gel digestions coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) (Fig. 1A, asterisk). The 110-kDa protein is encoded by two homologous genes annotated Tb09.160.1160 and Tb09.160.1180 in the T. brucei GeneDB, renamed TbNOP86 and TbNOP66, respectively, based on their cellular localization (NOP for nucleolar protein, see Fig. 4) and their expected molecular mass. Both genes, located in tandem on chromosome 9, are present as one copy per haploid genome (Fig. 1B). It is interesting to note that the two sequences flanking TbNOP66 (annotated Tb09.160.1190 and Tb09.160.1170 in GeneDB), likely correspond to intergenic regions and are identical. TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 share similar molecular organization having four short divergent domains (named D1-D4) embedded in a common core region of 579 amino acids (Fig. 1C). The common core regions are homologous with an overall identity of 92.6%. TbNOP86 has an additional specific domain of 183 amino acids at the C-terminal region. The start codon used throughout this report corresponded to an earlier GeneDB annotation and is located 3 amino acids downstream of the actual annotated start codon. TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 are highly acidic proteins (predicted isoelectric points of 4.4 and 4.7, respectively), because they are rich in glutamic acids (Glu) (∼12%). The TbNOP86-specific domain is composed of ∼11% aspartic acid (Asp), which is twice the number found in the common core region, explaining the lower predicted pI of TbNOP86. Known motifs were identified with PredictProtein: several putative protein kinase C and casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation sites, two coiled-coil domains, and a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS-1) were noted. We identified a second putative NLS (NLS-2) based on the arginine and lysine content and sequence alignment with a few known NLS sequences in trypanosomes.FIGURE 4Expression and localization of tagged TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 proteins in procyclic T. brucei 427 cells. A, total cell extracts from TbNOP86-ty-expressing cells (+ and -tet induced) were sampled at 48 h, blotted and probed with BB2 and rNOP. TbNOP86-ty is mostly expressed at 110 kDa. IF performed on fixed cells sampled at 48 h of tet induction and co-stained with BB2 (green), Nopp140 (nucleolar marker) (red), and DAPI (blue) showed that TbNOP86-ty partially co-localized with Nopp140 in G1 cells. B, integration of a TbNOP86-myc cassette into the TbNOP86 locus for endogenous expression. Western blots performed on T. brucei 427 non-transformed cells (NT) and TbNOP86-myc-expressing cells showed that TbNOP86-myc was expressed ∼110-116 kDa (Myc). No overexpression of TbNOP86 was detected with rNOP. As observed with TbNOP86-ty, TbNOP86-myc accumulated in the nucleolus. C, TbNOP66-ty is detected ∼67 kDa in TbNOP66-ty-expressing cells sampled at 48 h (+tet) probed with BB2 and rNOP. TbNOP66-ty accumulated in the nucleolus.

Nevertheless, TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 orthologues were found in all available Trypanosomatid genomes (Fig. 2). Discrimination between orthologues was difficult, because some orthologous genes encoded characteristics of both TbNOP86 and TbNOP66. For example, T. brucei gambiense (Tbgamb.21611) encodes tbNOP66 D4 and does not have the TbNOP86-specific domain (both characteristics of TbNOP66) but shares D1, D2, and D3 with TbNOP86. Therefore, the identification of orthologues was determined based on the presence or absence of the TbNOP86-specific domain. TbNOP66 orthologues were only found in African trypanosomes (T. brucei gambiense and T. congolense), whereas TbNOP86 orthologues were present in all trypanosomatids studied (T. brucei gambiense, T. congolense, T. vivax, T. cruzi, and Leishmania), with one copy per haploid genome (two genes are annotated in T. cruzi as the genome project reference strain is a hybrid). Contrasting with domains D1 and D3, which are conserved among the TbNOP86 orthologues and at varying degree among the TbNOP66 orthologues (Tbgamb.21611, congo1378f10.p1k_10 and congo1378f10.p1k_9), D2 and D4 are species-specific. The first half of the specific domain is conserved among trypanosomes and divergent in Leishmania species, but the second half is not conserved. Expression of TbNOP66 and TbNOP86 in Procyclic and Bloodstream Forms—The expression of TbNOP86 and TbNOP66 in T. brucei 427 was tested by immunoblot analysis of total cell extracts from procyclic and bloodstream forms (Fig. 3). Blots were analyzed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against both proteins (rNOP). TbNOP66 and TbNOP86 are predicted to be 66- and 86-kDa proteins, respectively. Accordingly, TbNOP66 corresponds to the weak band present at 66 kDa, and it is expressed at a similar level in both life stages, as indicated by the relative intensity of the band compared with the internal marker β-tubulin. TbNOP86 corresponds to the weak band at the expected 86-kDa position (asterisk) and the major band d"
https://openalex.org/W2046568545,"The inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (IMPCH) component (residues 1-199) of the bifunctional enzyme aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICAR Tfase, residues 200-593)/IMPCH (ATIC) catalyzes the final step in the <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthesis pathway that produces IMP. As a potential target for antineoplastic intervention, we designed IMPCH inhibitors, 1,5-dihydroimidazo[4,5-<i>c</i>][1,2,6]thiadiazin-4(<i>3H</i>)-one 2,2-dioxide (heterocycle, 1), the corresponding nucleoside (2), and the nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) (3), as mimics of the tetrahedral intermediate in the cyclization reaction. All compounds are competitive inhibitors against IMPCH (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i> values=0.13-0.23 μm) with the simple heterocycle 1 exhibiting the most potent inhibition (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i> = 0.13 μm). Crystal structures of bifunctional ATIC in complex with nucleoside 2 and nucleotide 3 revealed IMPCH binding modes similar to that of the IMPCH feedback inhibitor, xanthosine 5′-monophosphate. Surprisingly, the simpler heterocycle 1 had a completely different IMPCH binding mode and was relocated to the phosphate binding pocket that was identified from previous xanthosine 5′-monophosphate structures. The aromatic imidazole ring interacts with a helix dipole, similar to the interaction with the phosphate moiety of 3. The crystal structures not only revealed the mechanism of inhibition of these compounds, but they now serve as a platform for future inhibitor improvements. Importantly, the nucleosidecomplexed structure supports the notion that inhibitors lacking a negatively charged phosphate can still inhibit IMPCH activity with comparable potency to phosphate-containing inhibitors. Provocatively, the nucleotide inhibitor 3 also binds to the AICAR Tfase domain of ATIC, which now provides a lead compound for the design of inhibitors that simultaneously target both active sites of this bifunctional enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2080985592,"Mannan-binding protein (MBP) is a C-type serum lectin that is an important constituent of the innate immune defense because it activates the complement system via the lectin pathway. While the pig has been proposed to be an attractive source of xenotransplantable tissues and organs, little is known about porcine MBP. In our previous studies, phosphomannan, but not mannan, was found to be an effective inhibitor of the C1q-independent bactericidal activity of newborn piglet serum against some rough strains of Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, the inhibitory activities of phosphomannan and mannan were very similar in the case of MBP-dependent bactericidal activity against rough strains of Escherichia coli K-12 and S-16. Based on these findings, we inferred that an MBP-like lectin with slightly or completely different carbohydrate binding specificity might exist in newborn piglet serum and be responsible for the C1q-independent bactericidal activity. Herein we report that a novel phosphomannan-binding lectin (PMBL) of 33 kDa under reducing conditions was isolated from both newborn and adult porcine serum and characterized. Porcine PMBL functionally activated the complement system via the lectin pathway triggered by binding with both phosphomannan (P-mannan) and mannan, which, unlike MBP, was effectively inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate- or galatose-containing oligosaccharides.

Minchinton R.M. Clin. Infec. Dis. 2003; 37: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recently, MBP was shown to exhibit novel cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cells in in vivo experiments, which we propose to term MBP-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MDCC) (14Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Ma Y. Uemura K. Oka S. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).The complement system, which consists of three activation pathways, is involved in both innate and acquired immunity (16Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar, 17Walport M.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 18Fujita T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The classical pathway is activated by antigen-antibody complexes and is a major effector of antibody-mediated immunity. The other two, the lectin and alternative, pathways function in innate immune defense. The lectin pathway involves carbohydrate recognition by MBP and the subsequent activation of associated unique enzymes, MBP-associated serine proteases (MASPs) (19Janeway Jr., C.A. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik M. Immunobiology, the Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th edition. Garland Publishing. New York, NY2001: 35-91Google Scholar, 20Schwaeble W. Dahl M.R. Thiel S. Stover C. Jensenius J.C. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The alternative pathway does not involve specific recognition molecules. Experiments have indicated that the lectin pathway is also amplified by the alternative pathway (21Suankratay C. Zhang X.H. Zhang Y. Lint T.F. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3006-3013PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both the classical and lectin pathways, supported by the alternative pathway, lead to the final, nonenzymatic assembly of the bactericidal membrane attack complex.MBP has been described in many species (22Holmskov U. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 547-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). MBP occurs in two distinct forms in rodents and other animals including the rhesus monkey, MBP-A and MBP-C, which differ in their carbohydrate binding specificity (23Hansen S. Holmskov U. Immmunobiology. 1998; 199: 165-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, only one form has been found in the chicken, rabbit, and man, due to conversion of a gene into a pseudogene between monkeys and apes (22Holmskov U. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 547-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar).Xenotransplantation of porcine tissues has been proposed to be a means of alleviating the shortage of organs and tissues needed for the treatment of human organ failure and cellular diseases (24Sachs D.H. Sykes M. Robson S.C. Cooper D.K. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 129-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), yet little is known about porcine MBP. It is a well known fact that newborn piglet serum is extremely deficient in all classes of immunoglobulins, and the level of complement in newborn piglet serum is very low, usually ranging from 2 to 5 CH50 in the case of the classical complement pathway. We previously reported that the C1q-independent bactericidal activity of newborn piglet serum was completely inhibited by P-mannan, but not by mannan (25Dlabac V. Kawasaki N. Immunobiology. 1994; 190: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and MBP was shown to exhibit complement-dependent bactericidal activity, inhibiting with both P-mannan and mannan, against rough strains of E. coli K-12 and S-16 (5Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, we inferred that there are some MBP-like lectins with slightly or completely different carbohydrate binding specificities in newborn piglet serum, which are responsible for the antibody-independent bactericidal activity. As an extension of these studies, here we report that a novel P-mannan-binding lectin (PMBL) of 33 kDa under reducing conditions was isolated from newborn piglet serum, by P-mannan-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, and characterized. Meanwhile, we purified 33- and 31-kDa lectins, which were isolated and separated on a P-mannan-Sepharose 4B affinity column followed by a Hitrap Q anion exchange column, from adult porcine serum. Western blot analysis demonstrated the cross-reactivity of anti-rabbit MBP antibodies with the two porcine serum lectins. In addition, the porcine PMBL of 33 kDa functionally activated the complement system in a dose-dependent manner via the lectin pathway triggered by binding with both P-mannan and mannan, which, unlike MBP, was effectively inhibited by both Man-6-P- and Gal-containing oligosaccharides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsNewborn and adult porcine sera were supplied by Japan SLC, Inc.

Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1983; 94: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Separation of Lectins from Adult Porcine Serum by Hitrap Q Anion Exchange ChromatographyThe adult porcine serum lectin eluate from the P-mannan-Sepharose 4B column was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 6.7), and then the dialysate was applied to a Hitrap Q column, which had been equilibrated with the same buffer.

Calibration was carried out with a standard calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences).SDS-PAGE and Western Blot AnalysesThe purified newborn and adult porcine serum lectins were resolved on a 5-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel (ATTO) under reducing conditions, respectively, and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). The purified adult porcine serum lectins were also determined by Western blot analysis. The samples were separated on a 5-20% Tris-HCl gradient gel under reducing conditions, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane.

Amplification was carried out with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and characterized by DNA sequencing with a DNA sequencer (Model 373A, Perking Elmer, Corp., Applied Biosystem, Division, CA). The central portion containing E2D-33 originating primers was amplified by RT-PCR using a sense primer (5′-GGGCGAGATGGACGCAAAGG) and an antisense primer (5′-CTCTTCCAGTTGCTGTAGGT).

The plates were washed three times with PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20, followed by once wash with TBS buffer also containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Porcine PMBL, porcine l-MBP or rabbit MBP 200 ng was added to each well in TBS-T buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of monosaccharide, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 2 h. The plates were then washed three times with TBS-T buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, and then primary guinea pig anti-rabbit MBP polyclonal antibodies were added, followed by secondary anti-guinea pig HRP-conjugated IgG. The plates were then washed three times, 50 μl of o-phenylendiamine was added to each well, and then the plates were read at 490 nm with an ARVO SXc 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Wallac Oy, Finland). All ELISA experiments were performed in triplicate.Solid Phase Binding Assay Based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)The affinity between porcine PMBL or rabbit MBP and P-mannan or mannan was measured using a BIAcore X instrument (BIACORE). Biotin-labeled P-mannan and mannan were covalently immobilized on the sensor chips, SA and CM5, by the Biotin-Streptavidin and amine-coupling methods, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C and at the flow rate of 20 μl/min for both the association and dissociation phases in the HBS-P buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.0) supplied by the manufacturer. The interaction was monitored as the change in the SPR response. Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data using BIA evaluation 3.0 software.Complement C4 Cleavage AssayA complement C4 cleavage assay was performed as described previously (26Gadjeva M. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Curr. Prot. Immunol. 2003; 13: 6, 1-8Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells were coated overnight at room temperature with 1 mg of P-mannan or mannan in 100 μl of coating buffer. Residual protein binding sites were blocked with 0.1% (w/v) human serum albumin in TBS for 1 h. After washing with TBS plus 0.005% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2 (TBS/Tw/Ca2+), each well was filled with a MBP dilution, 0-1000 ng, or various saccharides for inhibition assaying in 100 μl of MBP binding buffer at room temperature for 1.5 h. After washing thoroughly, wells then received MASPs from diluted MBP-deficient human serum, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, 100 μl of 2 mg/ml human C4 diluted in C4 dilution buffer was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After washing with TBS/Tw/Ca2+, incubation with biotinylated anti-human C4 monoclonal antibodies in TBS/Tw/Ca2+ was performed at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed with TBS/Tw/Ca2+, and then deposited C4b was detected by adding HRP-AvidinD in TBS/Tw/Ca2+ at room temperature for 1 h. HRP activity was determined by adding 100 ml of Sure Blue TMB to each well, and then the plate was read at 450 nm. The optical density induced by porcine PMBL was determined in triplicate and compared with human and rabbit MBPs assigned arbitrary activity values. All experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated a minimum of three times.Statistical AnalysisThe results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of data obtained from three experiments performed in triplicate. The statistical significance was determined by the Student's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSIsolation and Cloning of PMBL from Newborn Porcine Serum—As an extension of our previous studies, a novel PMBL was isolated from newborn piglet serum using a P-mannan-Sepharose 4B affinity column in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 for binding and 50 mm mannose for elution. The purified lectin was subjected to 5-20% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB. As shown in Fig. 1A, the novel lectin migrated as a single major band corresponding to 33 kDa under reducing conditions, indicating the high purity of the lectin. Guinea pig anti-rabbit MBP polyclonal antibodies recognized the lectin on Western blot analysis (data not shown). The cross-reactivity of the anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies suggested the presence of similar epitopes in newborn piglet PMBL and rabbit MBP.Thus, to clone the PMBL cDNA, the amino acid sequence of the lectin was partially determined with a protein sequencer using lysylendopeptidase-digested peptides obtained from the purified lectin. The amino acid sequences of the three major peptides are shown in Fig. 1B. Peptides E2-N+18, E2D-29, and E2D-33 were found to be homologous to the N-terminal, middle and latter parts of mammalian MBPs, respectively. These peptide sequences were used to design degenerated oligonucleotide primers for PCR. First, fragments of about 450 bp and 150 bp were amplified with an E2N+18 s2 primer and an E2D-33 a1 primer, and an E2D-33 s2 primer and an E2D-29 a2 primer, respectively. The PCR with an E2N+18 s1 primer and an E2D-29 a1 primer, followed by the nesting PCR with an E2N+18 s2 primer and an E2D-29 a2 primer, did not amplify any specific fragments. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the pCRII vector and then sequenced. Next, based on the determined sequences, completely matched oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to amplify the middle part of the cDNA, which overlapped with these two fragments, and to determine the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the cDNA by means of the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE strategies. The fragments obtained on RT-PCR of the middle portion, and 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were subcloned into the pCRII vector and then sequenced. The whole cDNA of the lectin was covered by joining these three fragments.However, the 5′- and 3′-ends remained completely unclear. To confirm the predicted exons, and to determine the 5′- and 3′-exons of porcine PMBL mRNA, 5′- and 3′-RACE experiments were performed using porcine liver RNA as a template, followed by sequencing.The merged sequence of the cDNA fragment and deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 2A. The 1010-bp cDNA contains a 747-bp open reading frame, and 175-bp 5′- and 88 bp 3′-untranslated regions. The three lysylendopeptidase-digested peptides identified on mass spectrometry can be seen in the open reading frame of the deduced amino acid sequence, though it did not entirely coincide with the digested peptide sequences.FIGURE 2Nucleotide and translated amino sequence for PMBL and hydropathy and comparison analyses.

It has 19 Gly-X-Y repeats and a Gly-X-Gly interruption at the eighth repeat, which are found in other mammalian MBPs (27Lu J. Thiel S. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Reid K.M.B. J.
