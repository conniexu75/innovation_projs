https://openalex.org/W2094700723,"A population of individuals potentially at risk for psychiatric disorders was identified by screening 375 college student volunteers for low platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity levels. The lower and upper 10 per cent in MAO activity were interviewed and family history data were obtained. Low-MAO probands reported more frequent psychiatric or psychological counseling and problems with the law. Families of low MAO probands had an eightfold increase in the incidence of suicide or suicide attempts over those of high-MAO probands. This suggests that reduced MAO levels, reported previously in patients with affective disorders and chronic schizophrenia, may predict a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder."

The degree of intactness was estimated from the tyrosine content, which is present only in the nonhelical ends, and by mobility of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide of the alpha1 chain on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. The amount of covalently cross-linked polymeric material present was estimated by molecular sieve chromatography of denatured samples. Rapid purification in the cold was sufficient to prevent or greatly reduce proteolytic alteration. Fractionation by salt precipitation at acid pH was effective in reducing the content of polymeric material. Rat tail tendon yielded completely intact native collagen, but some high molecular weight aggregates remained. Collagen from the skin of lathyritic rats was easier to obtain free of aggregates, but contained about 1 less tyrosine residue per alpha1 chain even when isolated in the presence of enzyme inhibitors. Proton NMR spectra of denatured acidic solutions of these preparations showed that 4 to 5 tyrosine residues per alpha chain were present, confirming the chemical analysis. Spectra of the native molecule showed that about the same number of tyrosine residues per chain are in rapid motion, unlike residues in the helical portion of the molecule, a result which shows that the nonhelical ends of the native molecule are unstructured in acidic solution."

https://openalex.org/W1511913702,"The human En(a-) blood group is a rare recessive trait. These erythrocytes lack the major membrane sialoglycoprotein (PAS1, MN protein, or glycophorin) and contain a decreased amount of PAS2 as demonstrated by radiolabeling of surface porteins and chemical techniques. A third glycoprotein, Band 3, contains two labeled oligosaccharide chains; the more complex oligosaccharide has a higher molecular weight in En(1-) cells than in normal cells. A fourth glycoprotein, PAS3, is present in usual amounts in En(a-) cells. Cells heterozygous for En(a) are intermediate in these respects. The sialic acid is decreased in En(a-) cells, but the total carbohydrate is similar in the different membranes. The glycolipids are present in normal amounts but are much more exposed to galactose oxidase in En(a-) cells than in normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015106503,"The effectiveness of purines and purine analogues as inducers of erythroid differentiation in cultured murine erythroleukemia cells has been investigated. These cell lines have previously been shown to differentiate in vitro in response to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a number of other polar solvents. Two purine analogues, 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine, as well as the naturally occurring purine, hypoxanthine, are shown to be extremely potent inducers. 6-Thioguanine is effective at a concentration of 0.06 mM, 750 fold lower than the DMSO concentration required for equivalent induction. 6-Mercaptopurine and hypoxanthine are effective inducers at a concentration of approximately 2 mM. Accumulation of globin mRNA was monitored during induction with purine inducers and shown to be similar in amount to globin mRNA levels reached in DMSO-induced cultures. Induction of differentiation by all three compounds follows a similar time course to induction with DMSO. All three compounds are potent inducers of HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase)-negative cell lines; hence incorporation of purines into DNA is not required for induction of differentiation. Comparison of these compounds with other purines and purine analogues suggests a high degree of specificity in their interaction with a cellular target."

https://openalex.org/W2099632503,"The circulating half-lives of the four isozymes of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNases A, B, C, and D) have been determined in normal and in nephrectomized rats. The isozymes differ only in their glycosyl content. While A contains no sugars, B has a simple oligosaccharide (GlcNAc2 Man4-5),and C and D each have a complex oligosaccharide (GlcNAc4 Man 2-3 Gal2 Fuc NeuAc2, and GlcNAc4 Man3 Gal2 Fuc NeuAc4, respectively) attached to Asn-34 of the polypeptide chain. All four isozymes were cleared rapidly in normal rats (t 1/2 = 2 to 3 min), as expected on the basis of the established role of the kidneys in removing low molecular weight proteins from circulation. In nephrectomized rats, however, a much slower clearance was observed, thus permitting the evaluation of the role of the carbohydrate chains in the catabolism of the isozymes. The clearance curves can be analyzed in terms of two processes, a rapid initial one, shown to represent the equilibration of the injected enzyme into extravascular space, and a second one which is interpreted as the catabolic clearance of the enzyme. The haf-life of the RNase isozymes was calculated from this second process and found to be in the range 528 to 577 min for RNase A, 15 min for RNase B, 681 to 862 min for RNase C, and 839 to 941 min for RNase D. The rapidly cleared RNase B was treated with alpha-mannosidase to remove 3 of the 4 mannosyl residues, leaving only a trisaccharide (GlcNAc2-betaMan) attached to the protein. The half-life of this RNase B derivatives was found to be in the range 616 to 733 min. From these results it is concluded (a) that the addition of complex oligosaccharides to a protein does not have any significant direct effect on its circulating half-life (RNases C and D compared to RNase A), and (b) that in the rat there exists a mechanism for clearing glycoproteins based on specific recognition of exposed alpha-mannosyl residues (RNase B compared to the other isozymes and to alpha-mannosidase-treated RNase B)."
https://openalex.org/W1955391598,"The concentration of ketone bodies in plasma and of carnitine in various maternal, fetal, and neonatal tissues was examined during the developmental period in rats. Plasma ketone levels were low in the fetus, increased 10-fold during the first 24 h postpartom, and thereafter gradually declined such that normal values were found at the end of the suckling period. An almost identical profile was observed for liver carnitine concentrations in the baby rats. The converse was true for heart tissue, the carnitine content of which was low at birth and steadily increased to adult levels with the time of suckling. The primary source of carnitine in neonatal tissues, at least during the first 2 to 3 days postpartum, was shown to be the mother rat whose liver and milk carnitine content was very high at this time and fell as nursing continued. Experiments in which the fate of [14C]butyrobetaine, the immediate precursor of carnitine, was followed after injection into nursing mother rats indicated movement of carnitine from maternal liver leads to maternal plasma leads to milk leads to neonatal tissues. The above findings support the view expressed earlier that one prerequisite for the development of a high ketogenic profile in liver may be an elevation in the tissue carnitine concentration. Additional factors, however, are clearly involved as evidenced by the observation that in the fed state perfused livers from nursing mother rats synthesized ketone bodies from oleic acid at low rates compared with those seen after a 24 h fast, despite the fact that tissue carnitine levels were equally elevated in both groups. This paradox is likely related to the fact that in the fed state such livers also contained large quantities of glycogen, depletion of which through fasting was accompanied by marked acceleration of ketogenesis from oleate. The data indicate, therefore, that maximal ketogenic capacity of the liver requires for its induction an increase in carnitine coupled with a decrease in glycogen content of the tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1576188583,"The NH2- and COOH-terminal sequence of nuclear portein A24 has been determined by automatic Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase A and B digestion. Protein A24 is of interest because it is composed in part of histone 2A (Goldknofp, I.L., and Busch, H., (1975) Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 65, 951-960). The sequence of the first 37 NH2-terminal residues is: Met-Gln-Ile-Phe-Val-Lys-Thr-Leu-Thr-Gly-Lys-Thr-Ile-Thr-Leu-Glu-Val-Glu-Pro-Ser-Asp-Thr-Ile-Glu-Asn-Val-Lys-Ala-Lys-Ile-Gln-Asp-Lys-Glu-Gly-Ile-Pro- This sequence is not homologous to any known histone sequence. It contains regions of internal homology (italics). The COOH-terminal amino acid sequence is the same as that of histone 2A, naely: -His-His-Lys-Ala-Lys-Gly-Lys-COOH."
https://openalex.org/W1513805875,"Two water-soluble complex carbohydrate storage products were isolated from tissues and urine of patients with an inherited deficiency of lysosomal alpha-L-fucosidase (fucosidosis). The major component was an oligosaccharide of approximate molecular weight 1700, indicating that it was a dekasaccharide. From a combination of sequential digestion with purified exo-glycosidases, periodate oxidation and permethylation in conjunction with gas-liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis, the structure was found to be: Fuc(alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal-(beta 1 leads to 4) GlcNAc (beta1 leads to 2)Man [Fuc(alpha1 leads to 2) Gal (beta1 leads to 4) GlcNAc(beta1 leads to 2) Man] (alpha 1 leads to 3/6) Man (beta1 leads to 4) GlcNAc, although there was some evidence for heterogeneity at the mannose branchpoint. This material is structurally related to the stored oligosaccharides in patients with inherited deficiencies of beta-galactosidase (G M1-gangliosidosis) and N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase (G M2-gangliosidosis). A dissaccharide with the probable structure Fuc(alpha1 leads to 6)GlcNAc was found in lesser amounts in tissues; both are believed to be derived from the impaired catabolism of large numbers of different glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W107815673,"Polyribosomal messenger RNA from HeLa cells contain 3'-OH-terminal polyadenylate sequences approximately 133 nucleotides in length (weight average). When analyzed at the ribonucleoprotein level of organization these poly(A)-rich sequences are found to contain tightly bound proteins. These proteins remain associated with the poly(A)-rich RNA during affinity chromatography of RNase A and T1-digested polyribosomes on poly(U)-Sepharose in 0.5 M NaCl, and co-elute from the column with the RNA at 50% formamide. Controls establish that the co-purification of the proteins with poly(A) on poly(U)-Sepharose requires the molecular integrity of the poly(A). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolves the poly(A)-specific proteins into two components of 74,000 and 62,000 molecular weight. The larger protein is the same size as that previously reported to be associated with poly(A)-rich sequences in HeLa heterogeneous nuclear RNA (Kish, V.M., and Pederson, T. (1975), J. Mol. Biol. 95, 227-238). It is concluded that both HeLa nuclear and polyribosomal poly(A) sequences have a protein (62,000 molecular weight) associated with poly(A) appears to be confined only to messenger RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2083286064,"Nuclear viral RNAs synthesized early in productive infection with adenovirus 2 were analyzed by hybridization to specific viral DNA fragments. Radioactive RNAs were subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 98% formamide, and the fractionated RNA was hybridized to specific DNA fragments generated by cleavage with endo R-Eco Ri or endo R-Sma l. The viral genes expressed early in infection are located in four different segments of the genome. When nuclear RNA was hybridized to DNA fragments representing each of these segments, discrete RNA size classes were detected. For each of these four regions of the genome, some of the discrete nuclear RNAs were larger than the cytoplasmic mRNAs. As calculated from electrophoretic mobility, the molecular weight of these nuclear RNA size classes ranged from 15% to several fold greater than that of the corresponding cytoplasmic mRNAs. Hybridization-inhibition experiments were performed to analyze the sequences present in one of these larger nuclear transcripts, a 22S RNA transcribed from the left-hand end of the genome. This 22S nuclear RNA was transcribed from the same strand as the viral mRNA, for it contained cytoplasmic sequences; it also contained sequences restricted to the nucleus. The larger nuclear RNAs may serve as precursors to the cytoplasmic viral mRNAs synthesized early in infection."

https://openalex.org/W1499069692,"The effects of purine nucleosides on 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) synthesis were investigated in human erythrocytes in vitro. Previous observations have shown an increase of PP-ribose-P formation with nucleoside when inorganic phosphate (Pi) exceeded 20 mM. In contrast, when external Pi varied from 0 to 25 mM adenosine, inosine, guanosine, or 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside 1.25 mM decreased intracellular PP-ribose-P. The mechanism of this nucleoside effect on P-ribose-P concentration was investigated. Decreased synthesis rather than increased utilization accounted for the nucleoside effect. A decrease of erythrocyte Pi from the control values of 0.5 to 2.4 mM accompanied the nucleoside-related diminution of PP-ribose-P synthesis. This reduction of Pi was capable of decreasing the activity of PP-ribose-P synthetase which is known to be sensitive to small changes of Pi. The decrease of erythrocyte Pi levels was caused both by those nucleosides which were eventually degraded via purine nucleoside phosphorylase (adenosine, inosine, and guanosine) and by those nucleosides which were substantially phosphorylated initially by adenosine kinase (methylmercaptopurine riboside and adenosine with erythro-9(2-hydroxyl-3-nonyl)-adenine). Twenty-five per cent of methylmercaptopurine riboside was converted to the monophosphate derivative during the incubation. The presence of this compound, capable of inhibiting PP-ribose-P synthetase, provided evidence for a second mechanism of inhibition of PP-ribose-P synthesis by methylmercaptopurine riboside. No substantial increase of AMP, ADP, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, or cyclic AMP nor a decrease of ribose 5-phosphate was found. These observations suggest that under physiological Pi concentrations nucleosides diminish PP-ribose-P synthesis mainly by decreasing intracellular Pi. Regulation of PP-ribose-P formation by alterations of intracellular Pi levels may be an important control mechanism and may account for a number of biological effects of nucleosides."

https://openalex.org/W1516255760,"125I-Concanavalin A was found to bind to purified Golgi membranes in a manner which was time-dependent, proportional to the amount of Golgi protein, saturable, and inhibited by alpha-methyl-D-glucoside and unlabeled concanavalin A. Approximately 2 nmol of 125I-concanavalin A were bound per mg of membrane protein with a mean Ka of 0.2 x 10(7) M-1. After binding of concanavalin A to the membranes, all unbound lectin was removed by repeated washing prior to assay of galactosyltransferase activity to assure that bulk concanavalin A would not bind to the sugar acceptor during the enzyme assay. Therefore, the effects of the lectin were not due to altered acceptor concentrations in the assay. As a result of concanavalin A binding the activity of the galactosyltransferase of these membranes was enhanced by 70 to 100%. The enhancement was abolished by treatment of the concanavalin A-bound Golgi with alpha-methylglucoside. Kinetically this stimulation was reflected as an altered Km for N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-galactose. The data are suggestive that the stimulation of the enzyme results indirectly from perturbation of the membranes on binding of the lectin."

https://openalex.org/W2493430274,"The amino acid sequence of Cerebratulus toxin B-IV, a crustacean-selective axonal toxin occurring in the marine worm C. lacteus, was determined by Edman degradation of the tryptic and staphylococcal protease peptides obtained from the reduced, carboxymethylated toxin. All four of the anticipated maleylated tryptic peptides, ranging in size from 8 to 23 residues, and three staphylococcal protease peptides, ranging from 9 to 35 residues, were isolated in pure form by gel filtration followed by either ion exchange chromatography or preparative paper electrophoresis. The order of the maleylated tryptic peptides was based upon the sequences of the staphylococcal protease peptides. As might be expected, toxin B-IV displays no homology with the elapid nicotinic receptor toxins. In addition, toxin B-IV is structurally unrelated to a group of scorpion neurotoxins which, like B-IV, affect action potential generating mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1544874960,"Choline completely deuterated in the methyl groups has been incorporated into two mammalian cell systems. The first was the chemically transformed mouse fibroblast LM cell line, grown in suspension culture. The second system consisted of mitochondria from Sprague-Dawley rats which were fed upon a choline-deficient diet enriched with deuterated choline chloride. Two classes of deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal were obtained from each system. The first class of signal exhibited no residual quadrupole coupling constant and was assigned to the natural abundance of 2H in water, together with free labeled choline. The second class of signal had a residual quadrupole coupling of about 1 HKz and was assigned to 2H-labeled choline headgroups of phospholipids. These results are in conflict with a previous study of deuterated rat liver mitochondrial membranes. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectra can be obtained on mammalian membranes that have incorporated specific deuterium-labeled compounds and, therefore, provides a very powerful method for studying the dynamic structure of membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1544290213,"A glycoprotein fraction with hemagglutinating activity was purified by affinity chromatography from seeds of the pea tree, Caragana arborescens. Subsequent fractionation resolved two components, which could be separated on a preparative scale using different affinity matrices. The major component binds to N-acetylgalactosamine coupled to Sepharose 4B. It is a glycoprotein with high hemagglutinating activity. It is composed of two types of polypeptides, present in nonstoichiometric amounts, with apparent molecular weights near 30,000. In the native molecule, the subunits are cross-linked by disulfide bonds to form dimers, which in turn appear to be in rapid equilibrium with tetramers. The minor component binds to underivatized Sepharose 4B. It too, is a glycoprotein but has low hemagglutinating activity. It is composed of three types of polypeptides which, although they have apparent molecular weights near 30,000 are distinguished from the subunits of the major hemagglutinin by a number of physical and chemical properties. The native molecule is dimeric, with a mass of 60,000 daltons. The major component has high affinity (K = 0.1 mM) for the haptenic sugar, N-acetylgalactosamine, but will also bind D-galactose. Neither lectin has ABO blood group specificity, nor are they transformed mouse fibroblasts to the same extent."
https://openalex.org/W2071923914,"Puffs induced by treatment with vitamin B6 at locus 2-48BC in salivary gland cells of Drosophila hydei were isolated by micromanipulation, and the puff RNA was analyzed electrophoretically. The main RNA species migrated with a mobility of 40S. A similar RNA species was found in this puff after its induction by temperature treatment, except that in this case material with a higher mobility was also found, presumably due to the presence of growing chains. No evidence was found for polyadenylation of the RNA contained within the puff. The RNA profile of nucleoplasm of cells from glands either treated with vitamin B6 or subjected to a temperature shock also displayed a prominent peak with a mobility of 40S which was absent in extracts of nucleoplasm from control glands."

Hp 2-2 and Hp 2-1 form a series of alpha-disulfide-linked polymers. The subunit composition of the Hp 2-1 series was studied by isolation of single Hp 2-1 polymers by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After reductive disulfide cleavage and alkylation the relative content of alpha2 and alpha1 polypeptide chains was determined by quantitative densitometry of acid/urea polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250. The molar ratios alpha2/alpha1 for the Hp 2-1 polymers. P1 through P5 (in order of decreasing electrophoretic mobility), were found to be: P1, 0.0 (alpha1 only); P2, 0.48; P3, 0.97; P4, 1.6; P5, 2.0. Since one alphabeta-Hb half-molecule is known to bind to each Hp beta chain, the beta polypeptide chain content of each of the Hp 2-1 polymers could be estimated by by counting the number of Coomassie blue bands formed after electrophoresis of isolated Hp 2-1 polymers fractionally saturated with cyanmethemoglobin (Hb). The number of beta chains present in Hp 2-1 polymers P1 through P4 was determined to be: P1, 2; P2, 3; P3, 4 and P4, 5. Molecular weights of the Hp 2-1 polymers were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresus using as standards the almost homologous Hp 2-2 polymer series whose molecular weights are known from ultracentrifugation studies. Molecular weights for the first five Hp 2-1 polymers were estimated to be 107,000; 162,000; 217,000, 274,000; and 331,000, respectively. These data are consistent with the previously proposed model for the subunit composition of the Hp 2-1 polymer series when P1 = (alpha1 beta)2 and the subsequent polymers in order are represented as (alpha1 beta)2(alpha2 beta)n where n = 1,2,3,4..."
https://openalex.org/W1554765844,"The electronic structures of the amino acids containing first row atoms have been determined for the zwitterionic form using an approximate self-consistent field method, partial retention of diatomic differential overlap. Various energetic quantities including certain proton affinities are present as are eigenvalues for the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. It is found that our method, in common with all methods employing minimum basis sets, yields eigenvalues for the highest occupied molecular orbital that are too high. The method does predict the location of this orbital correctly when compared to calculations employing larger basis sets. It is predicted that electron loss due to ionizing radiation should occur from the carboxylate group for the nonaromatic amino acids, while for tyrosine and tryptophan, electron loss should occur from the ring system. No choice between these two sites can be made for phenylalanine. Charge distributions have been obtained which show that only partial zwitterionic character is found in the backbone and that little delocalization of charge from the backbone to the side chain occurs. Localized molecular orbitals have been obtained using the Boys criteria and the bonding in the amino acids is disscussed in terms of these orbitals. Hybridization of various bonds and bond polarities are discussed as is the phenomenon of fractional bonding to carbon."

https://openalex.org/W2006575762,"RAPESEED oil is a stable, viscous oil utilised extensively by the baking industry in several countries as a lubricant to prevent the dough piece sticking to the container during baking. The oil is applied either to the container or directly on to the dough surface and allows the easy removal of the bread after baking. There are, however, few data available to indicate the extent to which any rapeseed oil is absorbed into the bread during processing. The question has assumed considerable importance since Roine1 and many subsequent workers2–4 showed that a range of laboratory animals developed heart lesions and other biochemical abnormalities when fed diets with a substantial content of rapeseed oil. These effects have generally been attributed to erucic acid5 (13-docosenoic acid) which is the major fatty acid constituent in normal rapeseed oils (30–50% of total fatty acids)6. Consequently, various countries have legislated to restrict the amount of erucic acid permitted in certain foods, although no tolerances have been set specifically for baked products. This is mainly due to the assumption that erucic acid is not a natural component of the ingredients used in bread."

The requisite scientific skills that can contribute to greater world agricultural production exist in a uniquely concentrated form in the U.S. universities. Incentives for increased university involvement in technical assistance created by the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975 will not become effective until a mechanism which guarantees adequate and long-term funding is established. A continuing dialogue to define the nature and scope of needed reforms is necessary if maximum involvement of U.S. scientists in agricultural technical assistance is to be realized. Such involvement is vital in meeting the food needs of the developing world."
