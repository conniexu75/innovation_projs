https://openalex.org/W2093374391,"Recent evidence indicates that the nucleus basalis of Meynert, a distinct population of basal forebrain neurons, is a major source of cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex. Postmortem studies have previously demonstrated profound reduction in the presynaptic markers for cholinergic neurons in the cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The results of this study show that neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert undergo a profound (greater than 75 percent) and selective degeneration in these patients and provide a pathological substrate of the cholinergic deficiency in their brains. Demonstration of selective degeneration of such neurons represents the first documentation of a loss of a transmitter-specific neuronal population in a major disorder of higher cortical function and, as such, points to a critical subcortical lesion in Alzheimer's patients."

Anatomical location, fine structural features, and kinetic properties suggest that nonserrated cells represent a stem cell population and that serrated cells help anchor the epidermis to the dermis."
https://openalex.org/W2109448523,"Cloned 5S RNA genes added to a Xenopus oocyte nuclear extract assemble into stable active transcription complexes that persist for many rounds of 5S RNA synthesis. This stability of the complex has been demonstrated by its resistance to dilution and to competitor DNA. A stable complex is formed within minutes and lasts for at least 40 rounds of transcription per template over several hours. Stable, transcriptionally inactive complexes can be formed by incubation of cloned 5S RNA genes in an oocyte nuclear extract depleted of a 5S-specific transcription factor and supplemented with histones. The stable, transcriptionally active and inactive states of 5S RNA gene complexes that can be formed in vitro are analogous to the states of the somatic and oocyte 5S RNA genes as they exist in somatic cell chromatin. Oocyte 5S RNA genes remain repressed in chromatin isolated from somatic cells, but can be activated by washing chromatin with high salt. Maintenance of the differentiated state of a cell requires that selected genes remain stably active while others are stably repressed for long periods of time. We proposed that stable transcription complexes may play an important role in the maintenance of the differentiated state in eucaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062074930,"The nature of the ends of the vaccinia virus genome was determined by nucleotide sequencing. Our finding of terminal hairpins indicated that the linear double-stranded DNA molecule consists of a single continuous polynucleotide chain. The 104 nucleotide apex of the hairpin contains predominantly A and T residues and is incompletely based-paired. These loops exist in two forms, which when inverted with respect to each other are complementary in sequence. Both forms of the 104 nucleotide loop are present in nearly equimolar amounts of each end of the genome. A set of 13 tandem 70 bp repeats begins 87 bp from the proximal segment of the terminal loop, followed by a unique sequence of 325 bp, and then by a second set of 18 tandem 70 bp repeats. The sequence of the 70 bp repeats reveals a 13 bp internal redundancy. Self-priming and de novo start replication models, which involve a site-specific nick in one DNA strand proximal to the 104 nucleotide loop, account for the observed sequence inversions and incomplete base-pairing. Similar mechanisms may be involved in replication of the ends of the eucaryotic chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1562512611,"The effect of estradiol on prolactin gene transcription in pituitaries from ovariectomized, female rats has been investigated. Analysis of the multiple prolactin mRNA species present in pituitary cells demonstrated that estradiol increases the concentration of all the large, potential nuclear precursors of prolactin mRNA. To further examine possible estradiol effects on prolactin mRNA synthesis, nuclei were isolated from rat pituitaries and allowed to continue RNA synthesis in vitro in the presence of [alpha-32P]UTP. Newly synthesized prolactin mRNA sequences were quantitated by hybridization of [32P]RNA to immobilized plasmid DNA containing prolactin cDNA sequences. After 24 h of estradiol treatment, prolactin mRNA synthesis was increased 4-fold. Estradiol effects on prolactin gene transcription were detected as early as 20 min after injection of the steroid. These findings suggest that estradiol increases prolactin mRNA levels by increasing the transcription of the prolactin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2006624834,"Teratocarcinoma cells have a Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion site (t-CDS) that is unique in being inactivated with trypsin in the absence of CA2+ but not in the presence of Ca2+. Fab fragments of antibodies raised against teratocarcinoma F9 cells dissociated by treatment with trypsin and calcium (anti-TC-F9) inhibit the aggregation of teratocarcinoma cells mediated by t-CDS. This inhibitory effect of Fab is removed when anti-TC-F9 is absorbed with F9 cells treated with trypsin and calcium (TC-F9), but not when it is absorbed with F9 cells treated with trypsin and EGTA (TE-F9). Comparisons of cell-surface antigens reactive to anti-TC-F9 in TC-F9 cells with those in TE-F9 cells reveal that only one component, with an approximate molecular weight of 140,000 (p140), is detected specifically on the surface of TC-F9 cells. When TC-F9 cells are retrypsinized in the absence of CA2+, a substance with an approximate molecular weight of 34,000 (p34) is released that can neutralize the aggregation-inhibitory effect of the Fab. This p34 interferes with the immunoprecipitation of p140 with anti-TC-F9, suggesting that p34 is a tryptic fragment of p140. Anti-TC-F9 Fab causes the dissociation of the monolayers of teratocarcinoma cells. This effect is removed by absorption of the Fab with p34 as well as with TC-F9 cells, but not with TE-F9 cells. These results suggest that p140 is essential for the function of t-CDS, and that this is an actual cell-adhesion molecule active in the establishment of monolayers of teratocarcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024243865,"Satellite DNA (Bkm) from the W sex-determining chromosome of snakes, which is related to sequences on the mouse Y chromosome, has been used to analyze the DNA and chromosomes of sex-reversed (Sxr) XXSxr male mice. Such mice exhibit a male-specific Southern blot Bkm hybridization pattern, consistent with the presence of Y-chromosome DNA. In situ hybridization of Bkm to chromosomes of XXSxr mice shows an aberrant concentration of related sequences on the distal terminus of a large mouse chromosome. The XYSxr carrier male, however, shows a pair of small chromosomes, which are presumed to be aberrant Y derivatives. Meiosis in the XYSxr mouse involves transfer of chromatin rich in Bkm-related DNA from the Y-Y1 complex to the X distal terminus. We suggest that this event is responsible for the transmission of the Sxr trait."
https://openalex.org/W2073306638,"A single identified neuron was repeatedly isolated by axotomy from the central nervous system of the nudibranch mollusk Hermissenda crassicornis. An early voltage-dependent outward K+ current of this neuron was reduced and more rapidly inactivated for animals previously trained with paired but not randomized light and rotation. Since this current change can affect interneuron and motorneuron output via known synaptic pathways, it helps explain a long-lasting behavioral change that shows the defining features of vertebrate associative learning."

Gene transfer studies and comparison of the translated sequence with the partial amino acid sequence of the Ld transplantation antigen establish that gene 27.5 encodes an Ld polypeptide. A comparison of the gene 27.5 sequence with several complementary DNA sequences suggests that the BALB/c mouse may contain a number of closely related L-like genes. Gene 27.5 has eight exons that correlate with the structural domains of the transplantation antigen."

https://openalex.org/W2007578387,"Defective interfering RNAs of influenza virus are small segments derived from viral segments 1, 2 and 3. We present here the complete nucleotide sequences of segments 1 and 3 from the human influenza strain A/PR/8/34 and deduce that the sequence of a small RNA segment from A/NT/60/68, apparently a defective interfering RNA, is derived from five separate regions in segment 3 and from one region in segment 1. These regions, which are located near the termini of the two parental segments, are arranged in the small RNA segment in an alternating fashion: thus a region derived from near a 5′ terminus is adjacent to a region derived from near a 3′ terminus. We propose that the small segment is generated during positive strand synthesis as a result of the viral polymerase pausing at uridine-rich sequences in the template and reinitiating synthesis at another site."
https://openalex.org/W2087575891,"A noninvasive technique has been developed to measure and display local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) in vivo. In this procedure, nonradioactive xenon gas is inhaled and the temporal changes in radiographic enhancement produced by the inhalation are measured by sequential computerized tomography. The time-dependent xenon concentrations in various anatomical units in the brain are used to derive both the local partition coefficient and the LCBF. Functional mapping of blood flow with excellent anatomical specificity has been obtained in the baboon brain. The response of LCBF to stimuli such as changes in carbon dioxide concentrations as well as the variability in LCBF in normal and diseased tissue can be easily demonstrated. This method is applicable to the study of human physiology and pathologic blood flow alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2031286248,"We have examined cell-cell communication between epidermal cells of fifth-instar larvae of the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus and those of maggots of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala. Ionic coupling and the transfer of injected Lucifer Yellow (molecular weight 450) and lead-EDTA (molecular weight 374) were used to map the pattern of communication. All epidermal cells, regardless of their position with respect to the segmental border, were ionically coupled. In both species Lucifer Yellow was transferred freely between cells lying in the same segment—that is, in the same developmental compartment as defined by cell lineage. Dye injections close to the segmental border showed that Lucifer Yellow was not transferred between cells in adjacent segments—that is, across the compartmental border. In Calliphora failure of Lucifer Yellow transfer at the segmental border was always observed; in Oncopeltus Lucifer Yellow was not transferred in 90% of preparations examined. Injections of PbEDTA2− in Calliphora showed that this anion was transferred freely from cell to cell and did not respect the segmental boundary. Previous studies of the distribution of gap junctions at and away from the segmental border make it unlikely that the failure of Lucifer Yellow to cross from segment to segment is due to a reduced number of gap-junctional channels at the border. We conclude that gap junctions at the segmental borders may have different permeability properties from those between cells in the same segment."

https://openalex.org/W1979874824,"Gene transfer and immunoselection were used in the identification of a BALB/c genomic clone containing an H-2Ld gene (clone 27.5). Transformation of thymidine kinase-negative C3H mouse L cells with the cloned 27.5 DNA together with the herpes simplex virus tk gene produced transformants expressing Ld molecules detected by radioimmune assay with monoclonal hybridoma antibodies to Ld antigens. The foreign Ld gene products expressed by cloned mouse L cell transformants were shown to be virtually indistinguishable from BALB/c spleen Ld molecules by two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of H-2Ld immunoprecipitates. These results indicate that the genomic clone 27.5 contains a functional BALB/c H-2Ld gene and demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for identifying the gene products encoded by cloned genes which are members of a multigene family. Furthermore, the ability to place cell-surface recognition molecules on the surfaces of foreign cells provides a powerful opportunity for functional analyses of these molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2003863219,"Active nucleolar chromatin of Xenopus laevis oocytes was prepared for electron microscopy by a step gradient method, which separates the chromatin from proteins and other constituents that might nonspecifically bind at low ionic strength. Between putative RNA polymerases and within the nontranscribed spacer region, the chromatin appears as smooth, thin filaments. For the first time, it is shown here that these filaments are indistinguishable from pure DNA adsorbed to the same specimen, even when the ionic strength is raised up to 100 mM NaCl. Bulk rat liver chromatin, however, which was coprepared as a biochemically well-characterized standard with the active nucleolar chromatin, shows nucleosomes containing fibers, which condense into supranucleosomal structures with increasing ionic strength. Since the appearance and the behavior of active nucleolar chromatin at different ionic strengths and pHs resembles that of pure DNA, but not that of any known type of chromatin, it is suggested that, except for the transcription apparatus, very few macromolecular constituents are associated with ribosomal DNA during transcription. The observations described in this paper explain most of the published and partly conflicting results obtained by electron microscopy of nucleolar chromatin."

A column of this agarose-DFPase hydrolyzes the nerve gas 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (Soman). Although the more inhibitory of the four diastereoisomers of Soman are hydrolyzed least rapidly, a column of sufficient length will accomplish 95 percent hydrolysis whether measured by fluoride release or loss of cholinesterase-inhibiting power. The results suggest a means for detoxifying unwanted chemical warfare agents."

https://openalex.org/W1558454691,"The rate of splitting of energy-rich phosphate compounds and the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation in contracting mouse extensor digitorum longus (EDL, fast twitch) and soleus (slow twitch) muscles were studied at 20 degrees C. The rate of high energy phosphate-splitting during a maintained isometric tetanus was 1.44 +/- 0.21 mumol . g-1 . s-1 in soleus. In EDL, the splitting rate was higher, 3.71 +/- 0.62 mumol . g-1 . s-1, during the first several seconds and thereafter was reduced to a rate of 1.63 +/- 0.35 mumol . g-1 . s-1 between 12 and 15 s of stimulation. Light chains identified on 2-dimensional gel electrophoretograms from EDL corresponded to the light chain composition of fast twitch muscle (LC1f, LC2f, and LC3f). Soleus is composed of fast twitch and slow twitch fibers because 2 additional light chains were found: LC1s and LC2s. In unstimulated EDL and soleus muscles, 0.1 of the LC1f and LC2s were phosphorylated. Upon stimulation, only LC2f, and only in EDL, increased its extent of phosphorylation. The time course of increase in phosphorylation of LC2f and decrease in rate of high energy phosphate-splitting correspond so that the 2 processes may be mechanistically related. If so, it appears that myosin LC2f phosphorylation represents a thick filament regulatory system capable of downward modulation of actomyosin ATPase in vivo during a maintained contraction."

https://openalex.org/W2060580542,"Based on analysis by high pressure liquid chromatography, greater than 35% of the cytosine residues in chloroplast DNA of vegetative cells were found to be methylated constitutively in the nuclear gene mutation (me-1) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which has an otherwise wild-type phenotype. Digestion of chloroplast DNA from vegetative cells and gametes of this mutant with restriction endonucleases Hpa II and Msp I reveals that in the 5'CCGG3' sequence, CpG is methylated extensively, whereas CpC is only methylated occasionally. Hae III (5'GGCC3') digestion of the mutant chloroplast DNA also shows extensive methylation of the GpC sequence. In contrast to the results of Sager and colleagues, which show a correlation between methylation of chloroplast DNA and transmission of chloroplast genes in crosses, our results with crosses of the me-1 mutant suggest that extensive chloroplast DNa methylation may be insufficient to account for the pattern of inheritance of chloroplast genes in Chlamydomonas."
https://openalex.org/W2088007221,"of DNA replication can initiate DNA synthesis with primer-dependent DNA polymerase. A wealth of biochemical and genetic evidence supports a similar model for phage 429 DNA replication (Salas et al., op. cit.). In $29, however, the first nucleotide linked to the terminal protein (~3) is dAMP. A closer look at poliovirus and adenovirus suggests that these viruses have adopted a strikingly similar strategy for genome replication. Although poliovirus starts replication with single-stranded RNA, its replicative intermediate is now considered to have a double-stranded backbone, and strand displacement is thought to be the mechanism of daughter-strand release. Adenovirus, however, initiates on doublestranded DNA, but it can also initiate daughter-strand synthesis on linear single strands, at least in vitro. Both viruses appear to utilize a protein-linked pyrimidine nucleotide as primer. It is difficult to imagine why poliovirus RNA polymerase is primer-dependent, when all other known template-dependent RNA polymerases of both eucaryotes and procaryotes can initiate RNA synthesis de novo. A hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that the poliovirus RNA polymerase was at one time a DNA polymerase that converted to RNA replication but failed to learn how to initiate polynucleotide synthesis. An analysis of the poliovirus RNA sequence favors the hypothesis that this RNA may have originated from vertebrate DNA. Thus poliovirus and adenovirus may. have taken their strategies of genome replication from a common ancestor. The formation of the covalent linkage between DNA and polypeptide is known to occur in many other systems not discussed here. In some cases the protein-DNA complexes may be transient, serving as intermediates in DNA metabolism. For example, topoisomerases, gyrase or the A gene product of phage 4x174 act under specific conditions as endonucleases, the nicking activity being accompanied by covalent linkage formation of the enzyme to the newly generated terminal phosphate. This process may allow either the DNA to undergo topological isomerization (Gellert, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 50, 879-910, 1981) or a newly generated 3’ hydroxyl group to serve as a primer for DNA polymerases (Kornberg, DNA Replication, W. H. Freeman, 1980). It remains to be seen whether the protein of hepatitis B virus DNA, or the polypeptide found linked to the replicative form of DNA of parvovirus H-l (Revie et al., PNAS 76, 55395543, 1979), belongs in this class of proteins."

Immunocytochemical staining of the cerebellar cortex showed that MIT-23 occurs in all the neuronal types but is absent from glial and other nonneuronal cells.

In contrast, cobalamin-replete cells contained only 5.3% 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, along with 30% each of the other three reduced folate compounds.
