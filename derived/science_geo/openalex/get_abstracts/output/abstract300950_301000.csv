https://openalex.org/W2018819513,Large shallow earthquakes can induce changes in the fluid pore pressure that are comparable to stress drops on faults. The subsequent redistribution of pore pressure as a result of fluid flow slowly decreases the strength of rock and may result in delayed fracture. The agreement between computed rates of decay and observed rates of aftershock activity suggests that this is an attractive mechanism for aftershockss.

https://openalex.org/W1995916567,"Lithium titanium sulfides, Li(x)Ti(1.1)S(2)(0.1 x </= 0.3), become superconducting over the temperature range from 10 degrees to 13 degrees K. They have the hexagonal Ti(3)S(4) structure and should not be considered intercalation compounds. This is the first class of noncubic compounds with high transition temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2064751301,"The composition of aboriginal land mammal faunas in Australia and New Guinea (prototherians and metatherians), South America (metatherians and eutherians) and Madagascar (eutherians only) is reconsidered in light of continental drift reconstructions of Mesozoic-Tertiary world paleogeography It is proposed that these three faunas represent successively detached samples of the evolving world mammal fauna as it existed when each of these land masses became faunally isolated from the rest of the world as a result of the progressive fragmentation of Pangaea. Isolation of aboriginal prototherians and metatherians in Australia and New Guinea may date from the Upper JurassicLower Cretaceous; isolation of aboriginal metatherians and eutherians in South America may date from the Middle Cretaceous-Upper Cretaceous; isolation of aboriginal eutherians in Madagascar may date from the Paleocene-Eocene."

Serpentinites are unknown in the Venezuelan Andes, and the raw material was obtained from natural sources located in northern South American or possibly the Antilles, or by trade."
